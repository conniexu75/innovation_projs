https://openalex.org/W2060076138,"TDP-43 is a highly conserved nuclear factor of yet unknown function that binds to ug-repeated sequences and is responsible for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator exon 9 splicing inhibition. We have analyzed TDP-43 interactions with other splicing factors and identified the critical regions for the protein/protein recognition events that determine this biological function. We show here that the C-terminal region of TDP-43 is capable of binding directly to several proteins of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family with well known splicing inhibitory activity, in particular, hnRNP A2/B1 and hnRNP A1. Mutational analysis showed that TDP-43 proteins lacking the C-terminal region could not inhibit splicing probably because they were unable to form the hnRNP-rich complex involved in splicing inhibition. Finally, through splicing complex analysis, we show that splicing inhibition mediated by TDP-43 occurs at the earliest stages of spliceosomal assembly.

In its most basic form, the splicing process has the task of removing from the primary RNA transcript all of those sequences (introns) that will not be present in the mature mRNA (1Krainer A.R.

Alternative splicing, i.e. the inclusion/exclusion of selected exonic sequences in particular tissues or developmental stages, has been heavily exploited by evolution to generate multiple mRNA transcripts from the same pre-mRNA sequence (4Modrek B. Lee C.J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 5Lareau L.F. Green R.E. Bhatnagar R.S. Brenner S.E. Curr. Opin. Struct.

However, all of this flexibility also means that the splicing process is prone to mistakes following even minor changes (7Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and alterations of splicing are being increasingly reported as the underlying cause of many genetic diseases (8Faustino N.A. Cooper T.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 419-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 9Caceres J.F. Kornblihtt A.R.

Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, the removal of introns and the joining of exons are catalyzed by the spliceosome, which contains several hundred different proteins in addition to the five spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (13Nilsen T.W. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 14Zhou Z. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 419: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). This complex arrangement of factors has two functions: first, to define the exact boundaries of an exon; and second, to catalyze the cut-and-paste generation of the mature mRNA. However, many external factors can also contribute to its workings, such as RNA secondary structure (15Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10505-10514Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), transcription rates (16Kornblihtt A.R. De La Mata M. Fededa J.P. Munoz M.J. Nogues G. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), the presence of splicing enhancer and silencer elements (17Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), and even external stimuli (19Stamm S. Hum. Mol.

It is the combinatorial effect of all of these factors that will decide when, where, and to what degree a specific sequence will be included or not in the mature mRNA (17Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Recently, the finding that at least 5% of all human alternative exons are derived from the highly repeated dimeric retrotransposons Alu elements has focused a lot of attention on the potential splicing modulatory ability of repeated nucleotide sequences (21Kreahling J. Graveley B.R. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In previous works, we have focused our attention on clarifying the pathological role played by (ug)m-repeated sequences near the 3′-splice site of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 3The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorhnRNPheterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPBSphosphate-buffered salineNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidTemedN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediaminewtwild-typePTBpolypyrimidine tract-binding proteinRRMRNA recognition motifsnRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoprotein 3The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorhnRNPheterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPBSphosphate-buffered salineNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidTemedN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediaminewtwild-typePTBpolypyrimidine tract-binding proteinRRMRNA recognition motifsnRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoprotein exon 9 (22Niksic M.

In particular, we have shown that (ug)m repeats promote skipping of this exon through their interaction with TDP-43, a protein that, although first described as a DNA-binding protein, has all of the characteristics of a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) (23Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 26Buratti E. Baralle F.E. J. Biol.

Virol. 1995; 69: 3584-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, depletion of this protein in transient transfections using antisense oligonucleotides (23Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) or in in vitro assays (24Buratti E. Brindisi A. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 1322-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) results in increasing CFTR exon 9 inclusion, whereas add-back experiments in a depleted nuclear extract restore exon inhibition (24Buratti E. Brindisi A. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 1322-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 28Ayala Y.M. Pantano S. D'Ambrogio A. Buratti E. Brindisi A. Marchetti C. Romano M. Baralle F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, it has been recently shown through minigene analysis that CFTR exon 9 inclusion in a wide panel of different cell lines correlates well with the endogenous levels of TDP-43 in each respective cell line (29Disset A. Michot C. Harris A. Buratti E. Claustres M. Tuffery-Giraud S. Hum. Mutat. 2005; 25: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that an alternative explanation based on RNA secondary structure has been offered by Hefferon et al. (30Hefferon T.W. Groman J.D. Yurk C.E. Cutting G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3504-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) in which the role of TDP-43 binding to the ug repeats has been questioned. cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein glutathione S-transferase high pressure liquid chromatography phosphate-buffered saline nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine wild-type polypyrimidine tract-binding protein RNA recognition motif small nuclear ribonucleoprotein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein glutathione S-transferase high pressure liquid chromatography phosphate-buffered saline nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine wild-type polypyrimidine tract-binding protein RNA recognition motif small nuclear ribonucleoprotein In addition to CFTR exon 9 splicing, the isolation of TDP-43 as a highly specific (ug)m-binding protein is relevant to other genes in which (ug)m-repeated sequences have been described at the 3′-splice site, such as in the case of apolipoprotein AII exon 3 (31Arrisi-Mercado P. Romano M. Muro A.F. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39331-39339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and intron 2 of the human cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (32Gabellini N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, ug-repeated sequences have been predicted to function as intronic splicing enhancer elements in the fish Fugu rubripes (33Yeo G. Hoon S. Venkatesh B. Burge C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15700-15705Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). All of these examples indicate that this kind of dinucleotide repeat may well play an important biological role in other systems besides the CFTR gene, something that may well be reflected also in the observation that (ug)m-binding proteins have been found in many different organisms. In fact, (ug)m-binding proteins have been described in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in which they participate in the regulation of circadian-controlled processes (34Zhao B. Schneid C. Iliev D. Schmidt E.M. Wagner V. Wollnik F. Mittag M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); in Caenorhabditis elegans, in which a novel ug-specific binding protein (SUP-12) has been shown to control muscle-specific splicing of the actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin gene (35Anyanful A. Ono K. Johnsen R.C. Ly H. Jensen V. Baillie D.L. Ono S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); and also in humans (36Takahashi N. Sasagawa N. Suzuki K. Ishiura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 37Faustino N.A. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38Perez Canadillas J.M. Varani G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this kind of repeated dinucleotide sequence can play a functional role irrespective of the direction that its gets transcribed. In fact, (ca)m repeats have also been described to have an effect on splicing by promoting splicing inclusion of exon 13 in the endothelial nitricoxide synthase gene (39Hui J. Stangl K. Lane W.S. Bindereif A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 40Bilbao D. Valcarcel J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 6-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Also in this case, the trans-acting factor binding to these repeats has been identified and shown to correspond to the hnRNP L nuclear protein. Not unexpectedly and in a way analogous but opposite to TDP-43, the length of the (ca)m repeats correlates with hnRNP L binding and exon inclusion (39Hui J. Stangl K. Lane W.S. Bindereif A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, besides its role in CFTR exon 9 splicing, very little is known concerning the normal biological function of TDP-43. At present, experimental data show only that it is a highly conserved protein, as closely related proteins have been found in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis (28Ayala Y.M. Pantano S. D'Ambrogio A. Buratti E. Brindisi A. Marchetti C. Romano M. Baralle F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 41Wang H.Y. Wang I.F. Bose J. Shen C.K. Genomics. 2004; 83: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), that its Xenopus homolog may be involved in the timing of events in mitosis (42Georgi A.B. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and that it may act as a bridge between the various nuclear bodies possibly through an interaction with the SMN protein (43Wang I.F. Reddy N.M. Shen C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13583-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Recently, its expression has also been shown to be up-regulated in cells infected by respiratory syncytial virus (44Brasier A.R. Spratt H. Wu Z. Boldogh I. Zhang Y. Garofalo R.P. Casola A. Pashmi J. Haag A. Luxon B. Kurosky A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11461-11476Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Analogously, very little is also known regarding the mechanism through which TDP-43 can inhibit splicing; and at the moment, the available data show only that its C-terminal tail plays an essential role in inhibiting this process (28Ayala Y.M. Pantano S. D'Ambrogio A. Buratti E. Brindisi A. Marchetti C. Romano M. Baralle F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 41Wang H.Y. Wang I.F. Bose J. Shen C.K. Genomics. 2004; 83: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Here, we have investigated the reason for this observation; and in this work, we show that the C-terminal region of TDP-43 is capable of interacting with several proteins of the hnRNP family, in particular, hnRNP A2/B1, hnRNP A1, hnRNP C1/C2, and hnRNP A3. This interaction is probably essential for the splicing inhibitory activity of TDP-43. RNA Secondary Structure Determination—RNA secondary structure determination using limited V1 RNase, T1 RNase, and S1 nuclease digestion has been described in detail (45Buratti E. Muro A.F. Giombi M. Gherbassi D. Iaconcig A. Baralle F.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1387-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Overlay, HPLC Analysis, and Nanoelectrospray Mass Spectrometry—Western blots containing both HeLa nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (150 μg) were incubated for 2 h with GST-TDP-43 (10 μg of protein in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 10% (w/v) nonfat dried milk) for 1 h. The blots were washed four times with PBS plus 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with a commercial anti-GST antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:2000. The blots were then washed again four times with PBS plus 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibody (DakoCytomation A/S) at a dilution of 1:2000. After four final washes, the Western blots were developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Fractionation of nuclear extracts was performed on an HPLC Agilent 1100 series using a Phenomenex C4 300A reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm). The proteins were eluted using a solution of 95% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in a 20–70% linear gradient over 38 min. The different fractions were first speed-dried for 2 h to reduce volume and then concentrated using Microcon YM-10 filters. Each fraction was divided in two and loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels; one was stained with Coomassie Blue, whereas the other was blotted on Optitran BA-S 83 nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) and subjected to GST overlay as described above. Internal sequence analysis with the Coomassie Blue-stained bands excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel was performed using an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (LCQ Deca XP, Thermo Electron Corp.). The bands were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were extracted with water, 60% acetonitrile, and 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The fragments were then analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the proteins were identified by analysis of the peptide tandem mass spectrometry data with Turbo SEQUEST (Thermo Electron Corp.) and Mascot (Matrix Science). Reverse Transcription-PCR Amplifications of TDP-43, hnRNP Factors, and Mutants and Their Expression—The GST-TDP-43 and GST-TDP-43-(101–261) expression plasmids have been described (23Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The GST-TDP-43(NR-1) and GST-TDP-43-(101–414) mutants are protein fragments containing residues 1–190 and 101–414 of TDP-43, respectively. The fragments were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 571SmaRV (5′-tcccccggggcttctcaaaggctcatcttgg-3′) and pGEX5′ (5′-gggctggcaagccacgtttggtg-3′) for GST-TDP-43(NR-1) and oligonucleotides TDPDNf (5′-cgcggatccagaaaacatccgatttaatagtg-3′) and pGEX3′ (5′-ccgggagctgcatgtgtcagagg-3′) for GST-TDP-43-(101–414). The products were cloned into the pGEX-3X expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) using BamHI and SmaI in the case of GST-TDP-43(NR-1) and BamHI and EcoRI in the case of GST-TDP-43-(101–414). Expression and purification of the mutants were carried out as described previously (23Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The GST-TDP-43(ΔCter) mutant has been used in a recent study (28Ayala Y.M. Pantano S. D'Ambrogio A. Buratti E. Brindisi A. Marchetti C. Romano M. Baralle F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The plasmid expressing His-hnRNP A1 and rabbit antisera directed against this protein were a kind gift of Alexander Ochem and Raffaella Klima (International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology). The hnRNP C2 sequence (to obtain GST-hnRNP C2) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from total HeLa RNA using primers hnRNPCS (5′-aataaagaattctcatcctccattggcgctgtctctgtcatcctc-3′, sense) and hnRNPCAS (5′-tcgactcactgggctggcacaggctgaggggtctctcgcccactatcattaggcccctcgg-3′, antisense). The amplified product was then sequenced and inserted in the pGEX-3X plasmid for expression. The same procedure was followed to obtain the GST-hnRNP A2 plasmid using primers hnRNPA2S (5′-aatttaaggatccccatggagagagaaaagga-3′, sense) and hnRNPA2AS (5′-aattaagaattctcagtatcggctcctcccaccataa-3′, antisense). Mutant hnRNP A2 sequences were produced as follows. GST-hnRNP A2(ΔCter) was obtained by amplifying the hnRNP A2 cDNA with primers hnRNPA2S and hnRNPA2/631AS (5′-cctcctctaaagttacttcctggtcc-3′, antisense), whereas hnRNP A2(ΔRRM2) was obtained by a two-round amplification procedure using primers hnRNPA2/ΔRRM2S (5′-ctcatgtaactgtggaaatgcaggaagtt-3′, sense) and hnRNPA2/ΔRRM2AS (5′-aacttcctgcatttccacagttacatgag-3′, antisense). All proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (23Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were then obtained by immunizing a 3-month old New Zealand white rabbit according to standard immunization protocols. GST Pull-down Analysis—Approximately 40 μg of each recombinant protein were bound to 500 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin and incubated with 0.5 mg of HeLa nuclear protein extract (C4 Biotech) for 2 h at room temperature in PBS and 0.2% Tween 20. As a control, an equal amount of GST protein was bound to a second batch of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. After four wash cycles, the proteins bound to the resin were incubated with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was performed following standard protocols using rabbit anti-TDP-43 sera at a dilution of 1:2000, and blots were developed by ECL. Protein/Protein Interaction by Pull-down Analysis—200 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA; for His-TDP-43) or Sepharose 4B (for GST-TDP-43) resin were washed with 1 ml of PBS and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of dialyzed recombinant protein. The coated beads were then collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min in a Eppendorf minicentrifuge; and after two additional washes with PBS and 0.2% Tween, each batch was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 2 μg of its respective recombinant protein (GST-hnRNP A2 and GST-hnRNP C2 for the His-TDP-43-coated resin and His-TDP-43 for the GST-TDP-43-coated resin). After four washes with PBS and 0.2% Tween, the beads were collected, and 60 μl of SDS loading buffer were added before loading onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was performed to check for the presence of the added recombinant protein. As a control, uncoated beads were used in each experiment. Band Shift Analysis—Commercial (ug)12 and (ug)6 RNA oligonucleotides (200 ng, ∼25 pmol; MWG Biotech) were labeled by phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Stratagene) according to a standard protocol and resuspended in 400 μl of water. Each binding reaction was performed at room temperature for 15 min by mixing the purified protein with the labeled RNA in a 20-μl final volume. To obtain the (uaggg(u/a))3 RNAs, we cloned, into the SacI-XbaI restriction fragment of Bluescript KS+ sites, oligonucleotides (after annealing) 5′-ctagggatagggttagggat-3′ (sense) and 5′-ctagatccctaaccctatccctagagct-3′ (antisense); and to obtain the u21 RNAs, oligonucleotides 5′-cttttttttttttttttttttt-3′ (sense) and 5′-ctagaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagagct-3′ (antisense). The plasmids were linearized with XbaI, and in vitro transcription was performed as described previously (26Buratti E. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36337-36343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed in 1× bind shift binding buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 72 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.78 mm magnesium acetate, 0.52 mm dithiothreitol, 3.8% glycerol, 0.75 mm ATP, and 1 mm GTP) and 5 μg/μl heparin and electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 100 V for 1 h in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 4 °C. The amounts of each protein used in these experiments are reported in the figure legends. The gel were then dried and exposed to autoradiographic XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). In Vitro Splicing Analysis and Separation of Spliceosomal Complexes— The pY7 and pY7(UG12U5) plasmids have been described previously (24Buratti E. Brindisi A. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 1322-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In vitro splicing reactions were performed using capped SP6-transcribed RNAs according to standard protocols. Recombinant proteins (400 ng each) were added to the depleted nuclear extract prior to assembling the remainder of the splicing reaction mixture. Splicing reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. The RNA was extracted using RNAwiz (Ambion, Inc.); ethanol-precipitated; and analyzed on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. Spliceosomal complexes at selected time points during the in vitro splicing reactions were separated by electrophoresis on a native 3.5% acrylamide gel (2 ml of 1% bisacrylamide, 3.7 ml of 40% acrylamide, 2 ml of 1 m Tris (pH 10), 2 ml of 1 m glycine (pH 6), 28.5 ml of H2O, 0.28 ml of ammonium persulfate, and 28 μl of Temed) following addition of 1 μl of heparin (50 μg/μl). RNA Secondary Structure of CFTR Exon 9 and the (ug)m-repeated Motif—Before analyzing in detail the interactions of TDP-43 with cellular proteins, we decided to address the alternative explanation for the negative role played by (ug)m repeats in CFTR exon 9 splicing proposed recently by Hefferon et al. (30Hefferon T.W. Groman J.D. Yurk C.E. Cutting G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3504-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this model, the (ug)m repeats have been suggested to fold upon themselves to inhibit CFTR exon 9 recognition by blocking 3′-splice site usage. This mechanism could thus occur without the need to invoke the presence of any trans-acting factor such as TDP-43. Therefore, to address this issue experimentally, we extended a preliminary structural probing that was performed on CFTR exon 9 in a previous study (22Niksic M. Romano M. Buratti E. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2339-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The probed RNA thus comprised the entire CFTR exon 9 sequence carrying a (ug)11u7 repeat and a significant portion of the intervening sequence 8 intron. Structural probing was performed according to a methodology recently described for the EDA exons of the mouse fibronectin gene (45Buratti E. Muro A.F. Giombi M. Gherbassi D. Iaconcig A. Baralle F.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1387-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which integrates limited RNase digestion with mFold structural predictions (46Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (9968) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, in this extended RNA context, the enzymatic cleavages confirmed the existence of several stem-loop elements (I–IV) that had already been suggested to exist in a previous study (22Niksic M. Romano M. Buratti E. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2339-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and excluded any tendency for the (ug)11 sequence to fold upon itself, even in the absence of interacting proteins. Moreover, mFold analyses performed using this extended context and after varying the number of ug repeats in no instance predicted this sequence as being capable of folding upon itself (data not shown). The discrepancy between these experimental probing data and the conclusions of Hefferon et al. (30Hefferon T.W. Groman J.D. Yurk C.E. Cutting G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3504-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) may be explained by the fact that their in silico predictions were performed by taking into account only the ug-repeated sequences and a very limited region surrounding this region (10 nucleotides on either side). Given these limitations, it is not surprising that mFold predictions suggested the possibility that (ug)m repeats might fold upon themselves. Indeed, the length of RNA examined represents a severe limitation in assigning significance to in silico results, which has been reported for the neurofibromin-1 gene, where the RNA window analyzed by even a few nucleotides could yield striking differences in the prediction results (47Vandenbroucke I. Callens T. De Paepe A. Messiaen L. BMC Genomics. 2002; PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to investigate further the splicing inhibitory properties of TDP-43. In Vitro Effects of TDP-43 Mutants on CFTR Exon 9 Splicing and Analysis of Spliceosomal Complex Formation—In a recent study, we highlighted the importance of the TDP-43 C-terminal region in splicing inhibition (28Ayala Y.M.

To confirm and extend these data, we used a pY7 plasmid containing two tropomyosin exons separated by an ∼120-nucleotide-long intron sequence that was modified to contain the 3′-splice site of CFTR exon 9 (Fig. 2A, underlined).

Snail/Snai1 is rapidly induced by Gli1 in vitro, and is coexpressed with Gli1 in human hair follicles and skin tumors. In the current study, we generated a dominant-negative allele of Snail, SnaZFD, composed of the zinc-finger domain and flanking sequence. In promoter–reporter assays, SnaZFD blocked the activity of wild-type Snail on the E-cadherin promoter. Snail loss-of-function mediated by SnaZFD or by one of several short hairpin RNAs inhibited transformation of RK3E epithelial cells by Gli1. Conversely, enforced expression of Snail promoted transformation in vitro by Gli1, but not by other genes that were tested, including Notch1, ErbB2, and N-Ras. As observed for Gli1, wild-type Snail repressed E-cadherin in RK3E cells and induced blebbing of the cytoplasmic membrane. Induction of a conditional Gli1 transgene in the basal keratinocytes of mouse skin led to rapid upregulation of Snail transcripts and to cell proliferation in the interfollicular epidermis. Established Gli1-induced skin lesions exhibited molecular similarities to BCC, including loss of E-cadherin. The results identify Snail as a Gli1-inducible effector of transformation in vitro, and an early Gli1-responsive gene in the skin."

Here we report that only prion-infected neuronal cells become apoptotic after mild inhibition of the proteasome, and this is strictly dependent upon sustained propagation of PrPSc. Whereas cells overexpressing PrPC developed cytosolic PrPC aggregates, this did not cause cell death. In contrast, only in prion-infected cells, mild proteasome impairment resulted in the formation of large cytosolic perinuclear aggresomes that contained PrPSc, heat shock chaperone 70, ubiquitin, proteasome subunits, and vimentin. Similar structures were found in the brains of prion-infected mice. PrPSc aggresome formation was directly associated with activation of caspase 3 and 8, resulting in apoptosis. These data suggest that neuronal propagation of prions invokes a neurotoxic mechanism involving intracellular formation of PrPSc aggresomes. This, in turn, triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis and further implicates proteasome dysfunction in the pathogenesis of prion diseases.

Prion diseases are rare fatal neurodegenerative disorders, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) 2The abbreviations used are: BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Hsc70, heat shock chaperone 70; LAC, lactacystin; prnp, mouse prion protein gene; PrP, prion protein; PrPL, PrP lethal; SCA, scrapie cell assay; fmk, fluoromethylketone; UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome system; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RML, Rocky Mountain Laboratory. in cattle and scrapie in sheep. The molecular hallmark of these disorders is the accumulation of abnormal prion protein conformers (PrPSc) derived from normal cellular host prion protein (PrPC) (1.Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). The cause of neurodegeneration in these disorders is not well understood, and a major gap exists in the understanding of how the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc ultimately kills neurons. Whereas PrPC is absolutely required for prion conversion and neurotoxicity (2.Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar), knockout of PrPC in adult brain (3.Mallucci G.R. Ratté S. Asante E.A. Linehan J. Gowland I. Jefferys J.G.R.

Neurobiol. 1994; 8: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) has no overt phenotypic effect, effectively excluding loss of PrPC function in neurons as a significant mechanism in prion neurodegeneration. However, there is much evidence that also argues against the direct neurotoxicity of PrPSc or prions (whether or not they are identical). PrPC-null tissue remains healthy and free of pathology when exposed to PrPSc (6.Brandner S. Isenmann S. Raeber A. Fischer M. Sailer A. Kobayashi Y. Marino S. Weissmann C. Aguzzi A. Nature. 1996; 379: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 7.Mallucci G. Dickinson A. Linehan J. Klohn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J.

Collinge J. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 578-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In such “subclinical disease states,” the majority of the accumulated PrPSc may be inert; alternatively, PrPSc may not be the toxic entity, but instead a toxic oligomeric PrPL intermediate species (PrP for lethal) may be produced during prion conversion (12.Hill A.F. Collinge J. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 578-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Either this intermediate species or PrPSc itself may then only elicit neurotoxic effects when present at sufficient concentrations in particular subcellular compartments. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain neuronal death in prion disease (reviewed in Ref. 13.Mallucci G. Collinge J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which is thought to occur via an apoptotic mechanism (14.Cronier S. Laude H. Peyrin J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In vitro studies have suggested that both full-length PrPSc (16.Hetz C. Russelakis-Carneiro M. Maundrell K. Castilla J. Soto C.

Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) are toxic when applied to primary cultured neurons. Other mechanisms suggested relate to altered PrPC trafficking. It has been described that PrPC may assume a transmembrane topology (CtmPrP), the concentration of which has been suggested to correlate with neurotoxicity (19.Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). More recently, it was proposed that prion-associated toxicity involves altered trafficking of PrPC, where inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) results in extensive PrPC accumulation in the cytoplasm and associated neuronal cell death (20.Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, the data is conflicting, with evidence both for (21.Wang X. Wang F. Sy M.S. Ma J. J. Biol.

One of the major drawbacks of many of these studies on cytosolic PrPC is the high levels of proteasome inhibition used, which may limit any physiological relevance to the situation in vivo (26.Ding Q. Dimayuga E. Martin S. Bruce-Keller A.J. Nukala V. Cuervo A.M. Keller J.N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The concept that UPS inhibition may contribute to neurodegeneration is not new. Degradation of intracellular proteins via the UPS is a highly complex and tightly regulated process that plays a major role in a variety of cellular processes (27.Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Aberrations in this system have been implicated, either as a primary or secondary event, in the pathogenesis of a range of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and Huntington disease (28.Ciechanover A. Brundin P. Neuron. 2003; 40: 427-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The degradative capacity of the UPS in the nervous system is known to become impaired in these neurodegenerative diseases as well as during the aging process itself (29.Lee C.K. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 48.Keller J.N. Gee J. Ding Q. Ageing Res. Rev. 2002; 1: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to examine further the nature of the PrP species responsible for neurotoxicity and to what extent low level or “physiological” UPS inhibition may be involved in prion disease pathogenesis. We chose to study these effects both in cell models of prion infection as well as examining overexpression of native PrPC. We found that whereas neuronal cells overexpressing PrPC developed cytosolic PrPC aggregates under conditions of mild proteasome inhibition, this did not cause cell death. However, under similar conditions, we found that neuronal propagation of prions invokes a neurotoxic mechanism involving intracellular formation of compartmentalized cytosolic PrPSc aggresomes that triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis and implicates proteasome dysfunction in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. The aggresome has emerged as a key organelle in the clearance of toxic cytoplasmic misfolded protein aggregates (30.Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found evidence for similar structures in vivo in brains of prion-infected mice. Cell Culture and Scrapie Infection—GT-1 and N2aPD88 mouse neuronal cells were infected with mouse-adapted RML scrapie prions or wild-type CD-1 mouse brain homogenate as described (31.Schatzl H.M. Laszlo L. Holtzman D.M. Tatzelt J. DeArmond S.J. Weiner R.I. Mobley W.C. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8821-8831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Klohn P.C. Stoltze L. Flechsig E. Enari M.

Cells were cultured in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cultures were tested for the presence of newly generated PrPSc by the scrapie cell assay (SCA) (32.Klohn P.C. Stoltze L. Flechsig E. Enari M. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11666-11671Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The SCA was used to determine the percentage of infected cells (32.Klohn P.C. Stoltze L. Flechsig E. Enari M. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11666-11671Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Cells were diluted in duplicate so that no more than 1000 cells were seeded into one well of a scrapie cell assay plate. To determine the number of infected cells, the assay was developed using the standard color reaction as described (32.Klohn P.C. Stoltze L. Flechsig E. Enari M. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11666-11671Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To determine the total number of cells, the assay was developed using a 1:10 dilution of trypan blue as an indicator of cell viability. The percentage of infected cells was calculated as the number of infected cells expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells. Both ScN2aPD88 and ScGT-1 cells were cured of PrPSc with 0.5 μg/ml anti-PrP antibody ICSM18 (D-Gen Ltd., London, UK) for 14 days. Confirmation of clearance of PrPSc was determined using the scrapie cell assay as described (32.Klohn P.C. Stoltze L. Flechsig E. Enari M. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11666-11671Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Generation of N2amoPrPC Cells—Exon 3 (bp 7-1316) encoding the full open reading frame of mouse prnp was cloned into the NotI-ClaI sites of the retroviral vector LNCX2 (Clontech). This vector was then packaged into the GP-E86 line using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) and selected using G418. Viral supernatant was used to infect N2aPD88 and GT-1 cells with 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). At 24 h after retroviral transduction, stable exon 3 moprnp- expressing clones were selected using G418. Expression levels were quantified by immunoblotting as described below. Cell Death and Apoptosis Assays—For cell death studies, dose-response curves were established using proteasome inhibitors, and concentrations causing ∼20% cell death in wild-type cells were chosen. Analysis of cell death using the lactate dehydrogenase kit was as recommended by the manufacturer (Alexis, Nottingham, UK). Quantification of apoptosis using annexin V and propidium iodide staining and caspase 3 and 8 assays was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Oncogene). For caspase inhibition experiments, cells were preincubated for 2 h with benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-fmk or benzyloxycarbonyl-IETD-fmk before the addition of proteasome inhibitors. Annexin V-FITC binding was quantified using flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting). Cells were treated with 1 μm lactacystin for 24 h and then harvested by trypsinization. A total of 10,000 cells/sample were analyzed for cell death by a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) with the Cell Quest software. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were harvested, and brain tissue was homogenized on ice in PBS, freeze-thawed three times, and treated with benzonase (50 units/ml) to digest DNA. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). The equivalent of 25 μg of total protein was loaded onto 16% SDS-PAGE minigels (Novex, Paisley, UK) and analyzed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described (33.Wadsworth J.D.F. Joiner S. Hill A.F. Campbell T.A. Desbruslais M. Luthert P.J. Collinge J. Lancet. 2001; 358: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). For proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) digestion, lysates were incubated with proteinase K at 1 μg/mg protein (cells) or 5 μg/mg protein (brain) at 37 °C for 90 min. Equivalent protein loading was confirmed in non-proteinase K-treated lanes by stripping membranes and reprobing with anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Analysis—Cells were fixed onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips using 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and then permeabilized in methanol at -20 °C for 15 min. Cells were then incubated in 10% normal goat serum for 30 min. Incubation with primary antibody was at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing, cells were incubated for 45 min with the appropriate secondary antibody at 37 °C, washed several times in PBS, and mounted in Antifade (Sigma) containing 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma). To remove PrPC and reveal PrPSc, cells were exposed to 98% formic acid for 5 min after fixing and before permeabilization. For confocal analysis, images were obtained using an LSM510 confocal microscopy system (Zeiss). A ×63 oil immersion objective was used for all imaging. For some experiments, ICSM18 was conjugated to a fluorescent Alexa-488 FITC secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Details of all antibodies are shown in supplemental Table S1. Subcellular Fractionation and PrP Analysis—Analysis of PrP solubility and aggregation was performed with modifications to published procedures (20.Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 34.Ma J.Y. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Briefly, after 24 h of lactacystin treatment, cells were harvested, washed in ice-cold PBS, freeze-thawed three times, and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was collected, adjusted with an equal volume of ×2 lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate), and incubated with benzonase (50 units/ml) for 20 min at 4 °C before centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated at -20 °C with methanol, air-dried, and then boiled in ×2 SDS-sample buffer, whereas proteins in the pellet fraction were boiled in ×2 SDS-sample buffer. Each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Affinity Purification of PrPSc Aggresomes—Magnetic tosyl-activated beads were coated with either mouse monoclonal antibody to vimentin or Brc126, an IgG isotype control antibody, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal, Bromborough, UK). ScGT-1 cells (with or without proteasome inhibition) were harvested in ice-cold PBS, freeze-thawed three times before treatment with benzonase (50 units/ml) on ice for 15 min. Equivalent aliquots of sample (10 μl containing 25 μg of total cell protein) were incubated with vimentin antibody-coated beads, Brc126-coated beads, or magnetic beads alone (25-μl bead bed volume) for 2 h at 37°C on an orbital shaker. Beads were concentrated in a magnetic particle concentrator (Dynal) and washed three times with PBS (3 × 5 min, 500 μl of PBS). Washed beads were resuspended in 20 μl of PBS and analyzed after proteinase K digestion (final protease concentration of 1 μg/mg protein, 90 min, 37 °C) or in the absence of protease digestion. Beads were treated with 2× sample buffer at 100 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was analyzed by immunoblotting with biotinylated anti-PrP monoclonal antibody ICSM35 (D-Gen). For analysis of brain, 10% brain homogenate was prepared in PBS and freeze-thawed three times before digestion with benzonase (50 units/ml on ice, 15 min) and centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris. Aliquots of supernatant (25 μl) were adjusted with an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1% Triton-X-100, 1% deoxycholate) and incubated with either vimentin antibody-coated beads, Brc126 antibody-coated beads, or magnetic beads alone (25-μl bead bed volume) for 2 h at 37°C on an orbital shaker. Beads were concentrated in a magnetic particle concentrator (Dynal) and washed three times with PBS (3 × 5 min, 500 μl of PBS). Washed beads were resuspended in 20 μl of PBS and analyzed after proteinase K digestion (final protease concentration 5 μg/mg protein, 90 min, 37 °C) or in the absence of protease digestion. Beads were treated with 2× sample buffer at 100 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was analyzed by immunoblotting with biotinylated anti-PrP monoclonal antibody ICSM35. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by two-tailed nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, and significance was expressed as p < 0.01 (*), p < 0.001 (**), and p < 0.0001 (***) unless otherwise specified.

D, i, cell death in both N2aPD88 and N2amoPrPC cells after LAC treatment (1 μm; 24 h) is not significantly different, but levels of death in both cell types are significantly different from LAC-treated ScN2aPD88 cells (p < 0.0001). D, ii, after treatment with 10 μm LAC for 24 h, N2amoPrPC cells showed a significantly lower percentage of cell death compared with wild type N2aPD88 cells (p < 0.001; n = 12), suggesting that overexpressed cytosolic PrPC may have a neuroprotective effect. E, subcellular fractionation of PrP (S, soluble supernatant; P, insoluble pellet). In the absence of LAC treatment, PrP in N2amoPrPC cells is detergent-soluble (lane 1); after low dose (1 μm) LAC treatment, a proportion of PrP becomes insoluble and is isolated in the pellet fraction (lane 4); after high dose (10 μm) LAC treatment, all PrP becomes detergent-insoluble and aggregated and is found only in the pellet fraction (lane 6). F, infecting these N2amoPrPC cells with RML scrapie prions produces a significant (p < 0.0001; n = 6) increase in cell death after 1 μm LAC treatment, indicating that the presence of PrPSc sensitizes these cells to apoptosis.

Treatment with colchicine or nocodazole prevented aggresome formation (panels 2 and 3). Treatment with cytochalasin D did not clear aggresomes (panel 4), confirming our data indicating that clearance of PrPSc aggresomes selectively abrogates cell death.

However, the roles of ϵ- and ζ-cleavages in the formation of secreted Aβ and the relationship among these three cleavages, namely ϵ-, ζ-, and γ-cleavages, remain elusive. We investigated these issues by attempting to determine the formation and turnover of the intermediate products generated by these cleavages, in the presence or absence of known γ-secretase inhibitors. By using a differential inhibition strategy, our data demonstrate that Aβ46 is an intermediate precursor of secreted Aβ. Our co-immunoprecipitation data also reveal that, as an intermediate, Aβ46 is tightly associated with presenilin in intact cells. Furthermore, we identified a long Aβ species that is most likely the long sought after intermediate product, Aβ49, generated by ϵ-cleavage, and this Aβ49 is further processed by ζ- and γ-cleavages to generate Aβ46 and ultimately the secreted Aβ40/42. More interestingly, our data demonstrate that γ-cleavage not only occurs last but also depends on ζ-cleavage occurring prior to it, indicating that ζ-cleavage is crucial for the formation of secreted Aβ. Thus, we conclude that the C terminus of secreted Aβ is most likely generated by a series of sequential cleavages, namely first ϵ-cleavage which is then followed by ζ- and γ-cleavages, and that Aβ46 produced by ζ-cleavage is the precursor of secreted Aβ40/42. β-Amyloid precursor protein apparently undergoes at least three major cleavages, γ-, ϵ-, and the newly identified ζ-cleavage, within its transmembrane domain to produce secreted β-amyloid protein (Aβ).

Aβ is proteolytically derived from a large single transmembrane protein, the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), as a result of sequential cleavages by β- and γ-secretases (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol.

Although the exact nature of γ-secretase is still a matter of debate, accumulating evidence supports the idea that γ-secretase is a multiple molecular complex composed of, at least, presenilins, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 and that presenilin may function as the catalytic subunit (4Kimberly W.T.

The first one is the cleavage now specifically referred to as γ-cleavage (5Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2002; 41: 2825-2835Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar), which produces the C termini of most of the secreted Aβ species that end at amino acids 40 (Aβ40) or 42 (Aβ42) of the Aβ sequence. The second one is the ϵ-cleavage occurring between Aβ residues 49 and 50, which produces the N terminus of most of the APP intracellular domain (AICD) (5Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M.

The identification of this ϵ-cleavage site raises a question as to whether this ϵ-cleavage is obligatory for the generation of the C terminus of Aβ, and this also raises a question as to the relationship between ϵ- and γ-cleavages, i.e. whether they are independent of each other or sequential. One of the obstacles in addressing these questions is that neither the intermediate Aβ peptide, which ends at the ϵ-cleavage site, nor the C-terminal fragment, which starts with an N terminus generated by γ-cleavage, has ever been detected. In a recent study, we reported the identification of an intracellular long Aβ species, namely Aβ46, and this led to the discovery of the third major cleavage site, the ζ-cleavage site at Aβ46 between the known γ- and ϵ-cleavage sites (9Zhao G. Mao G. Tan J. Dong Y. Cui M.-Z. Kim S.-H. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50647-50650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The presence of ζ-cleavage site at Aβ46 is further supported by a very recent study showing that Aβ46 is the predominant form among the longer Aβ species detected intracellularly (10Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, the finding that the known γ-secretase inhibitors, such as DAPT, DAPM, and compound E, inhibit the formation of secreted Aβ40/42, and on the other hand cause the accumulation of Aβ46, raises the question as to whether Aβ40/42 and Aβ46 are produced by the same enzyme or by different enzymes (9Zhao G. Mao G. Tan J. Dong Y. Cui M.-Z. Kim S.-H. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50647-50650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, the roles of ϵ- and ζ-cleavages in the formation of secreted Aβ and the relationship among these three cleavages, namely ϵ-, ζ-, and γ-cleavages, also remain elusive. To address these key issues, the objectives of this study were focused on the following: (a) determining precursor and product relationship between Aβ46 and Aβ40/42; and (b) establishing the roles of ϵ- and ζ-cleavages in the formation of secreted Aβ40/42. γ-Secretase inhibitors, DAPT, DAPM, compound E, L-685,458, and WPE-III-31C (31C) were purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Aβ40 and Aβ42 were purchased from American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). Aβ46, Aβ48, and Aβ49 are customized peptides.

The plasmid APPsw645, which expresses a C-terminal truncated APP ending at the ϵ-cleavage site Aβ49, was constructed using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). APPsw (12Thinakaran G.

A pair of oligonucleotides (E49, CGTCATCACCTTGTAGATGCTGAAGAAG; E49-r, CTTCTTCAGCATCTACAAGGTGATGACG), which are complementary to each other and contain a stop codon at position 50 of the Aβ sequence, were used as primers. Cell-free Assay—In vitro turnover of Aβ46 by γ-secretase activity was assayed in a cell-free assay system established previously (13Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H. Sridharan A. Golde T. Eckman C.

Briefly, N2a cells were cultured in the presence of DAPM for 12 h and harvested in 9 volumes of homogenization buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl) containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science) and homogenized by passing through a 20-gauge needle 30 times. After removal of unbroken cells and nuclei by centrifugation at 800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The membranes were washed once with homogenization buffer and resuspended in assay buffer (150 mm sodium citrate pH 6.4, protease inhibitor mixture). Aliquots of equal amounts of membranes were then incubated at either 0 or 37 °C. After 1 h of incubation, aliquots (25 μl) were removed for Western blotting, and the remaining reaction mixtures were subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to yield the supernatant and pellet fractions. After addition of an equal volume of IP buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture), the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation using 6E10. The pellet fraction was solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 in IP buffer. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatant was diluted with equal amounts of IP buffer to lower the concentration of Nonidet P-40 to 0.5% and then subjected to immunoprecipitation using 6E10. The intracellular Aβ species were immunoprecipitated using 6E10. Both immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 10% Bicine/urea-SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis using 6E10 as described below. Detection of Aβ49—Note that in all of the experiments throughout this study, Aβ46 was determined by directly analyzing the cell lysates without immunoprecipitation. To determine the presence of the possible Aβ49, cells were cultured in the absence of any inhibitors and lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 in IP buffer. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatant was diluted with an equal amount of IP buffer, and the Aβ49 and other intracellular Aβ species were immunoprecipitated using 6E10 in the presence or absence of DAPT. Of note, based on our previous data (9Zhao G. Mao G. Tan J. Dong Y. Cui M.-Z. Kim S.-H. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50647-50650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and unpublished data, 3G. Zhao and X. Xu, unpublished data. it was found that all the tested nontransition state inhibitors, such as DAPT, DAPM, and compound E, cause intracellular accumulation of Aβ46 in the same fashion. However, in comparison with DAPM, the inhibitory effects of DAPT and compound E last longer, and this is probably because the enzyme binding activity of the latter two is stronger than that of DAPM. Therefore, DAPT and compound E were used in the in vitro assay and during the immunoprecipitation procedure. DAPM was used to cause the accumulation of Aβ46 in cells that would be used for determining the turnover of Aβ46 either in intact cells or in a cell-free system in which the inhibitor used for causing the accumulation of Aβ46 needs to be removed. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (9Zhao G. Mao G. Tan J. Dong Y. Cui M.-Z. Kim S.-H. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50647-50650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with the exception that in some cases the immunoprecipitation was carried out in the presence of 500 nm DAPT as indicated in the figure legends. Briefly, 24 h after splitting, cells were treated with inhibitors at various concentrations or with vehicle only as a control. Eight hours after treatment, cells were harvested and lysed in Western blot lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and protease inhibitors). Secreted Aβ was immunoprecipitated from conditioned media using a monoclonal Aβ-specific antibody 6E10 (Senetek). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 10% Bicine/urea-SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membranes were then probed with 6E10, and the immunoreactivity bands were visualized using ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Fractionation and Co-immunoprecipitation—In order to determine the formation of the possible complex of Aβ46 and presenilin, the following procedure, which was originally described in a previous study (14Farmery M.R.

Briefly, N2a cells expressing APPsw695/PS1wt cultured in the presence of 3 nm compound E (or 500 nm L-685,458; see Fig. 4B) for 10-12 h were harvested and then homogenized in homogenization buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) containing 10 nm compound E (or 2.5 μm L-685,458) by passing through a 20-gauge needle 30 times. The homogenized samples were subjected to centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min to remove the unbroken cells and nuclei. The postnuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h resulting in the supernatant and the pellet fractions. The resultant pellet, which contains both Aβ46 and PS1 (Fig. 4A), was solubilized in buffer B (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture)) (15Li Y.M.

The supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of solubilization buffer B to adjust CHAPSO to a final concentration of 0.5%. After pre-clearing with protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h, the supernatant was incubated with anti-PS1N, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the N terminus of PS1 (9Zhao G. Mao G. Tan J.

After washing twice with solubilization buffer B containing 0.5% CHAPSO and γ-secretase inhibitors, and then twice with PBS, the immunocomplex was eluted with SDS-PAGE Sample loading buffer and separated by 10-18% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using 6E10 to detect the co-immunoprecipitated Aβ46 and CTFβ. L-685,458 Inhibits the Formation of Aβ46—In our recent study, we have shown that treatment of cells with nontransition state γ-secretase inhibitors, such as DAPT, DAPM, and compound E, caused an increase in the accumulation of intracellular Aβ46, indicating that these inhibitors have no effect, or little effect, on the newly identified ζ-cleavage. On the other hand, when the cells were cultured in the presence of transition state analogs, such as L-685,458 and 31C, Aβ46 was not detectable, strongly suggesting that these inhibitors inhibit the ζ-cleavage and block the formation of Aβ46 (9Zhao G. Mao G. Tan J. Dong Y. Cui M.-Z. Kim S.-H. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50647-50650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be ruled out that the absence of Aβ46 in cells treated with L-685,458 may be due to the inability of this inhibitor to block the turnover of Aβ46. To address these issues, N2a cells expressing both PS1wt and APPsw were treated with DAPT, compound E, and L-685,458, either individually or in combination. Both the cell lysate and the secreted Aβ40/42 immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium (CM) were analyzed by 10% Bicine/urea-SDS-PAGE as described previously (16Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhuber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), followed by Western blotting using 6E10. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment with 0.5 μm DAPT (lane 2)or 5nm compound E (lane 3) caused a marked decrease in secreted Aβ40/42 (lower panel) and an accumulation of intracellular Aβ46 (upper panel). Fig. 1, lanes 12-15 and lanes 16-19, shows the dose-dependent effects of compound E and DAPM on the reduction of secreted Aβ40/42 and the concomitant accumulation of intracellular Aβ46, respectively. Of note, by directly analyzing the cell lysate, Aβ46 can also be detected in cells not treated with any inhibitor after prolonged exposure of the Western blot (Fig. 1, lane 11), as has been shown in our recent study (9Zhao G. Mao G. Tan J. Dong Y. Cui M.-Z. Kim S.-H. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50647-50650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). On the other hand, treatment with L-685,458, at a range of concentrations from 0.5 to 2.5 μm, completely abolished the formation of secreted Aβ40/42 in the CM (Fig. 1, lanes 4-6, lower panel), whereas it did not cause the accumulation of intracellular Aβ46 (upper panel). To determine whether the absence of Aβ46 was a result of the failure of L-685,458 to block the turnover of Aβ46, cells were treated with L-685,458 plus 0.5 μm DAPT or plus 5 nm compound E, both of which have been shown to block the turnover of Aβ46 (9Zhao G. Mao G. Tan J. Dong Y. Cui M.-Z. Kim S.-H. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50647-50650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), see also Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3. As shown in Fig. 1, the addition of DAPT (lanes 7 and 8) or compound E (lanes 9 and 10) did not lead to the accumulation of Aβ46 in the presence of L-685,458. This result clearly indicates that the absence of Aβ46, in cells treated with L-685,458, is due solely to its inhibition of the formation of Aβ46, rather than its failure to block the turnover of Aβ46. Aβ46 Is Processed into Aβ40/42 in Vitro—As reported in our recent study (9Zhao G. Mao G. Tan J. Dong Y. Cui M.-Z. Kim S.-H. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50647-50650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), at a low range of concentrations, DAPM, DAPT, and compound E cause a dose-dependent decrease in secreted Aβ40/42 and a concomitant increase in intracellular Aβ46 (see also Fig. 1), suggesting a possible precursor-product relationship between Aβ46 and Aβ40/42. This hypothesis is also supported by the facts that Aβ46 contains the γ-cleavage site at Aβ40/42 and that Aβ46 is detectable in living cells in the absence of any inhibitors (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 11), which suggests that ζ-cleavage occurs prior to γ-cleavage, otherwise the ζ-cleavage product Aβ46 would not have had a chance of being formed. To explore the possible precursor-product relationship between Aβ46 and Aβ40/42, we first determined whether Aβ46 is processed into Aβ40/42. To address this issue, a system that contains pre-existing Aβ46 is required. For this purpose, a cell-free system, which has been established and used in many previous studies to assay the in vitro γ-secretase activity (7Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G.

Cells were cultured in the presence of 100 nm DAPM, which has been shown to cause the accumulation of Aβ46 (Fig. 1), and the membranes were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 2, the membranes were then incubated in the absence of inhibitors (lanes 5 and 6), in the presence of DAPT (lane 7), and in the presence of L-685,458 (lane 8) at 37 °C. The sample in Fig. 2, lane 5, was incubated at 0 °C. After 1 h of incubation, reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 20,000 × g, and the resulting supernatants and pellets were subjected to immunoprecipitation by using 6E10. As shown in Fig. 2, top panel, Aβ40/42 was not immunoprecipitated from the pellet of membranes incubated at 0 °C (lane 5). However, Aβ40/42 was indeed immunoprecipitated from the pellet of membranes incubated at 37 °C with a concomitant decrease in Aβ46 (Fig. 2, compare lane 6 with lane 5), clearly indicating that Aβ46 was processed into Aβ40/42. Most interestingly, Aβ40/42 was also immunoprecipitated from the pellet of membranes incubated at 37 °C, in the presence of L-685,458 (Fig. 2, lane 8) but not from the pellet of membranes incubated in the presence of DAPT (lane 7). Note that in Fig. 2, lane 6, both pre-accumulated Aβ46 (top panel) and CTFβ (middle panel) decreased in comparison with those of the control in lane 5, suggesting that the Aβ40/42 detected in the absence of inhibitor (lane 6) is the sum of the Aβ40/42 produced from both accumulated Aβ46 and CTFβ. To confirm further that in the absence of inhibitor, CTFβ was processed by γ-secretase, aliquots of the reaction mixtures corresponding to samples in Fig. 2, lanes 5-8 in the middle panel, were separated by 10-18% regular SDS-PAGE and probed with antibody C15, an APP C-terminal specific antibody (9Zhao G. Mao G. Tan J. Dong Y. Cui M.-Z. Kim S.-H. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50647-50650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, bottom panel, in contrast to the basal level of AICD detected in samples in the presence of DAPT and L-685,458 (lanes 7 and 8), a significant amount of AICD was detected in the absence of inhibitor with a concomitant decrease in CTFβ and CTFα (lane 6). This result provides further support for the conclusion that γ-secretase-mediated processing of CTFβ contributes to the Aβ40/42 detected in Fig. 2, lane 6 (middle panel). The fact that CTFβ remains unchanged, in the presence of L-685,458 (compare Fig. 2, lane 8 with lane 5, middle and bottom panels), but that the pre-accumulated Aβ46 decreased with the concomitant production of Aβ40/42 indicates that the Aβ40/42 detected in Fig. 2, lane 8, is produced solely from the pre-accumulated Aβ46. This also explains why the amount of Aβ40/42 detected in Fig. 2, lane 8, is slightly less than that detected in lane 6. The fact that in the presence of L-685,458, the reduction of Aβ46 is similar to that of a membrane incubated in the absence of any inhibitors (compare lane 8 with lane 6, top panel) indicates that L-685,458 has no effect on the turnover of Aβ46. It was noted that only a trace amount of detectable Aβ40/42 was immunoprecipitated from the supernatants (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4, upper panel). One possibility is that the secretion of Aβ40/42 from the living cells might be an energy-dependent procedure. Therefore, the secretion of Aβ40/42 from the membrane of a cell-free system is not as efficient as in the living cells. Notably, small amounts of Aβ46, CTFβ, and full-length APP were also detected in these supernatants. It is possible that the Aβ40/42, as well as other APP derivatives detected in the supernatants, may be associated with the low density membranes contained in the supernatant fraction. The other possibility is that once the Aβ40/42 is released from the membrane, or more precisely from the γ-secretase complex, it might be rapidly degraded by the proteases released, during resuspension and incubation, from the membrane, which contains many kinds of protease-containing vesicles. In contrast, the Aβ40/42, which still remains in the membrane or, more precisely, before being released from the γ-secretase complex, was protected from the degradation. In this regard, it has been reported that the association of CTFβ with PS1 protects CTFβ from random degradation (17Pitsi D. Octave J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25333-25338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This degradation of Aβ40/42 released from the membrane may also account for the fact that the amount of Aβ40/42 detected is smaller than expected, compared with the decrease in precursor Aβ46. Aβ46 Is Processed into Aβ40/42 in Living Cells in the Presence of L-685,458—As shown in Fig. 2, Aβ46 was indeed processed into Aβ40/42 in a cell-free system. Data presented in Fig. 2 also clearly demonstrate that L-685,458, the transition state analog, did not block the turnover of Aβ46 into Aβ40/42 in a cell-free system, indicating that L-685,458 has no detectable effect on γ-cleavage that produces Aβ40/42 from Aβ46. The finding that the γ-cleavage and the new ζ-cleavage can be differentially inhibited by different inhibitors made it possible to determine the relationship between Aβ46 and Aβ40/42 and the role of the new ζ-cleavage in the formation of secreted Aβ40/42 in a living cell system. As shown in Fig. 3A, 24 h after splitting, cells were treated with either 100 nm DAPM (lanes 3-5 and 7) or 0.5 μm L-685,458 (lane 6) for 12 h. Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2, were the controls incubated with the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) only. As shown in Fig. 1, at the specified concentrations, DAPM completely blocked the formation of secreted Aβ40/42 and caused marked accumulation of Aβ46 (Fig. 1, lane 18), and L-685,458 completely blocked the formation of Aβ40/42 and Aβ46 (Fig. 1, lane 4). After 12 h of incubation, L-685,458 (0.5 μm) was added to the cells in Fig. 3A, lane 2. L-685,458 was also added to the cells in Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 7, in addition to the existing DAPM, and was continuously incubated for 40 min to completely stop the generation of new Aβ46 in these cells, because at this concentration, L-685,458 blocked the formation of Aβ46 (Fig. 1, lane 4). Since L-685,458 has no effect on the turnover of Aβ46 (Fig. 2), this treatment also allows the complete turnover of the Aβ46 possibly existing in the cells of lane 2 of Fig. 3A. As a control, cells in Fig. 3A, lane 1, were cultured in the presence of Me2SO throughout the course of the experiment. All cells were then washed twice with fresh medium containing the appropriate inhibitor, which was to be used in the next incubation step, and cultured for an additional 2 h either in the presence or absence of inhibitors as indicated. Aβ40/42 was immunoprecipitated"
https://openalex.org/W2008693523,"Abstract Mdm2 is a cellular antagonist of p53 that keeps a balanced cellular level of p53. The two proteins are linked by a negative regulatory feedback loop and physically bind to each other via a putative helix formed by residues 18-26 of p53 transactivation domain (TAD) and its binding pocket located within the N-terminal 100-residue domain of mdm2 (Kussie, P. H., Gorina, S., Marechal, V., Elenbaas, B., Moreau, J., Levine, A. J., and Pavletich, N. P. (1996) Science 274, 948-953). In a previous report we demonstrated that p53 TAD in the mdm2-freee state is mostly unstructured but contains two nascent turns in addition to a “preformed” helix that is the same as the putative helix mediating p53-mdm2 binding. Here, using heteronuclear multidimensional NMR methods, we show that the two nascent turn motifs in p53 TAD, turn I (residues 40-45) and turn II (residues 49-54), are also capable of binding to mdm2. In particular, the turn II motif has a higher mdm2 binding affinity (∼20 μm) than the turn I and targets the same site in mdm2 as the helix. Upon mdm2 binding this motif becomes a well defined full helix turn whose hydrophobic face formed by the side chains of Ile-50, Trp-53, and Phe-54 inserts deeply into the helix binding pocket. Our results suggest that p53-mdm2 binding is subtler than previously thought and involves global contacts such as multiple “non-contiguous” minimally structured motifs instead of being localized to one small helix mini-domain in p53 TAD."
https://openalex.org/W1963566766,"Approximately 25% of cases of Diamond Blackfan anemia, a severe hypoplastic anemia, are linked to heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 that result in haploinsufficiency for this protein. Here we show that deletion of either of the two genes encoding Rps19 in yeast severely affects the production of 40 S ribosomal subunits. Rps19 is an essential protein that is strictly required for maturation of the 3′-end of 18 S rRNA. Depletion of Rps19 results in the accumulation of aberrant pre-40 S particles retained in the nucleus that fail to associate with pre-ribosomal factors involved in late maturation steps, including Enp1, Tsr1, and Rio2. When introduced in yeast Rps19, amino acid substitutions found in Diamond Blackfan anemia patients induce defects in the processing of the pre-rRNA similar to those observed in cells under-expressing Rps19. These results uncover a pivotal role of Rps19 in the assembly and maturation of the pre-40 S particles and demonstrate for the first time the effect of Diamond Blackfan anemia-associated mutations on the function of Rps19, strongly connecting the pathology to ribosome biogenesis.

Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) 5The abbreviations used are: DBA, Diamond Blackfan anemia; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; rRNA, ribosomal RNA; ITS1, internal transcribed spacer 1; TAP, tandem affinity purification; DAPI, 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. is a severe hypoplastic anemia that generally presents early in infancy (1.Freedman M.H. Baillieres Clin. Hematol. 2000; 13: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 2.Willig T.-N. Gazda H. Sieff C.A. Hematology. 2000; 7: 85-94Google Scholar). Other clinical features of DBA are heterogeneous with some patients presenting craniofacial abnormalities, growth failure, predisposition to cancer, and other congenital abnormalities. Most cases of DBA arise spontaneously, with only a small proportion exhibiting familial transmission typically showing autosomal dominant inheritance. Approximately 25% of the DBA cases have been linked to mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), and in these cases haploinsufficiency for this ribosomal protein gives rise to the disease (3.Draptchinskaia N. Gustavsson P. Andersson B. Pettersson M. Willig T.N. Dianzani I. Ball S. Tchernia G. Klar J. Matsson H. Tentler D. Mohandas N. Carlsson B. Dahl N. Nat.

Tiemann C. Perignon J.L. Bouchier C. Cicchiello L. Mohandas N. Tchernia G. Blood. 1999; 94: 4294-4306PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining cases are of unknown etiology. The Rps19 protein is a component of the small ribosomal subunit, and as such, defects in some aspect of ribosome structure, function, or synthesis may be an underlying cause of DBA. The human Rps19 protein belongs to a family of ribosomal proteins restricted to eukaryotes and archea. Rps19 does not have a homolog in the eubacterial ribosome where the properties of individual ribosomal proteins have been most extensively studied. As such, little is known regarding the function of members of the eukaryotic Rps19 family. In prokaryotes, ribosomal proteins play critical roles in ribosomal assembly through their interactions with each other and rRNA (5.Nomura M. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, and Evolution. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 3-55Google Scholar). These interactions promote both steps in rRNA processing important for subunit maturation and the formation of active sites in mature subunits necessary for ribosome function. The precise functions of the ribosomal proteins in the production of the subunits in eukaryotes are poorly characterized, which calls for a more detailed investigation of the role played by Rps19 in ribosome synthesis and function. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be an outstanding system to investigate factors involved in eukaryotic ribosome synthesis, including ribosomal proteins (6.Baudin-Baillieu A.

To date, ribosome synthesis in yeast has been broken down to a number of well characterized intermediates, and numerous factors required for discrete steps in the pathway have been identified (11.Fatica A. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 12.Fromont-Racine M. Senger B. Saveanu C. Fasiolo F.

Ribosomal RNAs are initially synthesized as a polycistronic transcript containing 18 S, 5.8 S, and 25 S rRNAs (14.Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The mature rRNAs are derived from the primary transcript by a series of processing steps most of which occur within the nucleolus. Pre-rRNA processing occurs concomitantly with the assembly of ribosomal proteins onto the rRNA transcripts. The earliest pre-rRNAs are found in a large ribonucleoproteic precursor of 90 S, which splits into pre-40 S and pre-60 S particles after endonucleolytic cleavage in the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) at site A2 (see Fig. 5). Through proteomic analysis, non-ribosomal factors specifically associated with these pre-ribosomal particles at various maturation stages have been identified (15.Milkereit P. Kuhn T. Gas N. Tschochner H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Pre-40 S particles have been found to contain a set of specific nonribosomal proteins that associate in the nucleus and accompany the particles into the cytoplasm where they are required for the final maturation of the small subunit (16.Schafer T. Strauss D. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In yeast, Rps19 is encoded by duplicated genes, RPS19A and RPS19B, which differ from one another by a single amino acid. The yeast Rps19 proteins have over 50% sequence identity with the human protein (Fig. 1). The sequence similarity spans the bulk of the yeast and human proteins and includes blocks of near complete identity. One of these blocks, residues 52–63 in humans, is a hot spot for amino acid substitutions in patients with DBA (4.Willig T.N. Draptchinskaia N. Dianzani I. Ball S. Niemeyer C. Ramenghi U. Orfali K. Gustavsson P. Garelli E. Brusco A. Tiemann C. Perignon J.L. Bouchier C. Cicchiello L. Mohandas N. Tchernia G. Blood. 1999; 94: 4294-4306PubMed Google Scholar). Other amino acid substitutions found in DBA patients that occur outside of this region also fall in residues that are either identical or have conservative substitutions between yeast and humans. Given this high degree of conservation, studies on the function of the yeast Rps19 protein should provide insight into the function of its human homolog and processes affected in Diamond Blackfan anemia. Here we show that Rps19 is an essential protein that is required for the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit. This phenotype in Rps19-depleted cells is linked to a clear pre-rRNA processing defect at site A2 and to the nuclear retention of 40 S subunit precursors, which fail to recruit certain non-ribosomal factors involved in subunit maturation. In addition, a similar defect in pre-rRNA processing is induced by the expression of yeast Rps19 mutants carrying missense mutations found in DBA patients. These results indicate that Rps19 is a key protein in ribosome biogenesis and establish a link between partial or total loss of function of the DBA-linked protein Rps19 and a strong defect in pre-rRNA processing and subunit maturation. Yeast and Bacterial Strains—The yeast strains used in this study were generated by the Saccharomyces genome deletion project consortium and obtained from Research Genetics or Euroscarf. Media used in cultivating yeast were YPD (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, and 2% (w/v) glucose) and synthetic (0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 2% (w/v) glucose). Where appropriate, nutrients were added to synthetic media in amounts specified by Sherman (17.Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-21PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments glucose was replaced as a carbon source by 0.2% (w/v) sucrose and 2% (w/v) galactose. Diploids were sporulated on solid sporulation media (1% (w/v) potassium acetate, 0.1% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.05% (w/v) glucose, and 2% (w/v) agar). Additional nutrients were added to sporulation media in amounts corresponding to 25% of that used in synthetic media. A haploid yeast strain (GAL-RPS19), with chromosomal alleles of RPS19A and RPS19B disrupted and growth supported by a plasmid-borne allele of RPS19A under control of the GAL1 promoter, was created to analyze the effects of depletion of both Rps19 proteins. The RPS19A gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR and subcloned into pFL38-GAL (10.Leger-Silvestre I. Milkereit P. Ferreira-Cerca S. Saveanu C. Rousselle J.-C. Choesmel V. Guinefoleau C. Gas N. Gleizes P.-E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2336-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This plasmid was transformed into a diploid yeast strain heterozygous for RPS19A and RPS19B disruptions generated by crossing strains Y06271 (Δrps19A/RPS19B) and Y11142 (RPS19A/Δrps19B) obtained from Euroscarf. Resulting transformants were sporulated, and tetrads were dissected on rich media with 2% (w/v) galactose as carbon sources. Haploid progeny were initially tested for growth on 2% (w/v) glucose to identify strains whose growth was galactose-dependent. The status of the chromosomal alleles of RPS19A and RPS19B in these strains was assessed using oligonucleotides flanking the kanMX disruption cassette in each gene. Two haploid strains were identified that had growth dependent on the plasmid-borne allele of RPS19A under control of the GAL1 promoter. The Escherichia coli strain used in this study was XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). RPS19 Mutations—The UAS and entire coding sequence of RPS19A were amplified by PCR using Pfu Ultra Hotstart polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR product was cloned into pRS315. Missense mutations in RPS19 reported for DBA patients were introduced at corresponding positions in the RPS19A gene using the Genetailor site-directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen). Mutations introduced into RPS19A were confirmed by sequencing, which also ruled out the introduction of spurious mutations during the mutagenesis procedure. Plasmids carrying either wild-type or mutant alleles of RPS19A were transformed into the GAL-RPS19 strain growth on 2% galactose. The functions of RPS19A alleles on the pRS315 plasmid were analyzed after shifting growth to media containing 2% glucose. Polysome Analysis—Polysomes were prepared and fractionated on 7–47% sucrose gradients as described by Baim et al. (18.Baim S.B. Pietras D.F. Eustice D.C. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1839-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Centrifugation was generally carried out at 18,000 rpm for 16 h in an SW28.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Sucrose gradients were fractionated, and absorbance at 254 nm was monitored using an ISCO model 185 gradient fractionator and a UA-6 absorbance detector. Data were digitized using UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT) or Adobe Photoshop. Northern Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from yeast by hot phenol extraction (19.Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar), separated on a 1% agarose gel, and passively transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In Fig. 4, the membrane was hybridized overnight at 50 °C with the following oligonucleotides: probe 5′-A0 (5′-GCAGATCTGACGATCACC-3′), probe A0–A1 (5′-GATCGTTCTCCCTTACCCAC-3′), probe 18 S (5′-CATGGCTTAATCTTTGAGAC-3′), probe D-A2 (5′-TTAAGCGCAGGCCCGGCTGG-3′), probe A2–A3 (5′-GATTGCTCGAATGCCCAAAG-3′), probe E-C2 (5′-GGCCAGCAATTTCAAGTTA-3′) and probe 25 S (5′-CCATCTCCGGATAAACC-3′). In Fig. 8, membranes were hybridized overnight at 37 °C with probe A2–A3 (5′-ATGAAAACTCCACAGTG-3′) and probe 18S (5′-TGATCCTTCCGCAGGTTCACCTACGGAAAC-3′). The probes (10 ng) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). After hybridization, the blots were washed twice in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS, or 3 times in 6× SSC and analyzed by phosphorimaging.FIGURE 8Missense mutations found in DBA patients influence rRNA processing and affect the ability of RPS19A to support growth in yeast. The GAL-RPS19 strain was transformed with a second plasmid (pRS315) harboring alleles of RPS19A under the control of its own promoter. A, growth assay. Cultures were grown overnight in synthetic media lacking uracil and leucine with galactose as carbon source, diluted to 0.1 A600, subjected to 10-fold serial dilutions, and spotted on rich media containing galactose (Gal) or glucose (Glc). RPS19A alleles carried on the pRS315 plasmid are listed above each dilution series. B, Northern analysis. Strains were grown overnight in synthetic media lacking uracil and leucine with galactose as carbon source, transferred to glucose-containing media, and grown for 22 h before cells were harvested and total RNA prepared. Filters were hybridized with probe A2–A3 and a probe to mature 18 S rRNA. Values below each lane represent the ratio of 21 S pre-rRNA to 18 S rRNA derived from PhosphorImager analysis. The ratio in cells with RPS19A was arbitrarily set at 1. Other values were normalized against the RPS19A value. A.U., arbitrary units. C, pre-18 S rRNA FISH with a probe complementary to the D-A2 segment of ITS1. Strains were grown for 4 h in glucose-containing media.

Randall-Whitis L. Ellis S.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 704-710PubMed Google Scholar). The GAL-RPS19 strain was used in the pulse-chase experiments. Cells were initially grown in synthetic media lacking uracil containing 0.2% (w/v) sucrose and 2% (w/v) galactose followed by depletion of Rps19 by shifting to synthetic media containing 2% (w/v) glucose. After 7 h in glucose-containing media, cells were recovered from 40 ml of each culture (A600 0.2–0.3) by centrifugation. Cells from both cultures were each suspended in 1 ml of glucose-containing synthetic media lacking uracil and methionine. Each culture was pulse-labeled for 2 min at 30 °C with 250 μCi of [methyl-3H]methionine. Labeled cells in 250-μl aliquots were diluted into synthetic media containing 1 mg/ml methionine and either placed on ice (0 chase period) or incubated for 2, 5, or 10 min at 30 °C. After the chase period cells were quickly chilled on ice prior to the isolation of total RNA. RNA was fractionated on 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Zeta-probe membrane. Membranes were baked for 2 h at 80 °C and exposed to BioMax MS film at –70 °C using a BioMax LE intensifying screen (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Film was exposed from 2 weeks to 1 month. The long development time resulted from the fact that the strains in the deletion collection are methionine auxotrophs. Inclusion of methionine in the culture medium during and after the shift to glucose reduces the efficiency of radiolabeling with [methyl-3H]methionine during the pulse period. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunolocalization of TAP Proteins— Affinity purification of TAP-tagged Noc4p, Enp1p, Tsr1p, Ltv1p, Rio2p, and analysis of co-precipitating RNAs were performed as described previously (20.Dez C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Henry Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7053-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization of TAP proteins was performed as described before (10.Leger-Silvestre I. Milkereit P. Ferreira-Cerca S. Saveanu C. Rousselle J.-C. Choesmel V. Guinefoleau C. Gas N. Gleizes P.-E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2336-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, spheroplasts were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-protein A antibodies (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin (1:50,000 dilution). Fluorescence detection was achieved with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibodies (Molecular Probes), and DNA was counterstained with DAPI. Images were captured with a Coolsnap ES camera (Roper Scientifics) mounted on a DMRB microscope (Leica) using the Metavue software (Universal Imaging). Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization and Electron Microscopy—Detection of pre-rRNA by FISH was performed as described by Gleizes et al. (21.Gleizes P.E. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Leger-Silvestre I. Teulieres F. Dauxois J.Y. Pommet D. Azum-Gelade M.C. Gas N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The sequence of the ITS1 oligonucleotidic probe is TT*GCACAGAAATCTCT*CACCGTTTGGAAT*AGCAAGAAAGAAACT*TACAAGCT*T (ITS1 probe), where T* represents amino-modified deoxythymidine conjugated to Cy3. Cells were prepared for electron microscopy by high pressure freezing (EM Pact, Leica). The samples were then transferred to –90 °C for cryosubstitution in acetone containing 0.2% uranyl acetate, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.2% osmium tetroxide for 72 h. This fixative was then replaced by pure acetone, and temperature was raised to –45 °C for embedding in Lowicryl HM20 resin. The resin was polymerized under UV light for 2 days at –45 °C and 1 day at +20 °C. Rps19 Is Essential for Cell Viability—To determine the extent to which yeast cell growth and division is dependent on the RPS19 genes, strains deleted for one or the other RPS19 gene (obtained from the Yeast Deletion Collection) were crossed to create a diploid strain heterozygous for both RPS19 deletions. After sporulation, the resulting tetrads were dissected, and the haploid meiotic progeny from individual tetrads were examined for growth on rich media at 30 °C. The results from this analysis indicate that disruption of either RPS19 gene alone reduces growth rate, whereas spores fail to germinate when both genes are deleted (Fig. 2A). To examine whether Rps19 is required for vegetative growth, a strain (GAL-RPS19) was created where the chromosomal copies of RPS19A and RPS19B are disrupted and a plasmid-borne copy of RPS19A is expressed under control of the GAL1 promoter. These data reveal that growth ceases when cells are shifted to glucose and RPS19 expression is shut off, indicating that the yeast Rps19 proteins are essential for cell growth and division (Fig. 2B). Shortage of Rps19 Preferentially Affects the Production of 40 S Subunits—To address whether deleting either RPS19 gene influences the translational machinery we prepared cell extracts from wild-type and RPS19 deletion strains and passed these extracts through sucrose gradients to generate polysome profiles. This method provides a steady-state measure of free ribosomal subunits and ribosomes engaged in protein synthesis. Fig. 3 shows that extracts from the Δrps19B strain had reduced levels of free 40 S subunits and fewer polysomes relative to wild-type. The overall rate of ribosome synthesis in the Δrps19B strain is also decreased, which is likely secondary to the 40 S subunit deficiency and is correlated with reduced growth rate. Experiments with the GAL-RPS19 strain showed that the level of free 40 S subunits was reduced and free 60 S subunits increased 3 h after a shift to glucose-containing media (Fig. 3, compare GAL-RSP19(Gal) with GAL-RPS19(Glu)). Under these conditions the secondary effects on global ribosome synthesis are not as dramatic as those seen in the Δrps19B strain. Data for the RPS19 deletion strains are similar to results reported for disruption of genes encoding other ribosomal proteins that are essential components of the 40 S ribosomal subunit (8.Tabb-Massey A. Caffrey J.M. Logsden P. Taylor S. Trent J.O. Ellis S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6798-6805Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22.Demianova M. Formosa T.G. Ellis S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11383-11391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Production of 18 S rRNA Is Blocked in the Absence of Rps19—The reduced amount of 40 S subunits in RPS19 deletion strains could be the consequence of a defect in subunit synthesis or enhanced subunit degradation. We examined flux through the yeast rRNA-processing pathway in wild-type and GAL-RPS19 cells by pulse-chase analysis. The strains were grown in glucose containing medium for 7 h to deplete Rps19 in the GAL-RP19 cells, and ribosomal RNA precursors were radiolabeled with a brief pulse of [methyl-3H]methionine. The radiolabeled methionine rapidly equilibrates with S-adenosylmethionine, which is used in the methylation of ribosomal RNA precursors. Methylation occurs early in the synthesis of rRNA, efficiently labeling the 35S primary transcript. Processing was then followed after chase periods in the presence of unlabeled methionine. Fig. 4A shows that during the labeling period wild-type cells rapidly processed the 35 S/32 S precursors to 27 S and 20 S species, which were then matured to 25 S and 18 S rRNAs in the first 2 min of the chase period. The GAL-RPS19 strain, in contrast, showed delayed processing to the 35 S and 32 S precursors during the labeling period. Although there was some delay in the production of 25 S rRNA upon depletion of Rps19, the amount of 25 S rRNA produced by 5 to 10 min of chase approached that observed in wild-type cells. The production of 18 S rRNA, on the other hand, was severely compromised in the absence of Rps19: maturation of the 18 S rRNA stopped after synthesis of a late precursor, which corresponds to 21 S pre-rRNA (see below). Thus, although flux through the entire rRNA processing pathway appears reduced in Rps19-depleted cells mutants relative to wild-type, steps leading to the production of 18 S rRNA are clearly impacted more severely than those leading to 25 S rRNA. Rps19 Is Required for Pre-rRNA Processing at Site A2—To determine more precisely the pre-rRNA processing defect(s) induced by the depletion of Rps19, we next performed Northern analysis on total RNAs isolated from GAL-RPS19 cells using oligonucleotidic probes (Fig. 4B). Cells were grown either on galactose or shifted for 4 and 8 h to glucose-containing medium to shut down Rps19 synthesis. An outline of the yeast rRNA processing pathway is shown in Fig. 5A. While the amount of 25 S rRNA stays roughly constant upon shutting down Rps19 expression the level of 18 S rRNA decreases (Fig. 4B, probes 18S+25S). The decrease in 18 S rRNA is accompanied by an increase in 35 S and 23 S precursors indicating that cells depleted of Rps19 are inefficient at cleaving rRNA precursors at the A0 and A1 sites within ETS1 (Fig. 4B, probes 5′-A0 and A0–A1). Blots with an oligonucleotide that hybridizes to sequences between the D and A2 cleavage sites revealed a severe reduction of the amount of 20 S pre-rRNA, a normal intermediate in the pathway leading to 40 S subunits, and an increase in what appears to be 21 S pre-rRNA, which extends from the 5′-end of mature 18 S rRNA to the A3 cleavage site (Fig. 4B, probe D-A2). An oligonucleotide complementary to the A2–A3 segment confirmed that this band was 21 S pre-rRNA (Fig. 4B, probe A2–A3). This probe also showed that the 23 S rRNA intermediate extends past the A2 cleavage site. Thus, cells depleted of Rps19 are defective in cleavage at the A2 site within ITS1, as illustrated in Fig. 5B. The relative amounts of 23 S and 21 S rRNA precursors accumulating in the Rps19-depleted cells indicate that the primary defect is in ITS1 with secondary effects on cleavage within ETS1, consistent with previous reports on the coupling between cleavage at sites A0, A1, and A2 sites (14.Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In parallel, the 27 S-A2 precursor was decreased in cells depleted of Rps19 providing further support for the influence of Rps19 on cleavage at the A2 site (Fig. 4B, probe A2–A3). In contrast, the levels of 27 S-A3 and 27 S-B showed only a modest reduction in Rps19-depleted cells (Fig. 4B, probe E-C2) indicating that relatively efficient cleavage of 35 S and 32 S precursors at site A3 can still generate normal intermediates in the pathway leading to mature 25 S rRNA. Very similar pre-rRNA profiles were obtained when only one RPS19 gene was deleted: the major processing defect observed in these strains was accumulation of 21 S pre-rRNA (data not shown). These data indicate that Rps19 is necessary for efficient maturation of the pre-rRNA ETS1 and pinpoint the strict requirement of this ribosomal protein for processing at the A2 site in the ITS1. Nuclear Retention of Pre-40 S Particles—We next examined the intracellular fate of the 21 S pre-rRNA-containing particles accumulating upon depletion of Rps19 and determined whether they can be exported to the cytoplasm or are retained in the nucleus and degraded. Fig. 6A shows the localization by fluorescence in situ hybridization of the pre-40 S particles with a probe complementary to the D-A2 domain of ITS1, in wild-type and mutant cells. As previously observed (10.Leger-Silvestre I. Milkereit P. Ferreira-Cerca S. Saveanu C. Rousselle J.-C. Choesmel V. Guinefoleau C. Gas N. Gleizes P.-E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2336-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), wild-type cells display labeling in the nucleolus, where most ribosome biogenesis is performed, and in the cytoplasm where conversion of the 20 S pre-rRNA to 18 S mature RNA occurs. In GAL-RPS19 cells depleted of Rps19, one observes a striking decrease of the cytoplasmic signal, which indicates that the pre-40 S particles are no longer efficiently exported from the nucleus. Precursors to the small subunit accumulate in the nucleus with most of the signal being restricted to the nucleolus, which can be distinguished from the nucleoplasm due to very low staining with DAPI. Labeling with a probe complementary to the A2–A3 segment also yields a nucleoplasmic signal in Rps19-depleted cells and not in wild type, consistent with the nuclear accumulation of pre-40 S particles containing 21 S pre-rRNA (data not shown). Single deletion of RPS19A or RPS19B is sufficient to induce a similar phenotype (Fig. 6B). These data are very reminiscent of our previous observations of cells depleted of Rps18, which is also required for efficient cleavage at the A2 cleavage site within ITS1 (8.Tabb-Massey A. Caffrey J.M. Logsden P. Taylor S. Trent J.O. Ellis S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6798-6805Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10.Leger-Silvestre I. Milkereit P. Ferreira-Cerca S. Saveanu C. Rousselle J.-C. Choesmel V. Guinefoleau C. Gas N. Gleizes P.-E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2336-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The strong nucleolar signal is compatible with a defect in early pre-rRNA cleavage steps taking place in the nucleolus. Together with the accumulation of pre-rRNA precursors in the nucleus, another conspicuous feature in a majority of Rps19-depleted cells is the fact that the nucleolus (as seen with the D-A2 probe) becomes round and appears to detach from the DNA. We visualized this phenotype at a higher resolution by electron microscopy (Fig. 6C). In several sections, we observed what appeared to be the vacuole engulfing the nucleolus. These images stron"

The MUC1 C-terminal subunit localizes to mitochondria and blocks stress-induced activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. How MUC1 is delivered to mitochondria is not known. The present studies demonstrate that MUC1 forms intracellular complexes with HSP70 and HSP90. We show that the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain binds directly to HSP70 in vitro. By contrast, binding of MUC1 to HSP90 in vitro is induced by c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain. c-Src also increases binding of MUC1 to HSP90 in cells. In concert with these results, we show that heregulin (HRG), a ligand for ErbB receptors, activates c-Src and, in turn, stimulates binding of MUC1 to HSP90. We also show that inhibitors of c-Src or HSP90 block HRG-induced targeting of MUC1 to mitochondria and integration of MUC1 into the mitochondrial outer membrane. These findings indicate that MUC1 is delivered to mitochondria by a mechanism involving activation of the ErbB receptor → c-Src pathway and transport by the molecular chaperone HSP70/HSP90 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2041771456,"The cellular response to hypoxia is, at least in part, mediated by the transcriptional regulation of hypoxia-responsive genes involved in balancing the intracellular ATP production and consumption. Recent evidence suggests that the transcription factor, HIF-1α, functions as a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis by controlling a broad range of cellular events in hypoxia. In normoxia, HIF-1α is targeted for destruction via prolyl hydroxylation, an oxygen-dependent modification that signals for recognition by the ubiquitin ligase complex containing the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor. Three HIF prolyl hydroxylases (EGLN1, EGLN2, and EGLN3) have been identified in mammals, among which EGLN1 and EGLN3 are hypoxia-inducible at their mRNA levels in an HIF-1α-dependent manner. In this study, we demonstrated that apart from promoting HIF-1α proteolysis in normoxia, EGLN1 specifically represses HIF-1α transcriptional activity in hypoxia. Ectopic expression of EGLN1 inhibited HIF-1α transcriptional activity without altering its protein levels in a von Hippel-Lindau-deficient cell line, indicating a discrete activity of EGLN1 in transcriptional repression. Conversely, silencing of EGLN1 expression augmented HIF-1α transcriptional activity and its target gene expression in hypoxia. Thus, we proposed that the accumulated EGLN1 in hypoxia acts as a negative-feedback mechanism to modulate HIF-1α target gene expression.

All three EGLNs are 2-oxoglutarate- and iron-dependent dioxygenases that utilize molecular oxygen as a co-substrate for prolyl hydroxylation. Another dioxygenase, HIF1AN/FIH1, initially identified as an inhibitor of HIF-1α transcriptional activation (33Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L.

Thus, both EGLNs and HIF1AN serve as cellular oxygen sensors to regulate HIF-1α activity. Interestingly, both EGLN1 and EGLN3 genes are up-regulated by hypoxia at their mRNA levels (31Epstein A.C.

These observations have led to the hypothesis that the buildup of the prolyl hydroxylases during hypoxia primes for rapid degradation of HIF-1α upon reoxygenation. In this study, however, we sought the role of EGLN1 in hypoxia. Our results indicated that EGLN1 binds HIF-1α in hypoxia as well as in normoxia and functionally inhibits HIF-1α N-terminal transcriptional activity. Cell Culture—HEK293 and U-2 OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Hep3B cells were grown in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. A VHL-deficient renal clear cell carcinoma cell line, UMRC2 or C2, was obtained from L. Neckers (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). C2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For hypoxic treatment, cells were incubated in a hypoxic chamber (NAPCO, Winchester, VA), maintained with 1% O2 and 5% CO2, and balanced with N2. Prolyl Hydroxylase Binding—Gal4-HIF-1α(C-ODD) (amino acids 498-603) or the corresponding L574S mutant (1.5 μg) was transfected with or without the V5-tagged EGLN1 expression plasmid (0.2 μg). Cells were exposed to hypoxic conditions or treated with 12.5 μm Cbz-LLL (Sigma) for 4 h and then were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton-X. The lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Gal4 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by immunoblotting with anti-EGLN1 antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and polyclonal anti-Gal4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). RNA Interference—The design of the 21-nucleotide small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes against EGLN1, EGLN2, and EGLN3 is as described previously (40Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouves A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4082-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). All of them were chemically synthesized by Qiagen (Valencia, CA). SMARTpool siRNA against VHL was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). An siRNA targeting the firefly luciferase coding sequence of the pGL2 vector (41Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) was employed as a negative control. Cells were seeded at 30% confluence in antibiotic-free medium 24 h prior to transfection. Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) was used for transfection with 20 nm siRNA duplex twice at a 24-h interval according to the manufacturer's instructions. The efficacy of the siRNA transfection in each experiment was determined by Western blot. Polyclonal antibodies against EGLN isoforms were purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), and anti-VHL monoclonal antibody was from Pharmingen. HIF-1α Transcriptional Activity—Transient transfection of pGal4-luc and pEpoE-luc reporter plasmids and luciferase assays were essentially as described previously (18Huang L.E. Arany Z.

In brief, 0.25 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.1 μg of each effecter plasmid were used for each well in a 12-well plate with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). 0.1 μg of pEYFP-Nuc expression vector (Clontech) was co-transfected for normalization of transfection efficiency. For reporter experiments involving siRNAs, cells were first transfected with the plasmid DNA at a confluency of ∼30-40%. The next day, cells were fed with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and transfected with siRNAs as described above. Luciferase and EYFP were measured as described previously (43Huang L.E. Pete E.A. Schau M. Milligan J. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41750-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The data are presented as means plus standard deviations from three independent experiments in duplicate. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot was performed essentially as described previously (18Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol.

The effect of EGLN1 on HIF-1α C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain (C-ODD) protein level was examined after transfection of Hep3B and C2 cells, respectively, with 1 μg of Gal4-HIF-1α-(498-603) and 0.2 μg of EGLN1. pEYFP-Nuc (0.05 μg) was also included as an internal control. Cells were treated in hypoxia for 4 h before harvest. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse-transcribed with the Taq-Man reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ), and 1 μg of cDNA was then amplified using the TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The PGK1 probe and primers were designed using ABI Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems): probe, 6FAM-5′-ATTTATCTAATTGTCCCATCTCTCCACTGCTGCT-MGBNFQ-3′; forward primer, 5′-TCTTGAGGAACGGATCAGATGTC-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-AGTAGGCCCTTGATAAAGAATGGA-3′. Human ACTB (Taqman primers and probe, ABI 7700) was used as an endogenous control (VIC). Gene-specific PCR products were measured continuously by an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) during 40 cycles. The difference in threshold number of cycles between PGK1 and ACTB for each sample was then expressed relative to the normoxic mock-transfected samples and converted into -fold difference. All experiments were repeated three times in triplicates, and representative results were presented as means ± S.E. EGLN1 Binds HIF-1α Irrespective of Oxygen Tension—HIF-1α possesses an ODD (amino acids 401-603) (21Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar) that can be divided into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (43Huang L.E. Pete E.A. Schau M. Milligan J. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41750-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that in HEK293 cells, EGLN1 co-precipitated with the C-ODD (amino acids 498-603) after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor, Cbz-LLL (44Kageyama Y. Koshiji M. To K.K. Tian Y.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Huang L.E. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1028-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, no co-precipitation could be detected when Leu-574, a molecular determinant of Pro-564 hydroxylation (44Kageyama Y. Koshiji M. To K.K. Tian Y.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Huang L.E. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1028-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), was mutated (Fig. 1B). Moreover, no such interaction was shown when EGLN2 or EGLN3 was tested (44Kageyama Y. Koshiji M. To K.K. Tian Y.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Huang L.E. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1028-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this study, we observed that EGLN1 also bound C-ODD during a 4-h hypoxic treatment (Fig. 1C). A similar result was obtained when cells were treated with desferrioxamine, a hypoxia mimetic (Fig. 1D). To rule out the possibility that the detected EGLN1 binding was a remnant of hydroxylated HIF-1α from normoxia, we increased the hypoxic treatment to 8 h, given the turnover rate of HIF-1α in hypoxia being less than 2 h (21Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Again, the binding of EGLN1 to C-ODD was readily detectable from cells with the prolonged hypoxic treatment (data not shown). Together, these findings indicated that EGLN1 interacts with HIF-1α irrespective of oxygen tension. EGLN1 is presumably inactive in hypoxia because of the strict requirement of oxygen for its enzymatic activity. This observation prompted us to search for additional functions of EGLN1. EGLN1 Inhibits HIF-1α N-terminal Transcriptional Activity—In addition to the CAD, C-ODD also possesses transcriptional activity (19Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 43Huang L.E. Pete E.A. Schau M. Milligan J. Gu J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17771-17778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), referred to here as N-terminal transcriptional activity. To examine whether EGLN1 modulates HIF-1α transcriptional activities, we tested effects of transient expression of EGLN1 in Hep3B cells in a Gal4 reporter system (42Gu J. Milligan J. Huang L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3550-3554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 43Huang L.E. Pete E.A. Schau M. Milligan J. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41750-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 2A show that EGLN1 markedly inhibited the transcriptional activity of C-ODD but not of CAD. Even under hypoxic conditions, there was >50% decrease of the N-terminal transcriptional activity. To further test the specificity of such inhibition, we took advantage of mutations (P564A and L574S) that disrupt EGLN1 binding. As expected, each mutation gave rise to an increased reporter activity and a loss of hypoxic induction. Of note, the elevated transcriptional activity of each mutant was apparently correlated well with its increased protein levels (data not shown). However, EGLN1 had no significant effects on these mutants in hypoxia (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in U-2 OS cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, overexpression of EGLN2 and EGLN3 also inhibited the N-terminal transcriptional activity (data not shown). EGLN1 Inhibition of HIF-1α Transcriptional Activity Is Independent of the VHL Degradation Pathway—As mentioned above, HIF-1α hydroxylation leads to VHL-mediated polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. It is possible therefore that the EGLN1 repression of HIF-1α transcriptional activity in hypoxia is a result of increased HIF-1α proteolysis despite the scarce hydroxylase activity. To test this possibility, we used the renal cell carcinoma cell line C2 (46Isaacs J.S. Jung Y.J. Mimnaugh E.G. Martinez A. Cuttitta F. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29936-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) that lacks a functional VHL protein for HIF-1α proteolysis. However, the N-terminal transcriptional activity was still inhibited significantly by EGLN1 irrespective of oxygen tension (Fig. 3A). Of note, EGLN1 bound C-ODD in both normoxic and hypoxic C2 cells (Fig. 3B) as in HEK293 cells. Again, the transcriptional activities of the P564A and the L574S mutant was unaffected by EGLN1 overexpression. These results suggested a novel function of EGLN1 for inhibiting HIF-1α transcriptional activity. To provide further evidence, we determined C-ODD protein levels in cells co-expressed with EGLN1 by Western analysis. In Hep3B, ectopic expression of EGLN1 led to a >20% reduction of the protein levels in hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3C; also see Fig. 1). However, EGLN1 overexpression failed to do so in the VHL-deficient C2 cells. Therefore, these results supported that EGLN1, in addition to promoting HIF-1α proteolysis, also independently represses the N-terminal transcriptional activity. We also examined the effect of EGLN1 on endogenous HIF-1α-mediated transcription with a reporter plasmid driven by the human EPO hypoxia-responsive element (18Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). EGLN1 overexpression significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced EPO reporter activity in Hep3B and C2 cells (Fig. 3D). Thus, these results indicated the biological relevance of EGLN1 as a repressor for HIF-1α-mediated transcription. EGLN1 Silencing Enhances HIF-1α Transcriptional Activity and Its Target Gene Expression in Hypoxia—To corroborate the role of EGLN1 in inhibiting HIF-1α transcriptional activity, we took a complementary approach in which EGLN1 expression was silenced by siRNA. Knockdown of EGLN1 in Hep3B cells resulted in a significant increase in HIF-1α N-terminal transcriptional activity under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 4A). However, siRNA targeting EGLN2 or EGLN3 showed no effect, which differs from the EGLN2 and EGLN3 overexpression results above (see “Discussion”). To confirm the effectiveness of the siRNA, we determined protein levels of targeted genes by Western blot analysis. The extent and specificity of siRNA knockdown are illustrated in Fig. 4B. The protein level of each EGLN was strikingly and specifically reduced by its corresponding siRNA; neither control siRNA nor those against its isoforms had any significant effect. Importantly, knockdown of EGLN1 expression rendered HIF-1α stable in normoxia, whereas knockdown of the other two showed no obvious effect, consistent with the hypothesis that EGLN1, generally most abundant (47Appelhoff R.J. Tian Y.M. Raval R.R. Turley H. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Gleadle J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38458-38465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), is the key oxygen sensor setting low steady-state levels of HIF-1α in normoxia (40Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouves A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4082-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Likewise, simultaneous knockdown of EGLN1, EGLN2, and EGLN3 gave rise to similar results as the knockdown of EGLN1 alone. To demonstrate that EGLN1 inhibits HIF-1α target gene expression in hypoxia, we asked whether EGLN1 siRNA alters hypoxic induction of PGK1, a hypoxia-responsive gene. Results in Fig. 4C from real-time RT-PCR show that only EGLN1 siRNA further elevated PGK1 mRNA levels in hypoxia. This result supported the hypothesis that EGLN1 modulates the HIF-1α target gene expression under hypoxic conditions, although its enzymatic activity is inactivated by limited oxygen. It is noted that although the relative abundance of the EGLN isoforms and the efficiency of corresponding siRNAs may vary in the cells, neither EGLN2 nor EGLN3 siRNA altered PGK1 expression under these conditions. Taken together, these results argued that only EGLN1 inhibits HIF-1α transcriptional activity in hypoxia by virtue of binding to HIF-1α. Stimulation of HIF-1α Transcriptional Activity and Enhancement of Its Target Gene Expression by EGLN1 siRNA Is VHL-independent—To demonstrate further that the increased expression of PGK1 in hypoxia by EGLN1 siRNA is not simply a result of increased HIF-1α stability, we asked whether knockdown of VHL expression in Hep3B cells would produce a similar result. Fig. 5A shows that the VHL siRNA effectively down-regulated VHL protein levels, in concomitance with an increased level of HIF-1α. However, in contrast to the augmentation by EGLN1 siRNA, VHL silencing failed to further enhance PGK1 mRNA levels in hypoxia despite a marked increase in normoxia (Fig. 5B). Of note, EGLN1 expression was essentially unaffected by the VHL siRNA (Fig. 5A). Likewise, in VHL-deficient C2 cells, only EGLN1 siRNA was able to stimulate HIF-1α N-terminal transcriptional activity (Fig. 6A) and to further elevated PGK1 expression under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 6B) without an additional increase in HIF-1α protein levels (Fig. 6C). Again, siRNA against EGLN2 or EGLN3 had no effects on the transcriptional activity and PGK1 expression. These results confirmed that EGLN1 specifically represses HIF-1α transcriptional activity in hypoxia. The known function of the HIF prolyl-4-hydroxylases is to sense and transduce oxygen signals via prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-1α, thereby triggering VHL binding, polyubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation (31Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W.

Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). The observation that EGLN1 and EGLN3 themselves are hypoxia-inducible (31Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar) has prompted investigations of the biological relevance of the increased hydroxylase levels. It has been shown that the rate of HIF-1α proteolysis, upon reoxygenation, depends on the duration of hypoxic stress; after prolonged hypoxia, accelerated HIF-1α degradation supervenes (48Berra E. Richard D.E. Gothie E. Pouyssegur J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, the hypoxic up-regulation of EGLN1 and EGLN3 apparently explains the buildup of the prolyl hydroxylases during hypoxia for rapid degradation of HIF-1α upon reoxygenation (40Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouves A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4082-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). However, the biological role for the accumulated hydroxylases during prolonged hypoxia remains unclear. It is conceivable that a negative-feedback mechanism would take place by modulating HIF-1α transcriptional activities. In fact, it has been demonstrated that HIF-1α CAD activity is inhibited during hypoxia by CITED2/p35srj, a hypoxia-inducible gene product that competes for p300 binding (15Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In contrast, the regulation of the HIF-1α N-terminal transcriptional activity remains obscure. Here we demonstrated that EGLN1 binds HIF-1α in hypoxia as well. Apart from its role in regulating HIF-1α protein levels, EGLN1 also modulates HIF-1α N-terminal transcriptional activity as a feedback mechanism to avoid excessive hypoxic response. During this study, the possibility of altered HIF-1α stability in hypoxia resulting from the manipulation of EGLN1 expression was always a concern. Although the increased protein degradation over-shadowed the direct transcriptional repression by EGLN1, the effect of transcriptional repression was uncovered, nevertheless, with the use of VHL-deficient cells defective in HIF-1α degradation. Moreover, EGLN1 inhibited endogenous HIF-1α transcriptional activity. EGLN1 silencing specifically enhanced HIF-1α transcriptional activity and PGK1 expression, especially under hypoxic conditions without further increase in HIF-1α levels. Furthermore, EGLN1 silencing in VHL-deficient cells confirmed the inhibitory effect of EGLN1 on HIF-1α transcriptional activity. In addition, the lack of enhanced PGK1 expression, when VHL expression was knocked down, further supported that EGLN1-mediated HIF-1α degradation in normoxia and its inhibition of HIF-1α transcriptional activity in hypoxia are two distinct functions. Accordingly, we proposed that both EGLN1 and CITED2 fine-tune HIF-1α transcriptional activities under hypoxic conditions. It is noteworthy that forced expression of the HIF prolyl hydroxylases in cells often down-regulates HIF-1α, as shown in this study as well as in a previous report (32Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). Obviously, results from such an approach often “violate” in vivo rules that govern the specificity of intracellular biochemical reactions. Therefore, the data should be interpreted with extreme caution. Although overexpression of the three hydroxylases all inhibited HIF-1α N-terminal transcriptional activity in our initial reporter assays, only EGLN1 silencing augmented HIF-1α transcriptional activity and PKG1 expression. These findings are consistent with our co-immunoprecipitation result that only EGLN1, but not EGLN2 and EGLN3, interacts with HIF-1α C-ODD (44Kageyama Y. Koshiji M. To K.K. Tian Y.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Huang L.E. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1028-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, alternative approaches to gene overexpression are necessary to avoid potential pitfalls. While this report was in preparation, Baek et al. (49Baek J.H. Mahon P.C. Oh J. Kelly B. Krishnamachary B. Pearson M. Chan D.A. Giaccia A.J. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) reported that the protein OS-9 interacts with both HIF-1α and EGLN1 in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. OS-9 promotes HIF-1α hydroxylation, VHL binding, and proteasomal degradation. In addition, it inhibits HIF-1-mediated transcription. Apparently, OS-9 is not involved in EGLN1 inhibition of HIF-1α transcriptional activity because HIF-1α stability was not altered in this study. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted to identify the molecular mechanism(s) by which EGLN1 inhibits HIF-1-mediated transcription. Our current data seemingly suggested that the EGLN1 hydroxylase activity per se is not necessarily required for inhibiting HIF-1α transcriptional activity, and therefore, it would be interesting to search for additional factors that interact with EGLN1 for mechanistic dissections. Very recently, Ozer et al. (50Ozer A. Wu L.C. Bruick R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) reported that EGLN1, in addition to regulating HIF stability, modulates HIF function through the recruitment of the candidate tumor suppressor ING4. Targeting the HIF prolyl hydroxylases is regarded as a potential therapeutic principle for manipulating HIF activity (5Giaccia A. Siim B.G. Johnson R.S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 51Hewitson K.S. Schofield C.J. Drug Discov. Today. 2004; 9: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The differential effects on the HIF-1α target gene expression by the respective silencing of EGLN1 and VHL also suggest that although inhibiting EGLN1 activity alone may give rise to a marked increase in HIF-1α levels, the resulting HIF-1α transcriptional activity may depend on the intracellular oxygen tension, i.e. hypoxia specifically augments HIF-1α target gene expression. By contrast, inhibiting VHL activity would render HIF-1α stable and constitutively active regardless of oxygen tension. Therefore, understanding the regulation of HIF-1α transcriptional activity by the prolyl hydroxylase may provide new insight into the pharmacological manipulation of the HIF prolyl hydroxylase activities for the treatment of ischemic/hypoxic disease.

https://openalex.org/W2071238919,"Cellulose, the main structural component of plant cell walls, is the most abundant carbohydrate polymer in nature. To break down plant cell walls, anaerobic microorganisms have evolved a large extracellular enzyme complex termed cellulosome. This megadalton catalytic machinery organizes an enzymatic assembly, tenaciously bound to a scaffolding protein via specialized intermodular “cohesin-dockerin” interactions that serve to enhance synergistic activity among the different catalytic subunits. Here, we report the solution structure properties of cellulosome-like assemblies analyzed by small angle x-ray scattering and molecular dynamics. The atomic models, generated by our strategy for the free chimeric scaffoldin and for binary and ternary complexes, reveal the existence of various conformations due to intrinsic structural flexibility with no, or only coincidental, inter-cohesin interactions. These results provide primary evidence concerning the mechanisms by which these protein assemblies attain their remarkable synergy. The data suggest that the motional freedom of the scaffoldin allows precise positioning of the complexed enzymes according to the topography of the substrate, whereas short-scale motions permitted by residual flexibility of the enzyme linkers allow “fine-tuning” of individual catalytic domains.

Cellulolytic bacteria living in anaerobic biotopes produce large extracellular multienzymatic complexes termed cellulosomes that efficiently degrade crystalline cellulose and related plant cell wall polymers (1.Bayer E.A. Bélaïch J.-P. Shoham Y. Lamed R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The simplest cellulosomes, such as those produced by Clostridium cellulolyticum, include eight enzymes tenaciously bound to a scaffolding protein bearing a cellulose-binding module (CBM) 3The abbreviations used are: CBM, cellulose-binding module; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; MD, molecular dynamics; Fc, native full-length cellulase Cel48F from C. cellulolyticum; Ft, cellulase Cel48F from C. cellulolyticum appended with a C. thermocellum dockerin; At, cellulase Cel5A from C. cellulolyticum appended with a C. thermocellum dockerin; S4, scaffoldin protein containing one cohesin from C. thermocellum and one cohesin from C. cellulolyticum connected by a linker peptide of 51 residues; Fc-S4, S4 in complex with one native full-length Cel48F from C. cellulolyticum; Fc-S4-Ft, S4 in complex with two identical cellulases Cel48F appended with either a C. cellulolyticum or a C. thermocellum dockerin; Fc-S4-At, S4 in complex with two different cellulases, namely Cel48F appended with a C. cellulolyticum dockerin and cellulase Cel5A appended with a C. thermocellum dockerin. that anchors the entire complex to the surface of the substrate (1.Bayer E.A. Bélaïch J.-P. Shoham Y. Lamed R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In contrast, the most elaborate cellulosomes described to date, such as those found in rumen bacteria, contain several interacting scaffoldins that can accommodate dozens of enzymes (1.Bayer E.A. Bélaïch J.-P. Shoham Y. Lamed R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Despite their diversity, cellulosomes are systematically assembled by the same building blocks, a primary scaffoldin subunit that usually carries numerous enzyme subunits. For this purpose, the scaffoldin generally contains multiple copies of cohesin modules that can interact with any of the enzymes through their matching dockerin modules. In any given species, the interaction among the cohesins and dockerins usually proceeds in a nonspecific manner (2.Fierobe H.P. Pages S. Belaich A. Champ S. Lexa D. Belaich J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12822-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3.Yaron S. Morag E. Bayer E.A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The complexity and diversity of native cellulosomes prevents detailed analysis of the structural features responsible for their enhanced activity. Furthermore, the lack of specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interaction within a species constitutes a major obstacle for the fabrication of homogeneous simplified cellulosomes containing more than one enzyme. “Designer cellulosomes”, in which desired enzymes can be incorporated into defined positions, are desirable for both basic and applied purposes. Such well defined artificial cellulosomes would allow us to examine the contribution of defined cellulosomal components to the degradation of cellulosic substrates. In addition, by controlling the incorporation of different types of enzymes into an artificial cellulosome complex, we may be able to improve their concerted action on the given substrates. In this context, it was discovered that cohesins generally fail to recognize dockerins from different species, thus allowing species-specific control of the cohesin-dockerin interaction (4.Pages S. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Morag E. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This approach enabled the systematic design of highly ordered and homogeneous hybrid minicellulosomes that contained up to three different components (5.Fierobe H.P. Bayer E.A. Tardif C. Czjzek M. Mechaly A. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49621-49630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 6.Fierobe H.P. Mechaly A. Tardif C.

Such artificial assemblies were designed to comprise a chimeric scaffoldin, possessing an optional CBM and two cohesins of divergent specificity (derived from C. cellulolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum) and two cellulases, each bearing a dockerin complementary to one of the divergent cohesins. Thus, in these artificial cellulosomes, the composition of enzymes and their position on the hybrid scaffoldin can be strictly controlled. The design of these chimeric components allowed the investigation of an apparent paradox: the action of cellulosomes on crystalline cellulose is catalytically efficient, whereas their individual enzymatic components display relatively low activity (5.Fierobe H.P. Bayer E.A. Tardif C. Czjzek M. Mechaly A. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49621-49630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The incorporation of the enzyme pairs into the chimeric minicellulosomes were shown to induce a drastic increase in activity toward recalcitrant celluloses. The increased activity was shown to reflect two separate but complementary phenomena: (i) targeting to the substrate by virtue of the scaffoldin-borne CBM and (ii) enhanced synergy due to the proximity of the complementary enzymes in the complex (5.Fierobe H.P. Bayer E.A. Tardif C. Czjzek M. Mechaly A. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49621-49630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Recent advances provided the first clues to the mechanisms of complexation of cellulases onto the scaffoldin. Notably, the first crystal structure of a cohesin-dockerin complex derived from C. thermocellum was solved, providing valuable information on the interacting residues in both modules (7.Carvalho A.L. Dias F.M. Prates J.A. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Ferreira L.M. Romao M.J. Fontes C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13809-13814Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). That report also provided the first direct insight on the atomic level into the species specificity of the interaction observed between C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum. To gain structural information at a higher level of organization, the solution structures of both full-length enzymes and their assemblies with the cognate cohesins were subsequently established using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) (8.Hammel M. Fierobe H.P. Czjzek M. Finet S. Receveur-Brechot V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55985-55994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The data showed that large conformational changes occur upon complexation of the enzymes. It was observed that the linker connecting the catalytic module with the dockerin adopts an extended conformation in the free state but is pleated when the dockerin is bound to the cognate cohesin, thus restricting the overall flexibility (8.Hammel M. Fierobe H.P. Czjzek M. Finet S. Receveur-Brechot V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55985-55994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Despite these recent advances, the mechanisms by which enhanced synergistic activity occurs between the catalytic subunits within the complex remain obscure at the molecular level. In the present study, we examined cellulosome-like assemblies of higher complexity to gain further insight into the mechanism by which the cellulosomes enhance activity on recalcitrant substrates. For this purpose, a hybrid scaffoldin (S4) bearing a pair of divergent cohesins from C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum was combined with one or two enzymes, each of which contained a dockerin of appropriate specificity. The different complexes thus obtained were examined using a combination of SAXS with rigid body modeling to investigate their structural properties in solution. This approach is original in that it provides structural information on molecules exhibiting intrinsic disorder, flexibility, or heterogeneity (see Ref. 9.Svergun D.I. Koch M.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar for a review). The three-dimensional arrangements of the chimeric cellulosome-like constructs in the free and complexed states were investigated through the atomic models restored from the SAXS data. The physiological implications of these structural data toward the mechanism of cellulosome formation and their remarkable synergistic properties are discussed. Preparation of Protein Samples for SAXS—The production and purification of the different components (the chimeric scaffoldin S4 that contains a C. cellulolyticum cohesin fused to a C. thermocellum cohesin, the C. cellulolyticum cellulase Cel48F appended with either its native C. cellulolyticum dockerin or a C. thermocellum dockerin, and Cel5A appended with a C. thermocellum dockerin) were described previously (5.Fierobe H.P. Bayer E.A. Tardif C. Czjzek M. Mechaly A. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49621-49630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These three cellulase constructs are termed hereafter Fc, Ft, and At respectively. The concentration of the purified proteins was estimated by quantitative amino acid analysis on a Beckman 6300 system (Fullerton, CA) using ninhydrin detection. All protein samples were prepared by dilution of the protein solutions to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml in 9.2 mm Tris-HCl, 1.84 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, 5% (v/v) glycerol. Fc-S4 was prepared by mixing stoichiometric amounts of S4 with Cel48F appended with a C. cellulolyticum dockerin. Fc-S4-Ft and Fc-S4-At were prepared by mixing stoichiometric amounts of Fc-S4 with Cel48F or Cel5A, respectively, appended with a C. thermocellum dockerin, in the same buffer and at the final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. Total complexation was checked by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a Phast system apparatus (Phast gel gradient 4-15%; Amersham Biosciences). Immediately before measurement, protein samples were filtered through a Millex Microfilter membrane (pore size 0.22 μm) to eliminate large aggregates. SAXS Experiments—SAXS experiments were performed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) on beamline ID02 as described previously (8.Hammel M. Fierobe H.P. Czjzek M. Finet S. Receveur-Brechot V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55985-55994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The wavelength λ was 1.0 Å. The sample-to-detector distances were set at 4.0 and 1.0 m, resulting in scattering vectors, q ranging from 0.010 Å-1 to 0.15 Å-1 and 0.03 Å-1 to 0.46 Å-1, respectively. The scattering vector is defined as q = 4π/λ sinθ, where 2θ is the scattering angle. All experiments were performed at 20 °C. The data acquired at both sample-to-detector distances of 4 and 1 m were merged for the calculations using the entire scattering spectrum. Data Evaluation—The experimental SAXS data for all samples were linear in a Guinier plot of the low q region, indicating that the proteins did not undergo aggregation. The radius of gyration RG was derived by the Guinier approximation I(q) = I(0) exp(-q2RG2/3) for qRG < 1.0. The radii of gyration RG, calculated for different protein concentrations, displayed a slight concentration dependence arising from particle interferences in solution. Interference-free SAXS profiles were estimated by extrapolating the measured scattering curves to infinite dilution. The programs GNOM (10.Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2971) Google Scholar) and GIFT (11.Bergmann A. Fritz G. Glatter O. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 1212-1216Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar) were used to compute the pair-distance distribution functions, P(r). This approach also features the maximum dimension of the macromolecule, Dmax. Ab Initio Modeling—The overall shapes of the entire assemblies were restored from the experimental data using the program GASBOR (12.Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). The scattering profiles were fitted up to a qmax = 0.46 Å-1. GASBOR searches a chain-compatible spatial distribution of an exact number of dummy residues, centered on the Cα atoms of the protein amino acid residues. Five low resolution models obtained from different runs were averaged using the program DAMAVER (13.Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1618) Google Scholar) to construct the average model representing the general structural features of each reconstruction. The program package CREDO (14.Petoukhov M.V. Eady N.A. Brown K.A. Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3113-3125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was used to add missing domains (from 250 residues for S4 to 910 residues for Fc-S4-Ft) by fixing the known atomic structures and building the unknown regions to fit the experimental scattering data obtained from the entire particle. This procedure was applied in all cases to restore the low resolution shapes of missing linker regions. Atomic Model of the Entire Assemblies—The atomic structures of the individual modules were then positioned into the low resolution model obtained by CREDO using the program SUPCOMB (15.Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates of the missing linkers between the modules were modeled using the program TURBO (16.Roussel A. Cambillau C. Committee S.G. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar). These atomic models were used as templates for the rigid body modeling. Rigid Body Modeling—The program CHARMM, version 28.b1 (17.Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13969) Google Scholar), with the all-atom CHARMM force field version 22.0 (18.MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L. Evenseck J.D. Field M.J.

The atomic models obtained from the modeling described above were taken as the starting point of the simulations. In all cases, only the atoms of the scaffoldin linker were allowed to move relative to each other, while the modules at the extremities of each assembly (namely the cohesins in S4, the Cel48F-cohesin complex and second cohesin in Fc-S4, both Cel48F-cohesin complexes in Fc-S4-Ft, and Cel48F-cohesin and Cel5A-cohesin complexes in Fc-S4-At) were treated as rigid bodies, with no internal motion. The adequacy of the crystal structure to the solution structure of the isolated domains (8.Hammel M. Fierobe H.P. Czjzek M. Finet S. Receveur-Brechot V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55985-55994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) indeed indicates that the amplitude of their internal motions is not detected by SAXS and that the globular domains can be considered as rigid bodies. The simulations were performed in implicit solvent represented by setting the relative dielectric constant to 80.0. A time step of 1 fs was employed for MD simulation. All simulations were performed with the following protocol. The system was subjected to energy minimization with harmonic constraints on the protein atoms, followed by 30 ps of MD heating up to 1500 K, keeping the protein atoms fixed. During the subsequent “production phase” (7.5 ns), the resulting structures of the protein were recorded every 0.5 ps in a trajectory file. For each registered conformation the theoretical SAXS profile, the RG, and the corresponding fit to the experimental data were calculated using the program CRYSOL (19.Svergun D. Baraberato C. Koch M.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2778) Google Scholar). Overall SAXS Parameters—The properties of the solution structure of the chimeric scaffoldin (S4) in the free state were compared with those of the following artificial complexes (minicellulosomes): i) a binary complex Fc-S4, composed of S4 and cellulase Cel48F, appended with a C. cellulolyticum dockerin (Fc); ii) a ternary complex Fc-S4-Ft, comprising S4 and two identical cellulases: Cel48F, appended with either a C. cellulolyticum (Fc) or a C. thermocellum dockerin (Ft); and iii) a ternary complex Fc-S4-At, comprising S4 and two different cellulases, Cel48F appended with a C. cellulolyticum dockerin (Fc) and Cel5A appended with a C. thermocellum dockerin (At). To extract the RG values of the minicellulosomes, we determined interference-free SAXS profiles by extrapolating the measured scattering curves to infinite dilution. Fig. 1A displays the final scattering profiles of all assemblies, and TABLE ONE presents the RG computed from these data. The values of the radius of gyration RG increase significantly from S4 to Fc-S4-Ft and correlate well with the molecular masses of each sample. However, we obtained a higher value of RG = 64.9 ± 0.7 for the minicellulosome Fc-S4-At (167 kDa) than that of the heavier Fc-S4-Ft (196 kDa, RG = 61.4 ± 1.1), indicating that Fc-S4-At is more anisotropic.TABLE ONEStructural parameters of minicellulosome constructs obtained by SAXSSampleMolecular massaPredicted from the sequenceRGbRG and RGmodel, radius of gyration given by the Guinier approximation and calculated for the three best fitting models using the program CRYSOLDmaxcDmax and Dmaxmodel, the averaged experimental maximum diameters and those calculated from the three best fit atomic modelsAb initio modelingRigid body modelingχ(GASBOR)dχ(GASB), χ(CRED), and χ(model), discrepancies between the experimental SAXS profile and the respective fits for the overall shapes-models calculated by the program GASBOR, the fits calculated for the partial models restored by the program CREDO, and the average discrepancy of the three-best atomic models.

The P(r) function for all constructs exhibited extended profiles for the higher distances, indicating that the different modules do not fold over themselves but adopt an extended conformation with respect to each other rather than a globular compact one. The long tailing of the P(r) function of Fc-S4-At led to a greater Dmax value, further supporting the structural anisotropy of this assembly. Low Resolution Shapes from Ab Initio Modeling—Overall shapes of the entire assemblies were restored from the SAXS profiles using the program Gasbor (12.Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Single models with similar quality of fit showed slight variations between independent runs (Fig. 1A and TABLE ONE). However, average shapes calculated from repeated, multiple modeling processes (Fig. 2A) decrease the risk of inferring an erroneous low resolution structure. The average shapes of all protein samples display elongated conformations with direct correlation between the number of modules and the length of the model. This further confirms the linear arrangement of the individual modules with respect to each other. In the average shape of S4, two globular regions correspond to the two cohesin modules, and the connecting linker displays a rather extended conformation (Fig. 2A). The average shape of Fc-S4 is significantly stretched, revealing two globular units on one side connected to an extended branch on the opposite extremity. According to the low resolution shape revealed by our previous study of the Cel48F-cohesin complex (8.Hammel M. Fierobe H.P. Czjzek M. Finet S. Receveur-Brechot V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55985-55994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we can deduce that the globular units represent the catalytic module Cel48F and its cohesin-dockerin complex, whereas the extended branch can be associated with the free cohesin and its linker region. Similarly, the average shapes of the ternary complexes, Fc-S4-Ft and Fc-S4-At, display two globular units representing the catalytic module and its cohesin-dockerin complex. The opposite extremities of the overall shapes are less featured, and the position of the second enzyme and its cohesin-dockerin complex could not be distinguished. This effect probably arises from the high flexibility of the protein. The putative structural flexibility of the complexes prompted us to apply a second modeling approach (CREDO) (14.Petoukhov M.V. Eady N.A. Brown K.A. Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3113-3125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), in which we calculated the low resolution shapes of the missing region by fixing the elements of known atomic structures and fitting the SAXS profile of the entire set of proteins. It should be noted that neither the orientation nor the position of the partial shapes was taken into account during the computations. The shapes obtained by this strategy displayed the relative position of each module in the entire assembly and led to an excellent fit of the experimental data (Fig. 1A and TABLE ONE). To model the free scaffoldin (S4), the crystal structure of the first cohesin from C. cellulolyticum was fixed, whereas the second cohesin and the linker region were restored. In the typical shapes presented in Fig. 2B, one can clearly distinguish between the globular form of the second cohesin and the extended linker region. For Fc-S4, the atomic model of Cel48F in complex with the cohesin (8.Hammel M. Fierobe H.P. Czjzek M. Finet S. Receveur-Brechot V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55985-55994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was used as the starting point to calculate the shape of the scaffoldin and the linker region. The determined shape exhibited an extended arrangement, suggesting a stretched, flexible conformation of the scaffoldin linker. Finally, we reconstructed the low resolution shapes of the missing region in the minicellulosomes (Fc-S4-Ft and Fc-S4-At). For this purpose, the atomic structure of Cel48F in complex with the cohesin of C. cellulolyticum was fixed, and the rest of the complex was then modeled. The most typical shape, shown in Fig. 2B, was superimposed with the crystal structures of the missing modules. As shown by the Cα trace (Fig. 2B), the resulting atomic model indicates that the scaffoldin of Fc-S4-Ft adopts a comparatively compact structure. In contrast, in Fc-S4-At the scaffoldin remains extended. In conclusion, the models clearly suggest a high flexibility of the scaffoldin linker that typifies the overall conformation of minicellulosomes and further supports a higher level of structural anisotropy of Fc-S4-At compared with Fc-S4-Ft. Considering the high flexibility of the complexes, the observed scattering curves are produced by all the different conformations the protein can adopt in solution. The conformational space explored by the proteins increases with the overall length of the linker. Therefore, it is not possible to describe the scattering curve of the minicellulosomes by one single conformation, and the observed low resolution shapes, shown in Fig. 2A, only represent the average of the probable conformational space attained (20.Hammel M. Walther M. Prassl R. Kuhn H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consequently, we employed molecular modeling on the scaffoldin linker to determine the conformational distribution of the minicellulosome that best matches the experimental data. Atomic Models Derived from Rigid Body Modeling—MD is widely used for exploring conformational space. A common strategy is to perform the simulation at very high temperature (∼1500 K); the additional kinetic energy prevents the molecule from becoming trapped in a local minimum (21.Leach A.R. Hall P. Molecular Modelling; Principles and Applications. 2nd Ed. Pearson Education, Harlow, UK2001: 457-508Google Scholar). Different conformations of the protein are produced at regular intervals along the trajectory of subsequent calculations of the theoretical SAXS profiles. The comparison of the MD-generated SAXS prof"

NF-κB counteracts TGF-β1-induced apoptosis through up-regulation of downstream target genes, such as XIAP and Bcl-XL, which in turn inhibit the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. In addition, induction of NF-κB by TGF-β1 inhibits JNK signaling, thereby attenuating TGF-β1-induced cell death of normal hepatocytes. However, the mechanism involved in the negative cross-talk between the NF-κB and JNK pathways during TGF-β1 signaling has not been determined. In this study, we have identified the XIAP gene as one of the critical mediators of NF-κB-mediated suppression of JNK signaling. We show that NF-κB plays a role in the up-regulation of XIAP gene expression in response to TGF-β1 treatment and forms a TGF-β1-inducible complex with TAK1. Furthermore, we show that the RING domain of XIAP mediates TAK1 polyubiquitination, which then targets this molecule for proteosomal degradation. Down-regulation of TAK1 protein expression inhibits TGF-β1-mediated activation of JNK and apoptosis. Conversely, silencing of XIAP promotes persistent JNK activation and potentiates TGF-β1-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our findings identify a novel mechanism for the regulation of JNK activity by NF-κB during TGF-β1 signaling and raise the possibility that pharmacologic inhibition of the NF-κB/XIAP signaling pathway might selectively abolish the pro-oncogenic activity of TGF-β1 in advanced hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) without affecting the pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-β1 involved in normal liver homeostasis.

Mead J.E. Gruppuso P.A. Braun L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 593: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 inhibits the proliferation of normal hepatocytes in cell culture, after partial hepatectomy, and is a potent inducer of hepatic cell death both in vitro and in vivo (2.Oberhammer F. Bursch W. Parzefall W. Breit P. Erber E. Stadler M. Schulte-Hermann R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2478-2485PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Oberhammer F. Bursch W. Tiefenbacher R. Froschl G. Pavelka M. Purchio T. Schulte-Hermann R. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1238-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 can signal through intracellular mediators known as Smads, which are localized in the cytoplasm (4.Attisano L. Tuen Lee-Hoeflich S. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 3010.1-3010.8Crossref Google Scholar). Following TGF-β1 receptor (TβRI)-mediated phosphorylation, Smad2 and Smad3 associate as heteromeric complexes with the common signaling mediator Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus to regulate gene expression. The inhibitory Smad7 competes for binding with Smad2 and Smad3 to the activated TGF-β1 receptor and promotes ubiquitin-mediated receptor degradation, thereby suppressing TGF-β1 signaling (4.Attisano L. Tuen Lee-Hoeflich S. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 3010.1-3010.8Crossref Google Scholar). TGF-β1 promotes growth arrest through the induction of both the CDK inhibitors p15INK4B and p21CIP1 and the inhibition of genes that regulate cell cycle progression such as c-myc, CDC25A, and CDK6 (5.Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, CDK4 and CDK2 can impair TGF-β1 signaling through direct phosphorylation of Smad3 (6.Matsuura I. Denissova N.G. Wang G. He D. Long J. Liu F. Nature. 2004; 430: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 mRNA levels are scarcely expressed in normal rodent and human livers where they appear to be localized predominantly in oval cells during early stages of hepatocytic differentiation and in nonparenchymal cells (7.Nagy P. Evarts R.P. Marsden E. Roach J. Thorgeirsson S.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5522-5527PubMed Google Scholar). However, during liver neoplastic development, liver regeneration, and hepatic fibrosis, TGF-β1 is highly expressed in malignant hepatocytes (8.Bedossa P. Peltier E. Terris B. Franco D. Poynard T. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 760-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in nontumorous mesenchymal cells (9.Nagy P. Evarts R.P. McMahon J.B. Thorgeirsson S.S. Mol. Carcinog. 1989; 2: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this regard, TGF-β1 is thought to be one of the critical mediators of the epithelial-mesenchymal interaction that regulates development, growth, and neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells (10.Bhowmick N.A. Moses H.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Furthermore, autocrine activity of TGF-β1 can enhance the metastatic potential of advanced epithelial carcinomas (11.Roberts A.B. Wakefield L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8621-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 12.Yang Y.A. Dukhanina O. Tang B. Mamura M. Letterio J.J. MacGregor J. Patel S.C. Khozin S. Liu Z.Y. Green J. Anver M.R. Merlino G. Wakefield L.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The stage-dependent tumor-suppressing versus tumor-promoting activity of TGF-β1 is explained, in part, by the ability of epithelial cancer cells to acquire resistance to the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-β1 because of loss-of-function mutations within key components of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway or impaired secretion or activation of the latent TGF-β1 complex (1.Fausto N. Mead J.E. Gruppuso P.A. Braun L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 593: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, several tumors are resistant to the growth inhibitory action of TGF-β1 despite retaining an intact TGF-β1 signaling pathway (13.Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). Thus, a critical issue in cancer biology focuses on understanding how a cancer cell escapes from the growth inhibitory properties of TGF-β1. In the past, we have identified aberrant NF-κB activity as one of the crucial events that renders hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) resistant to TGF-β1-induced growth arrest and apoptosis (14.Arsura M. FitzGerald M.J. Fausto N. Sonenshein G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1049-1059PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Arsura M. Mercurio F. Oliver A.L. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5381-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16.Arsura M. Panta G.R. Bilyeu J.D. Cavin L.G. Sovak M.A. Oliver A.A. Factor V. Heuchel R. Mercurio F. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). NF-κB/Rel comprises a family of dimeric factors involved in the regulation of development, regeneration, and neoplastic transformation of the liver (17.Kucharczak J. Simmons M.J. Fan Y. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8961-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The canonical pathway of NF-κB activation applies to dimers composed of RelA, c-Rel and p50 subunits that, in non-stimulated cells, are sequestered in the cytoplasm through interaction with IκB-α. In response to microbial, viral infections, DNA damage, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, the IκB kinase (IKK) complex promotes NF-κB activation through phosphorylation-induced ubiquitination of IκB-α, which targets this molecule for proteolysis in the 26 S proteasome (18.Winston J.T. Strack P. Beer-Romero P. Chu C.Y. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The IKK complex is comprised of two catalytic subunits, IKK-α (IKK-1) and IKK-β (IKK-2) (19.Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar) as well as two scaffold components termed IKK-γ and ELKS (20.Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 21.Ducut Sigala J.L. Bottero V. Young D.B. Shevchenko A. Mercurio F. Verma I.M. Science. 2004; 304: 1963-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Our previous data indicated that constitutive activation of the IKK complex through the Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway plays an important role in hepatic oncogenesis (15.Arsura M. Mercurio F. Oliver A.L. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5381-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22.Factor V. Oliver A.L. Panta G.R. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Arsura M. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have found that the TAK1/IKK signaling pathway mediates the transient activation of NF-κB in response to TGF-β1 treatment of hepatocytes and fibroblasts (16.Arsura M. Panta G.R. Bilyeu J.D. Cavin L.G. Sovak M.A. Oliver A.A. Factor V. Heuchel R. Mercurio F. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which NF-κB contributes to liver tumor formation is, in part, caused by the transcriptional activation of prosurvival genes, which in turn oppose pro-apoptotic stimuli elicited by the host immune system. In this regard, we have shown that inhibition of NF-κB activity potentiates TGF-β1-induced apoptosis of immortalized hepatocytes (16.Arsura M. Panta G.R. Bilyeu J.D. Cavin L.G. Sovak M.A. Oliver A.A. Factor V. Heuchel R. Mercurio F. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23.Cavin L.G. Romieu-Mourez R. Panta G.R. Sun J. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Arsura M. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, adenoviral-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activity in murine HCCs promoted down-regulation of the prosurvival Bcl-XL and XIAP genes, thereby leading to pronounced cell killing of malignant hepatocytes by TNF-α and TGF-β1 (24.Cavin L.G. Venkatraman M. Factor V.M. Kaur S. Schroeder I. Mercurio F. Beg A.A. Thorgeirsson S.S. Arsura M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7030-7038Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previously, the induction of cell death by TGF-β1 has been linked to its ability to activate the JNK/AP-1 axis, which then cooperates with SMADs in inducing TGF-β1 responsive promoters of cell death-inducing genes (2.Oberhammer F. Bursch W. Parzefall W. Breit P. Erber E. Stadler M. Schulte-Hermann R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2478-2485PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Arsura M. FitzGerald M.J. Fausto N. Sonenshein G.E.

Given that the mechanism of sensitization of murine and human HCCs to TGF-β1-induced growth arrest and apoptosis following inhibition of NF-κB activity also relies on release of JNK activity (16.Arsura M. Panta G.R. Bilyeu J.D. Cavin L.G. Sovak M.A. Oliver A.A. Factor V. Heuchel R. Mercurio F. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), in this study we have examined the potential for the NF-κB downstream target gene XIAP to repress JNK activity. We show that XIAP physically interacts with TAK1 in a TGF-β1-inducible manner thereby promoting ubiquitin-mediated degradation of TAK1 and repression of the JNK/AP-1 axis. Collectively, these studies provide the conceptual framework for the future characterization of the IKK/JNK interplay in hepatic oncogenesis and illustrate a novel role of XIAP during protection from TGF-β1-induced apoptosis. Cell Culture and Treatment Conditions—Normal mouse hepatocyte (NMH) cells (28.Wu J.C. Merlino G. Cveklova K. Mosinger Jr., B. Fausto N. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5964-5973PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained as described previously (14.Arsura M. FitzGerald M.J. Fausto N. Sonenshein G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1049-1059PubMed Google Scholar). Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated from livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) by collagenase perfusion method. Livers were removed under Nembutal anesthesia (50 mg/ml) and were perfused in a perfusion chamber through the portal vein with calcium-free Krebs bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing collagenase and glucose. The livers were perfused at 37 °C with buffer gassed continuously with O2/CO2. After 30 min, the perfusate was collected in a beaker and minced with sterile scissors at 37 °C for 10 min. Digested liver was filtered through sterile mesh, and cells were separated from the debris by centrifugation. Cells were suspended in Williams E medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution and plated in a culture dish coated with rat tail collagen (Collaborative Biochemical Products, Bedford, MA). After 4 h, non-adherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were given the indicated treatments. Where indicated, cells were incubated either with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Austral Biological, San Ramon, CA) dissolved in 0.1% BSA or carrier BSA as control. HEK293 cells were grown in RPMI (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 was a kind gift from Celgene Corporation (San Diego, CA).

Cells were harvested after treatment according to the manufacturer's protocol in the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega), and lysates were analyzed with a Labsystems Luminoskan 96-well plate luminometer (Thermolab System, Needham Heights, MA). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized for Renilla luciferase activity, and results were expressed as a ratio (fold induction) of normalized luciferase activities in treated cells versus vehicle-treated cells. Significance (p < 0.01) was obtained using the Student's t test. Plasmids and Adenoviruses—The vectors directing expression of a dominant negative form of TAK1 (pFLAG-CMV-2-TAK1-K63W) and its wild-type counterpart (pFLAG-CMV-2-TAK1) (29.Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K.

The construct directing expression of a constitutively active form of IKK-2 (pCMV-IKK-EE) was a kind gift from Dr. Mercurio (Celgene). The histidine-tagged expression vectors, pCW7H6M-Ub, pCW8H6M-Ub, were a kind gift from Dr. Bohmann (32.Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The constructs directing expression of a constitutively active version of the TβR1 (T204D) (33.Wieser R. Wrana J.L.

The adenoviral vectors expressing GFP or a dominant negative form of IKK-2 (IKK-2 K>M) have been described previously (34.Panta G.R. Kaur S. Cavin L.G. Cortes M.L. Mercurio F. Lothstein L. Sweatman T.W. Israel M. Arsura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1823-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Virus stocks were amplified to high titer by Quantum Biotechnologies (Montreal, Canada). The concentration of viral particles (VP) was determined as described previously (34.Panta G.R. Kaur S.

RNA Interference—The SMARTpool™ siRNA specific for murine XIAP and scrambled siRNA control were purchased from Upstate Group (Lake Placid, NY) and were transfected (50–100 nm) into NMH cells according to the manufacturer's specifications using Lipofectamine™ 2000. Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 or BSA-carrier solution for the indicated times. XIAP protein expression was determined by immunoblot analysis as described below using an antibody against XIAP (AAM-050, Stressgen, San Diego, CA). RNA Isolation and Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidinium method following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) and samples (1 μg) subjected to semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Bands were quantified by densitometric analysis and are expressed in arbitrary units as the ratio of the optical density (OD) of XIAP to that of the GAPDH. The sequence of the primers specific for murine XIAP were as follows: mXIAP forward: 5′-ATGACTTTTAACAGTTTTGAAGGAACT-3′, mXIAP reverse: 5′-GAAGCACTTCACTTTATCGCCT-3′. To amplify the mouse GAPDH gene, we used the EZ-GENXpress™ normalized gene expression kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Maxim Biotech, Inc., San Francisco, CA). Immunoblot Analysis and Kinase Assay—For isolation of whole cell extracts (WCEs), cells were resuspended in cold lysis buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), 300 μm Na3V04, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and sheared by sonication. Extracts were then cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples (20–40 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotting performed as described previously (35.Arsura M. Wu M. Sonenshein G.E.

The GST-Jun substrate was purchased from Upstate Group. The GST-MKK4/7 was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The kinase reaction was stopped by addition of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and visualized by autoradiography. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—NMH cells were plated in p100 Petri dishes and were transfected using Lipofectamine™ 2000 with 7 μg of pFLAG-CMV-2-TAK1 construct in the presence or absence of 7 μg of pCW7-H6M-Ub or pCW8-H6M-Ub, with or without 7 μg of pCS3-MT-XIAP, pCS3-XIAP-ΔBIR, or pCS3-XIAP-ΔRING. Three hours after transfection, 20 μm MG132 were added to the culture medium. After 24 h, cells were harvested in lysis buffer and WCEs (300 μg) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (F-7425) (Sigma-Aldrich) or mouse IgG control (Upstate Group) and subjected to immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Min Wu, Novartis). Equal immunoprecipitated aliquots were also subjected to immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (F-4042) (Sigma-Aldrich). TUNEL and Caspase-3 Assays—TUNEL assay was performed on cultures of live cells using the DeadEnd™ Colorimetric TUNEL System (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions as we have described previously (24.Cavin L.G. Venkatraman M. Factor V.M. Kaur S. Schroeder I. Mercurio F. Beg A.A. Thorgeirsson S.S. Arsura M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7030-7038Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For the caspase-3 assay, NMH cells were seeded in p35 Petri dishes and were given a pretreatment with 10 μm SP600125 for 30 min or with 5 μm JIP-1 for 3 h followed by treatment with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 48 h. After 24–48 h, the cells were washed with cold 1× PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer. The lysates were sheared through sonication and centrifuged to obtain the supernatants. Cell extracts (100 μg) were subjected to caspase-3 assay using the CaspAce colorimetric assay kit (Promega). JNK Activity Is Required for TGF-β1-induced Apoptosis of Immortalized NMH—To assess the role of JNKs in TGF-β1 cell killing of hepatocytes, we treated NMH cells, which undergo apoptosis after 16–24 h of TGF-β1 treatment (14.Arsura M. FitzGerald M.J. Fausto N. Sonenshein G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1049-1059PubMed Google Scholar) with various doses of the small molecule inhibitor of JNK SP600125 and assessed c-Jun phosphorylation and cell death following TGF-β1 treatment. At a concentration of 10 μm, SP600125 significantly reduced c-Jun phosphorylation in NMH cells treated for 3 h with TGF-β1 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, incubation of NMH cells with 10 μm SP600125 reduced significantly cell death following 24 or 48 h of TGF-β1 treatment, as measured by TUNEL staining and enzymatic activity of caspase-3 (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, ectopic expression of a constitutively active JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein (36.Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D) promoted enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun (bottom panel) and apoptotic cell death (top panel) in the absence of TGF-β1 stimulation. Lastly, ectopic expression of the JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein potentiated TGF-β1-driven apoptosis (Fig. 1D, top panel). To further assess the role of JNK activity in TGF-β1 cell killing, we employed the JNK inhibitor 1 (d-stereoisomer) JIP-1 (37.Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Incubation of NMH cells with 5 μm JIP-1, led to inhibition of c-Jun phosphorylation but not Smad2 in TGF-β1-treated NMH cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore JIP-1-treated NMH cells failed to undergo apoptosis, as judged by TUNEL staining and enzymatic activity of caspase-3 (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, active JNKs play a role in TGF-β1 cell killing of hepatocytes. Inhibition of NF-κB Activity Potentiates TGF-β1 Cell Killing of NMH Cells through the JNK-AP-1 Axis—Our previous findings indicated that the early transient activation of NF-κB seen in TGF-β1-treated hepatocytes was opposing TGF-β1-induced apoptosis through inhibition of JNK signaling (16.Arsura M. Panta G.R. Bilyeu J.D. Cavin L.G. Sovak M.A. Oliver A.A. Factor V. Heuchel R. Mercurio F. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed a more pronounced and persistent phosphorylation of c-Jun in IKK-2 K>M than GFP-expressing NMH cells (Fig. 3A). This effect was specific for the JNK pathway, because ectopic expression of the IKK-2 K>M did not affect the levels of Smad2 phosphorylation following TGF-β1 stimulation (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, IKK-2 K>M-expressing cells displayed a marked increase in cell death compared with that of GFP-transfected cells, which was blunted in SP600125-treated hepatocytes (Fig. 3C). Thus, JNK signaling is required for the potentiation of TGF-β1 cell killing via NF-κB inhibition. As XIAP is a known downstream target of NF-κB (38.Stehlik C. de Martin R. Kumabashiri I. Schmid J.A. Binder B.R. Lipp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) and because our previous data showed that ectopic expression of XIAP rescued NMH cells from TGF-β1-induced apoptosis (16.Arsura M. Panta G.R. Bilyeu J.D. Cavin L.G. Sovak M.A. Oliver A.A. Factor V. Heuchel R. Mercurio F. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the regulation and role of XIAP gene expression during TGF-β1 signaling. We observed induction of XIAP mRNA expression after 1 h of TGF-β1 treatment that remained elevated for up to 6 h, as judged by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, ectopic expression of IKK-2 K>M inhibited TGF-β1-mediated up-regulation of XIAP gene expression (Fig. 4B). Likewise, we observed up-regulation of XIAP protein expression in response to TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 4C) that was blocked by ectopic expression of IKK-2 K>M (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, ectopic expression of a constitutively active mutant IKK-2 S176E/S180E (IKK-2 EE) led to up-regulation of XIAP protein levels (∼3-fold), indicating that XIAP is a downstream target of NF-κB (Fig. 4E). Given that JNKs are required for TGF-β1-mediated apoptosi"
https://openalex.org/W2011813310,"Nuclear localization and high levels of the Y-box-binding protein YB1 appear to be important indicators of drug resistance and tumor prognosis. YB1 also interacts with the p53 tumor suppressor protein. In this paper, we have continued to explore YB1/p53 interactions. We report that transcriptionally active p53 is required for nuclear localization of YB1. We go on to show that nuclear YB1 regulates p53 function. Our data demonstrate that YB1 inhibits the ability of p53 to cause cell death and to transactivate cell death genes, but does not interfere with the ability of p53 to transactivate the CDKN1A gene, encoding the kinase p21WAF1/CIP1 required for cell cycle arrest, nor the MDM2 gene. We also show that nuclear YB1 is associated with a failure to increase the level of the Bax protein in normal mammary epithelial cells after stress activation of p53. Together these data suggest that (nuclear) YB1 selectively alters p53 activity, which may in part provide an explanation for the correlation of nuclear YB1 with drug resistance and poor tumor prognosis."

https://openalex.org/W2152804246,"HIV-1 has maximized its utilization of syndecans. It uses them as in cis receptors to infect macrophages and as in trans receptors to infect T-lymphocytes. In this study, we investigated at a molecular level the mechanisms that control HIV-1-syndecan interactions. We found that a single conserved arginine (Arg-298) in the V3 region of gp120 governs HIV-1 binding to syndecans. We found that an amine group on the side chain of this residue is necessary for syndecan utilization by HIV-1. Furthermore, we showed that HIV-1 binds syndecans via a 6-O sulfation, demonstrating that this binding is not the result of random interactions between basic residues and negative charges, but the result of specific contacts between gp120 and a well defined sulfation in syndecans. Surprisingly, we found that Arg-298, which mediates HIV-1 binding to syndecans, also mediates HIV-1 binding to CCR5. We postulated that HIV-1 recognizes similar motifs on syndecans and CCR5. Supporting this hypothesis, we obtained several lines of evidence that suggest that the 6-O sulfation recognized by HIV-1 on syndecans mimics the sulfated tyrosines recognized by HIV-1 in the N terminus of CCR5. Our finding that CCR5 and syndecans are exploited by HIV-1 via a single determinant echoes the mechanisms by which chemokines utilize these two disparate receptors and suggests that the gp120/chemokine mimicry may represent a common strategy in microbial pathogenesis.

Syndecans are transmembrane receptors highly expressed on adherent cells (i.e. epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages), but poorly expressed on suspension cells (i.e. T-lymphocytes) (1Saphire A.C.

Virology. 2004; 325: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The syndecan family is composed of four members, syndecan-1 to -4. Their ectodomain bears linear heparan sulfate chains, which are composed of a repetition (30-400 repeats) of a sulfated disaccharide motif (5Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The sulfation pattern of the heparan sulfates dictates the ligand specificity of syndecans. Syndecans via their heparan sulfates function as co-factors in cell-cell adhesion, in linking cells to ligands in the extracellular matrix, and in the binding and activation of cellular growth factors (5Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Syndecans also function as receptors for HIV-1. We and others demonstrated that pretreatment of HIV-1 target cells (i.e. CD4+ T cell lines, CD4+ HeLa cells, and CD4+ CHO cells or macrophages) with heparinase, an enzyme that removes heparan sulfates from the ectodomain of syndecans, significantly reduces HIV-1 infectivity (1Saphire A.C.

Virol. 2002; 76: 6332-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), using CHO cells that either express HSPGs (CHO-K1) or lack HSPGs (pgsA745), obtained evidence that HSPGs favor HIV-1 infection in a gp120-dependent manner. Previous work suggests that the requirement for syndecans and HSPGs in HIV-1 infection is particularly accentuated when target cells express low levels of entry receptors (CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4) such as CD4+ HeLa cells and macrophages (1Saphire A.C. Bobardt M.D. Zhang Z. David G. Gallay P.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9187-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, why and how HIV-1 uses sulfated syndecans to optimally infect these target cells remain to be understood. More interestingly, syndecans also serve as in trans receptors for HIV-1. Specifically, HIV-1 binds syndecans richly expressed on the endothelium (2Bobardt M.D. Saphire A.C. Hung H.C. Yu X. Van der Schueren B. Zhang Z. David G Gallay P.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). HIV-1 bound to syndecans remains infectious for a week, whereas cell-free virus loses its infectivity after a single day (2Bobardt M.D. Saphire A.C. Hung H.C. Yu X. Van der Schueren B. Zhang Z. David G Gallay P.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Most importantly, HIV-1 attached onto the endothelium via syndecans represents an in trans source of infection for circulating T cells (2Bobardt M.D. Saphire A.C. Hung H.C. Yu X. Van der Schueren B. Zhang Z. David G Gallay P.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Moreover, endothelial syndecans enhance HIV-1 replication in T cells via a yet uncharacterized mechanism (2Bobardt M.D. Saphire A.C. Hung H.C. Yu X. Van der Schueren B. Zhang Z. David G Gallay P.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that syndecan-rich endothelium can provide a microenvironment that amplifies HIV-1 replication in T cells. Lastly, syndecans and HSPGs on brain microvascular endothelial cells play a significant role in HIV-1 transmigration through the blood-brain barrier (3Bobardt M.D. Salmon P. Wang L. Esko J.D.

Altogether these observations suggest that syndecans, by acting as in cis and in trans receptors on different cells and tissues, may profoundly impact HIV-1 pathogenesis.

Recombinant gp120 Proteins—Fc-gp120 was constructed by fusing the IgG1 Fc domain N-terminal to gp120 JR-CSF. A series of Fc-gp120 were modified to remove variable loop domains: ΔV1/V2 (Δ125-194 with a GSG linker), ΔV3 (Δ294-328 with a GSGG linker), or ΔV1/ V2/V3 core (Δ125-194 plus Δ294-328). A series of Fc-gp120 mutants in which the charged residues of the V3 were substituted with alanines was also constructed and produced as described previously (13Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A.

Intrinsic CD Spectroscopy—CD measurements were made with Aviv 62DS/720 CD spectrophotometer. Far UV spectra were recorded from 200 to 260 nm at 25 °C with a 0.1-cm path length cell. The protein concentration for all samples was adjusted to 5 μm. Spectra were collected at a scan speed of 3 nm/s and with a response time of 1 s. Each spectrum was derived from an average of 3 scans. For calculation of mean residue ellipticity (θ) the molecular weight of the proteins was determined as glycosylated species (76187.50 for wt, 73496.69 for V3R2, and 73581.80 for R298A). The data were expressed as mean residue ellipticity, θ, in deg cm2 dmol-1, which is defined as: θ = θobs (mdeg)/10nlc. Where θobs is the CD in mill degrees, n is the number of amino acid residues; l is the path length of the cell, and c is the concentration of the protein in moles. gp120 Binding Assay—Cells (0.25 × 106 cells) were incubated with Fc-gp120 (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C.

The V3 Region of gp120 Contains the Syndecan-binding Site for HIV-1—We asked if gp120 serves as the main ligand for HIV-1 binding to syndecans. We created a panel of cell lines expressing each syndecan member (syndecan-1 to -4) (2Bobardt M.D. Saphire A.C. Hung H.C. Yu X. Van der Schueren B. Zhang Z. David G Gallay P.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Human Namalwa B cells were chosen as parental cells, because they natively express no candidate gp120 receptors such as CD4, CCR5, HSPGs, and DC-SIGN. As positive controls, we created two additional cell lines expressing receptors known to bind gp120, CD4, and DC-SIGN. We verified by quantitative FACS analysis that these cell lines express similar amounts of gp120 receptors as described previously (2Bobardt M.D. Saphire A.C. Hung H.C. Yu X. Van der Schueren B. Zhang Z. David G Gallay P.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recombinant Fc-gp120 JR-CSF (gp120 derived from the primary R5 isolate JR-CSF fused to human Fc IgG1) binds both CD4 and DC-SIGN, but fails to bind parental cells (Fig. 1A). Importantly, Fc-gp120 binds all four syndecans, whereas Fc alone does not (Fig. 1A). Heparinase, which removes all heparan sulfates but preserves the integrity of the core protein (2Bobardt M.D. Saphire A.C. Hung H.C. Yu X. Van der Schueren B. Zhang Z. David G Gallay P.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), abolishes gp120 binding to syndecans, but not to CD4 and DC-SIGN (Fig. 1A). Thus, gp120 alone possesses the capacity to bind syndecans, and this interaction is mediated by the heparan sulfates of syndecans. After demonstrating that gp120 alone binds syndecans, we searched for domains in gp120 necessary for this interaction. We generated gp120 proteins deleted for specific domains and tested their capacities to bind syndecans. gp120 deleted for its two variable regions V1 and V2 still binds syndecans (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the V3-deleted as well as the V1/V2/V3-deleted gp120 fail to bind syndecans but still bind CD4 and DC-SIGN, suggesting that V3 is critical for gp120-syndecan interactions. We next asked whether V3 in context of whole virus also plays a critical role in syndecan utilization. We examined if antibodies directed against V3 interfere with HIV-1-syndecan interactions.

The residues recognized by the inhibitory anti-V3 257-D IgG1 antibody (27Purtscher M. Trkola A. Gruber G. Buchacher A. Predl R. Steindl F. Tauer C. Berger R. Barrett N. Jungbauer A. Katinger H. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) are located in the N-terminal β-strand of V3 (epitope KRIHI), whereas those recognized by the non-inhibitory anti-V3 268-D IgG1 are located at the GPG tip of V3 (epitope HIGPGR) (29Gorny M.K. Xu J.Y. Karwowska S. Buchbinder A. Zolla-Pazner S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 635-643PubMed Google Scholar). This may suggest that the residues responsible for HIV binding to syndecans reside near the N terminus of V3. To more definitely demonstrate that V3, in the context of whole virus, is necessary for HIV-1 binding to syndecans, we examined the capacity of a virus deleted for V3 to bind syndecans. The virus deleted for gp160 (NL4.3 Δgp160) binds syndecans poorly compared with wild-type (NL4.3) virus, suggesting that gp120/gp41 mediates HIV-1 binding to syndecans. Furthermore, the V3-deleted virus (ΔV3 HXB) lost its capacity to bind to syndecans compared with wild-type (HXB) or V1/V2-deleted (ΔV1/V2 HXB) viruses (Fig. 1D, top panel). However, the V3-deleted virus kept its capacity to bind DC-SIGN and CD4 (Fig. 1D, middle and bottom panels), suggesting that the syndecan-binding site in gp120 does not overlap with CD4- and DC-SIGN-binding sites. Moreover, heparinase treatment of the cells impaired the ability of HIV-1 to bind syndecans (Fig. 1D), indicating that the heparan sulfates contain the motifs necessary for HIV-1 capture. Thus, our data demonstrate that V3 serves as the major locus for HIV-1 binding to syndecans and that this binding occurs via the sulfated heparans of syndecans. A Single Highly Conserved Arginine Located at the Base of the V3 Region Is Necessary for gp120 Binding to Syndecans—We then examined if specific residues in V3 govern syndecan recognition by HIV-1. We tested a panel of HIV-1 for their capacities to bind syndecans as described previously (2Bobardt M.D. Saphire A.C. Hung H.C. Yu X. Van der Schueren B. Zhang Z. David G Gallay P.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), hoping to identify specific motifs in V3 that would correlate with their capacities to bind syndecans. However, we did not observe an obvious correlation between the capacities of viruses to bind syndecans and their co-receptor usage or gp120 subtype (Fig. 2A). Syndecans capture chemokines and growth factors via contacts between their heparan sulfates and basic consensus sequences within the ligand (5Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Thus, we also examined if a correlation exists between the number of basic residues within V3 and the capacity of the virus to bind syndecans. Surprisingly, again, no obvious correlation was observed. For example, viruses containing only five basic residues in V3 (i.e. JR-CSF and 93IN101) bind syndecans as well as viruses containing eight or nine basic residues (i.e. HXB2 and MN) (Fig. 2A). However, our observation that all viruses bind more efficiently to syndecan-expressing cells than to parental cells suggests that all HIV-1 contain intrinsic capacities to bind syndecans. We thus postulated that a few residues in V3 are necessary and sufficient to mediate HIV-1-syndecan interactions. First, we asked if the basic residues of V3 are important for HIV-1 binding to syndecans. We substituted the five basic residues of V3 of JR-CSF in Fc-gp120, and tested the resulting mutant protein for its capacity to bind syndecans. The five basic residues Arg-298, Arg-304, Lys305, Arg-308, and Arg-326 were replaced by alanines (called RRKRR/AAAAA). Fc-gp120 RRKRR/AAAAA binds syndecans poorly, but binds to CD4 and DC-SIGN well (Fig. 2B). To identify which of these basic residues are critical for HIV-1-syndecan interactions, we tested V3 peptides, which encompass V3, for their capacities to prevent HIV-1 binding to syndecans. Peptides encompassing the N terminus of V3 are more potent inhibitors than peptides encompassing the tip or the C terminus of V3 (Fig. 2C). This finding is in accordance with our observation that the anti-V3 257-D antibody directed against the base of V3 interferes with HIV-1 binding to syndecans (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 2A single highly conserved arginine at the base of the V3 region is necessary for gp120 binding to syndecans.A, syndecan-2+ cells were exposed to a panel of HIV-1 isolates. Results are expressed in percentage of p24 captured relative to the initial inoculum. B, syndecan-2+, CD4+, and DC-SIGN+ cells were incubated with wild-type (Fc-gp120), V3-deleted (Fc-gp120ΔV3), all V3 basic residues mutated (Fc-gp120 RRKRR/AAAAA: R298A, R304A, K305A, R308A, and R326A), two V3 basic residues mutated (Fc-gp120 RR/AA: R298A and R326A), and a unique V3 basic residue mutated (Fc-gp120 R298A) Fc-gp120 proteins.

We observed that one arginine at the base of V3, Arg-298, is highly conserved among all HIV-1 subtypes (Fig. 2D). We mutated this arginine in the context of Fc-gp120 JR-CSF and tested the resulting mutant protein to bind syndecans. Importantly, the R298A lost its capacity to bind syndecans (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the highly conserved arginine in position 298 of V3 of JR-CSF gp120 is necessary to mediate gp120 binding to syndecans. Although the R298A gp120 protein still binds CD4 and DC-SIGN (Fig. 2B), we cannot exclude the possibility that the introduction of mutations at this position induces conformational changes in V3 that would explain the inability of the gp120 mutant protein to bind syndecans. To rule out this possibility, we tested by ELISA anti-V3 antibodies for their capacities to recognize the R298A gp120 protein. As expected, anti-V3 antibodies do not b"

We examined the effect of adhesion signaling including Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) on cardiogenesis in mouse ES cells using α-myosin heavy chain promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein or luciferase as reporters. Cardiac transcription factors including Nkx2.5 and Tbx5 mRNA were first expressed at day 4 in hanging drop embryoid bodies, and adhesion of embryoid bodies to surfaces at or before that day strongly inhibited differentiation of ES cells to cardiomyocytes. Since adhesion signaling could suppress cardiogenesis through Src kinases, embryoid bodies were exposed to the small molecule PP2, known as a Src family kinase inhibitor. PP2 during embryoid body adhesion dramatically increased cardiomyocyte differentiation and decreased mRNA expression of neuronal cellular adhesion molecule and α-fetoprotein, neuroectodermal, and endodermal markers, respectively. Surprisingly, although there was an interaction between Src and FAK in cardiogenesis, the procardiogenic effect of PP2 appeared incompletely explained by Src kinase inhibition, since another Src family kinase inhibitor, SU6656, failed to induce cardiogenesis. Instead, PP2 specifically inhibited adhesion-induced FAK phosphorylation. In ES cells stably expressing FAK-related nonkinase, which functions as a dominant negative FAK, cell migration from embryoid bodies was inhibited, whereas α-myosin heavy chain expression and myosin-stained cardiomyocytes were increased, suggesting that reducing cell motility may contribute to cardiogenesis.

Therefore, we explored adhesion signaling pathways, including Src and FAK, in the differentiation of mouse ES cells to cardiomyocytes. Here we report that embryoid body adhesion before the initiation of the cardiac differentiation program inhibits cardiogenesis. We explored signaling pathways downstream of adhesion, including the Src tyrosine kinase pathway. We found that exposure of ES cells to PP2, a Src family kinase inhibitor, during embryoid body adhesion dramatically promotes selective cardiogenesis, as shown by increases in α-MHC and cardiac troponin T expression and synchronized beating cardimyocytes. Surprisingly, we found that the effect of PP2 was incompletely explained by Src kinase inhibition, and PP2 exerts its effect in part by inhibition of adhesion-induced FAK activation. In ES cells stably expressing FAK-related nonkinase, which functions as a dominant negative FAK, cell migration was inhibited, whereas cardiogenesis was increased. These findings indicate that FAK signaling is a key negative regulator of cardiogenesis in mouse ES cells, and inhibiting FAK activation can promote cardiogenesis.

Gullans S.R. Lee R.T. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1912-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). For the α-MHC promoter-luciferase vector, pGL3-Basic and neomycin-resistant pEGFP-1 vectors were digested with KpnI and XbaI, and the luciferase coding region of pGL3-basic and pEGFP-1 without EGFP were ligated to make luciferase expression vectors. The 5.5-kb fragment of the α-MHC promoter region was excised from α-MHC-pBluescript SK+ with SacI and HindIII and then subcloned into the luciferase expression vector. For the FRNK expression vector, the 1.1-kb FRNK coding region (corresponding to amino acids 691-1053 of mouse FAK; GenBank™ accession number M95408) was generated by PCR from mouse lung cDNA. The PCR primers used were as follows (5′ to 3′): CGCCTCGAGCGGATGAGGGAATCCAGAAGA (forward) and CGCAAGCTTGCTCAGTGTGGCCGTGTCTGC (reverse). The resultant PCR product was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector with the cytomegalovirus promoter, and correct orientation was confirmed by sequencing. To obtain stable transformants, ES cells were transfected with Fugene 6 and selected for 14 days with 500 μg/ml Geneticin as previously described (13Takahashi T. Lord B. Schulze P.C. Fryer R.M. Sarang S.S. Gullans S.R. Lee R.T. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1912-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription PCR, Quantitative PCR, and Luciferase Assay—Total RNA was extracted from ES cells with TRI reagent, and 0.2 μg of RNA was analyzed with quantitative PCR using the QuantiTect SYBR Green reverse transcription-PCR kit and the Light Cycler System (Roche Applied Science) as previously described (13Takahashi T. Lord B. Schulze P.C. Fryer R.M. Sarang S.S. Gullans S.R. Lee R.T. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1912-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Sequences of PCR primers were as follows (5′ to 3′): GCTGTGACTGCCTACCAGAATG and GAGAGAGAGCGAGCCTCCAAAC (Brachyury); CTCGATATGTTTGATGACTTCT and CGTTTTCTGGTTTGAATCCC (GATA4); GCTACAAGTGCAAGCGACAG and GGGTAGGCGTTGTAGCCATA (Nkx2.5); CCACTGGATGCGACAACTTGTCTCC and GACGTGGGTGCAAAACGCAGTGTTC (Tbx5); TGGTTTCCGTAGCAACT and GTCGCTCCCATCGTAG (MEF2C); AAACCAGGCCCCCTCCC and CGGATTCGAAGCTGTTGTCTT (Myocardin); ACCGTGGACTACAACAT and CTTTCGCTCGTTGGGA (α-MHC); ACGTCCGGTTCATAGTCCTG and CACACACCAGGGTGACAGAC (NCAM); AACAGAAACCCGTGGAGATG and GTCTCTGTGGCTCTCGTTCC (PECAM-1); CCTATGCCCCTCCCCCATTC and CTCACACCAAAGCGTCAACACATT (α-FP); GGAACATAGCCGTAAACTGC and TCACTGTGCCTGAACTTACC (β-tubulin). For reverse transcription-PCR of Tbx5 and β-tubulin, the reaction condition is as follows: 94 °C for 4 min and then denaturing, 94 °C for 30 s; annealing, 63 °C for 1 min; extension, 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 72 °C for a 10-min incubation. Each PCR cycle was determined by each quantitative PCR result so that the relations between the amounts of PCR product and cycles were within a linear range, and there were 25 and 20 cycles for Tbx5 and β-tubulin, respectively. Embryoid bodies of α-MHC promoter-luciferase-expressing cells were lysed at day 10, and luciferase activities were assayed using the Bright-Glo luciferase assay system. Immunocytochemistry—Day 14 embryoid bodies were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Then cells were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody to sarcomeric myosin MF20 (diluted 1:100) and sequentially incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400). Slides were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 for nuclear staining. Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—Western analysis was performed as previously described (13Takahashi T. Lord B. Schulze P.C. Fryer R.M. Sarang S.S. Gullans S.R. Lee R.T. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1912-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). ES cells or embryoid bodies were lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. After the protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by Bradford assay, samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 7.5-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight (anti-actin diluted 1:2000; anti-FAK diluted 1:200; others diluted 1:1000) and sequentially detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (1:3000, 1 h) and enhanced chemiluminescence. For FRNK, the rabbit antibody to the carboxyl terminus of FAK (C-20) was used as the primary antibody. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were precleared with protein G-agarose beads, and samples containing the same amount of protein were incubated with rabbit antibody to FAK overnight, followed by incubation with protein G-agarose beads for 2 h. Immunocomplexes were then washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cell Proliferation Assay—BrdUrd labeling was performed as previously described (27Anneren C. Cowan C.A. Melton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31590-31598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Day 3 embryoid bodies were dissociated with trypsin-EDTA, and single cells were cultured on gelatin-coated chamber slides in differentiation medium for 48 h with or without Me2SO or Src inhibitors. Then cells were incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd for 30 min. After fixation, permeabilization, and blocking, cells were incubated sequentially with anti-BrdUrd antibody G3G4 (1:1000) and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400). Slides were double-stained with Hoechst 33342 for nuclear staining. For cell counting, embryoid bodies were plated on gelatincoated dishes at day 4 and trypsinized at day 4 or 5, and the cell number was counted manually. Cell Migration Assay—Day 4 embryoid bodies were plated on gelatincoated dishes and incubated in differentiation medium containing 25 mm HEPES with or without Me2SO or Src inhibitors for 24 h. Subsequently, dishes were mounted on an inverted microscope (IX-70; Olympus) on a temperature-controlled stage (TC-344B; Warner Instrument Corp.). Experiments were performed at 37 °C and a thin layer of mineral oil was used to minimize evaporation of culture media. After a brief equilibration period, images were automatically acquired at ×10 magnification every 2 min for 4 h (corresponding to 120 frames) using a digital CCD camera (CoolSNAP HQ; Roper Scientific) and stored on a computer for subsequent cell migration analysis using MATLAB software (The MathWorks). Single cells were tracked over time using a custom-written normalized cross-correlation algorithm based on the nuclear position, and single cell tracking coordinates were subsequently used to compute migration distance and velocity for each cell. Statistical Analysis—Data were shown as mean ± S.D. and analyzed by Student's t test or 1-way analysis of variance with post hoc analysis, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Cardiac Differentiation Programs Begin in Hanging Drop Embryoid Bodies at Day 4—First, to explore when cardiac differentiation programs initiate within embryoid bodies, mRNA expression of heart-related transcription factors was analyzed by quantitative PCR (Fig. 1). Embryoid bodies were adhered to gelatin 6 days after hanging drop embryoid body formation, a typical protocol for differentiation of ES cells. Brachyury, an early mesodermal marker (28Wilkinson D.G. Bhatt S. Herrmann B.G. Nature. 1990; 343: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), was transiently expressed from days 3-5. GATA 4 was expressed earliest among the transcription factors examined and increased rapidly after day 4. The expression of Nkx2.5, Tbx5, and MEF2C, which have crucial roles in cardiac development in the embryo (29Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 407: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 30Solloway M.J. Harvey R.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 264-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), began after day 4, followed by expression of the gene for the sarcomeric protein α-MHC. Nkx2.5 is known to express early within the embryonic heart (31Komuro I. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8145-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 32Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development. 1993; 119: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the observed sequential gene expression pattern in embryoid bodies was consistent with the cardiac developmental process. Collectively, these data indicate that cardiac differentiation programs in embryoid bodies start at day 4, before the typical embryoid body adhesion step. Embryoid Body Adhesion before Initiation of Cardiac Differentiation Inhibits Cardiogenesis—To determine if embryoid body adhesion affects cardiogenesis, α-MHC promoter-driven EGFP cells were cultured as embryoid bodies and then adhered on gelatin at various time points, and EGFP-positive cardiomyocytes were observed at day 10. The number of EGFP-positive cells was significantly decreased if embryoid bodies were adhered at day 4 or earlier (Fig. 2A). This finding was also confirmed by α-MHC promoter-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that signals downstream of embryoid body adhesion inhibit cardiogenesis. PP2 Exposure during Embryoid Body Adhesion Promotes Selective Cardiogenesis—Src tyrosine kinase and FAK are kinases downstream of integrin signaling (15Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3821) Google Scholar, 16Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ross R.S. Borg T.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether exposure of PP2, a pyrazolopyrimidine derivative known as an Src family kinase inhibitor, could promote cardiogenesis during embryoid body adhesion. Exposure of 10 μm PP2 from day 4 dramatically enhanced α-MHC promoter-driven luciferase activity (4-fold) compared with control embryoid bodies adhered at day 4 (Fig. 3A) and also with embryoid bodies adhered at day 6 (data not shown). Days 4-6 was the critical period for PP2 to exert its inductive effect. In contrast, PP2 exposure from day 6 onward had no effect, and from times before day 4, PP2 inhibited subsequent cardiogenesis. Total protein content of embryoid bodies was not changed significantly by PP2 exposure from day 4 (data not shown). PP2 exposure during days 4-6 induced more α-MHC promoter-driven EGFP-positive cells than control, and the proportion of EGFP-positive cells was 5-10% (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, differentiated cardiomyocyte clusters following PP2 treatment beat more synchronously than Me2SO-treated cells (supplemental videos, DMSO.avi and PP2.avi). These effects were achieved by concentrations of PP2 greater than or equal to 5 μm, and 10 μm was most effective (Fig. 3C). Recently, one of the Src family kinases (cYes) was reported to be important for mouse and human ES cell self-renewal, and cYes inhibition combined with a low concentration of retinoic acid leads to multilineage differentiation (27Anneren C. Cowan C.A. Melton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31590-31598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that PP2 promotes differentiation to other cell lineages of ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal origin, NCAM, PECAM-1, and α-fetoprotein (α-FP) mRNA expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR; NCAM, PECAM-1, and α-FP are markers of neuroectoderm, endothelial cells of mesoderm, and endoderm, respectively (33Loebel D.A. Watson C.M. De Young R.A. Tam P.P. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 34Czyz J. Wobus A. Differentiation. 2001; 68: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). At day 10, NCAM expression was decreased and α-FP was strikingly diminished, whereas PECAM-1 was not affected by PP2 (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrate that PP2 exposure during embryoid body adhesion promotes selective cardiogenesis, possibly by regulating stem cell lineage commitment. PP2 Inhibits Adhesion-induced FAK Phosphorylation and Increases Tbx5 mRNA Expression—Since PP2 is a Src family kinase inhibitor, we tested whether SU6656, another Src family kinase inhibitor (27Anneren C. Cowan C.A. Melton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31590-31598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 35Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), also enhances cardiogenesis in ES cells. Day 4 embryoid bodies were adhered, and adhesion-induced Src family kinase activation (defined as tyrosine 416 autophosphorylation (36Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar)) was detected by Western analysis. Src family kinases were activated up to 3 h after adhesion in embryoid bodies treated with Me2SO, whereas they were strongly inhibited by SU6656 as well as PP2 (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, however, SU6656 exposure did not promote cardiogenesis in embryoid bodies even at high concentrations (Fig. 4B). This result was confirmed by Western analysis of MHC and cardiac troponin T, showing that only PP2 markedly enhanced expression of these cardiac proteins (Fig. 4E). Then, we examined whether stimulation with the Src activator PDGF-BB affects cardiogenesis in embryoid bodies. PDGF-BB at a concentration of 50 ng/ml activated Src in Me2SO-treated control cells (Fig. 4C) and significantly inhibited α-MHC mRNA expression (Fig. 4D, Me2SO: 50.4 ± 25.5% compared with control without PDGF stimulation, n = 3, p < 0.05). This inhibitory effect of PDGF was also observed in SU6656-pretreated cells, but not in PP2-treated cells, both at the mRNA and the protein level (Fig. 4D, SU6656: 126.4 ± 22.5 to 72.9 ± 12.6% by stimulation with PDGF (50 ng/ml), n = 3, p < 0.05; Fig. 4E, upper panel), although SU6656 inhibits PDGF-induced activation of Src equal to or greater than PP2. Instead, PP2 effectively blocked PDGF-induced FAK activation (Fig. 4C, right). We further tested whether inhibition of PDGF receptor activation promotes cardiogenesis, but exposure of the PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor AG1296 with or without SU6656 did not have an effect similar to PP2 (data not shown). Next, the cardiac gene expression profile in cells treated with either Me2SO, PP2, or SU6656 was compared by quantitative PCR (Fig. 5). We found that the gene expression profile of SU6656 was almost identical to that of Me2SO-treated control regarding cardiac genes analyzed here. An increase in α-MHC expression over control by PP2 was observed from day 7, and interestingly, among cardiac transcription factors examined, only Tbx5 was significantly increased by PP2 from day 5 (3.5- and 3.4-fold as control at day 5 and day 6, respectively), prior to the increase in gene expression for other transcription factors and α-MHC. This is noteworthy, because Tbx5 is a transcription factor that is critical for cardiogenesis in the embryo (37Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A.

Monzen K. Ikeda Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that Src participates in cardiac differentiation, whereas the observed cardiogenic effect of PP2 is incompl"
https://openalex.org/W2047295199,"Here we report that myeloid cells differentiating along the monocyte/macrophage lineage down-regulate the ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase via a protein kinase C/Ras/ERK signaling cascade. In consequence, the β1 integrin subunit becomes hyposialylated, which stimulates the ligand binding activity of α5β1 fibronectin receptors. Pharmacologic inhibitors of protein kinase C, Ras, and MEK, but not phosphoinositide 3-kinase, block ST6Gal-I down-regulation, integrin hyposialylation, and fibronectin binding. In contrast, constitutively active MEK stimulates these same events, indicating that ERK is both a necessary and sufficient activator of hyposialylation-dependent integrin activation. Consistent with the enhanced activity of hyposialylated cell surface integrins, purified α5β1 receptors bind fibronectin more strongly upon enzymatic desialylation, an effect completely reversed by resialylation of these integrins with recombinant ST6Gal-I. Finally, we have mapped the N-glycosylation sites on the β1 integrin to better understand the potential effects of differential sialylation on integrin structure/function. Notably, there are three N-glycosylated sites within the β1 I-like domain, a region that plays a crucial role in ligand binding.

The molecular mechanisms underlying PMA-dependent cell adhesion have not been well defined, although it has been reported that PMA increases the synthesis of both α5 and β1 integrin subunits (1Boles B.K. Ritzenthaler J. Birkenmeier T. Roman J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L703-L712PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bellon T. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Rubio M.A. Jochems G. Bernabeu C. Corbi A.L. Eur. J.

However, myeloid cells (U937 and THP-1) express an abundant amount of α5β1 in the absence of PMA treatment, and yet these cells bind very poorly to fibronectin. This suggests that myeloid α5β1 receptors are normally in an inactive state and that increased expression alone cannot account for the dramatically increased fibronectin binding induced by PMA. In our prior study (5Semel A.C. Seales E.C. Singhal A. Eklund E.A. Colley K.J. Bellis S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32830-32836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) we observed that PMA stimulated a rapid but transient increase in fibronectin binding that was likely due to the activation of integrins already present on the cell surface. However, following this initial transient event there was a second phase of elevated fibronectin binding that was sustained over many hours. The onset of this second phase of integrin activation was temporally correlated with the synthesis of a β1 integrin isoform that lacked α2-6-linked sialic acids, a sugar modification directed by the ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase. Our laboratory has previously determined that β1 integrins serve as a substrate for ST6Gal-I in several different cell types (5Semel A.C. Seales E.C. Singhal A. Eklund E.A. Colley K.J. Bellis S.L. J.

In differentiating myeloid cells the expression of hyposialylated β1 integrins results from PMA-induced down-regulation of ST6Gal-I (5Semel A.C. Seales E.C. Singhal A. Eklund E.A. Colley K.J.

Given that PMA is a known activator of protein kinase C (PKC), our goal in this investigation was to identify the signaling molecules that direct ST6Gal-I down-regulation and, correspondingly, integrin hyposialylation. Other studies have suggested that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is required for monocytic differentiation (8Hu X. Moscinski L.C. Valkov N.I. Fisher A.B. Hill B.J.

Trush M.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 307-315PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which ERK regulates integrin function in differentiated cells has not been elucidated. Our current results suggest that a PKC/Ras/ERK signaling cascade mediates the sustained phase of fibronectin binding by inhibiting β1 integrin sialylation. Cell Culture—A U937 myeloid cell subclone selected for granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor sensitivity was obtained from Dr. Elizabeth Eklund (Northwestern University). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 mg ml-1 glucose, l-glutamine (Cellgro), 10% fetal bovine serum, and gentamicin. U937 cells expressing constitutively active MEK were generated by using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) to transfect cells with a hemagglutinin-tagged, activated MEK construct (available from Upstate Biotechnology). A pooled population of clones expressing activated MEK was obtained by selection in G418. Verification of MEK expression was accomplished by immunoblotting for the hemagglutinin tag. Western Blotting—U937 cells were treated with or without 50 ng ml-1 PMA for 15 h. Cells were then lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg ml-1 leupeptin, 4 mm sodium fluoride, and 200 μm sodium pervanadate. Protein concentrations in the lysates were determined using a modified Bradford assay (Sigma). Lysates were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE, and β1 integrins were Western blotted using a monoclonal antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories. Western blot analysis of ST6Gal-I was accomplished using a polyclonal antibody generously provided by Dr. Karen Colley (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL). Enzyme Inhibitor Studies—Cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with one of the following enzyme inhibitors: 10 μm R031-8220 (Calbiochem), 30 μm manumycin A (Sigma), 50 μm PD98059 (Calbiochem), or 30 nm wortmannin (Sigma). PMA was then added to a final concentration of 50 ng ml-1, and cells were incubated in the presence of both PMA and the selected inhibitor for an additional 15 h at 37 °C. Lectin Affinity Analyses—Cell lysates (600 μg) were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of the biotinylated lectins SNA or ECL (Vector Laboratories). Streptavidin-agarose (20 μl, Sigma) was then added, and samples were incubated for an additional 2 h at 4°C with rotation. Lectin-glycoprotein complexes were collected by brief centrifugation and then washed three times with lysis buffer followed by one wash with phosphate-buffered saline. Glycoproteins were released from the complexes by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted to detect the β1 integrin. Cell Attachment Assays—Cells were treated with or without 50 ng ml-1 of PMA and also with enzyme inhibitors in some trials and then seeded onto tissue culture dishes that had been precoated with 20 μg ml-1 fibronectin. Adhesion was quantified as described previously using a crystal violet staining method (5Semel A.C. Seales E.C. Singhal A. Eklund E.A. Colley K.J. Bellis S.L. J. Biol.

Sialidase and ST6Gal-I Enzyme Treatment of Purified α5β1 and Modified ELISA Integrin Binding Assay—As reported previously (5Semel A.C. Seales E.C. Singhal A. Eklund E.A. Colley K.J. Bellis S.L. J.

Agarose-conjugated Vibrio cholerae sialidase (200 milliunits; Calbiochem) was added to the integrin solution, and samples were incubated for 6 h at 37°C with rotation. An equal amount of the integrin solution was incubated for 6 h in buffer without sialidase as a control. Following this incubation, the agarose-conjugated sialidase was removed by centrifugation. Both control and sialidase-treated integrin solutions were subdivided into two tubes and then treated with or without 5 milliunits ml-1 of rat recombinant ST6Gal-I (Calbiochem) in the presence of 50 μm CMP-Neu (the activated sugar donor substrate required by ST6Gal-I) for 4 h at 37°C. Following this incubation, the integrin solution buffer was adjusted to pH 7.4 by addition of pH 8.0 ELISA buffer. Integrin solutions were loaded onto 12-well tissue culture dishes precoated with fibronectin (100 μg ml-1). A final amount of 350 ng of purified α5β1 integrin was added to each well. Samples were also loaded onto wells that were precoated with denatured bovine serum albumin to control for nonspecific binding. Purified integrins were allowed to adhere for 1.5 h at 37 °C; the wells were then washed three times with ELISA buffer (pH 7.4) and exposed for 1 h to the glycosylation-insensitive anti-β1 integrin monoclonal antibody MAB2000 (Chemicon). After washing, wells were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) followed by the colorimetric horseradish peroxidase substrate chromogen (BIOSOURCE). Integrin binding was quantified by absorbance spectroscopy at a 450-nm wavelength. Specific binding values were obtained by subtracting bovine serum albumin binding values (“nonspecific”) from total fibronectin binding. Transfection of N-Glycosylation Site Mutants—CHO-K1 cells were transfected with a V5-tagged ST6Gal-I construct (provided by Dr. Karen Colley, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL), and stable clones were generated by selection in G418. The pECE plasmid containing the human β1 integrin sequence (12Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Erkki Ruoshlati (The Burnham Institute), and site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Reactions were performed in a thermal cycler with 40 ng of template DNA and complementary primers at 300 nm and with the following cycling steps repeated 16 times: 30s at 94 °C, 60 s at 55 °C, and 12 min at 68 °C. Mutant clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The mutated constructs were transiently transfected into ST6Gal-I-expressing CHO-K1 cells using Lipofectamine Plus according to the vendor protocol (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours following transfection the cells were lysed, and detection of the constructs was accomplished by Western blotting with antibodies that recognized only the transfected form of the β1 integrin. Two antibodies were used, one from BD Transduction Laboratories (catalog number 610468) and one from Chemicon (catalog number MAB1965). Of note, the N74Q mutant (numbering begins with first amino acid following the signal sequence) was only detectable with the Chemicon antibody, possibly because this mutation alters epitope recognition by the BD Transduction Laboratories antibody. Activation of PKC/Ras/ERK Induces Expression of Hyposialylated β1 Integrins—Previously we reported that β1 integrins expressed by PMA-treated U937 and THP-1 cells have a smaller apparent molecular mass when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and it was subsequently shown this was due to the PMA-induced synthesis of integrins lacking α2-6 sialic acids (5Semel A.C. Seales E.C. Singhal A. Eklund E.A. Colley K.J. Bellis S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32830-32836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the expression of hyposialylated integrins was regulated by PKC, we pretreated U937 cells with the PKC inhibitor R031-8220, stimulated cells with PMA (plus inhibitor), and then examined the electrophoretic mobility of β1 integrins. As shown (Fig. 1A), mature β1 integrins from PMA-treated cells migrated more rapidly than β1 integrins from control cells, reflecting the expression of the hyposialylated glycoform. Pretreatment with R031-8220 blocked the PMA-induced mobility shift, implicating PKC as a modulator of integrin sialylation. In contrast to mature β1, neither PMA nor R031-8220 had any effect on the mobility of precursor β1 integrins, a species that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (13Heino J. Ignotz R.A. Hemler M.E.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and is therefore not a substrate for sialyltransferases. Other studies from our laboratory have shown that forced expression of oncogenic Ras in epithelial cells causes altered α2-6 sialylation of β1 integrins (7Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Singhal A. Bellis S.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7137-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar); we therefore speculated that Ras may act as a regulator of integrin sialylation in myeloid cells. To test this hypothesis, cells were treated with manumycin A, a compound that blocks Ras activation by preventing farnesylation (17Di Paolo A. Danesi R. Nardini D. Bocci G. Innocenti F. Fogli S. Barachini S. Marchetti A. Bevilacqua G. Del Tacca M. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Kouchi H. Nakamura K. Fushimi K. Sakaguchi M. Miyazaki M. Ohe T. Namba M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similar to results with R031-8220, manumycin A prevented the PMA-induced electrophoretic mobility shift (Fig. 1A). We next sought to identify downstream effectors of Ras that might be involved in regulating integrin sialylation. Ras can activate multiple signaling cascades; however, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are among the best characterized mediators of Ras-dependent cellular responses (19Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we treated cells with an inhibitor (PD98059) of the ERK-activating kinase MEK as well as with an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (wortmannin). As shown in Fig. 1A, the MEK inhibitor blocked PMA-induced expression of the hyposialylated glycoform, whereas the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor was without effect. These data suggest that PKC regulates integrin sialylation by activating a Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. To more directly examine integrin sialylation, we performed a lectin affinity assay. Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with SNA, a lectin that binds specifically to α2-6-linked sialic acids. Sialylated proteins were precipitated and electrophoresed, and β1 integrins were subsequently detected by Western blotting. Consistent with results from mobility shift assays, SNA failed to precipitate β1 integrins from PMA-treated cells, indicating that these integrins are lacking α2-6 sialic acids (Fig. 1B). However, SNA reactivity could be restored when PMA-treated cells were preincubated with R031-8220, manumycin A, and PD98059, but not with wortmannin. Down-regulation of ST6Gal-I Is Mediated by PKC/Ras/ERK—Given that PMA induces down-regulation of ST6Gal-I (5Semel A.C. Seales E.C. Singhal A. Eklund E.A. Colley K.J. Bellis S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32830-32836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Taniguchi A. Higai K. Hasegawa Y. Utsumi K. Matsumoto K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of pharmacologic inhibitors on ST6Gal-I protein levels. Western blots of ST6Gal-I revealed that the PMA-dependent down-regulation in ST6Gal-I expression could by blocked by preincubating cells with R031-8220, manumycin A, and PD98059 but not with wortmannin (Fig. 1C). Hyposialylated β1 Integrins Have Increased Levels of Galactose-terminated N-Glycans—ST6Gal-I directs the addition of sialic acid in an α2-6-linkage to the terminal galactose of N-linked polylactosamine chains. However, this terminal galactose is a potential substrate for other trans-Golgi glycosyltransferases including several α2–3-sialyltransferases, which are known to be active in U937 cells (21Brown J.R. Fuster M.M. Whisenant T. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23352-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It follows that in cells with down-regulated ST6Gal-I the terminal galactoses of β1 could either remain unmodified or, alternately, become capped with other types of sugars or sugar linkages. To establish whether β1 integrins become targeted by competing glycosyltransferases as a result of PMA-induced down-regulation of ST6Gal-I, we performed a lectin affinity analysis with ECL, a lectin specific for the unsubstituted terminal galactose of N-linked polylactosamine chains. As shown in Fig. 1D, β1 integrins from PMA-treated cells were much more reactive with ECL, suggesting that a substantial proportion of integrin polylactosamine chains remain uncapped in the absence of ST6Gal-I activity. PMA-dependent Cell Binding to Fibronectin Is Mediated by PKC/Ras/ERK—Having determined that a PKC/Ras/ERK signaling cascade directs ST6Gal-I down-regulation and hyposialylated integrin expression, we anticipated that inhibitors of this pathway would block integrin-dependent cell adhesion to β1 substrates. Thus, cells were pretreated with inhibitors as before, stimulated with PMA, and then subjected to standard cell adhesion assays using fibronectin as a substrate. These assays showed that PMA-dependent fibronectin binding was blocked by R031-8220, manumycin A, and PD98059 but not by wortmannin (Fig. 1E). Constitutively Active MEK Mimics the Effect of PMA on Integrin Sialylation and Function—To verify that integrin hyposialylation and function are regulated by an ERK-dependent signaling cascade, we generated cells that stably express constitutively active MEK. SNA analyses of integrins harvested from these cells revealed that activated MEK induced the expression of hyposialylated β1 integrins in tandem with down-regulation of ST6Gal-I (Fig. 2, A and B). We also found that MEK-dependent integrin hyposialylation was associated with enhanced cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 2C). These data, combined with results from the pharmacologic inhibitor studies (Fig. 1), indicate that ERK is both a necessary and sufficient regulator of sialylation-dependent integrin activation. α2-6 Sialylation Directly Regulates α5β1 Binding to Fibronectin—To further establish that α2-6-linked sialic acids play a causal role in regulating integrin function, we manipulated the sialylation of purified α5β1 integrins and then monitored integrin binding to fibronectin using a modified ELISA. Consistent with our prior results (5Semel A.C. Seales E.C. Singhal A. Eklund E.A. Colley K.J. Bellis S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32830-32836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the enzymatic desialylation of purified α5β1 integrins stimulated fibronectin binding (Fig. 3A). However, we now show that this increased fibronectin binding can be reversed by using recombinant ST6Gal-I to add α2-6 sialic acid residues back onto desialylated α5β1 integrins. These data provide strong evidence that α2-6-linked sialic acids directly regulate α5β1 ligand binding activity. Also important, the behavior of purified α5β1 integrins recapitulates the behavior of α5β1 integrins expressed on the myeloid cell surface; desialylated purified integrins, like cell surface hyposialylated integrins, bind better to fibronectin. To confirm the activity of both the sialidase and ST6Gal-I enzymes in our assays, treated integrins were precipitated with SNA and then Western-blotted for β1 integrin. As shown in Fig. 3B, sialidase treatment of α5β1 led to significantly reduced SNA reactivity, suggesting that the sialidase was very effective in removing α2-6-linked sialic acids. The subsequent incubation of desialylated α5β1 integrins with recombinant ST6Gal-I restored SNA reactivity to base-line levels, indicating re-addition of α2-6-linked sialic acids. Treatment of control α5β1 integrins, which are already heavily sialylated, with ST6Gal-I slightly increased α2-6 sialylation, although this did not appear to affect ligand binding activity (Fig. 3A) β1 Integrins Are Glycosylated on 10 of 12 of the Asparagine Residues That Have the Appropriate Consensus Sequence for N-Glycosylation, Including Three Sites within the Functionally Important I-like Domain—Our understanding of the role of glycosylation in regulating integrin structure/function has been limited by the lack of information concerning specific sites of N-glycosylation. To address this deficiency, we used a mutagenesis approach to identify the sites carrying N-linked glycans. Specifically, the asparagine residues within the NX(S/T) glycosylation consensus sequence were mutated to glutamine; these mutated cDNAs were then transfected into CHO-K1 cells, and expression of the constructs was detected by Western blotting using antibodies that recognize only the transfected β1 isoform. We anticipated that the loss of an N-glycan at a given site would result in a reduced apparent molecular mass when compared with wild type β1 integrins. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, 10 of the 12 mutant constructs demonstrated increased electrophoretic mobility by SDS-PAGE, indicating decreased molecular mass (N461Q is shown in Fig. 4A as a representative example). These data suggest that theβ1 integrin is typically N-glycosylated on 10 sites, including three sites within theβ1 I-like domain, a region crucial for ligand binding. In contrast, the mobilities of the N564Q and N74Q constructs were identical to that of the wild typeβ1 isoform, suggesting that these sites do not normally carry N-linked glycans. Interestingly, only one band was typically observed for the transfected β1 construct (Fig. 4A), and this band migrated to the expected position of the partially glycosylated precursor isoform. In a few blots a small amount of mature β1 was detected upon extended exposure of the films (not shown). The mature band, when observed, also showed an electrophoretic mobility shift as expected. It is currently unclear why the majority of the transfected β1 construct remains in the endoplasmic reticulum. The regulation of Golgi glycosyltransferases by signaling mechanisms has been little studied, and even less is known about how such regulation affects the function of specific substrates targeted by these enzymes. We and others have shown that forced expression of oncogenic Ras alters ST6Gal-I expression in epithelial cells (7Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Singhal A. Bellis S.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7137-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (22Easton E.W. Bolscher J.G. van den Eijnden D.H. J. Biol.

These results are noteworthy because they indicate that Golgi enzymes such as ST6Gal-I can be dynamically regulated and further imply that variantly glycosylated substrates may be expressed in response to extracellular stimuli that activate appropriate signaling cascades. Signaling through ERK has been suggested as an essential step in the differentiation of myeloid cells along the monocyte/macrophage lineage (8Hu X. Moscinski L.C. Valkov N.I. Fisher A.B. Hill B.J.

Trush M.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 307-315PubMed Google Scholar), and the heterologous expression of constitutively active Ras or MEK stimulates monocytic cell behaviors including phagocytosis and adhesion to fibronectin (8Hu X.

However, the molecular mechanisms linking ERK to specific changes in integrin structure/function have not been well defined. Our results indicating that expression of hyposialylated integrins is induced by PKC/Ras/ERK signaling, combined with our prior observation that the synthesis of hyposialylated integrins is temporally correlated with enhanced adhesion to fibronectin, strongly support variant β1 sialylation as a mechanism for activation of myeloid fibronectin receptors during monocytic differentiation. Unequivocal evidence that α2-6 sialic acids play a direct role in regulating the activity of α5β1 fibronectin receptors is provided in this report by purified integrin receptor/ligand binding assays. The enzymatic removal of sialic acids from purified α5β1 integrins increases fibronectin binding, whereas the re-addition of these sugars by recombinant ST6Gal-I attenuates binding to basal levels. Importantly, the behavior of purified α5β1 integrins in a cell-free assay system mimics the behavior of integrins on the cell surface; α5β1 integrins lacking α2-6 sialic acids bind better to fibronectin. We postulate that the enhanced fibronectin binding activity of hyposialylated integrins contributes to the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. This hypothesis is consistent with results from a recent animal study in which ST6Gal-I expression was reduced in selected tissues by mutating one of the multiple ST6Gal-I promoter sequences. In these ST6Gal-I-deficient mice the introduction of a bacterial pathogen stimulated enhanced recruitment of leukocytes into the peritoneum (28Appenheimer M.M. Huang R.Y. Chandrasekaran E.V. Dalziel M. Hu Y.P. Soloway P.D. Wuensch S.A. Matta K.L. Lau J.T. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Elegant work from Luo et al. (29Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) suggests that glycosylation can affect integrin conformation. These investigators engineered an artificial N-glycosylation site into the β1 integrin by substituting an asparagine residue for proline at amino acid 333, which created the NXS consensus sequence for N-glycosylation. Upon transfection of this construct in CHO-K1 cells, the β1 subunit was N-glycosylated, and this variant glycoform was shown to have increased ligand binding activity. Site 333 is in the C-terminal end of the β1 I-like domain, and it was hypothesized that the addition of a glycan at this site caused an increase in the distance between the β1 head and stalk domains, thus inducing the integrin heterodimer to assume a more extended (activated) integrin conformation. Although P333N is not a naturally occurring mutation, these data are important because they provide proof of concept that changes in the glycan structure within key regions of the integrin molecule can alter integrin conformation and activity. Notably, the specific sites on β1 that normally carry N-linked glycans have not previously been identified, which is surprising given the fact that there is currently intense interest in delineating integrin structure. Our studies now suggest that 10 of the 12 consensus asparagine residues are elaborated with N-linked glycans. Three of these sites lie within the β1 I-like domain, a region critical for ligand binding, and seven other sites are distributed among the plexin-semaphorin-integrin, hybrid, integrin-epidermal growth factor, and β-tail domains. We hypothesize that sialic acid, a negatively charged sugar, either alters the overall conformation of the integrin receptor or more directly regulates ligand binding. Negative charges within the β1 I-like domain are very important for integrin function, as negatively charged amino acids within this region are known to complex with divalent cations. In turn, the binding of divalent cations is a requisite event in integrin activation. We speculate that the addition or subtraction of sialic acids within this domain could either influence coordination of divalent cations or alter positioning of the ligand within the ligand binding surface. Results generated from integrins with artificial N-glycosylation sites, combined with our ligand-binding studies using enzymatically manipulated purified integrins, provide much needed causal evidence that integrin function can be regulated by changes in glycosylation. However, it is important to note that there is an extensive literature showing that naturally occurring changes in integrin glycan structure are associated with dramatic alterations in cell behaviors such as adhesion, migration, and invasion. Variant β1 glycoforms have been observed in numerous cell types including fibroblasts, myeloid cells, keratinocytes, cytotrophoblasts, T lymphocytes, and several kinds of epithelial cells (reviewed in Refs. 30Bellis S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1663: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar and 31Gu J. Taniguchi N. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Importantly, the altered β1 glycosylation described in most of these studies occurred in response to physiologic events or stimuli and not merely as a consequence of in vitro molecular manipulations of cell lines. Thus, differential glycosylation likely represents an important feature of the natural biology of integrins containing the β1 subunit. The current study adds to the prior body of literature by defining a specific endogenous signaling mechanism that regulates variant β1 glycosylation and by demonstrating that hyposialylation is the likely mechanism underlying the known involvement of ERK in regulating the increased cell adhesiveness associated with monocytic/macrophage differentiation. We gratefully acknowledge the members of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Molecular Biology Core Facility for their assistance in generating glycosylation site mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1590835357,"The proliferative action of ERα largely accounts for the carcinogenic activity of estrogens. By contrast, recent data show that ERβ displays tumor-suppressor properties, thus supporting the interest to identify compounds that could increase its activity. Here, we show that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDI) upregulated ERβ protein levels, whereas it decreased ERα expression. Part of this regulation took place at the mRNA level through a mechanism independent of de novo protein synthesis. In addition, we found that, in various cancer cells, the treatment with different HDI enhanced the ligand-dependent activity of ERβ more strongly than that of ERα. On the other hand, in MDA-MB231 and HeLa cells, the expression of ERs modified the transcriptional response to HDI. The use of deletion mutants of both receptors demonstrated that AF1 domain of the receptors was required. Finally, we show that ERβ expression led to a dramatic increased in the antiproliferative activity of HDI, which correlated with a modification of the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle control by HDI. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the interference of ERβ and HDAC on the control of transcription and cell proliferation constitute a promising approach for cancer therapy."

The anthracycline class of antitumor drugs undergoes redox cycling in living cells producing increased amounts of reactive oxygen species and semiquinone radical, both of which can cause DNA damage, and consequently trigger apoptotic death of cancer cells. We show here that MCF-7 cells overexpressing thioredoxin (Trx) were more apoptotic in response to daunomycin. Trx overexpression in MCF-7 cells increased the generation of superoxide anion (O2˙-) in anthracycline-treated cell extracts.

Additionally Trx increased p53-DNA binding and expression in response to anthracyclines. MCF-7 cells expressing mutant redox-inactive Trx showed decreased superoxide generation, apoptosis, and p53 protein and DNA binding. In addition, down-regulation of endogenous Trx expression by small interfering RNA resulted in decreased expression of caspase-7 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase expression in response to daunomycin. These results suggest that endogenous Trx is required for anthracycline-mediated apoptosis of breast cancer cells.

Chem. 1988; 263: 4984-4990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its role as an antioxidant protein, Trx has been shown to have growth promoting properties (9Powis G. Mustacich D. Coon A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent study has demonstrated that overexpression of redox-active Trx could promote cell death via activation of caspase-8 (10Ma X. Karra S. Lindner D.J. Hu J. Reddy S.P. Kimchi A. Yodoi J. Kalvakolanu D.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3703-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additional studies have shown that Trx reductase is critical for cell death, and a Trx-dependent mechanism has been suggested (11Ueda S. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Tanaka T. Ueno M. Yodoi J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Recent studies also indicate that caspases, the executioner of cell death by apoptosis, could be activated by Trx due to its disulfide reducing properties (12Ueda S. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Sasada T. Yonehara S. Takabayashi A. Yamaoka Y. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6689-6695PubMed Google Scholar). Caspases are rich in cysteine motifs that are required for their catalytic activity. Therefore, oxidation could inhibit caspase activity, which could be restored by the Trx system (12Ueda S. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Sasada T. Yonehara S. Takabayashi A. Yamaoka Y. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6689-6695PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore Trx also has been shown to promote p53-DNA binding due to its reducing actions on DNA-binding cysteine motifs on p53 (14Ueno M. Masutani H. Arai R.J. Yamauchi A. Hirota K. Sakai T. Inamoto T. Yamaoka Y. Yodoi J. Nikaido T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35809-35815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Taken together, accumulating evidence suggests that Trx is a multifunctional protein, which can participate in proliferation as well as cell death process. The antioxidative action of Trx could be due to its manganese superoxide dismutase inducing properties (5Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

The anthracycline class of anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin or daunomycin has been shown to induce p53-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells (16Cho Y. Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1999; 74: 239-248PubMed Google Scholar, 17Asher G. Lotem J. Cohen B. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Additionally anthracyclines have also been shown to cause DNA damage, which increases p53 expression (18Ngo E.O. Nutter L.M. Sura T. Gutierrez P.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Sadji-Ouatas Z. Lasfer M. Julien S. Feldmann G. Reyl-Desmars F. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). p53 is a sequence-specific transcription factor, which can induce proapoptotic or suppress antiapoptotic genes in response to DNA damage or irreparable cell cycle arrest (20Maya R. Balass M. Kim S.T. Shkedy D. Leal J.F. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Katzir E. Oren M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p53 on the Ser15 residue dissociates MDM2 and activates p53 as a transcription factor, which binds to various p53-dependent genes resulting in their activation or repression (20Maya R. Balass M. Kim S.T. Shkedy D. Leal J.F. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Katzir E. Oren M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). While evaluating the protective effect of Trx in daunomycin-induced cytotoxicity we observed increased death of MCF-7 cells overexpressing Trx. Because Trx has been shown to protect against oxidative stress and daunomycin-mediated cytotoxicity has been shown to be mediated in part by reactive oxygen species (ROS), our observation was rather surprising and novel. Anthracyclines contain quinone moieties in their structure, which can undergo biochemical reduction by one or two electrons catalyzed by flavoenzymes in the cell using NADPH as an electron donor (21Iyanagi T. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Bolton J.L. Trush M.A. Penning T.M. Dryhurst G. Monks T.J. Chem. Res.

This bioreductive process generates semiquinone radical with concomitant production of superoxide anion (O2˙-). The semiquinone radical intercalates with the DNA resulting in DNA damage. The formation of O2˙- is the beginning of a cascade that generates hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, generally referred to as reactive oxygen species (24Mordente A. Meucci E. Martorana G.E. Giardina B. Minotti G. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition to various bioreductive enzymes, low molecular weight protein or non-protein thiols may also take part in the redox cycling process (25Hrdina R. Gersl V. Klimtova I. Simunek T. Machackova J. Adamcova M. Acta Med. (Hradec Kralove). 2000; 43: 75-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present investigation we report that endogenous Trx is required for daunomycin-induced apoptosis of cancer cells. In addition, we also demonstrate that Trx enhances the apoptotic death of cancer cells in response to daunomycin due to enhanced redox cycling of anthracyclines. In contrast, cells that express redox-inactive Trx or transfected with Trx siRNA show resistance to apoptosis. Reagents—Daunomycin was purchased from Sigma, and 5-iminodaunomycin was obtained from NCI, National Institutes of Health. Anti-p53 (full length), anti-caspase-7, and anti-caspase-1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-p53 phospho-Ser15, anti-caspase-6, anti-caspase-8 (recognizes cleaved fragment), and anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antithioredoxin antibody was purchased from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ). Cell Culture and Adenovirus Production—MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin. MCF-7 clones expressing Trx (Trx9), dominant negative redox-inactive Trx (Serb4), and only vector (vector) were the generous contribution of Dr. Garth Powis (Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ) and have been described previously (26Oblong J.E. Berggren M. Gasdaska P.Y. Powis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11714-11720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gallegos A. Gasdaska J.R. Taylor C.W. Paine-Murrieta G.D. Goodman D. Gasdaska P.Y. Berggren M. Briehl M.M. Powis G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5765-5770PubMed Google Scholar). MCF-7 clones were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing G418 (300 μg/ml). A549 cells were obtained from ATCC and propagated in F12K medium. The AdenoX system was obtained from Stratagene Corp. (La Jolla, CA), and Trx or mutant Trx open reading frame (26Oblong J.E. Berggren M. Gasdaska P.Y. Powis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11714-11720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into pAdenoX vector. Recombinant virus was allowed to infect human embryonic kidney 293 cells for generation of viral particles. For transfection, MCF-7 cells were infected with ∼1 × 108 infectious units (per million cells), and after 48 h protein expression was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RNA Interference—p53, Trx, and scrambled non-targeting siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon RNA Technologies (Lafayette, CO). For transfection, MCF-7 or A549 cells were seeded in 35-mm2 dishes to obtain 20% confluency at the time of transfection. Xtreme siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used to transfect siRNA to a final concentration of 100 nm. Inhibition of gene expression by siRNA was determined after 72 h by Western analysis. Thioredoxin Activity Assay—The thioredoxin activity assay was performed as described by Holmgren and Bjornstedt (1Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Briefly the reaction mixture contained NADPH (200 μm), porcine insulin (80 μm, Sigma), and bovine Trx reductase (0.1 μm) in 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing EDTA (1 mm) in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The reaction was started by addition of bovine Trx reductase (0.1 μm). Trx activity was calculated as micromoles of NADPH oxidized per minute per milligram of protein at 25 °C (Beckman DU800 spectrophotometer). TUNEL Assay—Apoptotic cells were detected using an in situ cell death detection, peroxidase kit (Roche Applied Science). Apoptotic DNA strand breaks were identified by labeling 3′-OH termini with fluorescein-dUTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight in chambered glass slides (Nunc) to a final density of 25,000 cells/well. Following treatment with the appropriate concentration of drugs medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice and washed twice with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The labeling reaction was performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dUTP along with other nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase for 60 min in the dark at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Then cells were washed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and mounted, and the incorporated fluorescein-dUTP was analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert M200, Carl Zeiss). Flow Cytometry—Cells were treated with drugs for 48 h. Floating cells were collected, and adherent cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized. Floating and adherent cells were pooled and centrifuged at 500 × g for 3 min. Cells were washed again with PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum, resuspended in 500 ml of PBS followed by fixing in 7.5 ml of ice-cold ethanol (70%), added dropwise while vortexing, and stored at -20 °C overnight. After two washes with PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum, cells were resuspended in the same buffer and stained with 10 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in the presence of 250 mg/ml RNase at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. Stained cells were analyzed using a Coulter Epics Elite ESP flow cytometer using an argon laser at 488 nm wavelength. Flow cytometric results were analyzed, and apoptosis was defined as the “sub G1” peak (6Berggren M.I. Husbeck B. Samulitis B. Baker A.F. Gallegos A. Powis G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) using Multicycle software. Western Blotting—Protein lysates were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 1% Igepal in PBS with protease inhibitors, and protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of protein were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The blot was treated with the appropriate dilutions of primary antibody and visualized using either Lumiglo (Cell Signaling Technology) or the ECL plus system (Amersham Biosciences) with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Determination of O2˙- Production by Reduction of Ferricytochrome c—Superoxide production was measured as superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c (28Azzi A. Montecucco C. Richter C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 65: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Cells were sonicated in potassium phosphate buffer (0.05 m, pH 7.8, plus 1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for the assay. To determine the O2˙- generation in the cell lysate, the supernatant was incubated with 10 μm drug and 10 μm cytochrome c with or without 1 unit of superoxide dismutase to determine superoxide dismutase inhibitable rate. All reactions were performed in triplicate. The reduction of ferricytochrome c was measured both in kinetic and end point mode with path check on for 1-h duration at a wavelength 550 nm using a Spectramax 190 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Total protein was quantified using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). In Situ Detection of O2˙- by Fluorescent Probe 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescin Diacetate (DCF-DA)—Cells were grown in chambered glass slides (Nunc) to a final density of 25,000 cells/well. Cells were preincubated with 20 μm DCF-DA (Sigma) in 20 mm HEPES in PBS containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 30 min followed by washing with PBS buffer, the drug was added, and cells were observed for 300 s in a Nikon laser confocal microscope using a laser beam wavelength of 488 nm and analyzed by Ultraview software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Clonogenic Assay—Cells were trypsinized and seeded to a final density of 1 × 106 viable cells/100-mm2 dish and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then treated with the appropriate concentration of drugs for 24 h, trypsinized, and seeded to a final density of 500,000 viable cells/100-mm2 dish. Viable cells were determined using a Vicell counter (Beckman Coulter). After 14 days, the surviving colonies were washed in PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stained using 0.1% crystal violet in 90% ethanol. Colonies containing a minimum of 30 cells were counted using the colony counting feature present in the Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. The assays were performed in triplicate, and the data were statistically analyzed using InStat version 2.01 software. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear extract was prepared as described previously (29Das K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4662-4670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and harvested in 2 ml of ice-cold PBS by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin and antipain by gentle pipetting. Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min followed by addition of 25 ml of 10% Nonidet P-40 and vortexed at full speed for 10 s. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 rpm. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.42 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 10% (v/v) glycerol), and tubes were rocked gently at 4 °C for 30 min on a shaking platform. The extracts were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 25 min, and the supernatant was saved as nuclear extract at -70 °C for further experiments. Protein was quantified using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—For the EMSA, the p53 consensus oligonucleotide was obtained from Genosys (5′-GGCATGTCCGGGCATGTCC-3′) and was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 10× kinase buffer supplied with the enzyme. Ten micrograms of nuclear protein were preincubated in 5 μl of 5× binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris·HCl, 0.4 mg/ml calf thymus DNA), 200 ng of anti-p53 polyclonal antibody 421 and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 15 min followed by binding with labeled oligonucleotide for 30 min. The nuclear protein was separated by electrophoresis using a 4% native polyacrylamide gel and 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA as running buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak Biomax x-ray film overnight. Thioredoxin Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Cells were homogenized in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml antipain. Lysates were microcentrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. The protein concentration in the supernatant was measured using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed as described previously (30Das K.C. White C.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 211: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All statistical analysis was performed using the InStat software program (versions 2.01 and 3.0). All experiments were repeated at least twice. Increased Expression of Redox-active Trx Enhances Apoptosis in Response to Daunomycin—To test whether Trx overexpression protects MCF-7 cells against daunomycin-mediated apoptosis, we treated vector, Trx9, or Serb4 cells (clones of MCF-7 cells) with daunomycin and determined apoptosis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” First we determined apoptosis using TUNEL assay, which detects nicks in the DNA that are generated during DNA damage and apoptosis. We expected to find more TUNEL-positive nuclei in Serb4 cells compared with Trx9 cells in response to daunomycin because previous studies show that Trx could protect against the cytotoxic actions of other anticancer drugs such as cisplatin and bleomycin (31Sasada T. Iwata S. Sato N. Kitaoka Y. Hirota K. Nakamura K. Nishiyama A. Taniguchi Y. Takabayashi A. Yodoi J. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 2268-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 32Sasada T. Nakamura H. Ueda S. Sato N. Kitaoka Y. Gon Y. Takabayashi A. Spyrou G. Holmgren A. Yodoi J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 33Yokomizo A. Ono M. Nanri H. Makino Y. Ohga T. Wada M. Okamoto T. Yodoi J. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4293-4296PubMed Google Scholar). However, to our surprise we observed a higher number of TUNEL-positive Trx9 cells (Fig. 1, A and B) in response to daunomycin. TUNEL assay detects nicks generated by drug-induced DNA damage and endonuclease activation during apoptosis. MCF-7 cells lack caspase-3 and do not undergo classical DNA laddering during apoptosis. Therefore, we further determined apoptotic cells as the “sub-G1” population by flow cytometry by propidium iodide staining. Treatment of vector, Trx9 or Serb4 clones with daunomycin resulted in the appearance of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Trx9 cells showed a higher percentage of apoptotic cells (23%) compared with vector or Serb4 cells (8%). These data also agree with our TUNEL data that show increased apoptosis of Trx9 cells in response to daunomycin. Trx activity was assayed in vector, Serb4, and Trx9 cells using insulin reduction assay as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1E). Decreased Clonogenic Survival of MCF-7 Cells Overexpressing Trx—After cytotoxic treatment, cells can survive DNA damage through various repair processes and may continue to propagate into colonies (34Islam M.M. Begum S. Lin L. Okamura A. Du M. Fujimura S. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2002; 49: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 35Munshi A. Hobbs M. Meyn R.E. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 110: 21-28PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we compared the clonogenic survival of Trx9, Serb4, or vector cells treated with daunomycin at concentrations as low as 0.025 μm. A clonogenic assay is a more stringent assessment of chemosensitivity than TUNEL or sub-G1 peak measurements (34Islam M.M. Begum S. Lin L. Okamura A. Du M. Fujimura S. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2002; 49: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 35Munshi A. Hobbs M. Meyn R.E. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 110: 21-28PubMed Google Scholar). Trx9 cells treated with daunomycin formed significantly less colonies at the end of 14 days, whereas vector cells treated with daunomycin formed several colonies (Fig. 2A). Thus MCF-7 cells overexpressing Trx exhibited increased apoptosis and decreased clonogenic survival in the presence of daunomycin as compared with vector-transfected cells. In addition to MCF-7 clones, we also generated Trx- or dnTrx-expressing clones in A549 cells to test whether the observations with MCF-7 cells could be reproduced in other cell types. As demonstrated in Fig. 2B, A549-vector only clones or A549-dnTrx clones showed several colonies at the end of 14 days, whereas A549-Trx clones did not show a significant number of colonies. These data demonstrate that either A549 cells or MCF-7 cells expressing a higher level of Trx undergo increased apoptosis and decreased clonogenic survival in response to daunomycin. Next to determine whether endogenous Trx contributes to apoptosis induced by anthracyclines, we used RNA interference to down-regulate Trx expression. Silencing Trx Expression by siRNA Decreases Apoptosis in MCF-7 Cells as Well as in A549 Cells in Response to Daunomycin—The apoptosis experiments described above were done using Trx- or dnTrx-overexpressing clones of MCF-7 cells. Therefore, there is reason to believe that the data obtained could be specifically applicable to a specific clone of Trx or dnTrx of MCF-7 cells. In addition, it is not clear whether the effects that were observed are only related to the overexpression of Trx. Therefore, to understand the role of endogenous Trx in apoptosis induced by daunomycin, we down-regulated the level of Trx in MCF-7 cells using a siRNA approach. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment of MCF-7 cells with Trx siRNA down-regulated the Trx protein level. The decrease was about 95% compared with cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA. Following siRNA transfection, cells were treated with daunomycin, and the levels of apoptotic markers were evaluated by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B (top panel) and Fig. 3C, MCF-7 cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA and treated with daunomycin demonstrated a significant increase in p53 protein level. In contrast, cells treated with Trx siRNA demonstrated a significantly (p < 0.001) lower level of p53 protein in response to daunomycin treatment (Fig. 3C). Additionally the level of active caspase-7 (Fig. 3B, second panel, and Fig. 3D) and the level of cleaved PARP (Fig. 3B,third panel, and Fig. 3E) were also significantly (p < 0.001) decreased in Trx siRNA-transfected cells compared with non-targeting siRNA-transfected cells. These data demonstrate a crucial role of endogenous Trx in daunomycin-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that caspase-1 expression is upregulated in response to doxorubicin in a p53-dependent manner in MCF-7 cells (36Gupta S. Radha V. Furukawa Y. Swarup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10585-10588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37Sadasivam S. Gupta S. Radha V. Batta K. Kundu T.K. Swarup G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because caspase-1 expression is proapoptotic and its expression is dependent on p53, we examined the level of caspase-1 in response to daunomycin treatment and the effect of silencing Trx on the expression of caspase-1. In addition, we also examined the expression of caspase-6 and cleaved caspase-8 expression in re"

Light activation of NpSRII leads to a displacement of helix F, which in turn triggers a rotation/screw-like motion of TM2 in NpHtrII. This conformational change is thought to be transmitted through the membrane adjacent conserved signal transduction domain in histidine kinases, adenylyl cyclases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, and phosphatases (HAMP domain) to the cytoplasmic signaling domain of the transducer. The architecture and function of the HAMP domain are still unknown. In order to obtain information on the structure and dynamics of this region, EPR experiments on a truncated transducer (NpHtrII157) and NpSRII, site-directed spin-labeled and reconstituted into purple membrane lipids, have been carried out. A nitroxide scanning involving residues in the transducer helix TM2, in the predicted AS-1 region, and at selected positions in the following connector and AS-2 regions of the HAMP domain has been performed. Accessibility and dynamics data allowed us to identify a helical region up to residue Ala94 in the AS-1 amphipathic sequence, followed by a highly dynamic domain protruding into the water phase. Additionally, transducer-transducer and transducer-receptor proximity relations revealed the overall architecture of the AS-1 sequences in the 2:2 complex, which are suggested to form a molten globular type of a coiled-coil bundle.

Light activation of NpSRII leads to a displacement of helix F, which in turn triggers a rotation/screw-like motion of TM2 in NpHtrII. This conformational change is thought to be transmitted through the membrane adjacent conserved signal transduction domain in histidine kinases, adenylyl cyclases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, and phosphatases (HAMP domain) to the cytoplasmic signaling domain of the transducer. The architecture and function of the HAMP domain are still unknown. In order to obtain information on the structure and dynamics of this region, EPR experiments on a truncated transducer (NpHtrII157) and NpSRII, site-directed spin-labeled and reconstituted into purple membrane lipids, have been carried out. A nitroxide scanning involving residues in the transducer helix TM2, in the predicted AS-1 region, and at selected positions in the following connector and AS-2 regions of the HAMP domain has been performed. Accessibility and dynamics data allowed us to identify a helical region up to residue Ala94 in the AS-1 amphipathic sequence, followed by a highly dynamic domain protruding into the water phase. Additionally, transducer-transducer and transducer-receptor proximity relations revealed the overall architecture of the AS-1 sequences in the 2:2 complex, which are suggested to form a molten globular type of a coiled-coil bundle. Phototaxis in halophilic Archaea is mediated by two sensory rhodopsins, SRI and SRII (also named phoborhodopsin (1.Tomioka H. Takahashi T. Kamo N. Kobatake Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)), which structurally and functionally are closely related to the two light-driven ion pumps bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin (2.Spudich J.L.

The photophobic receptor SRII is tightly bound to its cognate transducer protein HtrII, which exhibits a transmembrane and a cytoplasmic signaling domain, connected via a linker region including a HAMP 5The abbreviations used are: HAMP domain, conserved signal transduction domain in histidine kinases, adenylyl cyclases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, and phosphatases; NpSRII, Natronomonas pharaonis sensory rhodopsin II; NpHtrII157, Natronomonas pharaonis halobacterial transducer of rhodopsins II, truncated at residue 157; PML, purple membrane lipids; SDSL site directed spin labeling; mT, millitesla; CrOx, chromium oxalate. domain (4.Aravind L.

Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). This is suggested to be a conserved signal transduction domain identified in histidine kinases, adenylyl cyclases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, and phosphatases (4.Aravind L. Ponting C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane N-terminal domain consists of two transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2) and comprises part of the receptor-binding site. The x-ray crystallographic structure (6.Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Büldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) of the complex formed by SRII and a C-terminal truncated HtrII from Natronomonas pharaonis revealed the close interaction between the transducer transmembrane helices and the receptor helices F and G. No structural data are available for the transducer beyond position 82. Based on primary sequence homologies, the HAMP domain is predicted to consist of two helical amphipathic sequences (AS-1 and AS-2) linked by a connector sequence of undefined secondary structure (Fig. 1) (7.Appleman J.A. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite many efforts, there are no structural or functional data available for any of the HAMP domains. The long rod-shaped cytoplasmic domain of the transducer, which is suggested to be arranged in a four-helix bundle in analogy to the chemoreceptors Tsr and Tar from Escherichia coli (8.Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), harbors the signaling domain involved in the signal transfer to the His kinase CheA and the methylation sites implicated in adaptation processes to constant stimuli. As shown previously (9.Jung K.-H. Spudich E.N. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6365-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10.Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a chimeric fusion protein consisting of SRII fused to an HtrII C-terminally truncated from N. pharaonis joined to the cytoplasmic domain of E. coli chemotaxis receptor Tsr is able to perform photosignaling activity, thus further supporting a common design for the two cytoplasmic signaling domains. Previous SDSL EPR studies (11.Wegener A.A. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12.Wegener A.A. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.-J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13.Klare J.P. Bordignon E. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.-J. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) suggested that the transduction of the signal is triggered by a light-induced movement of helix F, which in turn induces a rotary/screw-like motion of the transducer helix TM2. How this TM2 movement, which has been proven so far in the transmembrane transducer region (positions 78-82), is subsequently propagated along the cytoplasmic rod to the CheA-binding site is still a matter of debate. Complexed to NpHtrII, the receptor NpSRII is no longer capable of light-driven proton pumping (14.Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Sumi M. Kamo N. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 916-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15.Schmies G. Engelhard M. Wood P.G. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This observation has been utilized in a study (16.Hippler-Mreyen S. Klare J.P. Wegener A.A. Seidel R. Herrmann C. Schmies G. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Engelhard M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) applying calorimetric and electrophysiological methods to identify the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor binding domain of NpHtrII. It was shown that an N-terminal sequence of 114 amino acids is sufficient for tight binding and for blocking of the proton pump. The cytoplasmic portion of the transducer, which is responsible for the inhibition of the proton pump, is located in the connector region of the HAMP domain (Fig. 1). Recent studies on the linker region of NpHtrII (17.Yang C.S. Sineshchekov O. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42970-42976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and HtrI (18.Chen X. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42964-42969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (corresponding to positions 87-95, numbering according to NpHtrII) revealed initial insight into the topology of the membrane proximal domain of the transducer with respect to the receptor in the solubilized complex. We report here the use of SDSL EPR to investigate the structure and the overall architecture of the HAMP domain in the 2:2 complex. Residues in the transducer helix TM2 (Val78-Leu82) and those succeeding this helix in the predicted helical amphipathic sequence AS-1 (Gly83-Gly101) were mutated to cysteines and subsequently coupled to the methanethiosulfonate spin label. Additionally, four residues in the negatively charged region connecting AS-1 to AS-2 (Leu105, Asp106, Asp115, and Glu116), one in the AS-2 region (Ala122), and one close to the C-terminal end of NpHtrII157 (Ala148) have been investigated (Figs. 1 and 2). The topology of the complex at the level of the transducer linker region has been elucidated by using four parameters addressable by EPR spectroscopy: the mobility of the spin label side chains R1; their orientation toward buffer, lipid, or protein interior; the polarity of their environment; and distances between two spin labels. Bacterial Strains—E. coli XL1 was used as a host for DNA manipulations. Gene expression was carried out in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Cysteine Mutants—Starting with the plasmids pET27bmod-npsopII-His (19.Hohenfeld I.P. Wegener A.A. Engelhard M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and pET27bmod-nphtrII157-His (C-terminally truncated transducer (1-157)) (12.Wegener A.A. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.-J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), cysteine encoding mutations were introduced by using the overlap extension method as described previously (20.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6770) Google Scholar). The final PCR products were ligated into pET27bmod by using the NcoI and HindIII restriction sites. Positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Spin Labeling—NpSRII-His, NpHtrII157-His, and respective cysteine mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) according to Shimono et al. (21.Shimono K. Iwamoto M. Sumi M. Kamo N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and purified as described in Hohenfeld et al. (19.Hohenfeld I.P. Wegener A.A. Engelhard M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The methanethiosulfonate spin label (the corresponding side chain is also abbreviated as R1; TRC, Toronto, Canada) was covalently attached to the cysteine residues of the solubilized NpSRII-His or NpH-trII157-His mutants as outlined by Pfeiffer et al. (22.Pfeiffer M. Rink T. Gerwert K. Oesterhelt D. Steinhoff H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Excess label was removed by DEAE chromatography. For preparation of the complex, both components were isolated independently and mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. For reconstitution into purple membrane lipids (PML), the mixtures were shaken (16 h at 4 °C in the dark) in a buffer (1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8) containing a 40-fold excess of lipids and detergent-absorbing Biobeads (SM2; 10 mg/mg dodecyl maltoside; Roche Applied Science). After filtration, the reconstituted protein-containing membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g and resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8. EPR Measurements—Room temperature continuous wave EPR spectra were recorded using a homemade EPR spectrometer equipped with a Bruker dielectric resonator, with the microwave power set to 0.4-0.6 milliwatt, and B-field modulation amplitude adjusted to 0.15 mT. Samples were loaded into EPR glass capillaries (0.9 mm inner diameter) at final concentrations of 15-20 mg/ml (sample volume 15 μl). EPR spectra for interspin distance determination were recorded at 160 K using a homemade EPR spectrometer equipped with an AEG H103 rectangular cavity. The magnetic field was measured with a B-NM 12 B-field meter (Bruker). A continuous flow cryostat Oxford ESR 900 allowed stabilization of the sample temperature. The microwave power was set to 0.2 milliwatt and the B-field modulation amplitude adjusted to 0.25 mT. Samples were loaded into EPR quartz capillaries (3-mm inner diameter) at final concentrations of 15-20 mg/ml protein (sample volume 40 μl). The accessibility for paramagnetic quenchers, ∏, was quantified by the method of continuous wave power saturation (23.Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 24.Altenbach C. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The EPR spectrometer equipped with the Bruker dielectric resonator was used; microwave power from 0.1 to 30-40 milliwatts was applied to the sample. The protein sample was loaded into a gas-permeable TPX capillary (Spintec). The sample was deoxygenated by a nitrogen gas flow around the capillary for the reference measurements; for oxygen-accessibility measurements nitrogen was replaced by air (21% O2); for water-accessibility measurements a chromium oxalate (CrOx) solution was added to the same sample to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the nitrogen gas flow was restored. In case of high accessibility values, the measurements were repeated with 25 mm CrOx to minimize errors in the fitting procedure. The accessibility values obtained were then multiplied by 2 to obtain the expected values for 50 mm CrOx. Prior to EPR experiments, the sample was fluxed with the proper gas for 20 min. The errors of the ∏ values were determined to be in the range of ±10%. For positions 95-101, accessibility experiments using the neutral Ni-ethylene diamine-N,N′-diacetic acid (20 mm) as a paramagnetic relaxing agent were also performed. No differences were observed between the trends of ∏ values obtained with the two water-soluble relaxing agents. Fitting of Simulated EPR Spectra—Fitting of simulated dipolar broadened EPR powder spectra to the experimental ones detected at 160 K was performed according to the method described in detail by Steinhoff and co-workers (25.Steinhoff H.-J. Radzwill N. Thevis W. Lenz V. Brandenburg D. Antson A. Dodson G. Wollmer A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 3287-3298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because of the flexible spin label side chain, a random distribution of nitroxide ring orientation with respect to the interspin distance vector is assumed. To account for a range of distances expected to arise from these different orientations, a Gaussian distribution of interspin distances with 0.2 nm width is allowed. During the fitting procedure, the g tensor values, two components of the A tensor, and the line width parameters were fixed according to the values found from analysis of the corresponding singly labeled species. For the spin-labeled transducer in the reconstituted complex, this was achieved with a 1:4 labeled/unlabeled mixture that leads to a negligible amount of doubly labeled dimers in the sample or with the solubilized form of the complex that leads to the disruption of the dimer. For the spin-labeled receptor, the singly labeled mutants in the reconstituted or solubilized form were considered. The analysis of several singly labeled mutants allows us to obtain the fitting parameters suitable for the fit of all the spectra. The spectrum of the solubilized NpSRII/NpHtrII-A94R1 was chosen as the reference spectrum without dipolar broadening (Fig. 6). The parameters used are gxx = 2.0086, gyy = 2.0066, gzz = 2.0026, Axx = 0.52 mT, Ayy = 0.45 mT, and Azz was variable to account for different polarity of the spin label environment (12.Wegener A.A. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.-J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 26.Steinhoff H.-J. Savitsky A. Wegener C. Pfeiffer M. Plato M. Möbius K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1457: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27.Plato M. Steinhoff H.-J. Wegener C. Törring J.T. Savitsky A. Möbius K. Mol. Phys. 2002; 100: 3711-3721Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The spectra were convoluted with a field-independent line shape function composed of a superposition of 44% Lorentzian and 56% gaussian of 0.3 and 0.39 mT, respectively. The fitting parameters for the determination of the dipolar broadening are thus the average interspin distance, the fraction of the singly labeled component, and Azz. The fraction of the singly spin-labeled component has been estimated from spin labeling efficiency calculations performed on the investigated mutants to be in the range of 40%. Fitting of simulated EPR spectra to the experimental ones detected between 278 and 308 K (Fig. 5) was performed according to the Brownian model of isotropic reorientational diffusion (28.Fried J.P. Berliner L.J. Spin Labeling: Theory and Applications. Academic Press, New York1976: 83-91Google Scholar). The rotational correlation times for the two spectral components were allowed to vary with temperature. The obtained ratio of the two spectral components was used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters in terms of a simple thermodynamic equilibrium between two conformations. The nitroxide scanning was performed on samples covering the first predicted helix of the HAMP domain (AS-1). Additionally, residues in the connector and in the AS-2 sequence were chosen in order to determine the inter-relationship and connectivity of the transducer molecules in the 2:2 complex (see Figs. 1 and 2). In a first set of experiments, the spin label side chain mobility and accessibility are determined. The temperature effects on the spectral features are analyzed, and finally interspin distances are determined between the two transducers as well as between the transducer and the receptor. Analysis of Side Chain Mobility and Accessibility—The room temperature X-band EPR spectra detected for the spin-labeled residues in the NpSRII-HtrII complex reconstituted in PML are presented in Fig. 3. The majority of the EPR spectra detected presents a composite spectral shape, revealing the presence of at least two components that could arise, as noted previously by Hubbell et al. (29.Hubbell W.L. Mchaourab H.S. Altenbach C. Lietzow M.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 779-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), from inhomogeneous structural constraints in the protein environment surrounding the label. It is evident that moving from the transducer transmembrane region toward the predicted AS-1 domain up to position 101 that the EPR spectra show a gradual decrease of the spectral line widths. The room temperature EPR line shape reflects the mobility of the spin label side chain that depends on its topographical location. The term “mobility” is used in a general sense, and it includes effects on the spectra because of the motional rate, amplitude, and anisotropy of the nitroxide reorientation, characterizing the motional freedom of the nitroxide in the nanosecond time scale. Interactions between the nitroxide and neighboring side chains or backbone atoms may restrict its mobility, thus causing a broadening of the EPR lines and an increase in the apparent hyperfine splitting. Strong interactions result in a powder-like spectral pattern with a resolved high field hyperfine line and a large hyperfine splitting in the spectrum (for example see position 78 in Fig. 3, right panel). On the contrary, weak interactions between the nitroxide and the rest of the protein, as found for helix surface sites or loop regions, result in narrowing of the EPR lines and a decrease of the apparent hyperfine splitting in the spectra (for example see position 88 in Fig. 3, right panel). In addition, protein backbone dynamics contribute to the overall mobility of the spin label side chain. Dynamic domains exhibit very high mobility values, and the EPR spectral features resemble those of a free spin label in viscous solutions (for example see positions 98 and 122 in Fig. 3, right panel). The mobility can be quantified via the parameter (ΔH0−1 which is the inverse line width of the central resonance line (29.Hubbell W.L. Mchaourab H.S. Altenbach C. Lietzow M.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 779-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The resulting mobility profile is shown in Fig. 4A. All residues located in the transmembrane region of the complex (Val78-Leu82) and the following residues up to Ala87 are characterized by low mobility values (∼1.5 mT-1), suggesting a close packing of the complex up to position 87. From residues Ala88 to Ala94 the R1 side chain mobility gradually increases and finally reaches very high values (∼4.5 mT-1) in the Ala95-Gly101 region, which clearly point to the presence of a very dynamic AS-1 C-terminal end lacking fixed structural features. The mobility profile of Fig. 4A reveals a periodicity of the (ΔH0−1 values up to position 94; however, the periodicity pattern is not directly commensurable with a canonical α-helix. The residues investigated in the predicted charged region connecting AS-1 and AS-2 also show a lack of a rigid structure and of close tertiary interactions with neighboring residues (positions 105, 106, 115, and 116). Positions 122 in the AS-2 sequence (f in the heptad repeat) and 148 show as well spectra characterized by high mobility. Accessibility measurements were performed to distinguish residues exposed to the water or lipid phases or buried in the protein interior. The collision frequency between the nitroxide and the water-soluble CrOx is negligible for side chains not exposed to the bulk water. On the other hand, molecular oxygen allows us to distinguish between side chains oriented into the protein interior, showing a low collision frequency, and those directed into the lipid bilayer, exhibiting a high accessibility. The change in the electron longitudinal relaxation time (T1) is a relative measure of the collision frequency between the nitroxide and the paramagnetic relaxing agent and can be determined by the method of continuous wave power saturation according to Altenbach et al. (23.Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 24.Altenbach C. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B shows the accessibility data for the AS-1 region in terms of the dimensionless parameter ∏, which is proportional to the collision frequency of the R1 side chain with either oxygen or CrOx. Low values for both ∏CrOx and ∏Oxygen are found for side chains up to position 86, showing a periodicity for ∏Oxygen typical for an α-helical secondary structure. It is worth noting the consistency between the low ∏ values observed characteristically for residues in a dense protein packing interface and the low mobility values measured for the same region. For positions 87-94 the ∏CrOx values gradually increase, in line with the notion that the side chains become more dynamic and more exposed to the bulk water. Accordingly, the ∏Oxygen values are also increasing. The periodicity observed in this region cannot be directly ascribed to a helical pattern, although it might be present. The reason for this failure to recognize possible secondary structure elements might be the fact that for interfacial regions the accessibility/mobility data lose their statistical significance (30.Cuello L.G. Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Science. 2004; 306: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). From positions 95 to 101, the ∏CrOx values approach those typical for water-exposed residues. Most interestingly, the decreased CrOx accessibility observed in the water-exposed region at positions 97 and 98 suggests possible interactions with neighboring residues that can hinder the CrOx diffusion toward the spin label attached at those sites. The almost constant level of ∏Oxygen (∼0.6) obtained for positions 91-101 is indicative of nitroxides exposed to the aqueous phase. The mobility and accessibility data for the predicted AS-1 sequence in the HAMP domain demonstrate its gradual protrusion from the transmembrane region to the aqueous phase. Moreover, the data enabled us to distinguish among three segments within the 83-101 sequence: the first (Gly83-Ala87) characterized by helical periodicity and close contact with neighboring residues; the second (Ala88-Ala94) still characterized by a periodical pattern and intermediate in mobility located in the membrane adjacent region; and the third (Ala95-Gly101) exposed to the bulk aqueous phase lacking fixed structural features. Polarity Measurements—The Azz parameters obtained from the low temperature spectra of the positions under investigation in the HAMP domain are presented in Fig. 4C and compared with the mobility and accessibility data already presented. The gradual increase of the Azz values from positions 78 to 94 confirms that the first part of the AS-1 sequence is protruding from the protein/protein interface into a more polar aqueous environment, in agreement with the findings based on mobility and accessibility data. The third segment in the AS-1 sequence (positions 95-101), which has been shown to be a very dynamic region exposed to the bulk water phase, is indeed characterized by higher Azz values up to 3.60 mT for positions 95 and 101. However, for those residues fully exposed to water, the expected values should be in the 3.6-3.7 mT range (26.Steinhoff H.-J. Savitsky A. Wegener C. Pfeiffer M. Plato M. Möbius K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1457: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27.Plato M. Steinhoff H.-J. Wegener C. Törring J.T. Savitsky A. Möbius K. Mol. Phys. 2002; 100: 3711-3721Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), as observed for positions 105, 115, and 122 in the following region. Lowering the temperature might favor a more compact packing of the transducers in the complex, as already suggested by the decrease of the fraction of the mobile component in the spectra (Fig. 5A). This fact could explain the relatively low polarity values obtained for the dynamic region of the AS-1 sequence. Nevertheless, the trend of the Azz values versus residue number reflects the ∏CrOx profile, with a remarkable decrease in both polarity and water accessibility around positions 94 and 97. This clearly indicates the presence of a similar topology of the transducer in the complex at room and low temperatures. Temperature Effects on the EPR Spectral Features—To investigate the molecular origin of the presence of two spectral components in the room temperature EPR spectra, we analyzed the spectra in terms of a"
https://openalex.org/W2059242809,"Members of the lipocalin protein family are typically small, secreted proteins that possess a variety of functions. Although the physiological role of lipocalin 2 remains to be fully elucidated, a few pivotal functions have recently been reported, e.g., regulation of the apoptosis of leukocytes. Unexpectedly, lipocalin 2 is abundantly expressed in erythroid progenitor cells. An in vitro culture experiment demonstrated that lipocalin 2 induces apoptosis and inhibits differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells. During acute anemia the expression of lipocalin 2 was reduced in erythroid cells by a feedback system. Furthermore, injection of recombinant lipocalin 2 into mice suffering from acute anemia retarded the recovery of red blood cell (RBC) numbers, suggesting the importance of reduced expression of lipocalin 2 for the efficient recovery of RBC numbers. These results indicate that lipocalin 2 suppresses RBC production in an autocrine fashion. Hence, anemia arising from pathological conditions, such as chronic inflammation, might be partly due to increased levels of lipocalin 2 secreted from expanded leukocytes and/or macrophages. Also, anemia arising from malignancies might be partly due to the abundant secretion of lipocalin 2 from tumor cells. Thus, lipocalin 2 may represent an attractive therapeutic target for anemia under certain pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2060107828,"Recent findings associate the control of stereochemistry in lipoxygenase (LOX) catalysis with a conserved active site alanine for S configuration hydroperoxide products, or a corresponding glycine for R stereoconfiguration. To further elucidate the mechanistic basis for this stereocontrol we compared the stereoselectivity of the initiating hydrogen abstraction in soybean LOX-1 and an Ala542Gly mutant that converts linoleic acid to both 13S and 9R configuration hydroperoxide products. Using 11R-3H- and 11S-3H-labeled linoleic acid substrates to examine the initial hydrogen abstraction, we found that all the primary hydroperoxide products were formed with an identical and highly stereoselective pro-S hydrogen abstraction from C-11 of the substrate (97-99% pro-S-selective). This strongly suggests that 9R and 13S oxygenations occur with the same binding orientation of substrate in the active site, and as the equivalent 9R and 13S products were formed from a bulky ester derivative (1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoylphosphatidylcholine), one can infer that the orientation is tail-first. Both the EPR spectrum and the reaction kinetics were altered by the R product-inducing Ala-Gly mutation, indicating a substantial influence of this Ala-Gly substitution extending to the environment of the active site iron. To examine also the reversed orientation of substrate binding, we studied oxygenation of the 15S-hydroperoxide of arachidonic acid by the Ala542Gly mutant soybean LOX-1. In addition to the usual 5S, 15S- and 8S, 15S-dihydroperoxides, a new product was formed and identified by high-performance liquid chromatography, UV, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and NMR as 9R, 15S-dihydroperoxyeicosa-5Z,7E,11Z,13E-tetraenoic acid, the R configuration “partner” of the normal 5S,15S product. This provides evidence that both tail-first and carboxylate end-first binding of substrate can be associated with S or R partnerships in product formation in the same active site. Recent findings associate the control of stereochemistry in lipoxygenase (LOX) catalysis with a conserved active site alanine for S configuration hydroperoxide products, or a corresponding glycine for R stereoconfiguration. To further elucidate the mechanistic basis for this stereocontrol we compared the stereoselectivity of the initiating hydrogen abstraction in soybean LOX-1 and an Ala542Gly mutant that converts linoleic acid to both 13S and 9R configuration hydroperoxide products. Using 11R-3H- and 11S-3H-labeled linoleic acid substrates to examine the initial hydrogen abstraction, we found that all the primary hydroperoxide products were formed with an identical and highly stereoselective pro-S hydrogen abstraction from C-11 of the substrate (97-99% pro-S-selective). This strongly suggests that 9R and 13S oxygenations occur with the same binding orientation of substrate in the active site, and as the equivalent 9R and 13S products were formed from a bulky ester derivative (1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoylphosphatidylcholine), one can infer that the orientation is tail-first.

To examine also the reversed orientation of substrate binding, we studied oxygenation of the 15S-hydroperoxide of arachidonic acid by the Ala542Gly mutant soybean LOX-1. In addition to the usual 5S, 15S- and 8S, 15S-dihydroperoxides, a new product was formed and identified by high-performance liquid chromatography, UV, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and NMR as 9R, 15S-dihydroperoxyeicosa-5Z,7E,11Z,13E-tetraenoic acid, the R configuration “partner” of the normal 5S,15S product. This provides evidence that both tail-first and carboxylate end-first binding of substrate can be associated with S or R partnerships in product formation in the same active site. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are oxygenated to signaling molecules of very specific structure by the dioxygenases lipoxygenase (LOX) 4The abbreviations used are: LOX, lipoxygenase; AA, arachidonic acid; LA, linoleic acid; H(P)ODE, hydro(pero)xyoctadecadienoic acid; H(P)ETE, hydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoic acid; diH(P)ETE, dihydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoic acid; C16/LA-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoylphosphatidylcholine; C16/AA-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoylphosphatidylcholine; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; SP-HPLC, straightphase HPLC; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; TPP, triphenylphosphine.4The abbreviations used are: LOX, lipoxygenase; AA, arachidonic acid; LA, linoleic acid; H(P)ODE, hydro(pero)xyoctadecadienoic acid; H(P)ETE, hydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoic acid; diH(P)ETE, dihydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoic acid; C16/LA-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoylphosphatidylcholine; C16/AA-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoylphosphatidylcholine; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; SP-HPLC, straightphase HPLC; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; TPP, triphenylphosphine. and cyclooxygenase, and by the cytochrome P450 class of monooxygenase (1.Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 2.Rouzer C.A. Marnett L.J. Chem.

One of the fundamental differences lies in activation of the fatty acid by the dioxygenases compared with oxygen activation by the P450s. In the case of P450s, the oxygen is bound to the heme iron, and the control of reaction specificity largely depends on the specific binding of substrate and its presentation to the activated ferryl oxygen (4.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995: 245-303Crossref Google Scholar, 5.Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem.

By contrast, in both classes of dioxygenase the fatty acid substrate is activated to a radical species capable of instantaneous reaction with molecular oxygen (1.Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 2.Rouzer C.A. Marnett L.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2239-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar); all elements of reaction specificity thus depend on arranging the meeting of molecular oxygen with the correct site on the substrate radical. All the evidence suggests that the reacting oxygen molecule is untethered and that other factors in the enzyme active site must determine the reaction outcome. In particular, cyclooxygenase enzymes have no residues capable of direct oxygen binding within the oxygenase active site (7.Malkowski M.G. Ginell S.L. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 8.Kurumbail R.G. Kiefer J.R. Marnett L.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas for lipoxygenases there is both spectroscopic and kinetic isotope data to refute the involvement of the active site nonheme iron in oxygen binding (9.van der Heijdt L.M. Schilstra M.J. Feiters M.C. Nolting H.F. Hermes C. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 186-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Glickman M.H. Klinman J.P.

Proteins. 1996; 24: 275-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The possibility of oxygen channeling through the protein is one potential means of achieving the targeting of O2 onto a particular carbon of the reacting fatty acid radical (12.Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 13.Knapp M.J. Klinman J.P.

Soc. 2001; 123: 2931-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The influence of protein residues in shielding some of the reactive carbons must also figure into the control of product regiochemistry and stereochemistry. These two options relate directly to the studies we report here on the specificity of reaction by soybean lipoxygenase. Soybean LOX-1 is the prototypical enzyme of its class and is the best-studied model of lipoxygenase catalysis and structure. Mechanistic studies are supported by the availability of two high resolution x-ray crystal structures (12.Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 15.Minor W. Steczko J. Stec B. Otwinowski Z. Bolin J.T. Walter R. Axelrod B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10687-10701Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Soybean LOX-1 has been used over the years to establish many fundamental concepts of lipoxygenase catalysis. Among these are the high specificity of the reaction and formation of a chiral product (16.Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5329-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the sole product is 13S-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (13S-HPODE) from linoleic acid, and the corresponding 15S-hydroperoxide from arachidonic acid. Early on it was shown that the specific oxygenation is associated with a highly stereoselective initial hydrogen abstraction from the fatty acid and that the two events occur on opposite faces of the reacting pentadiene (an antarafacial relationship) (16.Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5329-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Egmond M.R. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F. Boldingh J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 54: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Related observations in comparing the 9S-specific corn lipoxygenase with the 13S-specific soybean enzyme led to the important concept of substrate being capable of adopting a reversed orientation of binding in the lipoxygenase active site (18.Egmond M.R. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This reversed orientation hypothesis has remained open to debate in that there is no LOX structure available with bound substrate to directly support or refute the various lines of argument. Indeed, a recent study suggested a head-first substrate orientation for the first oxygenation by soybean LOX-1 (19.Ruddat V.C. Mogul R. Chorny I. Chen C. Perrin N. Whitman S. Kenyon V. Jacobson M.P. Bernasconi C.F. Holman T.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13063-13071Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the absence of an x-ray structure with bound substrate, modeling stands as one useful approach to understanding concepts developed by analysis of the stereochemistry of the lipoxygenase reaction and the influence of modifications to the protein structure (14.Knapp M.J. Seebeck F.P. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2931-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20.Borngräber S. Browner M. Gillmor S. Gerth C. Anton M. Fletterick R. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37345-37350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A recent study described the importance of a conserved lipoxygenase active site residue in controlling the regio- and stereospecificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation (21.Coffa G. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15579-15584Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The residue is conserved as an Ala in lipoxygenases that form S-specific hydroperoxides and as Gly in the R-hydroperoxide-forming enzymes. The Ala → Gly mutation in the enzymes studied at least partially switched the position and R or S chirality of oxygenation on the substrate such that an enzyme with original 8R-specificity could be mutated to make 12S product, 15S to 11R, and so on. These changes correspond to a switch in the position of oxygenation from one end of the fatty acid pentadiene intermediate to the other. The aim of the present study was to investigate some novel aspects of the reaction of wild-type and Ala542 → Gly mutant soybean LOX-1, including the specificity of the associated hydrogen abstraction and the characteristics of double dioxygenation as they pertain to our understanding of substrate binding and the stereocontrol of oxygenation. Materials and Procedures—Mutagenesis primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit, La Jolla, CA). Plasmids were purified using QIAprep Spin Miniprep kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Stratagene XL1-Blue super competent cells and BL21-Gold(DE3) cells were transformed for plasmid amplification and protein expression, respectively. BugBuster protein extraction reagent was from Novagen (Madison, WI). It was supplemented with 0.8 μg/ml DNase and 5.0 mm MgCl2 before use. Escherichia coli spheroplasts were prepared in TSE (0.1 m Tris acetate, 0.5 m sucrose, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6). Ni-NTA affinity agarose (His·Bind Superflow, Novagen) was prepared in wash buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, and 3 mm sodium azide, pH 8.0) to remove ethanol. All buffers from BugBuster through the Ni-NTA buffers contained phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine, both at 1 mm. Anion exchange chromatography medium was DE-52 (Whatman). The DE-52 column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 m sodium chloride in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. HPLC purification was performed using a Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) HPLC system (GP50 gradient pump) with a size exclusion column (Superdex 200 HR 10/30, Amersham Biosciences) and a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The HPLC buffer was 0.02 m potassium Pi, 0.15 m KCl, 3.0 mm sodium azide, pH 7.3. Mutagenesis of Soybean LOX-1—Soybean LOX-1 was cloned from whole, mature green pods of plants cultured from organically grown soybeans (22.Maguire B.C. Expression of Apolipoprotein C-II: Structural and Biophysical Studies. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore1999: 117Google Scholar). To insert an N-terminal His6 tag, the soybean LOX-1 cDNA was then subcloned into the pET-30Xa/LIC (Novagen) expression vector following the manufacturer's instructions. Mutant plasmids were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using overlapping mismatching primers containing the desired mutation following manufacturer's instructions. Correctly mutated plasmids were identified by sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed at the FSU Biology DNA Sequencing Facility using an Applied Biosystems 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Cloning and Expression—The plasmid originally constructed from soybean mRNA transcript had three single base mutations that were corrected by mutagenesis to the J02795 coding sequence, and one three-base mutation (AGT to GAG at positions 478-480 encoding a Ser160 Glu change) that was retained in the construct for most experiments. Ser160 was introduced for some comparisons, as indicated in the text. The yield of expressed protein was improved by lowering the temperature of incubation after isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and by lengthening the incubation period, until the final condition of 14 °C for 30 h was determined to be optimal. The isolated protein yield was halved if the cells were harvested after 24 h. The mutant proteins examined in this study were Ala542 → Gly, Ala542 → Ser, Ala542 → Thr, and Ala542 → Val. Yields of the expressed mutant proteins were similar to yields of native lipoxygenase: typically 10 mg of lipoxygenase/liter of original culture were obtained after purification for wild-type and somewhat less for mutants. Wild-type and mutant soybean LOX-1 were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) Gold (Stratagene). Overnight cultures in LB (37 °C) were diluted 200-fold into multiple 1-liter flasks containing 375 ml of TB. Cultures were grown to A600 > 1.2 (4-5 h, 37 °C), cooled to 14 °C, induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm), and grown for 30 h at 8 °C. Cells were harvested and incubated for 30 min in TSE (0.1 m Tris acetate, 0.5 m sucrose, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6). Pelleted spheroplasts were frozen at -70 °C. Thawed pellets were suspended in BugBuster (Novagen, 60 ml/liter of original culture). After 20 min at room temperature, the suspension was clarified by centrifugation (18,600 × g in this and subsequent steps), and solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 30% of saturation. After 20 min, a pellet was removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was brought to 40% ammonium sulfate saturation, and then clarified again by centrifugation, and finally the supernatant was brought to 65%-saturated ammonium sulfate and the suspension was centrifuged immediately. The 65% ammonium sulfate pellet from 3 liters of culture was suspended in wash buffer and immediately cycled several times through a prepared column of Ni-NTA (Novagen, 6 ml from 50% suspension). The Ni-NTA was washed with 100 ml of wash buffer, and then His-tagged lipoxygenase was eluted at once with wash buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, and dialyzed overnight (4 °C) in Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 8). The dialyzed eluate from Ni-NTA was separated by anion exchange chromatography (1 × 15 cm DE-52 Whatman column). Fractions containing soybean LOX-1 activity were brought to 65% of saturation with ammonium sulfate and centrifuged, and the pellet was suspended in 1-2 ml of HPLC buffer and dialyzed in HPLC buffer. Lipoxygenase elutes at ∼30 min from the Superdex 200 HR 10/30 HPLC column. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and was >95%. The amino-terminal His tag in expressed lipoxygenases was removed by incubating 10 units of Factor Xa/mg LOX protein for 4 h at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped using Xarrest-agarose, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen, Factor Xa Cleavage Capture Kit). Typically, 5-10 mg of protein was digested in one batch and the yield of cleaved LOX protein, after workup, was >50% of the starting uncleaved protein. Completion of cleavage was verified by SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel). Samples were AMS precipitated, brought up to 5-10 mg/ml, and dialyzed to remove remaining cleaved peptide. Samples were prepared for metal analysis by centrifugation and dialysis into 0.01 m Tris, 5 μm sodium azide, pH 7.6. The Tris buffer was passed through a Chelex column before use. Glassware for analytical samples was washed sequentially with nitric acid and water. Metal analyses by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry were performed at the Chemical Analysis Laboratory, University of Georgia (Athens, GA). Percent iron values are based on absorbances at 280 nm for a 1 mg/ml protein solution of 1.28 (with His tag) and 1.35 (no tag) (23.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). The active samples analyzed included one of Ser160/Gly542 without His tag, three of Gly542 with His tag, one of Ser542 with tag, and two of wild type (Glu160) with tag. The samples for metal determination ranged in concentration from 1 to 15 μm LOX protein and iron, nickel, manganese, copper, and zinc were analyzed. To determine which metals were correlated with protein concentration, metal analysis and protein concentration data of all samples were graphed using KaleidaGraph (micromoles of metal versus micromoles of protein). The metal concentrations that correlated with protein concentration (mole ratio metal/protein) were iron (0.62), manganese (0.02), and, weakly correlated, nickel (0.04) (Pearson's R-values of 0.99, 0.96, and 0.69 respectively). Average amounts of zinc (2 μm) and copper (0.2 μm) in the samples were not correlated with protein concentration. Single analyses of iron in threonine and valine mutants with His tags indicated iron incorporation similar to that of the active samples. The dialysis buffer at the final sample preparation step for metal analysis had negligible iron, manganese, nickel, copper, or zinc content. Assay System for Wild-type and Mutant Soybean LOX-1—Recombinant wild-type soybean LOX-1 or mutants (1 μg) were incubated with either [1-14C]AA or [1-14C]LA (100 μm final concentration) in 100 μl of 50 mm borate buffer, pH 9, 150 mm NaCl for 2 min at room temperature. Incubations were stopped by addition of methanol, and the pH was reduced to ∼6 by addition of 1 n HCl prior to product extraction using the Bligh and Dyer method (24.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). For experiments studying the second oxygenation reactions, soybean LOX-1 and the Ala542 → Gly mutant (50 μg) were incubated with 15S-HPETE (10 μg) in 0.5 ml of 50 mm, pH 9 borate buffer. Reactions were monitored in the UV (200-350 nm), and upon completion products were extracted with dichloromethane (0.5 ml) after acidification to ∼pH 6 with 1 n HCl. Hydroperoxy derivatives were resuspended in methanol and reduced to hydroxy fatty acids by addition of 5 μl of triphenylphosphine (TPP, 5 mg/ml) prior to HPLC analysis. Wild-type soybean LOX-1 and the Ala542 → Gly mutant (10 μg) were incubated with either C16/LA-PC or C16/AA-PC (100 μm final concentration) in 0.5 ml of 50 mm borate, pH 9, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm deoxycholate. Reactions were monitored by UV spectrophotometry at 235 nm and stopped by addition of methanol. Products were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer procedure (24.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar), reduced with TPP, and transesterified with sodium methoxide prior to HPLC analysis. Incubation with Stereospecifically Labeled Linoleic Acids—The stereospecifically labeled 11R-3H and 11S-3H linoleic acids were synthesized previously as described (25.Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Lai S. Cha J.K. Brash A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The tritium-labeled linoleates were mixed with [14C]LA, which served as an internal standard for measurement of tritium retention. Incubations were carried out in 1 ml of 50 mm borate, pH 9, 150 mm NaCl using 10,000 cpm 3H for incubations with the wild-type enzyme and 20,000 cpm 3H for experiments with the Ala542 → Gly mutant. The appearance of the conjugated diene chromophore was monitored by UV spectrometry (200-300 nm), and reaction was stopped by addition of methanol at ∼80% substrate conversion. The products were acidified and extracted by the Bligh and Dyer procedure (24.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar), reduced with TPP, and methylated with diazomethane prior to HPLC analysis. Fractions were collected and counted for 3H and 14C, and the percentage of 3H retained was estimated by comparison of the 3H/14C ratios of product and substrate. HPLC Analysis—Products of the reaction of LOX enzymes and mutants with [1-14C]LA, [1-14C]AA, and 15S-HPETE were analyzed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC equipped with a diode array detector connected online to a Radiomatic FLO-ONE A-100 radioactive detector. Metabolites from [1-14C]LA were analyzed using a Whatman® Partisil 5 silica column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid (100/2/0.1, by volume) with UV detection at 235 nm. Metabolites from incubation with [1-14C]AA were analyzed on a Waters Symmetry C18 5-μm column (25 × 0.46 cm) using a solvent of methanol/water/acetic acid (80/20/0.01, by volume) eluted at 1 ml/min with UV detection at 235 nm; the unreacted substrate was eluted with methanol. The oxygenated products of 15S-HPETE were eluted with methanol/water/acetic acid (75/25/0.01, by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Methyl esters of products of incubations with either C16/LA-PC or stereospecifically labeled linoleic acids were analyzed on a Whatman® Partisil 5 silica column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid (100/1/0.1 by volume). HETE and HODE metabolites collected from the HPLC systems above were converted to methyl esters by treatment with ethereal diazomethane and further purified by SP-HPLC prior to chiral phase HPLC analysis. Chiral analysis of the HETE methyl esters was performed using a Daicel Chiralpak AD (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with hexane/methanol (100/2, by volume), HODE methyl esters were eluted with hexane/methanol (100/5, by volume) with UV detection at 235 nm (26.Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Determination of 3H Retention in Products Formed from Stereospecifically Labeled Linoleic Acids—HPODE products formed by the wild-type soybean LOX-1 and the Ala542 → Gly mutant were reduced with TPP, converted to the methyl ester derivative with diazomethane and purified by SP-HPLC and chiral phase HPLC as described under “HPLC Analysis.” Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the chiral HPLC column directly into scintillation counting vials. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen, scintillation fluid was added, and the samples each counted for 10 min in a Packard 1900 TR liquid scintillation analyzer using the dual channel mode for 3H and 14C. Typically there were 1000-2000 cpm of 14C in the product peaks, and the samples were counted for 30 min to improve precision. The counts in the baseline fractions adjacent to the chromatographic peaks were used as background. The 3H retention was calculated by comparison of the 3H/14C ratio of substrate and product. Preparation of 9R,15S-diHPETE and 9S,15S-diHPETE—Wild-type soybean LOX-1 (50 μg in 1 ml) was incubated with 9S- or 9R-HPETE (50 μm) prepared by autoxidation of methyl arachidonate, purification by SP-HPLC, resolution as 9R and 9S by chiral chromatography using a Chiralpak AD column (9R elutes before 9S (27.Milne G.L. Porter N.A. Lipids. 2001; 36: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) with a solvent of hexane/methanol 100:2, by volume, and alkaline hydrolysis to give the corresponding free acids (26.Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To prepare milligram amounts of 9R,15S-diHETE and 9S,15S-diHETE soybean LOX-1 (2 mg, Sigma type V) was incubated with 9R,S-HETE (20 mg) in 100 ml of 50 mm borate buffer, pH 9, 150 mm NaCl, products of reaction were extracted in dichloromethane at pH 6, re-dissolved in methanol, and reduced with NaBH4 prior to methylation with diazomethane. The analysis of the methyl ester trimethylsilyl ether-hydrogenated derivatives of the products was carried out in the positive-ion electron impact mode (70 eV) by using a Hewlett-Packard 5989A mass spectrometer coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with an RTX-1701 fused silica capillary column (5 m × 0.25-mm internal diameter). The position of the OH groups was confirmed by the presence of the ions at m/z 259 and 345 (α cleavage at C9) and of the peaks at m/z 173 and 431 (α cleavage at C15). 1H NMR and 2D (H,H-COSY) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 400-MHz spectrometer. 9R,15S-diHETE-Me and 9S,15S-diHETE-Me gave (ppm): δ 0.87 (t, H20), 1.23-1.32 (m, H17-19), 1.53 (H16 under the H2O peak), 1.71 (p, H3), 2.21 (q, H4), 2.31 (t, H2), 2.41-2.50 (m, H10), 3.65 (s, H1), 4.15 (q, H15), 4.24 (q, H9), 5.37-5.49 (m, H5 and H11), 5.67-5.74 (dt, H8 and H14), 6.00 (t, H6), 6.13 (t, H12), and 6.44-6.51 (dd, H7 and H13). Kinetic Analysis—Enzymatic activity of purified enzymes was determined by monitoring the increase of the signal at 235 nm in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences lambda-35 UV-visible spectrophotometer with LA concentrations ranging from 2 to 100 μm. Rates of reaction were calculated from the initial linear part of the curve. The enzymatic assay for soybean LOX-1 or the Ala542 → Gly mutant (0.25 μg) was performed in 0.5 ml of 50 mm borate, pH 9, 150 mm NaCl buffer. 13S-HPODE (1.3 μm) was included in each reaction as hydroperoxide activator. Km and kcat values were calculated with the Michaelis-Menten equation. To determine the effect of different activators on the lag phase, enzymatic assays with soybean LOX-1 (0.05 μg) or the Ala542 → Gly mutant (0.25 μg) were performed in the presence of 13S-HPODE or 9R-HPODE (1.3 μm). Lag phase was measured from the beginning of the reaction to the time at which a line tangent to the maximum velocity intersects the time axis, as described by Smith and Lands (28.Smith W.L. Lands W.E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1038-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EPR Spectroscopy—Lipoxygenase samples (1-2 mg/ml in 0.2 m potassium Pi, pH 6.8) were oxidized by addition of one equivalent of previously prepared 13S-HPODE, precipitated immediately by adding saturated ammonium sulfate to produce 65% saturation, and brought up to 4-9 mg/ml in 0.2 m buffer of choice (0.2 m potassium Pi, pH 6.8, in most cases). To remove residual ammonium sulfate and remaining products derived from 13S-HPODE, samples for comparison of EPR spectra were dialyzed overnight against ∼10,000 volumes of a buffer. To verify that no significant reduction of the ferric signal had occurred during dialysis, the EPR intensities of individual samples were also compared before and after dialysis. Lineshapes of samples before dialysis were variable because of the presence of residual ammonium sulfate. Samples were also examined in 0.2 m Tris, pH 7.5, and in 0."

Heart disease is the world's leading cause of death, accounting for 38% of all deaths in the United States in 2002. Each year, ∼900,000 people die from heart disease, and many millions more suffer from and eventually succumb to heart diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, high blood pressure, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias (1Association American Heart Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2005 Update. 2005; (American Heart Association, Dallas, TX)Google Scholar). Sudden cardiac death is the sudden, abrupt loss of heart function; about half of all deaths from heart disease are unanticipated, occurring instantly or shortly after symptoms appear and, unfortunately, before emergency medical treatment can be administered. Sudden cardiac deaths account for 19% of deaths in children between 1 and 13 years of age, and 30% of those between 14 and 21 years (1Association American Heart Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2005 Update. 2005; (American Heart Association, Dallas, TX)Google Scholar). Many sudden cardiac death victims have no diagnosed heart disease, and post-mortem examinations reveal no morphologic abnormalities to explain the death (2Chugh S.S. Senashova O. Watts A. Tran P.T.

Molecular genetic analysis demonstrated that mutations in the cardiac muscle RyR gene may be associated with ∼14% of these sudden cardiac death cases (11Tester D.J. Spoon D.B. Valdivia H.H.

RyR2 functions as a calcium release channel in the heart, where it plays a crucial role in excitation-contraction coupling. Influx of Ca2+ through the cardiac L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR)) on the plasma membrane triggers RyR2 to release a large amount of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. The resulting increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ activates the myofilaments to generate cardiac muscle contraction (12Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. 2001; (Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands)Crossref Google Scholar). Aberrant release of calcium ions via RyR2 can lead to electrical instability, abnormal cell growth, and irregular heartbeat and can in turn lead to heart disease. To date, 40 naturally occurring mutations in RyR2 have been linked to genetic forms of sudden cardiac death (3Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Tiso N. Memmi M. Vignati G. Bloise R. Sorrentino V.

CPVT is a genetic arrhythmogenic disorder characterized by stress-induced, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia that may degenerate into cardiac arrest and cause sudden cardiac death (3Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Tiso N. Memmi M. Vignati G. Bloise R. Sorrentino V. Danieli G.A. Circulation. 2001; 103: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). ARVD2 is an autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy characterized by partial degeneration of the myocardium right ventricle, electrical instability, and sudden death, and it is most frequently found in juveniles and athletes (5Tiso N. Stephan D.A. Nava A. Bagattin A. Devaney J.M. Stanchi F. Larderet G. Brahmbhatt B. Brown K. Bauce B. Muriago M. Basso C. Thiene G. Danieli G.A. Rampazzo A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which a single-point mutation among the ∼5000 amino acids of RyR2 affects normal heart function and causes sudden cardiac death remains elusive. These mutations are largely clustered in three regions of the RyR2 primary sequence: one near the N terminus, one in the central region, and the third in the C-terminal region (see Fig. 1). Intriguingly, these three regions are homologous to the three malignant hyperthermia (and related central core disease) regions in the skeletal muscle RyR (known as RyR1): the N-terminal region comprises the first 614 amino acids of RyR1; the central region is located between amino acids 2163 and 2458; and the C-terminal region is between amino acids 4800 and 4900 (13McCarty T.V. Quane K.A. Lynch P.J. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 410-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For RyR2, the central region mutations include S2246L, V2306I, E2311D, P2328S, N2386I, A2387P, Y2392C, A2403T, R2474S, T2504M, and L2534V. An isoleucine-proline motif (positions 2427 and 2428) in the same region is predicted to be involved in binding FKBP12.6 (FK506-binding protein of 12.6 kDa), a protein thought to regulate RyR2 channel gating (14Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Tiso et al. (15Tiso N. Salamon M. Bagattin A. Danieli G.A. Argenton F. Bortolussi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have suggested that central region mutations in CPVT and ARVD2 influence the binding of FKBP12.6 to RyR2, which causes the closed state of mutant RyR2 to become destabilized so that unusually large amounts of Ca2+ are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm, leading to faster heart beat and sudden death. To explore the structural basis of central region mutations in sudden cardiac death, we identified the location of a central mutation site in the three-dimensional structure of RyR2. We inserted a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag after Ser-2367, near the middle of the central region (RyR2S2367-GFP). RyR2S2367-GFP expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells functions as a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive calcium release channel. Purified RyR2S2367-GFP was studied by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), and a three-dimensional structure was reconstructed by single-particle image processing. The location of the inserted GFP tag was determined by comparison with the reconstruction of wild-type (wt) RyR2 (RyR2wt). The inserted GFP tag (and consequently, Ser-2367) was mapped to the “bridge” between cytoplasmic domains 5 and 6. These domains have been suggested to undergo conformational changes during channel gating. Thus, our data suggest that disease-associated RyR2 mutations located in the central region alter the conformational changes that normally occur during channel gating. Moreover, the three-dimensional location of this central mutation site is not close to the FKBP12.6-binding site mapped previously, suggesting that the isoleucine-proline motif is unlikely to be the FKBP12.6-binding site. cDNA Construction of RyR2S2367-GFP—The cloning and construction of the 15-kb cDNA encoding the mouse cardiac muscle RyR (known as RyR2) have been described previously (16Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The DNA encoding GFP flanked by Gly-rich linkers and an AscI site (see Fig. 1) was obtained by PCR as described previously (17Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The AscI site was introduced into the central mutation region of RyR2 after Ser-2367 in the sequence by overlap extension by PCR. The “outer” primers were as follows: forward, 5′-ACC AGT GGC TCC GGG CGC GCC CTT GAT ATA GAA GAG GAG-3′; and reverse, 5′-TTC TAT ATC AAG GGC GCG CCC GGA GCC ACT GGT TGG AGA-3′. The AscI fragment containing GFP and the linkers was then subcloned into full-length RyR2wt after Ser-2367. The sequences of all PCR fragments were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of RyR2S2367-GFP—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (18Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol.

HEK293 cells grown on 100-mm tissue culture dishes for 18-20 h after subculture were transfected with 6-12 μg of RyRS2367-GFP cDNAs using Ca2+ phosphate precipitation (18Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The transfected HEK293 cells were detergent-lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Na-PIPES (pH 7.2), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% egg lecithin, and protease inhibitor mixture (2 mm benzamidine, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.75 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) and incubated on ice for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by sedimentation, and sucrose (400 mm final concentration) and NaCl (400 mm final concentration) were added to the supernatant. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (100 μl) containing 400 μg of bound glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FKBP12.6 fusion protein were added to the cell lysate supernatant. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 2 days. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with lysis buffer containing 0.5% CHAPS and 0.25% egg lecithin. The RyR2 proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation with 100 mm glutathione in 25 mm Na-PIPES (pH 7.2), 400 mm NaCl, 400 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4% CHAPS, 0.16% egg lecithin, 200 mm Tris/HEPES (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitor mixture for 15 min. The eluate was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -90 °C. Ca2+ Release Measurement, [3H]Ryanodine Binding Assay, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—The free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in the transfected HEK293 cells was measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3 as described previously (18Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Equilibrium [3H]ryanodine binding to purified RyR2 proteins was carried out at various Ca2+ concentrations as described previously (19Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The purified RyR2 proteins were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-6% polyacrylamide mini-gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting with anti-RyR antibody (clone 34C) or anti-GFP antibody (catalog no. PA1-980) (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) was performed as described previously (20Liu Z. Zhang J. Wang R. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cryo-EM and Image Processing—Purified RyR2S2367-GFP was diluted 5-10-fold with EM dilution buffer (20Liu Z. Zhang J. Wang R. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Grids were prepared for cryo-EM according to standard methods. Micrographs were recorded using low-dose protocols on a Philips EM420 microscope, equipped with a low-dose kit and a Gatan 626 cryo-transfer holder with 100-kV operating voltage, in a defocus range between 2.0 and 2.5 μm and at a magnification of ×38,600×(±2%) as verified by a tobacco mosaic virus standard. Each exposure corresponded to an electron dose of ∼10 e-/Å2. Micrographs were checked for drift, astigmatism, and presence of Thon rings by optical diffraction. Selected electron micrographs were digitized on a Zeiss imaging scanner (Z/I Imaging Corp., Huntsville, AL) with a step size of 14 μm. Images were processed using the SPIDER/WEB software package (21Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Images of RyR2 proteins in the 4-fold symmetric orientation were aligned by cross-correlation methods, and two-dimensional averages were computed (22Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. 1996; (pp. , Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA): 54-125Crossref Google Scholar). Three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained from images of particles lying in all available orientations by the projection matching procedure (23Liu Z. Zhang J. Sharma M. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6104-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The final three-dimensional reconstructions of RyR2wt and RyR2S2367-GFP were computed from 5434 and 4105 particles, respectively, to ensure that the particle orientations covered the entire angular space and that each view would be represented by almost equal numbers of particles. Four-fold symmetry was enforced in both the two-dimensional averages and the three-dimensional reconstructions. The final resolutions were estimated to be 34 Å by Fourier shell correlation (with a cutoff of 0.5) for RyR2wt and 33 Å for RyR2S2367-GFP. The three-dimensional difference map was calculated by subtraction of the volume of RyR2wt from that of RyR2S2367-GFP. Construction, Expression, Functional Characterization, and Purification of RyR2S2367-GFP—To gain insight into the structural basis of RyR2 malfunction caused by central region mutations, we mapped the location of a central mutation site in the three-dimensional structure of RyR2. A chimeric cDNA of RyR2 with GFP inserted in the middle of the central mutation region, after Ser-2367, was constructed (Fig. 1). cDNAs of modified RyR2 proteins with GFP insertions were expressed in HEK293 cells. RyR2wt expressed in HEK293 cells has been shown to function as a Ca2+ release channel (17Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol.

We measured intracellular Ca2+ release of RyR2S2367-GFP using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester. As shown in Fig. 2a, HEK293 cells transfected with RyR2S2367-GFP cDNA displayed multiple Ca2+ release events in response to repeated stimulation by caffeine, an activator of RyR2. The addition of ryanodine led to a slow increase in fluorescence and diminished the response to multiple caffeine stimulations. This is most likely the result of modulation by ryanodine, which is known to bind to only the open state of the channel and to dramatically increase the channel open probability. As a consequence, the ryanodine-modified channel no longer responded to further caffeine stimulation. These results suggest that RyR2S2367-GFP is sensitive to caffeine and ryanodine modification. Similar Ca2+ release responses to caffeine and ryanodine have also been observed in HEK293 cells transfected with RyR2wt (17Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The functional properties of the purified RyR2S2367-GFP proteins were further characterized by [3H]ryanodine binding studies. Fig. 2b shows [3H]ryanodine binding to purified RyR2S2367-GFP in the presence of a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations. Analysis of the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding by the Hill equation yielded an EC50 of 0.11 ± 0.005 μm (mean ± S.E., n = 3). We also determined the specificity of [3H]ryanodine binding to the purified RyR2S2367-GFP proteins. Binding was carried out in the presence of 50 nm [3H]ryanodine in an attempt to saturate the binding and 100 μm Ca2+ to maximally activate the channel. Under these conditions, we obtained a binding specificity of 518 ± 51 pmol of [3H]ryanodine/mg of protein (n = 4), which is similar to those reported previously for the purified RyR2 and RyR1 proteins (24Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q-Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Anderson K. Lai F.A. Liu Q-Y. Rousseau E. Erickson H.P. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1329-1335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the insertion of GFP after Ser-2367 does not grossly alter the structural and functional properties of RyR2. The expressed RyR2S2367-GFP protein was purified in a single step from detergent-solubilized cell lysates by affinity chromatography (glutathione-Sepharose) using GST-FKBP12.6 as the affinity ligand (17Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Evidently, the insertion of GFP after Ser-2367 did not restrict the binding of GST-FKBP12.6 to RyR2. The purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. A single high molecular mass band, which migrated at a slightly slower rate compared with RyR2wt (as expected, due to the addition of GFP), was detected in the purified sample of RyR2S2367-GFP (Fig. 2c). This band was recognized by both the anti-RyR and anti-GFP antibodies. On the other hand, the purified RyR2wt protein was recognized by the anti-RyR antibody, but not by the anti-GFP antibody. Three-dimensional Localization of a Central Mutation Site—The purified RyR2wt and RyR2S2367-GFP samples were diluted to a suitable concentration, applied to carbon-coated EM grids, blotted, rapidly frozen, and imaged by electron microscopy. Fig. 3 shows a typical electron micrograph in which individual RyR2S2367-GFP channels are visible. Image processing was performed using the SPIDER/WEB software package (21Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 (a and b) shows two-dimensional averages of RyR2S2367-GFP and RyR2wt, respectively, computed using images of selected particles that were lying with their 4-fold symmetry axes oriented perpendicular to the carbon support film; these images were aligned by cross-correlation methods (22Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. 1996; (pp. , Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA): 54-125Crossref Google Scholar). Subtraction of the two-dimensional average of RyR2wt from that of RyR2S2367-GFP provides a difference map that should resolve the projected location of the GFP insertion and perhaps also conformational differences between the two averaged projection structures. The brightest white areas shown in Fig. 4c correspond to the most significant positive densities, which represent protein mass present in RyR2S2367-GFP, but absent from RyR2wt. These regions are located near the center of the “clamp” structures that form the corners of the square-shaped receptor (26Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). From previous three-dimensional reconstructions, we know that the domains that lie in the vicinity of the inserted GFP tag are domains 5-8 (see the three-dimensional reconstruction in Fig. 5). Statistical analysis (Fig. 4d) of the difference between the two averaged images indicated that these regions show significant differences at a confidence level of >99.9% (27Wagenknecht T. Frank J. Boublik M. Nurse K. Ofengand J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These differences almost certainly correspond to the additional mass contributed by the GFP insertion in RyR2S2367-GFP. This interpretation is confirmed, and GFP is more precisely mapped in the three-dimensional reconstructions described below.FIGURE 5Three-dimensional localization of GFP inserted at Ser-2367. a, a surface representation of the three-dimensional reconstruction of RyR2S2367-GFP is shown in green. b, a difference map (RyR2S2367-GFP-RyR2wt) shown in green is superimposed on the three-dimensional reconstruction of RyR2wt (blue). Each of the green regions of the difference map corresponds to a GFP insertion in the central mutation region of a RyR2 subunit. The three-dimensional reconstructions in both panels are shown in three views: left, top view from the cytoplasmic surface that in situ would face the transverse tubule membrane; middle, bottom view that would face the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen; right, side view. The side view shows that RyR2 has a small transmembrane assembly (TA) and a large cytoplasmic assembly as the main mass of the protein. The numerals 1-10 on the cytoplasmic assembly indicate the distinguishable domains according to previous nomenclature (26Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S.

Fig. 5a shows surface representations of the three-dimensional reconstruction of RyR2S2367-GFP in three principal orientations. The reconstructed structure consists of two major components: a large cytoplasmic assembly composed of at least 10 distinct domains (labeled 1-10) (26Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J.

For the reconstruction of RyR2S2367-GFP, the final resolution was estimated to be 33 Å (see “Experimental Procedures”). Overall, the three-dimensional reconstruction of RyR2S2367-GFP is very similar to that of the RyR2wt (17Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol.

The site of proteolytic processing of trout VE precursor proteins that occurs during VE formation around eggs is of considerable interest. Here we used mass spectrometry (MS) measurements of individual VE proteins isolated from rainbow trout eggs to assess whether or not the CFLCS and C-terminal propeptide were retained following synthesis and secretion of the proteins by the liver and transport to the ovary and eggs. Because only VE proteins that had recently arrived in the vicinity of eggs would be expected to retain a CFLCS and C-terminal propeptide, i.e. a small fraction of total VE protein associated with eggs, MS provides the level of sensitivity necessary to make such an assessment. The evidence obtained strongly suggests that proteolytic cleavage at the CFLCS of VE precursor proteins, which results in removal of the short C-terminal propeptide, takes place on the egg. Occasionally this occurs after formation of covalently linked heterodimers (VEα-VEγ and VEβ-VEγ) but before incorporation of VE proteins into the VE. This would be consistent with the suggestion that soluble VE precursor proteins are converted into insoluble VE proteins at the site of envelope assembly in the ovary, not in the liver or bloodstream (8Hyllner S.J.

Furthermore, the evidence is consistent with a recently proposed mechanism for ZP assembly in mammals that involves short hydrophobic patches near the C terminus (external hydrophobic patch (EHP)) and within the ZP domain (internal hydrophobic patch (IHP)) of ZP precursor proteins (28Jovine L. Qi H. Williams Z. Litscher E.S. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5922-5927Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Reagents were obtained from the following commercial sources: MALDI-TOF-MS standards, chymotrypsin, AspN, GluC(V8), trifluoroacetic acid, formic acid (FA), and acetonitrile (ACN) from Sigma; trypsin from Roche Applied Science; SDS-polyacrylamide gels from Bio-Rad; and molecular weight markers from Bio-Rad, Invitrogen, and New England Biolabs. The procedure described by Brivio et al. (29Brivio M.F. Bassi R. Cotelli F. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1991; 28: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was used to isolate VEs from rainbow trout (O. mykiss) eggs. Briefly, eggs were obtained from females by abdominal squeezing in a bloodless procedure that avoided contamination of eggs with proteins from blood. Eggs were frozen immediately by immersion in an ethanol and dry ice mixture. To prepare proteolytic digests of VE proteins, VEs were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gel pieces containing individual VE proteins were excised and then digested with various proteases. Analyses of VE protein digests by MS were performed using several VE preparations. VE proteins were separated on 10% gels by SDS-PAGE (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1A). For nonreducing conditions, samples were dissolved in the absence of DTT. Gels were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In most cases, a small portion of unstained gel just above the Coomassie-stained band (i.e. higher molecular weight) was used for MS experiments. As a result, under reducing conditions, there was a small amount of cross-contamination of VE proteins (e.g. VEβ peptides in VEγ samples and VEα peptides in VEβ samples), but this did not interfere with interpretation of the MS analyses. For molecular weight determination by MS, individual VE proteins were obtained by preparative SDS-PAGE on 12% gels under nonreducing conditions, and the position of each protein was determined by transient zinc staining (see below). Gel bands containing individual VE proteins were excised, electroeluted (Biotrap, Schleicher & Schuell) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 0.025% (w/v) SDS, pH 8.8, for 12–16 h at room temperature, and concentrated to 0.5–1 mg/ml. To remove SDS, individual proteins were dialyzed twice against 6 m urea (16 h each dialysis), followed by dialysis against distilled water six times (12–16 h each dialysis). Digestion of gel pieces containing individual VE proteins with proteases was carried out in the manner of Hellman et al. (31Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) with certain modifications (32Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Neubauer G. Mortensen P. Mann M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 893-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Gel pieces containing 0.5–2 μg of protein were incubated with 60% (v/v) ACN for 20 min, dried completely in a SpeedVac evaporator, and rehydrated for 10 min with digestion buffer (25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0). This procedure was repeated three times. After drying, gel pieces were again rehydrated in digestion buffer containing 10 mm DTT and incubated for 1 h at 56°C. Reduced Cys residues in VE proteins were blocked by replacing the DTT solution with 100 mm iodoacetamide in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, for 45 min at room temperature with occasional vortexing. In some experiments, the reduced Cys residues were not blocked by iodoacetamide. Gel pieces were dehydrated, dried, and rehydrated twice. Dried gel pieces were then digested for 16–18 h at 37 °C in digestion buffer containing 15 ng/μl trypsin (cleavage at the C terminus of Arg and Lys residues), chymotrypsin (cleavage at the C terminus of Phe, Tyr, Trp, Met, and Leu residues), endoproteinase AspN (cleavage at N terminus of Asp and Glu residues), or endopeptidase GluC(V8) (cleavage at C terminus of Glu and Asp residues). For tryptic and chymotryptic digests, 5 mm calcium chloride was added to the digestion buffer. Following digestion, peptides were extracted twice from gel pieces by addition of 300 μl of 60% ACN, 5% FA in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and shaking for 60–90 min at room temperature. Solutions containing peptides of VE proteins were pooled, dried, and used for MALDI-TOF-MS in either linear or reflective modes and MS or MS/MS by LC-MS(QTOF and QSTAR). MALDI-TOF-MS analyses of VE peptides were carried out on a TOF Voyager-DERP mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a linear mode and on a Reflex III TOF system (Bruker Daltonics, Leipzig, Germany) in a reflective mode, both equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Samples were dissolved in 50% ACN (linear mode) and co-crystallized with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix on a stainless steel target. In a reflective mode, the samples were prepared by a modified thin layer method (33Kussmann M. Nordhoff E. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Haebel S. Rossel-Larsen M. Jakobsen L. Gobom J. Mirgorodskaya E. Kroll-Kristensen A. Palm L. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 593-601Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The dry samples were dissolved with 2% trifluoroacetic acid, and a mixture of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and nitrocellulose was used as matrix. After drying, samples were analyzed either undiluted or at suitable dilutions. After ionization, peptide data were collected in the mass/charge (m/z) 800-8000 (linear mode) and 700–3200 (reflective mode) range, and time-to-mass conversion was achieved by using external or internal calibration with bradykinin (m/z 1061.2), angiotensin (m/z 1297.5), insulin (m/z 5734.5), and tryptic fragments. Peaks detected by MALDI-TOF-MS in a linear mode corresponded to average m/z peptides. The peaks detected by MALDI-TOF-MS in a reflective mode corresponded to monoisotopic m/z peptides. Here we refer to the MALDI-TOF-MS peaks (m/z) as average/monoisotopic, singly charged (protonated) peptides. For MALDI-TOF-MS measurements in a linear mode, m/z differences (from the calculated value) up to 1 Da were observed, whereas calibration differences for measurements in a reflective mode were generally up to 100 ppm. Interpretation of mass spectra was performed using Mascot (www.matrixscience.com), FindMod, FindPep, PeptideMass (www.expasy.ch), as well as manually. Nanoflow HPLC-MS(LC-MS(QTOF))—Analyses were carried out with a Micromass-QTOF hybrid mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) with a nanoelectrospray source. A fused silica tip mounting adaptor, fitted with a 75-μm (inner diameter) fused silica tip (New Objective), was connected through a 50-μm (inner diameter) fused silica tubing to the liquid chromatography (LC) detector outlet. An LC Packings system (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA), equipped with an Ultimate micro pump and solvent organizer and a Switchos loading pump and Famos autosampler, was used for LC-MS. Separation was carried out on a 75-μm × 15-cm column (LC Packings C18 PepMap; 5-μl injection volume) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min, using a gradient of 2–80% ACN in 0.1% FA. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode and automatically switched between MS and MS/MS. The peaks detected by LC-MS(QTOF) corresponded to peptides with a monoisotopic m/z. Calibration differences for both MS and MS/MS measurements were typically up to 200 ppm. Processed files were subjected to a Mascot search (www.matrixscience.com), and the results were further supplemented by manual searches. The MS/MS spectra were further analyzed using MS-Product, MS-Fit, and MS-Tag (prospector.ucsf.edu), as well as manually. For determination of molecular weights of intact VE proteins, samples containing individual polypeptides (0.5–1 mg/ml) were concentrated ∼10 times to 5–10 mg/ml in 5 μl of water and were reduced by adding 5 ml of 50 mm DTT in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and heating at 60 °C for 1 h. Reduced proteins were injected onto a Dionex C18 micron precolumn (0.3 × 5 mm), desalted at 200 nl/min with 10% ACN, 0.1% FA, eluted with 95% ACN, 0.1% FA, and analyzed on a Micromass QTOF hybrid mass spectrometer with a nanoelectrospray source connected to the column outlet. Operating conditions were 1.8-kV capillary voltage, 32-V cone voltage. Raw spectra were deconvoluted using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) based software supplied with the MassLynx software. Nanoflow HPLC-MS (LC-MS(QSTAR))—Samples were measured on a QSTAR Pulsar i mass spectrometer (Applera Deutschland GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark). The MS was coupled to an Ultimate micro pump (Dionex, Idstein, Germany) with a FAMOS autosampler. Samples were dissolved in 2% trifluoroacetic acid (trifluoroacetic acid, S.P. 99.9%, SDS, Peypin, France; H2O, Lichrosolv®, Merck). HPLC column tips (fused silica) with a 75-μm inner diameter (New Objective, Woburn, MA) were packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 ODS-3 to a length of 11–12 cm. A gradient of 0.5% acetic acid (ACS Reagent, Sigma) in water plus 0.5% acetic acid in water containing 80% ACN (HPLC gradient grade, SDS), with increasing proportions of ACN, was used for peptide separation. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode and switched automatically between MS and MS/MS. Differences between measured and calculated m/z values for these measurements were typically up to 150 ppm. Processed files were subjected to an in-house licensed Mascot search (www.matrixscience.com), and the results were further supplemented by searches using MS-Product, MS-Fit, and MS-Tag (prospector.ucsf.edu), as well as manually. To ensure that VE precursors would be present, a small amount of unstained gel just above the Coomassie-stained band (i.e. higher molecular weight) was used for MS experiments. In general, digested VE protein samples were divided in two and analyzed in parallel by MALDI-TOF-MS and by either LC-MS(QTOF) or LC-MS(QSTAR). The samples were first analyzed to identify the VE proteins by peptide mass fingerprinting using Mascot search (www.matrixscience.com). The data that resulted from MALDI-TOF-MS were then compared with those from LC-MS(QTOF or QSTAR). When a peak that corresponded to a C-terminal peptide was detected by MALDI-TOF-MS, a search for the same peptide was carried out using either LC-MS(QTOF) or LC-MS(QSTAR). In addition, when a peak that corresponded to a C-terminal propeptide was detected by LC-MS(QSTAR) and no suitable MS/MS was obtained, a second run for detection of the same peak (using the same sample) was performed. The C-terminal amino acid present at the CFLCS of mature VE proteins was determined primarily with AspN and chymotrypsin digests because there is no cleavage site for these enzymes at the CFLCS. Because the C-terminal peptides contained many Lys, Arg, Asp, and Glu residues, trypsin and AspN were used as the principal proteases for determination of the C-terminal propeptides, which increased the probability of detecting C-terminal peptides. In MALDI-TOF-MS and tandem MS experiments, possible modifications of the peptides (e.g. cyclization of Gln or Glu residues to pyroglutamate or oxidation of Met to Met) were examined. In MS/MS experiments, the collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra corresponding to a C-terminal peptide were analyzed using MS-Product, MS-Fit, and MS-Tag (prospector.ucsf.edu), as well as manually. Because a large number of amino acids in the C-terminal propeptides could lose water (e.g. Ser, Thr, Asp, and Glu) and ammonia (e.g. Arg, Lys, Asn, and Gln), single and multiple neutral loss of water and ammonia were taken into account. Neutral loss of CO (Mr 28 units) was also considered. Because of the presence of many Pro and Asp residues in the C-terminal region of VE proteins, fragments that resulted in CID from the cleavage of the peptide bond of these amino acids, and the internal fragments that resulted from subsequent fragmentation of these fragments (MS/MS/MS), were taken into account. Because the C-terminal peptides contained many positively charged amino acids (e.g. Arg, His, Lys, and Asn), in MS and MS/MS experiments we searched for multiply [(2+), (3+), (4+)] charged ions, in addition to the doubly charged ions classical for tryptic digests. Electrophoretic and Mass Spectrometric Analyses of Rainbow Trout VE Proteins—Under reducing conditions (+DTT) on SDS-PAGE, rainbow trout VEs contain three major proteins, called VEα,VEβ and VEγ, with masses of ∼58, ∼52, and ∼47 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1A, lane a). In addition, a 4th band with a mass of ∼120 kDa is present and contains VEα-VEγ and VEβ-VEγ heterodimers, as reported previously (7Darie C.C. Biniossek M.L. Jovine L. Litscher E.S. Wassarman P.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7459-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). No other proteins (e.g. proteins from blood) were detected either on Coomassie-stained gels or by MS experiments. Under nonreducing conditions (–DTT) on SDS-PAGE, the band containing VEα-VEγ and VEβ-VEγ heterodimers separates into two bands; the top band contains VEα-VEγ heterodimers and the bottom band contains VEβ-VEγ heterodimers (Fig. 1A, lanes b and d). In addition to the VEα,VEβ, and VEγ monomers observed under reducing (Fig. 1A, lane a) and nonreducing (Fig. 1A, lanes b and d) conditions, additional protein bands were occasionally observed with molecular weights close to that of VEα (Fig. 1A, lane b), VEγ (Fig. 1A, lane d), and VEβ (data not shown). MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of trypsin-digested gel bands marked as VEα (Fig. 1A, lane b) identified both bands as VEα (data not shown), suggesting the presence of VE isoproteins. Each VE propolypeptide contains an N-terminal SP, a PQ region, a P domain (absent in VEγ), a ZP domain, a CFLCS, and a C-terminal propeptide downstream of the CFLCS (Fig. 1B). The amino acid sequence of VE proteins containing the last Cys residue upstream of the CFLCS (VEα-Cys528,VEβ-Cys487, and VEγ-Cys406), the CFLCS, and the C-terminal propeptide are shown in Fig. 1B. Sometime after secretion by the liver, the C-terminal propeptide is removed by a furin-like proprotein convertase that cleaves at the CFLCS. The predicted molecular masses of secreted VE proteins lacking the SP are 61, 56, and 47 kDa for VEα, VEβ, and VEγ, respectively (not accounting for glycosylation of VEγ). Based on amino acid sequences after removal of C-terminal propeptides, mature VE proteins should have molecular masses of ∼58 kDa (VEα), ∼52 kDa (VEβ), and ∼44 kDa (VEγ). In addition, VEγ has ∼3 kDa of covalently linked N-linked oligosaccharide. By comparing theoretical molecular weights of VE proteins with and without the C-terminal propeptide and the molecular weights of VE proteins run under reducing conditions (Fig. 1A, lane a), it appears that VE proteins are proteolytically processed and do not contain the C-terminal propeptide. However, because molecular weights determined by SDS-PAGE may not be accurate, the molecular weights of individual polypeptides also were measured by LC-MS(QTOF) to confirm that VE proteins are processed at the C terminus. The molecular masses determined were 51,996 Da (Fig. 1C), 51,948 Da, and 51,980 Da (data not shown) for VEβ and 47,600 Da for VEγ (Fig. 1D), in good agreement with results of SD"

However, the mechanisms by which neurotrophins promote prolonged MAP kinase signaling are not well understood. Here we defined the Rin GTPase as a novel component of the regulatory machinery contributing to the selective integration of MAP kinase signaling and neuronal development. Rin is expressed exclusively in neurons and is activated by neurotrophin signaling, and loss-of-function analysis demonstrates that Rin makes an essential contribution to nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neuronal differentiation. Most surprisingly, although Rin was unable to stimulate MAP kinase activity in NIH 3T3 cells, it potently activated isoform-specific p38α MAP kinase signaling and weakly stimulated ERK signaling in pheochromocytoma (PC6) cells. This cell-type specificity is explained in part by the finding that Rin binds and stimulates b-Raf but does not activate c-Raf. Accordingly, selective down-regulation of Rin in PC6 cells suppressed neurotrophin-elicited activation of b-Raf and p38, without obvious effects on NGF-induced ERK activation. Moreover, the ability of NGF to promote neurite outgrowth was inhibited by Rin knockdown. Together, these observations establish Rin as a neuronal specific regulator of neurotrophin signaling, required to couple NGF stimulation to sustain activation of p38 MAP kinase and b-Raf signaling cascades required for neuronal development.

Together, these observations establish Rin as a neuronal specific regulator of neurotrophin signaling, required to couple NGF stimulation to sustain activation of p38 MAP kinase and b-Raf signaling cascades required for neuronal development. Neurotrophin signaling is responsible for the regulation of a wide range of nerve cell functions, including differentiation, axonal and dendritic elongation, survival, and many aspects of neuronal activity (1Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). These diverse biological effects are mediated predominantly by the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Upon ligand binding, activated Trk receptors recruit adaptor proteins and activate Ras-related GTP-binding proteins and other effectors to modulate a diverse array of canonical signaling pathways (2Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar).

A distinguishing feature of neurotrophin signaling is the sustained activation of ERK kinase activity (3Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that the longevity of MEK/ERK pathway activation (4Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 5Miyasaka T. Chao M.V. Sherline P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4730-4735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is critical for neuronal differentiation in many systems, and Ras-like GTPases have emerged as key elements in these pathways (1Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). The Raf-MEK-ERK kinase cascade is implicated in the regulation of diverse biological processes, including both cellular proliferation and differentiation, and an important remaining issue is how integration of MAP kinase cascade signaling promotes distinct biological responses. However, although an extensive literature supports a role for prolonged MEK/ERK signaling in neuronal differentiation, inhibition of the sustained phase of ERK activation does not block neurite outgrowth (6York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In addition, Src and bone morphogenetic factor-2 are unable to activate ERK but still induce neurite outgrowth in pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (7Yang L.T. Alexandropoulos K. Sap J. J. Biol.

First, neurotrophin signaling induces sustained p38 activation in a variety of systems (9Takeda K. Ichijo H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1099-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Consistent with a critical role for the p38 pathway in neuronal differentiation, treatment with p38 inhibitors or dominant inhibitory p38 blocks neurite outgrowth (8Iwasaki S. Iguchi M. Watanabe K.

Moreover, neurite outgrowth induced by the expression of constitutively active MEK also depends upon p38 activity (10Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). How neurotrophin-mediated signals regulate the p38 MAP kinase cascade to induce neuritogenesis remains to be elucidated. A greater understanding of this signaling pathway would provide insight into neurotrophin-specific modulation of p38 MAP kinase cascade activity and the role for p38 kinase signaling in neuritogenesis. Small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins serve as molecular switches to regulate a diverse array of cellular functions. These include control of cellular growth, differentiation, actin dynamics, protein trafficking, and nuclear transport (12Colicelli J. Sci. STKE 2004. 2004; : RE13Google Scholar, 13Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Despite sequence differences between the members of this large family, all contain five conserved sequence domains and function as guanine nucleotide-dependent molecular switches. When in their active GTP-bound state, the GTPases interact through their effector domains with a variety of cellular targets to elicit their biological activity. We and others have described the cloning of Rin, a novel member of the Ras-related proteins (14Lee C.H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shao H. Kadono-Okuda K. Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. Arch. Biochem.

Although Rin shares more than 50% sequence identity with Ras, it is expressed only in neurons and shares a conserved and unique effector domain with the closely related Rit and Drosophila Ric proteins. Moreover, Rin lacks a known recognition site for post-translational lipidation required for the association of many Ras proteins with cellular membranes, instead exhibiting calcium-dependent association with calmodulin via an extended C terminus (14Lee C.H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wes P.D. Yu M. Montell C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5839-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although our previous studies have demonstrated that the closely related Rit GTPase signals to a variety of Ras-responsive promoter elements, transforms NIH 3T3 cells to tumorigenicity, and activates the Ral exchange factor RGL3, Rin had little to no activity in these assays. Thus, Rin and Rit are likely to regulate distinct cellular functions, and characterization of Rin function remains incomplete (17Shao H. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26914-26924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rusyn E.V. Reynolds E.R. Shao H. Grana T.M. Chan T.O. Andres D.A. Cox A.D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17605-17615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that Rin is activated following NGF stimulation of pheochromocytoma cells (19Spencer M.L. Shao H. Tucker H.M. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17605-17615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and together with studies implicating Rin signaling in calcium-mediated neurite outgrowth (19Spencer M.L. Shao H. Tucker H.M. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17605-17615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Hoshino M. Nakamura S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), these data have led to the proposal that Rin signaling may play a pivotal role in regulating neuronal signaling pathways. In this report, we investigated the molecular events that mediate neurotrophin-induced differentiation and the role of the Rin GTPase in neurotrophin signaling. We demonstrate that Rin associates with and activates the neuronal Raf isoform b-Raf, but not c-Raf, to promote modest ERK activation. More importantly, Rin promotes robust p38 MAP kinase activation and plays an essential role in regulating the magnitude and longevity of NGF receptor-mediated p38 activation, but it is not required for EGF receptor-induced p38 signaling in pheochromocytoma cells. Furthermore, Rin silencing blocks NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth, without altering ERK activation. These observations establish Rin as a critical component in the signaling machinery used to generate neurotrophin-mediated activation of b-Raf and p38 signaling pathways and highlight the essential role of p38 MAP kinase signaling in maintaining normal nervous system function. Plasmids and Antibodies—Rin was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pEBG (GST fusion) (kindly provided by Dr. J. H. Kehrl, NIAID, National Institutes of Health) or p3xFLAG-CMV-10 expression vectors (Sigma). Wild-type (WT) b-Raf, WT-c-Raf, HA-tagged MEK1, and kinase-dead Akt (Akt-KD) have been described previously (21Shi G.X. Andres D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 830-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The construction of FLAG-tagged wild-type and dominate-negative p38 (α, β2, γ, and δ) expression vectors have been described (22Jiang Y. Gram H. Zhao M. New L. Gu J. Feng L. Di Padova F.

The cDNA clone for human Rin (RIT2) was obtained from the University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center (www.cdna.org). Antibodies against the following were purchased: FLAG (Sigma); phospho-ERK1/2, -MEK1/2, -ERK5, -MKK3/6, -p38, -AKT, -HSP27, and p38, HSP27 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); MEK1, ERK1, b-Raf, Raf-1 (c-Raf), GST, and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); phospho-Raf (Ser338) and Ras (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); and phospho-JNK1/2 (Thr(P)183/Tyr(P)185, BIOSOURCE). Biotinylated antibodies were generated using the protein biotinylation system (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-Rin and anti-Rit antibodies have been described (21Shi G.X. Andres D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 830-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our previous work (21Shi G.X. Andres D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 830-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) has found that immunoblotting with the anti-phospho-c-Raf (Ser338) antibody can be used to monitor the activation state of b-Raf in PC6 cells, and thus detection of phospho-b-Raf was accomplished by using this reagent. Recombinant human EGF and rat β-NGF were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The indicated reagents were purchased: JNK1/2 inhibitor SP600125, p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (Tocris, Ellisville, MO), MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Calbiochem), PMA, and A23187 (Sigma). Cell Lines and Transfections—PC6 cell is a subline of PC12 cells that produces neurites in response to NGF but grows as well isolated cells rather than in clumps and is suited to both biochemical and morphological analysis of signaling pathways (19Spencer M.L.

PC6 and COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5% horse serum or 10% FBS, respectively. Transfections were performed using Effectene or SuperFect reagents (Qiagen). GST-Pull Down Analysis and Immunoblotting—To examine the association of Rin and Raf proteins, cell lysates were prepared from COS cells transiently transfected with 3 μg of empty pEBG (expressing unfused GST), pEBG-Rin-Q78L, or pEBG-H-Ras-Q61L and either 2 μg of pcDNA3-HA-b-Raf-WT or -c-Raf-WT-FLAG. Cell monolayers were cultured for 36 h after transfection and harvested following an additional 5 h of incubation in serum-free DMEM by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspending in ice-cold kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm KF, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)). The cell suspension was lysed by sonication on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min to eliminate the insoluble material. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Detergent-soluble lysates (400 μg) were incubated with 22 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in a total volume of 1 ml for 1–2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation to allow isolation of the GST fusion proteins. The glutathione beads were then collected in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 1 × 104 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pelleted glutathione beads were then washed two times with ice-cold kinase buffer, once with ice-cold 1 m NaCl kinase wash buffer (kinase buffer containing 1 m NaCl), and with two additional washes with ice-cold kinase buffer, after which the bound proteins were released by boiling in Laemmli sample loading buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels. To examine the interaction of Rin and endogenous Raf kinase isoforms, cell lysates (10 mg of total cell lysate/reaction) prepared from COS cells transiently transfected with pEBG, pEBG-Rin-Q78L, or pEBG-H-Ras-Q61L were subjected to GST-pull down analysis as described above. To examine the interaction of Rin and Raf proteins by co-immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared from COS cells transiently co-transfected with 3 μg of empty 3xFLAG vector, 3xFLAG-Rin-Q78L, or 3xFLAG-H-RasQ61L together with 2 μg of Myc-b-Raf-WT or Myc-c-Raf-WT expression vectors. Cell monolayers were allowed to recover for 36 h after transfection, serum-starved for 5 h of incubation in serum-free DMEM, resuspended in ice-cold kinase buffer, and lysed by sonication on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min (1.4 × 104 rpm in refrigerated microcentrifuge) to eliminate the insoluble material, and the cleared cell lysates (400 μg) were incubated with either 2 μg of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody or mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (control) for 2 h with gentle rotation at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were affinity absorbed onto 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for an additional 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The Sepharose resin was collected by brief centrifugation (5 minat1 × 104 rpm at 4 °C) and washed extensively (as described above), and bound proteins were eluted by incubation for 5 min at 100 °C in Laemmli buffer. Bound proteins and 10 μg of total cell lysate from each sample were resolved by using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell), and subjected to immunoblotting using biotin-labeled anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibody. Immunoblots were blocked in 1% casein (Sigma) in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at 25 °C and incubated with an appropriate dilution of the primary antibody in 1% casein or 5% BSA in PBST for 1–2 h. The immunoblots were washed three times with PBST before the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) diluted at 1:20,000 or 1:40,000 in 1% casein in PBST, respectively. The signal was detected by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico system; Pierce) as described previously (19Spencer M.L. Shao H. Tucker H.M. Andres D.A. J. Biol.

In Vitro Kinase Assays—To perform b-Raf kinase assays, COS or PC6 cells were either co-transfected with expression vectors for GST-tagged Raf kinases and different Ras family GTPases or with shRNA expression vectors, cultured for 36–60 h, and subjected to serum starvation for 5 h prior to growth factor addition (where indicated) and the preparation of whole cell lysates. Immune complex kinase assays using either GST-bound protein or b-Raf immunoprecipitates were performed by using a Raf kinase cascade assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) essentially as described previously (21Shi G.X. Andres D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 830-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For p38 kinase assays, HA-RinQ78L and FLAG-tagged p38 isoform co-transfected PC6 cells were lysed in breaking buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and p38 kinase activity was monitored with a nonradioactive assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. The immune complexes were washed twice with breaking buffer and twice in kinase buffer (5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2) and were incubated in kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 as substrate. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the assays were terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and p38 activity was determined by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-specific ATF-2 antibody. For the studies on ERK and p38 MAP kinase activation, PC6 cells were transfected as described above with either 1.0 μg of empty 3xFLAG vector or 3xFLAG-Rin-Q78L after pretreatment with PD98059 (10 μm) or SB203580 (10 μm) for 30 min or not. Cell lysates were harvested after starvation, and the phosphorylation levels of ERK or p38 MAP kinase were analyzed by immunoblotting with the appropriate phospho-specific antibodies. The activation of ERK in PC6 cells was also analyzed by immunoprecipitation using 500 μg of total lysate proteins with 2 μg of anti-ERK1 polyclonal antibody performed in a similar immunoprecipitation procedure as described above. The phosphorylation of MKK3/6, ERK5, PKB/AKT, or JNK1/2 was analyzed by immunoblotting lysates with phospho-specific antibodies as indicated in Fig. 1. To study the role of inhibitors and b-Raf on Rin signaling, PC6 cells were transfected with 1 μg of empty 3xFLAG vector or 3xFLAG-Rin-Q78L in the absence or presence of Myc-b-Raf-WT (0.5 μg) after pretreatment with SB203580 (10 μm), PD98059 (10 μm), or not. The cells were then starved for 5 h in the presence or absence of inhibitors and harvested with kinase buffer. The extracted detergent-soluble lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylation status of ERK, p38 MAPK, and HSP27 was detected by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. The levels of protein expression were blotted with the appropriate antibodies. Neurite Outgrowth Studies—PC6 cells were exposed to DNA-Effectene complexes for 9–16 h, re-plated after dilution (1:4 dilution), and subjected to 400 μg/ml G418 selection for 3–7 days. The percentage of neurite-bearing cells, neurite number per cell body, neurite length, and the number of branch points per neurite were determined in two to four separate experiments. At least 200 cells were counted per experiment (in 9–12 random fields) with each experiment performed in triplicate as described previously (21Shi G.X. Andres D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 830-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cells were then fixed with methanol/acetone (3:1) at 4 °C for 45 min, and the images were captured on an Axiovert 200 m phase-contrast microscope (Zeiss). To examine the effect of Rin on neurite outgrowth, PC6 cells were transfected with 1 μg of empty 3xFLAG vector, 3xFLAG-Rin-Q78L, or 3xFLAG-Rit-Q79L as control, and recombinant proteins were visualized using an immunofluorescent microscope (Zeiss) with OpenLab 3.1.4 imaging software (Improvision Inc., Lexington, MA). Immunostaining was performed by incubation with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (1:200; diluted in 0.5% BSA/PBS) at 37 °C for 1 h after blocking with 0.5% BSA/PBS for 30 min, then washed with PBS three times before incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:200, diluted in 0.5% BSA/PBS), and terminated by extensive washing with PBS. To investigate the involvement of a variety of signaling pathways on Rin-mediated neurite outgrowth, PC6 cells were pretreated with SB203580 (10 μm), PD98059 (10 μm), SP600125 (25 μm), or LY294002 (10 μm) for 30 min or co-transfected with 1 μg of AKT-KD. To explore the possible mechanisms of Raf on Rin-mediated neurite outgrowth, PC6 cells were transfected with 1 μg of empty 3xFLAG vector or 3xFLAG-Rin-Q78L in the absence or presence of empty Myc vector or Myc-b-Raf-WT (1 μg) after pretreatment with PD98059 (10 μm), SB203580 (10 μm), or without drug addition. To explore the contribution of specific p38 kinase isoforms on Rin-mediated neurite outgrowth, PC6 cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of 3xFLAG-RinQ78L or empty 3xFLAG vector and 1 μg of FLAG-tagged dominant-negative-p38α, -β2, -γ, or -δ. Short Hairpin-RNA Interference—The mammalian expression vector, pSUPER.gfp/neo (OligoEngine), was used for expression of shRNA in PC6 cells as described previously (21Shi G.X. Andres D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 830-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The vector allows direct synthesis of shRNA transcripts using the polymerase-H1-RNA gene promoter and co-expresses GFP to allow detection of transfected cells. The Rin-specific insert sequence AGCGCAGTCACAATGCAGT (target sequence sense (TS)) was subcloned into pSUPER.gfp/neo (Oligo-Engine) to generate shRin99. Rat target sequences are as follows: shRin448-TS, CTCTTGCTCGAGACTACAA, and control shCTR-TS, TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT. Expression constructs were introduced to PC6 cells by transfection using Effectene reagents, and the cells were subjected to G418 (200 μg/ml) selection. The expression of Rin, Ras, or Rit GTPases was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Rin, anti-Ras, or anti-Rit monoclonal antibody. To determine the effects of shRNA-mediated knock-down of endogenous Rin on signaling, PC6 cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected with either shRin99 or shCTR. Cell monolayers were subjected to G418 (400 μg/ml) selection for 2 days, serum-starved for 5 h, stimulated as indicated, and then harvested in kinase lysis buffer. The phosphorylation levels of ERK, p38 MAP kinase, and HSP27 were detected by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. The p38 MAP kinase activities were also determined by p38 MAP kinase assay following immunoprecipitation with immobilized anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase antibody. To explore the requirement for Rin function in NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth, PC6 cells were transfected with the appropriate shRNA construct and then reseeded onto 35-mm dishes (1:4 dilution) in complete DMEM containing 400 μg/ml of G418 with or without NGF (100 ng/ml) stimulation to initiate differentiation. The neurite outgrowth was analyzed, and the cells were photographed as described above at days 3 and 7 following NGF exposure. To reconstitute the Rin deficiency in shRin99-treated PC6 cells, cells were co-transfected with either 0.5 μg of empty vector or pcDNA3-hRin-WT in the presence of 1.5 μg of shRin99 or shCTR. The expression of hRin-WT was monitored by immunoblotting lysates with anti-Rin monoclonal antibody, and neurite outgrowth was initiated and analyzed at day 3 as described above. Rin Activates Both ERK and p38 MAP Kinase Signaling to Induce Differentiation—The RIN gene was originally identified as a calmodulin-binding GTPase expressed exclusively in neurons, and we have shown that Rin is rapidly activated following NGF stimulation of PC6 cells (19Spencer M.L. Shao H. Tucker H.M. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17605-17615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Propagation of TrkA signaling is associated with activation of a variety of small GTP-binding proteins, suggesting that Rin might be directly involved in neurotrophin signaling. However, in our earlier analysis the expression of GFP-tagged acti"
https://openalex.org/W1977843940,"Protein kinase C (PKC)-δ is proapoptotic in human keratinocytes, and is downregulated or inactivated in keratinocytes expressing the activated Ha-ras oncogene, making it a candidate tumor suppressor gene for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We evaluated the significance of PKC-δ loss in transformed human keratinocytes using tumorigenic HaCaT Ras II-4 cells that have significantly reduced PKC-δ levels. Re-expression of PKC-δ by retrovirus transduction caused an increase in apoptosis and growth inhibition in culture. The growth inhibition induced by PKC-δ could be partially reversed by Bcl-xL expression, indicating that apoptosis was in part responsible for PKC-δ-induced growth inhibition. PKC-δ re-expression suppressed the tumorigenicity of HaCaT Ras II-4 cells in nude mice (P<0.05), and the small tumors that did form contained elevated levels of activated caspase-3, indicating increased apoptosis. In addition, we found that 29% (12/42) of human Bowen's disease (squamous carcinoma in situ) or SCC cases had absent or reduced PKC-δ when compared to the surrounding normal epidermis. These results indicate that PKC-δ inhibits transformed keratinocyte growth by inducing apoptosis, and that PKC-δ may function as a tumor suppressor in human SCCs where its loss in cells harboring activated ras could provide a growth advantage by conferring resistance to apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2016406801,"We have previously shown that lung tumors arising in MMTV-IGF-II transgenic mice displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). To investigate the role that insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) and CREB play in human lung tumorigenesis, A549 and NCI-H358 cells were examined. In these cell lines, IGF-II administration enhances human tumor cell survival and CREB phosphorylation. Further, the effects of IGF-II on cell survival and CREB phosphorylation appeared to be mediated, at least in part, by activation of the Erk pathways, as inhibition of these signaling pathways reduced tumor cell survival and CREB phosphorylation. Specifically, Erk5 appeared as the predominant mediator of CREB phosporylation. To further verify the importance of CREB in human lung tumorigenesis, A549 and NCI-H358 cells were stably transfected with a vector containing a dominant negative CREB construct (KCREB). KCREB transfection significantly inhibited the soft agar growth of both human tumor cell lines. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type CREB in the normal human bronchial epithelial cell line, HBE135, enhanced soft agar growth. Therefore, our results indicate that CREB and its associated proteins play a significant role in lung adenocarcinoma and IGF-II induces CREB phosphorylation, at least in part, via the Erk5 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2034828678,"The mechanism of channel opening for voltage-gated calcium channels is poorly understood. The importance of a conserved isoleucine residue in the pore-lining segment IIS6 has recently been highlighted by functional analyses of a mutation (I745T) in the CaV1.4 channel causing severe visual impairment (Hemara-Wahanui, A., Berjukow, S., Hope, C. I., Dearden, P. K., Wu, S. B., Wilson-Wheeler, J., Sharp, D. M., Lundon-Treweek, P., Clover, G. M., Hoda, J. C., Striessnig, J., Marksteiner, R., Hering, S., and Maw, M. A. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102, 7553–7558). In the present study we analyzed the influence of amino acids in segment IIS6 on gating of the CaV1.2 channel. Substitution of Ile-781, the CaV1.2 residue corresponding to Ile-745 in CaV1.4, by residues of different hydrophobicity, size and polarity shifted channel activation in the hyperpolarizing direction (I781P > I781T > I781N > I781A > I781L). As I781P caused the most dramatic shift (-37 mV), substitution with this amino acid was used to probe the role of other residues in IIS6 in the process of channel activation. Mutations revealed a high correlation between the midpoint voltages of activation and inactivation. A unique kinetic phenotype was observed for residues 779–782 (LAIA) located in the lower third of segment IIS6; a shift in the voltage dependence of activation was accompanied by a deceleration of activation at hyperpolarized potentials, a deceleration of deactivation at all potentials (I781P and I781T), and decreased inactivation. These findings indicate that Ile-781 substitutions both destabilize the closed conformation and stabilize the open conformation of CaV1.2. Moreover there may be a flexible center of helix bending at positions 779–782 of CaV1.2. These four residues are completely conserved in high voltage-activated calcium channels suggesting that these channels may share a common mechanism of gating. The mechanism of channel opening for voltage-gated calcium channels is poorly understood. The importance of a conserved isoleucine residue in the pore-lining segment IIS6 has recently been highlighted by functional analyses of a mutation (I745T) in the CaV1.4 channel causing severe visual impairment (Hemara-Wahanui, A., Berjukow, S., Hope, C.

These four residues are completely conserved in high voltage-activated calcium channels suggesting that these channels may share a common mechanism of gating. The entry of Ca2+ through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels has direct effects on muscle contraction, release of hormones and neurotransmitters, hearing, vision, gene expression, and other important physiological functions (2.Catterall W.A. Striessnig J. Snutch T.P. Perez-Reyes E. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 579-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The pore-forming α1-subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are composed of four homologous domains formed by six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) that are linked together on a single polypeptide (3.Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). A membrane depolarization initiates channel openings (activation) and closures (inactivation). These events can be considered a multistep process consisting of a conformational change in the voltage sensor, a transmission of the signal to the pore region, the opening of the pore, and channel closure due to inactivation. The voltage-sensing machinery is formed by multiple charged amino acids located in segment S4 and adjacent structures of each domain (4.Yifrach O. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A large number of amino acids involved in Ca2+ channel inactivation have been identified and several molecular mechanisms for this process have been proposed (for reviews see Refs. 5.Hering S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6813-6821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of the voltage-dependent pore opening of Ca2+ channels, however, is less studied and largely unknown. The first attempt to localize the structural elements in Ca2+ channel α1-subunits that are involved in channel activation was made by Tanabe et al. (8.Tanabe T. Adams B.A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1991; 352: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) who constructed chimeric channels in which sequence stretches of a slow activating (“skeletal muscle-like”) CaV1.1 α1-subunit were replaced by sequences from a fast activating (“cardiac-like”) CaV1.2 α1-subunit. The chimeras activated slowly if repeat I of the CaV1.2 α1-subunit was replaced by the CaV1.1 α1-sequence. In a later study, replacement of domains I, II, and III of the low voltage and fast activating CaV3.1 α1-subunit with the corresponding domains of the high voltage-activated CaV1.2 α1-subunit resulted in a high voltage-activated channel (9.Li J. Stevens L. Klugbauer N. Wray D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26858-26867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An important role of domains I and III but not II and IV on midpoint voltage and time constants of activation was reported by Garcia et al. (10.Garcia J. Nakai J. Imoto K. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2515-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) who mutated the arginines in the S4 segments of all four domains of a chimeric channel to neutral or negative amino acids. The removal of prolines that are conserved in segments IS4 and IIIS4 of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels resulted in shortening of channel open time, whereas introduction of extra prolines to corresponding positions of IIS4 and IVS4 lengthened the channel open time (11.Yamaguchi H. Muth J.N. Varadi M. Schwartz A. Varadi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our present study was initiated by the recent finding that a novel retinal disorder is caused by a point mutation (I745T) in segment IIS6 of the CaV1.4 α1-subunit that shifts the voltage dependence of CaV1.4 channel activation by approximately -30 mV (1.Hemara-Wahanui A. Berjukow S. Hope C.I. Dearden P.K. Wu S.B. Wilson-Wheeler J. Sharp D.M. Lundon-Treweek P. Clover G.M. Hoda J.C. Striessnig J. Marksteiner R. Hering S. Maw M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heinzle T. Grabner M. Striessnig J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6041-6049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we have decided to study the functional roles of this residue and neighboring residues in segment IIS6 by introducing and characterizing mutations in the homologous CaV1.2 channel. Our findings demonstrate that residue Ile-781 and three neighboring residues (Leu-779, Ala-780, and Ala-782) play a key role in gating of the CaV1.2 channel. Mutagenesis—The CaV1.2 α1-subunit coding sequence (GenBank™ X15539) in-frame 3′ to the coding region of a modified green fluorescent protein (GFP) 4The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild-type; NaChBac, bacterial sodium channel; Bay K8644, 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)pyridine-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester. was kindly donated by Dr. M.

For electrophysiological studies we used the plasmid lacking the GFP tag. Substitutions in segment IIS6 of the CaV1.2 α1-subunit were introduced by the “gene SOEing” technique (15.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). In particular, an isoleucine to threonine mutation was introduced in position 781, and further substitutions were made at this position to proline, leucine, alanine, asparagine, glutamine, and arginine. The mutated fragments were cloned into a BamHI-AflII-cassette (nucleotides 1265 and 2689, numbering according to the CaV1.2 α1-subunit coding sequence). This cassette was also used in creation of C769P, G770P, N771P, Y772P, I773P, L774P, L775P, N776P, V777P, F778P, L779P, A780P, A782P, and V783P. Mutations that did not lead to functional channels were recloned into the GFP-tagged vector (14.Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) to study membrane targeting. All constructs were checked by restriction site mapping and sequencing. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Human embryonic kidney tsA-201 cells were grown at 5% CO2 and 37 °C to 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were split via trypsin EDTA and plated on 35-mm Petri dishes (Falcon) at 30–50% confluence ∼16 h before transfection. Subsequently tsA-201 cells were co-transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant CaV1.2 α1-subunits with auxiliary β1a (16.Ruth P. Rohrkasten A. Biel M. Bosse E. Regulla S. Meyer H.E.

Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15142) Google Scholar) by means of an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments) 36–48 h after transfection. The extracellular bath solution contained BaCl2 5 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, HEPES 10 mm, and choline-Cl 140 mm, titrated to pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid. Patch pipettes with resistances of 1–4 megohms were made from borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical Instruments) and filled with pipette solution containing CsCl 145 mm, MgCl2 3 mm, HEPES 10 mm, and EGTA 10 mm, titrated to pH 7.25 with CsOH. All data were digitized using a DIGIDATA 1200 interface (Axon Instruments), smoothed by means of a four-pole Bessel filter and stored on computer hard disc. 300- and 100-ms current traces were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz, for the steady state inactivation protocol, currents were sampled at 1 kHz and filtered at 0.5 kHz, and tail currents were sampled at 50 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz. Leak currents were subtracted digitally using average values of scaled leakage currents elicited by a 10 mV hyperpolarizing pulse or electronically by means of an Axopatch 200 amplifier. Series resistance and offset voltage were routinely compensated. The pClamp software package (Version 7.0 Axon Instruments, Inc.) was used for data acquisition and preliminary analysis. Microcal Origin 5.0 was employed for analysis and curve fitting. The voltage dependence of activation was determined from current-voltage (I-V) curves that were fitted according to the following modified Boltzmann term: I = Gmax (V - Vrev)/(1 + exp[(V0.5,act - V)/kact]) where VreV is extrapolated reversal potential, V is membrane potential, I is peak current, Gmax is maximum membrane conductance, V0.5,act is voltage for half-maximal activation, and kact is slope factor. The time course of current activation was fitted to a mono-exponential function: I(t) = A[exp(-t/τ)] + C; where I(t) is current at time t, A is the amplitude coefficient, τ is a time constant, and C is steady state current. The voltage dependence of IBa inactivation (inactivation curve) was measured using a multistep protocol to account for run-down (see Ref. 1.Hemara-Wahanui A. Berjukow S. Hope C.I. Dearden P.K. Wu S.B. Wilson-Wheeler J. Sharp D.M. Lundon-Treweek P. Clover G.M. Hoda J.C. Striessnig J. Marksteiner R. Hering S. Maw M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7553-7558Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The pulse sequence was applied every 40 s from a holding potential of -100 mV. Inactivation curves were drawn according to a Boltzmann equation: IBa,inact = Iss + (1 - Iss)/(1 + exp[(V - V0.5,inact.)/k)] where V is membrane potential, V0.5,inact is midpoint voltage, k is the slope factor, and Iss is the fraction of non-inactivating current. Data are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed with the Student's unpaired t test. Confocal Imaging—The confocal images were obtained ∼30 h after transfection. Data illustrated are representative for 15–20 tsA-201 cells from three independent experiments. Confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal laser scanning microscope, using a 63× (1.4 NA) oil immersion objective. The plasma membrane was stained with 1 μm FM4-64 (amphiphilic styryl dye, Molecular Probes). Images were acquired using an argon laser (excitation, 488 nm; emission BP505–530 nm emission filter) for the GFP-tagged CaV1.2 α1-subunits and a He-Ne laser (excitation, 543 nm; emission filter, LP650 nm) for FM4-64. Mutation I781T Shifts CaV1.2 Channel Activation to More Hyperpolarized Voltages—Residue Ile-745 in segment IIS6 of the CaV1.4 α1-subunit corresponds to residue Ile-781 in the CaV1.2 α1-subunit (Fig. 1A). The effects of I781T substitution on CaV1.2 channel activation were investigated after expressing wild-type or mutant CaV1.2 α1-subunits together with auxiliary β1a and α2-δ1-subunits in tsA-201 cells. Families of inward Ba2+ currents (Fig. 1B) and the corresponding current-voltage (I-V) curves (Fig. 1C) and voltage dependences of channel activation (Fig. 2A) and inactivation (Fig. 2B) are shown. For both wild-type and I781T channels, the current reversed at ∼50 mV indicating that the I781T mutation does not affect ion selectivity (Fig. 1C). The midpoint voltage of activation changed from -9.9 ± 1.1 mV in the wild-type channel to -37.7 ± 1.2 mV in the I781T channel (Fig. 2A). I781T also shifted the voltage dependence of inactivation. The midpoint voltage of the inactivation curve changed from -38.7 ± 1.0 mV in wild-type channels to -57.8 ± 0.7 mV in I781T channels (Fig. 2, B and C). Wild-type channels were inactivated by 65 ± 4%, whereas I781T channels were inactivated by 47 ± 3% during a 300-ms pulse at the peak of their respective I-V curves (0 mV, -30 mV; Fig. 1B, TABLE ONE).FIGURE 2Ile-781 substitutions shift the voltage dependences of CaV1.2 channel activation and inactivation.

To gain insight into the structural requirements at this position, we subsequently replaced Ile-781 by residues of different size, polarity and charge. Replacement of Ile-781 by leucine, alanine, asparagine, and proline caused a shift in channel activation ranging from approximately -10 mV for I781L to approximately -37 mV for I781P (TABLE ONE). The same mutations also shifted the channel inactivation curves by values ranging from approximately -6 mV (I781L) to approximately -30 mV (I781P) (Fig. 2, B and C). Interestingly, the changes in the voltage dependences of channel activation and inactivation occurred in parallel. This is evident from Fig. 2C where the midpoint voltages of the activation curves are plotted versus the midpoint voltages of the inactivation curves. Fitting the data with a regression function revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.97. Ile-781 Substitutions Showed Slow Activation Gating at Hyperpolarized Voltages and Slow Deactivation—The voltage dependences of the activation time constants for the Ile-781 substitution mutants were also determined (Fig. 3). Between -30 mV and +30 mV, activation of the wild-type and mutant channels occurred with a similar time course (wild-type, τm ranged between 3.2 ms (-30 mV) and 2.5 ms (30 mV); I781P, τm ranged between 3.9 ms (-30 mV) and 2.1 ms (10 mV) (Fig. 3B)). At voltages negative to the threshold potential of wild-type CaV1.2 activation (-40 mV, Fig. 2A), mutant channels displayed decelerated activation kinetics (Fig. 3). At -50 mV, no channel activation was observed in wild-type and I781L (Fig. 3A), whereas the four remaining mutant channels activated at comparatively slow rates (see Fig. 3B for time constants). Moreover, activation of I781P at -60 mV was even slower (τm ∼25 ms). In other words, the more the voltage dependence of channel activation was shifted (TABLE ONE), the more slowly the channels activated at hyperpolarized voltages (Fig. 3B). To gain insight into the stability of the open channel conformation, we also analyzed the voltage dependence of deactivation for I781P and I781T, the mutants that induced the strongest effects on channel activation. The two mutant channels deactivated more slowly than the wild-type channel at all potentials with deactivation of I781P being slower than that of I781T (Fig. 4). Proline Substitution of Gly-770—A similar kinetic phenotype to that observed for the I781T substitution (slow deactivation, slow activation at hyperpolarized voltages, and decelerated inactivation) was previously reported for a bacterial sodium channel (NaChBac) when a highly conserved glycine (Gly-219) in the central third of S6 was substituted by proline (20.Zhao Y. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2004; 41: 859-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To evaluate an analogous role of Gly-770 in the corresponding position of segment IIS6 of CaV1.2 (Fig. 1A), we mutated this amino acid to proline. G770P had, however, neither significant effects on the current kinetics (Fig. 5A, second current family from top; Fig. 5B) nor on the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation (Fig. 6). N771P adjacent to G770P was found to shift the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation (Fig. 6B, TABLE ONE) and to substantially slow the time course of inactivation (Fig. 5A, TABLE ONE). N771P did not, however, show slow channel activation at hyperpolarized voltages (τm ranged between 1.3 ± 0.2 and 2.9 ± 0.2 ms at all voltages, Fig. 5), and channel deactivation was not decelerated (Fig. 4).FIGURE 6Positional specificity of the effects of proline substitution on the voltage dependence of CaV1.2 gating.

To examine the positional specificity of I781P on CaV1.2 channel gating we substituted all amino acids between Cys-769 and Val-783 by prolines (Figs. 5 and 6, TABLE ONE). Substitution of the two alanine residues flanking Ile-781 (A780P and A782P) and of L779P substantially shifted the voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 6, TABLE ONE). A782P and L779P also showed decelerated channel activation at hyperpolarized voltages (Fig. 5B). Additionally channel inactivation was decelerated for A782P and not detectable for A780P and L779P during a 300-ms pulse (Fig. 5A, TABLE ONE). Two peculiarities were observed for A780P. This mutation i) shifted the voltage dependence of channel activation but not inactivation (Fig. 6B), and ii) this mutation slowed the kinetics of channel activation at all voltages (Fig. 5B, inset). Proline substitutions C769P, I773P, and F778P caused smaller or non-significant shifts in the voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 6A, TABLE ONE). Evidence for Membrane Targeting of Non-functional Mutants—Six constructs (Y772P, L774P, L775P, N776, V777P, and V783P) did not conduct Ba2+ currents. To investigate whether the lack of current observed for these mutants could be because of an impairment of plasma membrane targeting, we examined the subcellular distribution of GFP-tagged mutants (14.Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) by confocal microscopy. Wild-type and mutant GFP-tagged CaV1.2 α1-subunits were co-transfected with β1a and α2-δ1-subunits in tsA-201 cells, and the plasma membrane was visualized by staining with FM4-64 (Fig. 7). Consistent with previous reports (21.Gerster U. Neuhuber B. Groschner K. Striessnig J. Flucher B.E. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22.Gao T. Bunemann M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2137-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the wild-type CaV1.2 α1-subunit localized predominantly at the plasma membrane with some intracellular labeling also evident. Similarly, images taken from cells expressing the non-functional channels (shown are two representative mutants) demonstrated that all mutant subunits were targeted to the plasma membrane, with some intracellular staining also detected. These findings demonstrate that the lack of current observed for these mutants cannot be attributed to a failure of the mutant GFP-tagged CaV1.2 α1-subunits to reach the plasma membrane. Bay K8644 and β-Subunit Modulation of Ile-781 Mutants—A shift of voltage dependence of activation toward more negative voltages is a hallmark of Bay K8644 action. It was therefore interesting to analyze if the shift in activation gating caused by the naturally occurring mutation I781T would affect BAY K8644 action. At potentials corresponding to the maximum of the current voltage relationships (0 mV for WT and -30 mV for I781T, Fig. 1C) 100 nm of BAY K8644 induced similar stimulation (2.3 ± 0.3-fold, n = 3 in WT and 2.6 ± 0.3, n = 3 in the I781T mutant) (Fig. 8, A and B). The voltage dependences of channel activation were shifted to comparable extents, -5.9 ± 1.3 mV (n = 4) in I781T and -6.7 ± 1.4 mV in WT (n = 3) (Fig. 8C). It is well established that β-subunits modulate the gating of high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (for reviews see Refs. 24.Birnbaumer L. Qin N. Olcese R. Tareilus E. Platano D. Costantin J. Stefani E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 25.Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 26.Hering S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 509-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether the observed changes in the voltage dependence of channel activation interfere with β-subunit modulation, we co-expressed wild-type, I781T, and I781P CaV1.2 α1-subunits with β1a- or β2a-subunits as well as the α2-δ1-subunit and analyzed the resulting activation curves. For each of these channels, co-expression of the β2a-subunit gave a small hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation and slower channel inactivation when compared with co-expression with the β1a-subunit (Fig. 9, TABLE ONE). These findings suggest that these Ile-781 mutants do not substantially affect β-subunit modulation. In this study we demonstrate a crucial role of a cluster of amino acids (Leu-779, Ala-780, Ile-781, Ala-782) in the pore-forming segment IIS6 in activation and inactivation of the CaV1.2 channel. This finding is related to a recently described channelopathy, where a mutation of the corresponding isoleucine to threonine in CaV1.4 (I745T) causes a severe X-linked retinal disorder (12.Hope C.I. Sharp D.M. Hemara-Wahanui A. Sissingh J.I. Lundon P. Mitchell E.A. Maw M.A. Clover G.M. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol. 2005; 33: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As previously described for the I745T CaV1.4 mutant (1.Hemara-Wahanui A. Berjukow S. Hope C.I. Dearden P.K. Wu S.B. Wilson-Wheeler J. Sharp D.M. Lundon-Treweek P. Clover G.M. Hoda J.C. Striessnig J. Marksteiner R. Hering S. Maw M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7553-7558Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), I781T resulted in an almost identical shift in the voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 1C) and slowed inactivation of CaV1.2 (TABLE ONE) suggesting a common mechanism of gating disturbances in both channel types. Additional analyses revealed that the I781T mutation also caused a negative shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation (Fig. 2B), slowed activation at hyperpolarized voltages (Fig. 3), and slowed deactivation at all potentials (Fig. 4). These changes in gating of CaV1.2 favor transitions to the open state and can be explained by a destabilization of the closed state (i.e. an acceleration of the forward transition to the open state, see 4), a stabilization of the open state (i.e. a deceleration of the backward transition to the closed state, see Ref. 20.Zhao Y. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2004; 41: 859-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), or both. Ile-781 Substitutions May Destabilize the Closed State—The five Ile-781 substitutions that produced functional channels caused similar alterations in channel gating (Fig. 2). It seems more feasible to explain this finding by a destabilization, rather than by a stabilization, of channel conformations. A possible mechanism for destabilization of the closed state could be a reduction in hydrophobic interactions in position 781 with neighboring residues in the S6-bundle crossing region. This explanation is in line with the lower hydrophobicity and larger shifts in the activation curve of threonine when compared with alanine and leucine (Fig. 2A). Thus, hydrophobic interactions of Ile-781 with neighboring residues in the bundle crossing region might contribute to stabilization of the closed conformation in wild-type channels. Changes in hydrophobicity alone can, however, not explain the full picture. Asparagine is less hydrophobic than threonine (27.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17209) Google Scholar), although it causes a similar shift (Fig. 2C). As leucine differs from isoleucine by the position of only one methyl group and showed the smallest shift, we speculated that Ile-781 forms part of a tightly fitted region in the closed channel state. Proline caused the largest effect on channel activation. Its hydrophobicity is, however, closer to the wild-type isoleucine than to threonine and asparagine. Proline might disturb the interaction with neighboring amino acids in the closed state by favoring bending of the α-helix (28.Cordes F.S. Bright J.N. Sansom M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and may thereby favor an open pore conformation. Evidence for Stabilization of the Open State—The deceleration of deactivation observed for I781P and I781T (Fig. 4) is a strong indication of a stabilization of the open channel conformation. A stabilization of the open state is also supported by the reduced rate of channel inactivation that was observed for the majority of Ile-781 mutants (TABLE ONE); a prolonged sojourn in the open channel state would result in a slower net transition rate from the open to the inactivated state. These findings indicate that a point mutation in one S6 segment can be sufficient to slow channel closure. We speculate that closure of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels requires the return of all four pore-forming elements into the resting state. If one element of the gate structure does not precisely fit the resting (closed) state, then the conducting pore may remain open for a longer period. Positional Specificity of Ile-781—To examine the positional specificity of I781P we substituted the residues between Cys-769 and Val-783 by prolines (see Fig. 5A). Amino acids causing prominent shifts in the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation were localized in a cluster near the intracellular channel mouth (I781P > L779P, A782P, A780P). The more the voltage dependence of channel activation was shifted, the slower these channels activated at hyperpolarized potentials (Figs. 5 and 6A). A782P showed moderately decreased inactivation, whereas inactivation was severely reduced for L779P and A780P suggesting that all three residues contribute to both activation and inactivation gating to different extents. In the upper part of IIS6, N771P caused a shift (-17 mV) of the activation curve and moderately slowed inactivation, but did not shift the inactivation curve markedly and did not affect the rate of channel activation at hyperpolarized voltages, (Fig. 5B, Fig. 6B, TABLE ONE). Moreover, unlike I781P and I781T, the voltage dependence of channel deactivation was unaltered in this mutant (Fig. 4B). Together these findings suggest that mutation N771P does not stabilize the open state but is more likely to destabilize the closed state. The correlation between shifts in the activation and inactivation curves observed for all mutants with the exception of A780P represents an interesting finding per se Figs. 2B and 6B. A model describing channel activation in terms of a voltage-sensing machinery, a discrete voltage-independent mechanism of the pore opening and inactivation events might reproduce this correlation. Although correctly targeted to the plasma membrane, some proline mutants did not conduct barium currents (Fig. 7). These data suggest that proline substitutions in Ca2+ channel S6 segments may disrupt the functionality of the conducting pore. Similar observations were recently made for proline substitutions in the central part of NaChBac segment S6 (29.Zhao Y. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17873-17878Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We cannot exclude, however, that other substitutions in these positions would produce functional Ca2+ channels with altered gating properties. Bay K8644 and β-Subunit Modulation—Slowing of deactivation and a shift of steady state activation as observed for the naturally occurring mutation I781T and other effective mutations is reminiscent of BAY K8644 action. Interestingly, mutation I781T neither prevented a further shift of channel activation nor affected the stimulation of the current (Fig. 8). These data suggest that Bay K8644 and mutation I781T affect the channel via independent mechanisms. Functional and structural studies suggest that the modulation of channel activation and inactivation by β-subunits occurs by a direct modulation of the movement of the pore-forming segment IS6 (26.Hering S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 509-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30.Van Petegem F. Clark K.A. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The I781P and I781T mutants showed the same shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation and slowed inactivation that occurs when wild-type α1 subunits are coexpressed with β2a rather than β1a (Fig. 9, TABLE ONE). These findings suggest that β-subunit modulation of segment IS6 and the effects of residue 781 on pore stability are determined by independent mechanisms. Significance of Ile-781 and Adjacent Residues for Activation Gating of Ca2+ Channels—The crystal structure of the 2-TM helix calcium-gated potassium channel MthK revealed that a conserved glycine at position 83 is responsible for bending the pore-lining M2 helix leading to channel opening (31.Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the corresponding glycine (Gly-219) in the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NaChBac represents a “gating hinge” (20.Zhao Y. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2004; 41: 859-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on two principle findings, i) G219P shifts the activation curve to hyperpolarized voltages, and ii) this shift is accompanied by a deceleration of deactivation kinetics. Mutating the corresponding Gly-770 in CaV1.2 to proline did not cause significant effects on channel gating (Fig. 6, TABLE ONE). Localization of a gating hinge at residue Gly-770 is therefore not likely. The kinetic phenotype of Ile-781 and adjacent residues (Leu-779, Ala-780, and Ala-782) observed in the present study is, however, similar to the one described for NaChBac construct G219P (20.Zhao Y. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2004; 41: 859-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our data therefore suggest that helix bending is more likely to occur close to the inner channel mouth in CaV1.2. Residues 779–782 are conserved in high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, and it is tempting to speculate that this sequence (LAIA) might participate in a common mechanism of gating. We thank Dr. Thomas Peterbauer for his support in confocal imaging. The excellent technical assistance of Hannelore Kadlec was greatly appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2032159825,"ARHI is a maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene whose expression is markedly downregulated in breast cancer. Reactivation of ARHI expression in breast cancer cells is associated with increased histone H3 acetylation and decreased lysine 9 methylation of histone H3. An ARHI promoter segment that spanned bases −420 to +58 (designated the P2 region) exhibits significantly higher promoter activity in normal cells than in cancer cells. To better understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to this differential transcriptional activity, we sought to identify transcription factors that bind to the P2 region of the ARHI promoter and regulate its activity. Sequence analysis and oligonucleotide competition in electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified an A2 fragment containing an E2F-binding site. Using specific antibodies in supershift assays, we have shown that anti-E2F1 and 4 antibodies can supershift the A2–protein complexes, whereas anti-E2F2 and 6 antibodies cannot, demonstrating that the A2 fragment interacts with specific members of the E2F family proteins. When compared with normal breast epithelial cells, breast cancer cells have significantly elevated expression of E2F1, 4 and increased E2F DNA-binding activity. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that both E2F1 and 4 bind to the ARHI promoter in breast cancer cells in vivo. This binding was reduced when the cells were treated with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor – trichostatin A (TSA). When SKBr3 cells were cotransfected with an ARHI/luciferase reporter and E2F-expression vectors, E2F1 and 4 reduced ARHI promoter activity 2–3-fold, and this reduction could be reversed by TSA treatment. The negative regulation by E2F–HDAC complexes could also be reduced by small interfering RNA of E2F1 and 4. While the retinoblastoma protein, pRB, alone had no effect on ARHI promoter activity, repression by E2F1, but not E2F4, was enhanced by the coexpression of pRB. Taken together, our results suggest that E2F1, 4 and their complexes with HDAC play an important role in downregulating the expression of the tumor suppressor gene ARHI in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2070676976,"HS1 (hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1), a substrate of protein tyrosine kinases in lymphocytes, binds to F-actin, and promotes Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization. However, the mechanism for the interaction between HS1 and F-actin has not yet been fully characterized. HS1 contains 3.5 tandem repeats, a coiled-coil region, and an SH3 domain at the C terminus. Unlike cortactin, which is closely related to HS1 and requires absolutely the repeat domain for F-actin binding, an HS1 mutant with deletion of the repeat domain maintains a significant F-actin binding activity. On the other hand, deletion of the coiled-coil region abolished the ability of HS1 to bind to actin filaments and to activate the Arp2/3 complex for actin nucleation and actin branching. Furthermore, a peptide containing the coiled-coil sequence only was sufficient for F-actin binding. Within cells overexpressing green fluorescent protein-tagged HS1 proteins, wild type HS1 co-localizes with cortical F-actin at the cell leading edge, whereas mutants with deletion of either the coiled-coil region or the repeat domain diffuse in the cytoplasm. Immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that the coiled-coil deletion mutant binds poorly to F-actin, whereas the mutant without the repeat domain fails to bind to both Arp2/3 complex and F-actin. These data suggest that the HS1 coiled-coil region acts synergistically with the repeat domain in the modulation of the Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization.

These data suggest that the HS1 coiled-coil region acts synergistically with the repeat domain in the modulation of the Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization. Actin dynamics plays a fundamental role in immune system such as immune response, phagocytosis, and adhesion to cells or extracellular substratum. Assembly of cortical actin filaments that lie underneath the plasma membrane is the function of actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex and its associated proteins. At least two types of proteins that bind to and subsequently activate the Arp2/3 complex in a sequential manner have been described in mammalian cells, WASP and cortactin. WASP, a protein family that includes WASP, N-WASP, and three WAVE/Scar-related proteins (1Millard T.H. Sharp S.J. Machesky L.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), initiates actin assembly by recruiting G-actin to the proximity of the Arp2/3 complex, resulting in a heterogeneous nucleation site for efficient actin extension (2Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar). The initial product of actin assembly, where the Arp2/3 complex is still linking to a nascent filamentous actin (F-actin), acquires a high affinity for cortactin, binding of which provokes further actin nucleation and extension (3Uruno T. Liu J. Li Y. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26086-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Unlike WASP/WAVE proteins, which interact with the Arp2/3 complex through an acidic rich sequence at their C termini, cortactin binds to the complex through a DDW-containing N terminus (4Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In addition, cortactin contains a unique F-actin binding motif that consists of 6.5 tandem repeats, with each having exactly 37 amino acids (5Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The binding of F-actin appears to be an important property of cortactin and absolutely required for the cortactin/Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly (4Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In immune cells, the function of cortactin is likely carried out by HS1 (6Kitamura D. Kaneko H. Miyagoe Y. Ariyasu T. Watanabe T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9367-9379PubMed Google Scholar), which contains 3.5 cortactin characteristic repeated units, a coiled-coil (CC) 5The abbreviations used are: CC, coiled-coil; DTT, dithiothreitol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SH3, Src homology 3; VCA, verprolincofilin acidic motif. 5The abbreviations used are: CC, coiled-coil; DTT, dithiothreitol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SH3, Src homology 3; VCA, verprolincofilin acidic motif. region, an SH3 domain at the C terminus, and an Arp2/3 binding domain at the N terminus (see Fig. 1). Like cortactin, HS1 shows a significant F-actin binding activity and markedly promotes actin assembly mediated by Arp2/3 complex when analyzed with purified proteins (7He H. Watanabe T. Zhan X. Huang C. Schuuring E. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Kumar C.C. Simpson R.J. Maruta H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3829-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Despite this similarity, the mechanism for HS1 to associate with F-actin is unclear because it has notably less repeat unites than cortactin. In fact, it has been described that cortactin mutants with 3.5 repeats bind poorly to F-actin and are unable to activate Arp2/3 complex (4Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 9Katsube T. Togashi S. Hashimoto N. Ogiu T. Tsuji H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 427: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), indicating that the minimal number of the repeat units for F-actin binding is 4.5. One possibility is that HS1 could have an additional F-actin binding motif. In the exploration of the detailed mechanism for HS1 to bind to F-actin, we found that HS1 mutant with deletion of the repeat domain maintains an F-actin binding activity but is impaired in Arp2/3 binding. We also found that the CC region is necessary for F-actin binding and activation of the Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly. These data suggest a new function of the repeat domain and indicate for the first time that the CC region plays an important role in the regulation of the activity of HS1, the property that may be adapted to the actin dynamics in hematopoietic cells. Cell Lines and Antibodies—Human vein umbilical endothelial cells were purchased from Clonetics and cultured as previously described (11Li Y. Liu J. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37187-37193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Immature mouse B cell line WEHI-231 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Antibody specific to β-actin monoclonal antibody is from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody specific to mouse HS1 was raised in rabbits against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 306-320. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to Arp2/3 was prepared against a human p41 peptide (QSSQRGLTARERFQNLDKKC). DNA Constructs—HS1 constructs based on MGIN viral vector were prepared as previously described (12Hao J.J. Carey G.B. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33413-33420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To prepare glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged HS1 constructs, including GST-HS1, GST-HS1-CC, GST-HS1-R, and GST-HS1ΔPS, DNA fragments were produced by polymerase chain reaction with primers encoding the corresponding mutations and then subcloned into BamHI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T-2 (Pharmacia Biotech). The deletion mutants GST-HS1ΔCC and GST-HS1ΔR were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The MGIN-based retroviruses carrying HS1-GFP or HS1 mutants were prepared and infected to cells as described previously (12Hao J.J. Carey G.B. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33413-33420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein Preparation and Purification—Plasmids encoding GST-HS1 constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. The transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C to the density of A600 = 0.6, and expression of GST-HS1 proteins was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and by incubation for additional 3 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 1/10 volume of starting culture with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2.5 mm dithiothreitol and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspended bacteria were stored at -80 °C overnight. The frozen bacteria were thawed at room temperature and sonicated with an ultrasonic processor (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and further filtering through a 0.22-μm sterilized filter (Fisher Scientific). The clarified lysate was loaded onto a mini glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column. After loading, the column was washed extensively with PBS, and GST-tagged protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione in PBS. The eluted solution was dialyzed at 4 °C against PBS containing 0.5 mm DTT, which was changed every 3 h for a total of three times. The purity of eluted proteins was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE. F-actin Binding Assay—F-actin was prepared as described previously (13Huang C. Ni Y. Wang T. Gao Y. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To analyze the F-actin binding activity of HS1 proteins, GST-tagged proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose were mixed with F-actin (2 μm) in 150 μl of F buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm KC1, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated at 4 °C on a rotating wheel for 90 min. After centrifugation (2 min at 100 × g), the beads were washed twice with F buffer and dissolved in 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. Actin present in the beads and the supernatants were revealed by Coo-massie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE. F-actin binding was also assessed by co-sedimentation. Briefly, the purified GST proteins (1 μm) were mixed with F-actin at different concentrations as indicated and incubated on ice. After incubation for 30 min the mixture was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the pellet was resuspended in 2× SDS loading buffer at equal volume. Aliquots of the supernatants and pellets were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Analysis of the Interaction with Arp2/3 Complex—Immobilized GST-tagged proteins (0.25 μm) were mixed with 10 pmol of purified Arp2/3 complex in 500 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) and incubated at 4 °C on a rotating wheel for 90 min. After brief centrifugation, the beads were washed twice with buffer A and dissolved in 20 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer. The amount of Arp2/3 complex in the beads was detected by immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti-Arp3 antibody after separation by SDS-PAGE. Actin-polymerization Assay—Polymerization of globular actin (G-actin; 10% pyrene-labeled) was performed as described (4Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) with a modification. Briefly, Ca2+ ATP-G-actin in G-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm ATP) was converted into Mg2+ ATP-G-actin by mixing with 0.1 volume of 10× exchange buffer (2 mm EGTA and 1 mm MgCl2) at 20 °C for 2 min. Actin polymerization was initiated by adding 60 μl of Mg2+ ATP-G-actin (10 μm) to 240 μl of 1.25 × polymerization buffer (62.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 12.5 mm imidazole, pH 7.3, 1.25 mm EGTA, 0.125 mm CaCl2, 0.625 mm DTT, 0.3125 mm ATP, and 3.75 mm NaN3) in the presence of Arp2/3 complex and GST-HS1 at the concentrations as indicated. Actin assembly was monitored by measuring the increase in pyrene fluorescence detected by LS50B spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with filters for excitation at 365 nm and emission at 407 nm. F-actin Branching Assay—The F-actin branching assay was based on a method that was described previously (3Uruno T. Liu J. Li Y. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26086-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, actin polymerization was initiated by adding 2.0 μm G-actin to the mixture of 25 nm GST-HS1 proteins, 100 nm VCA, and 50 nm Arp2/3 complex. To visualize actin branches, rhodamine-phalloidin (2 μm) was added to the reaction solution at 15 min after initiation. Samples were diluted 200-fold in fresh fluorescence buffer (100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm DTT, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.3, 0.5% methylcellulose, 20 μg/ml catalase, 100 μg/ml glucose oxidase, and 3 mg/ml glucose). Diluted samples (2.0 μl) were applied on to coverslips precoated with poly-d-lysine. Actin filaments were examined by a Nikon inverted microscope TE2000-U using a 100× 1.5 NA objective lens. Images were captured with a digital camera equipped on the microscope and controlled by the ACT software. The digital images were processed with Adobe Photoshop to generate monochromatic images. Actin branches were quantified by counting the number of branched filaments based on five randomly selected digital images. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells expressing GFP-HS1 variants were seeded on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in a 6-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and stained with rhodamine phalloidin. The stained samples were inspected under Nikon TE2000-U microscope equipped with a digital camera. The digital images were captured and processed by Adobe Photoshop. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot—1 × 107 of WEHI-231 cells expressing HS1-GFP or mutants were washed once with PBS and lysed in 500 μl of TNE buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates were centrifuged briefly to remove insoluble debris. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose coupled with GFP monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% (v/v) SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted using appropriate primary antibodies followed by secondary horse radish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad). The membrane was stripped using Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and reprobed with appropriate antibodies. Blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The CC Motif Is Necessary and Sufficient for F-actin Binding—To explore the structural motifs necessary for F-actin binding, a series of HS1 mutants were prepared as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1). Purified recombinant proteins at either 1 or 5 μm were incubated with spontaneously assembled F-actin. The resulting complex of F-actin and HS1 was pulled down by glutathione beads. 7% of the supernatant (s) and 40% of the pellet (p) were resolved in SDS-PAGE and the gel was subsequently stained by Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2). Although GST itself at either 1 or 5 μm failed to pull down any detectable F-actin, which displayed a gel motility of 42 kDa, GST-HS1 precipitated readily F-actin at both concentrations (Fig. 2A, right). Likewise, the mutant GST-HS1ΔPS, which lacks the proline and SH3 domains, also pelleted a significant amount of F-actin, indicating that the C-terminal region is dispensable for F-actin binding. Interestingly, the repeat deletion mutant GST-HS1ΔR was still able to pull down F-actin, although it did so less efficiently at 1 μm. On the other hand, the mutant GST-HS1ΔCC with the deletion of the amino acids from 215 to 280 failed to do so at both concentrations. To confirm whether the CC and the repeat domains are sufficient for F-actin binding, peptides GST-HS1-R, which contains the repeat domain only (Fig. 1), and GST-HS1-CC, which contains the sequence from 215 to 280, were prepared and used in the pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, actin was readily detected in the pellet of GST-HS1-CC, whereas it was absent in that of GST-HS1-R, indicative of a poor interaction between the repeat domain and F-actin. To verify that the pull-down assay reflects a true F-actin binding, the mixture of GST fusion proteins and F-actin were co-sedimented at a high centrifugation force, the assay that has been most commonly used for F-actin binding. As shown in Fig. 2B, the CC domain peptide itself bound readily to F-actin, and deletion of it nearly abolished the binding. The results with other mutants by co-sedimentation were also similar to those based on pull-down assay. A quantitative co-sedimentation was performed at different concentrations of F-actin, from which we estimated that GST-HS1 and GST-HS1ΔPS have equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values of 0.52 and 0.46 μm, respectively, whereas GST-HS1-CC peptide shows a Kd = 1.63 μm. It is apparent that the CC motif does not account for the full F-actin binding activity, suggesting that other sequence of HS1 may likely play a role in the optimal F-actin binding as well. One possible situation is that the CC domain acts synergistically with the repeat domain for F-actin binding. Indeed, the repeat deletion mutant GST-HS1ΔR has a slightly lower affinity for F-actin than the wild type HS1 with a Kd = 0.68 μm, indicating that the repeat domain also plays a role in F-actin binding, though to a less degree. It should be also noticed that the only mutant that was able to be nearly 100% depleted by F-actin in the co-sedimentation assay is GST-HS1ΔPS (Fig. 2C), whereas trace amounts of the other HS1 forms, including the wild type, were apparently maintained in the supernatant even in the presence of 5 μm F-actin. This suggests that HS1 may possess a configuration that is resistant to F-actin binding and negatively regulated by the C-terminal region. The CC Motif Is Required for HS1 to Promote the Arp2/3 Complex-mediated Actin Polymerization—HS1 is known to bind to and activate Arp2/3 complex (8Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine whether the CC domain plays a role in the interaction with Arp2/3 complex, the recombinant GST-HS1 mutants were used to pull down purified Arp2/3 complex, which was further detected by immunoblot using antibody against Arp3, a subunit of Arp2/3 complex. As shown in Fig. 3A, GST-HS1 and GST-HS1ΔPS bound effectively to Arp2/3 complex. Deletion of the CC motif or the repeat domain as shown by GST-HS1ΔCC and GST-HS1ΔR had little effect on Arp2/3 binding under the same condition. Likewise, GST-HS1-CC or GST-HS1-R itself was unable to bind to Arp2/3 binding activity. Thus, the CC motif and repeat domain are dispensable for Arp2/3 binding under the condition without actin polymerization. Our previous study has shown that the functional affinity of cortactin for Arp2/3 complex is influenced by actin polymerization as a result of binding to branched actin (3Uruno T. Liu J. Li Y. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26086-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the CC and repeat motifs could regulate the affinity for the Arp2/3 complex only when actin polymerization takes place. As a result, we analyzed the effect of these GST-HS1 fusion proteins on the Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly, providing an indirect measurement of the interaction with the complex. Actin polymerization was initiated by adding ATP-actin to the mixture of HS1 proteins and Arp2/3 complex. As reported previously (8Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), GST-HS1 enhanced markedly the kinetic growth of actin filaments in the presence of Arp2/3 complex (Fig. 3B, curve c compared with curve a). The mutant of GST-HS1ΔPS also promoted actin polymerization at an efficiency that is slightly higher than GST-HS1 (Fig. 3B, curve f), which is consistent with a possible inhibitory activity of the C-terminal domain, a phenomenon that was also found with cortactin (14Zhu J. Zhou K. Hao J.J. Liu J. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 108: 807-817Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, both GST-HS1ΔR and GST-HS1ΔCC failed to induce significant increase in actin polymerization under the same condition (Fig. 3B, curves d and e), indicating that both the CC motif and the repeat domain are essential for the activation of the Arp2/3 complex. The HS1 mutants were also evaluated for the effect on Arp2/3 complex and N-WASP mediated actin branching, the characteristic feature for the Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly that can be enhanced by wild type HS1 (8Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To visualize actin filamentous morphology, actin filaments were assembled and stained immediately by rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. The labeled actin filaments were subsequently inspected by fluorescent microscopy. Under this condition, spontaneously assembled actin proteins were shown as long and non-branched filaments (Fig. 4A, a). In contrast, actin was assembled into short and branched filaments in the presence of Arp2/3 complex and GST-VCA (Fig. 4A, b), which is a constitutively activated form of N-WASP (15Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). As previously reported (8Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the branched actin filaments were significantly enhanced in the presence of either GST-HS1 or GST-HS1ΔPS as shown by the apparently increased density of branched filaments (Fig. 4A, c and d). On the other hand, both GST-HS1ΔR and GST-HS1ΔCC failed to increase actin branching (Fig. 4A, e and f). A quantitative analysis further indicates that the mutants GST-HS1ΔR and GST-HS1ΔCC at 25 nm actually slightly inhibited branching as compared with that without HS1 (Fig. 4B). At a higher dose (75 nm), the inhibition was more apparent, suggesting a possible competition between HS1 mutants and GST-VCA, presumably for Arp2/3 complex binding. Analysis of the Role of the CC and Repeat Motifs in the Interaction between HS1 and F-actin in Cells—To facilitate examination of the distribution of HS1 mutants in cells, MGIN retroviruses carrying HS1-GFP fusions were used to infect human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The infected cells were stained with rhodamine phalloidin (Fig. 5, red). As shown in Fig. 5, HS1-GFP, which was shown as green staining, localized at the cell leading edges and the perinucleus. In the cell leading edge, it was primarily found in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles where F-actin is evidently enriched. This pattern is quite similar to that of cortactin (16Liu J. Huang C. Zhan X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), indicating that HS1-GFP functions properly. In contrast, HS1ΔCC-GFP randomly distributed in the cytoplasm and showed little association with F-actin within the membrane protrusive structures. Similarly, HS1ΔR-GFP diffused and did not exhibit a clear association with any distinct cellar structures in the leading edge. Because endothelial cells express few endogenous HS1 proteins (data not shown), we also evaluated the interaction between HS1 mutants and F-actin in B cells where HS1 is abundant (17Yamanashi Y. Okada M. Semba T. Yamori T. Umemori H. Tsunasawa S. Toyo-shima K. Kitamura D. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3631-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The murine WEHI-231 B cells expressing GFP-tagged HS1 mutants were established similarly by retroviral infection (12Hao J.J. Carey G.B. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33413-33420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by GFP antibody. The pellets were blotted with antibody either against β-actin or HS1. All HS1 proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 6A). Two lower bands of HS1ΔR-GFP likely present degraded proteins. It is apparent that HS1ΔCC-GFP co-precipitated poorly with F-actin as compared with wild type HS1-GFP, the result that is consistent with the cell staining and in vitro data. Interestingly, the F-actin binding activity of HS1ΔR-GFP was nearly abolished. Although this result agrees with the cell staining (Fig. 5), it was paradoxical because the same mutant still maintains a significant F-actin binding activity when analyzed with purified actin alone (Fig. 2). One possibility is that HS1 binds only to cortical F-actin that is nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex in cells as cortactin does (17Yamanashi Y. Okada M. Semba T. Yamori T. Umemori H. Tsunasawa S. Toyo-shima K. Kitamura D. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3631-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the interaction of the mutants with Arp2/3 complex by reblotting the same membrane with an antibody against p41, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex. It is apparent that HS1ΔR-GFP failed to co-precipitate with Arp2/3 complex, whereas HS1ΔCC-GFP maintained a strong Arp2/3 binding activity. Taken together, although both the CC motif and the repeat domain contribute to the association with cortical actin within cells, the repeat domain may play a more important role in Arp2/3 binding, whereas the CC motif is more responsible for direct F-actin binding.FIGURE 6Analysis of F-actin binding of HS1 mutants in cells. A, WEHI-231 cells expressing HS1-GFP, HS1ΔR-GFP, HS1ΔCC-GFP, and GFP were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody. The pellets were immunoblotted with anti-p41 or β-actin antibody. The same blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-HS1 polyclonal antibody. B, quantitative analysis of co-immunoprecipitation of HS1 with Arp2/3 complex or actin based on the data as shown in A. The bands were digitally scanned and analyzed with NIH Scion Image software. The intensity of each band was compared with that of HS1-GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our major finding in this report is that the HS1 repeat domain is not the only one contributing to F-actin binding, which is very different from cortactin. Although deletion of the repeat domain abolished activation of Arp2/3 complex, it has only a minor effect on direct F-actin binding. Instead, in vitro F-actin binding activity was nearly diminished by deletion of the CC domain. The finding of the CC motif as a main F-actin binding domain strongly implies a new function for the HS1 repeat domain. Because both the CC motif and the repeat domain are necessary for activation of the Arp2/3 complex and co-localization with F-actin in cells, these two structural domains likely act synergistically to regulate the Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly. One possible function of the repeat domain is that it aligns along the side of the nascent actin filament at a branching site (Fig. 7), other than simply binding to F-actin through the fourth repeat unit as previously suggested (10Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Although the repeat domain itself does not bind to the Arp2/3 complex, it follows immediately the Arp2/3 binding domain, which may facilitate a strong association of the Arp2/3 complex at the pointed end of the nascent actin filament, resulting in further increase in actin nucleation and branching stabilization. Indeed, deletion of the repeat domain has nearly abolished binding to the Arp2/3 complex in cells as well as F-actin, which was likely generated from the Arp2/3 complex (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the CC domain may bind directly to F-actin and enhance the association of HS1 with the complex of Arp2/3 and branched actin. Additional evidence supporting this model is that the sequence of the repeat domain is highly conservative (over 70% identity), which may be necessary to accommodate a conserved but repetitive structural profile on the side of actin filaments. In contrast, the sequence of the CC domain, which mainly consists of charged amino acid residues, shows little homology to that of cortactin. Although this may indicate that the F-actin binding mediated by the CC motif is less specific, its affinity for F-actin, when it is analyzed alone, is less than that of the wild type HS1 (1.63 versus 0.52 μm). Thus, interaction of HS1 with F-actin in cells may be determined by the synergistic interactions among the repeat, the CC, and the Arp2/3 complex binding domains; lacking any of each of these components would cause its dislocation in relation to cortical F-actin (18Li Y. Uruno T. Haudenschild C. Dudek S.M. Garcia J.G. Zhan X. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cortactin also contains a coiled-coil-like region. Although the functional role of the region is unknown, it is not indispensable for its binding to F-actin and activation of the Arp2/3 complex as analyzed with purified proteins (data not shown). This suggests that the repeat domain with more than four repeat units as in the case of cortactin is sufficient to achieve a significant F-actin binding, resulting in a less demanding for the function of the CC motif. Although it appears that the function of the CC domain is unique to HS1, the HS1-mediated actin cytoskeleton reorganization is likely to adapt to a special property of hematopoietic cells that is distinguished from adherent cells by assuming a rounding shape necessary for their circulation in the blood. The characterization of the difference in details between HS1 and cortactin may eventually explore the molecular mechanics that determines specific cellular morphogenesis.

At least one type IA DNA topoisomerase can be found in every bacterium, making it a logical target for antibacterial agents that can convert the enzyme into poison by trapping its covalent complex with DNA. However, it has not been possible previously to observe the consequence of having such a stabilized covalent complex of bacterial topoisomerase I <i>in vivo</i>. We isolated a mutant of recombinant <i>Yersinia pestis</i> topoisomerase I that forms a stabilized covalent complex with DNA by screening for the ability to induce the SOS response in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Overexpression of this mutant topoisomerase I resulted in bacterial cell death. From sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, it was determined that a single amino acid substitution in the TOPRIM domain changing a strictly conserved glycine residue to serine in either the <i>Y. pestis</i> or <i>E. coli</i> topoisomerase I can result in a mutant enzyme that has the SOS-inducing and cell-killing properties. Analysis of the purified mutant enzymes showed that they have no relaxation activity but retain the ability to cleave DNA and form a covalent complex. These results demonstrate that perturbation of the active site region of bacterial topoisomerase I can result in stabilization of the covalent intermediate, with the <i>in vivo</i> consequence of bacterial cell death. Small molecules that induce similar perturbation in the enzyme-DNA complex should be candidates as leads for novel antibacterial agents."

TRAF4 has been shown to promote JNK activation, however the signaling pathways leading to JNK activation have not been defined (9Xu Y.C. Wu R.F. Gu Y. Yang Y.S. Yang M.C. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. J.

We have discovered that TRAF4 is a binding partner for MEKK4. Their association occurs through the kinase domain of MEKK4 and the TRAF domain of TRAF4. TRAF4 increases MEKK4 kinase activity by promoting the oligomerization of MEKK4 and enhances MEKK4 signaling to JNK.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines, Culture Conditions, and Transfections—K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin. E10.5 embryos were isolated from timed matings of 129 SvEv mice according to university and federal guidelines for the use of animals. 293 cells and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Transfections of 293 cells were performed in 60-mm dishes using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications for 24–36 h. COS-7 cells were plated on coverslips and transfected as described for 293 cells.Plasmids—Human TRAF4 cDNA was kindly provided by Nancy Raab-Traub (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). HA tagged full-length TRAF4 and the TRAF domain of TRAF4 (amino acids 308–470) in pCDNA3 were a kind gift from Dale Bredesen (Buck Center for Research in Aging). The TRAF4 N terminus (amino acids 1–307) and the TRAF4 Ring deletion mutant (amino acids 58–470) in pCDNA3 were kindly given by Wafik El-Deiry (Howard Hughes Medical Institute and University of Pennsylvania). HA-tagged JNK, HA-tagged full-length MEKK4, and HA-tagged MEKK4 kinase domain (amino acids 1301–1597) were as described previously (10Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged wild-type MEKK4 was constructed by subcloning MEKK4 into FLAG-pCDNA3. The kinase-inactive MEKK4, MEKK4K1361R, was constructing using PCR to replace the active site lysine with an arginine, producing a kinase-inactive MEKK4 that was verified by sequencing. FK506-binding protein (FKBP) MEKK4 fusion constructs were created by introduction of SalI sites on the wild-type MEKK4 kinase domain by PCR, and products were subcloned into pSH1/SN-E-FV′ -FVls-E, a gift from David Spencer (Baylor) containing a point mutation Phe36 → Val (FV) engineered in the FKBPs resulting in 1000× higher binding affinity of the synthetic dimerizer AP20187 compared with the wild-type FKBP (11Fan L. Freeman K.W. Khan T. Pham E. Spencer D.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 2273-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Two FV sites were inserted on the N terminus of the kinase domain of MEKK4 and a C-terminal HA tag.Immunoprecipitations, Western Blot Analysis, Measurement of JNK Activity, and Kinase Assays—Cells were lysed in cold Buffer A containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton-X, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 17 μg/ml aprotinin. 500 μg of lysate was immunoprecipitated for 1.5 h with the indicated antibodies, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1.5 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with cold Buffer A. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-TRAF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MEKK4, anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-HA (12CA5) and phosphospecific antibodies against phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling). For kinase assays, lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated as described above. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cold lysis buffer and once with cold kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 m m β-glycerphosphate, and 0.5 mm ATP. Reactions were incubated with inactive His-MKK6 or GST-c-Jun at 30 °C for 20 min and probed with anti-FLAG, anti-TRAF4, anti-HA, anti-phospho-c-Jun, and anti-phospho-MKK3/6 (Cell Signaling) antibodies. Chemical dimerization experiments using AP20187 provided by Ariad Pharmaceuticals (www.ariad.com/regulationkits) were performed as described previously (11Fan L. Freeman K.W. Khan T. Pham E. Spencer D.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 2273-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence—For TRAF4 and MEKK4 staining, COS-7 cells plated on coverslips were fixed for 10 mins in 3% paraformaldehyde containing 3% sucrose and phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 and were permeabilized for 6 min in 0.1% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline. Coverslips were washed, blocked in 10% donkey serum, and incubated for 1 h with murine anti-FLAG and goat anti-TRAF antibodies diluted 1:500. Coverslips were washed and incubated with DAPI (0.04 ng/ml), Cy3 donkey anti-goat diluted 1:500, and fluorescein isothiocyanate donkey anti-mouse. Imaging was performed using an Axiovert 200 m microscope from Zeiss. Imaging software from Intelligent Imaging Innovations (Denver, Colorado) was used to perform nearest neighbors deconvolution on 0.1-μm sections.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTRAF4, an Atypical Embryonic TRAF, Binds MEKK4—Immunoprecipitation assays using K562 cells that endogenously express high levels of both TRAF4 and MEKK4 demonstrated that endogenous MEKK4 was specifically coprecipitated with TRAF4 (Fig. 1A). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of endogenous MEKK4 from K562 cells revealed an association of TRAF4 (data not shown). Both TRAF4 and MEKK4 are expressed at low levels in most adult mouse tissues, whereas expression is strong throughout embryogenesis with particularly high levels in the developing neuroepithelium (5Abell A.N. Rivera-Perez J.A. Cuevas B.D. Uhlik M.T. Sather S. Johnson N.L. Minton S.K. Lauder J.M. Winter-Vann A.M. Nakamura K. Magnuson T. Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell.

Significantly, TRAF4 and MEKK4 coprecipitated in lysates prepared from E10.5 embryos showing the association of MEKK4 and TRAF4 during development (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate an in vivo association of TRAF4 and MEKK4 and suggests a role for this interaction in MEKK4 and TRAF4 function.Analysis of TRAF4 and MEKK4 Interaction Domains—Analysis of the domains of MEKK4 that bind full-length TRAF4 revealed that the N terminus of MEKK4 did not bind TRAF4 (data not shown). The kinase domain alone of MEKK4 was sufficient for the association of MEKK4 with TRAF4 (Fig. 2A). However, binding of TRAF4 to MEKK4 was not dependent on MEKK4 kinase activity as TRAF4 coimmunoprecipitated equally with FLAG-tagged wild-type MEKK4 or a kinase-inactive MEKK4 where the active site lysine is substituted with an arginine (MEKK4K1361R) (Fig. 2B). The interaction domains of TRAF4 with full-length MEKK4 were similarly examined. In contrast to the N terminus of TRAF4 that failed to bind MEKK4, the TRAF domain of TRAF4 was necessary and sufficient for binding to MEKK4 (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the lack of binding of MEKK4 to the N terminus of TRAF4, MEKK4 retained the ability to bind a mutant TRAF4 wherein the RING domain in the N terminus was deleted (Fig. 2C). Together, these data show the specific interaction of the TRAF domain of TRAF4 with the kinase domain of MEKK4.FIGURE 2TRAF4 binds to the kinase domain of MEKK4; however, this association does not require MEKK4 kinase activity. A, the kinase domain of MEKK4 is sufficient for the association of MEKK4 with TRAF4. 293 cells were transiently cotransfected with TRAF4 and HA-tagged full-length MEKK4 or the kinase domain of MEKK4. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-TRAF4 antibody and then probed with antibodies to HA and TRAF4. B, coprecipitation of TRAF4 with MEKK4 does not require MEKK4 kinase activity. 293 cells were transiently cotransfected with TRAF4 and FLAG-MEKK4wt or kinase-inactive FLAG-MEKK4K1361R. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and then probed with antibodies to FLAG and TRAF4. C, coprecipitation of MEKK4 with the TRAF domain of TRAF4. 293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-MEKK4 and full-length TRAF4, TRAF4 N terminus, TRAF4 TRAF domain, or a RING deletion mutant of TRAF4. Lysates were immunoprecipitated as indicated with either an anti-N-terminal or anti-C-terminal TRAF4 antibody and probed with antibodies to FLAG and TRAF4. MEKK4 is highly sensitive to proteolysis. The lower bands represent cleavage fragments of MEKK4. Full-length TRAF4 and the RING deletion mutant are sensitive to proteolysis. Smaller bands represent cleavage fragments of TRAF4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Colocalization of MEKK4 and TRAF4 in the Cytoplasm of COS-7 Cells—Previous reports have yielded conflicting results regarding the localization of TRAF4 within the cell. Some studies have shown a nuclear localization of TRAF4, whereas others have shown that TRAF4 localizes specifically to the cytoplasm (12Regnier C.H. Tomasetto C. Moog-Lutz C. Chenard M.P.

MEKK4 has been shown to localize to the cytoplasm and to perinuclear, Golgi-associated vesicles (14Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To determine whether TRAF4 and MEKK4 localized to similar regions within the cell, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with TRAF4 and MEKK4, and the localization of these proteins was examined by the immunofluroescence of deconvolved 0.1 μm sections. As shown in Fig. 3, MEKK4 and TRAF4 colocalized in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells with pronounced staining in the perinuclear region of the cell. Immunostaining for TRAF4 and MEKK4 was not detected in the nuclei of cells as assessed by lack of colocalization with the nuclear stain DAPI (Fig. 3). The colocalization of TRAF4 and MEKK4 is consistent with their ability to coprecipitate from cell lysates.FIGURE 3Colocalization of TRAF4 and MEKK4 in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were transiently cotransfected with constructs encoding wild-type FLAG-tagged MEKK4 and full-length TRAF4. Cells were immunostained with anti-FLAG (green) and anti-TRAF4 (red) antibodies.

However, coexpression of TRAF4 and MEKK4 resulted in synergistic activation of JNK producing a 7-fold induction in phosphorylation of JNK (Fig. 4, A and B). JNK activation by coexpressed TRAF4 and MEKK4 was markedly inhibited by the co-expression of MEKK4K1361R (Fig. 4C). Additionally, the TRAF domain of TRAF4, the site that binds MEKK4, was able to inhibit activation of JNK by MEKK4 (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, TRAF4 does not promote MEKK4 activation of p38 (data not shown). Furthermore, the TRAF domain of TRAF4 inhibits JNK, but not p38, activation by MEKK4 indicating that TRAF4/MEKK4 complexes are specific for JNK signaling (data not shown).FIGURE 4Regulation of JNK by TRAF4 and MEKK4. A, coexpression of MEKK4 with TRAF4 results in the synergistic activation of JNK. 293 cells were cotransfected with constructs encoding HA-JNK, TRAF4, and FLAG-MEKK4wt or FLAG-MEKK4K1361R. HA-JNK was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and probed with an antibody to phospho-JNK. B, quantitation of JNK activation from A. P-JNK was normalized to total HA-JNK. Data represent the mean ± range from two independent experiments. C, synergistic activation of JNK by MEKK4 and TRAF4 is blocked by coexpression of MEKK4K1361R. 293 cells were cotransfected with constructs encoding HA-JNK, TRAF4, HA-MEKK4, and FLAG-MEKK4K1361R. HA-JNK was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and probed with an antibody to phospho-JNK. D, JNK activation by MEKK4 is inhibited by the TRAF domain of TRAF4.

Coexpression of TRAF4 with MEKK4 resulted in a 2.2-fold stimulation of MEKK4 phosphorylation of purified His-MKK6 as compared with expression of MEKK4 alone (Fig. 5A). One mechanism to explain the ability of TRAF4 to increase MEKK4 kinase activity and MEKK4-dependent JNK activation is through the oligomerization of MEKK4 by TRAF4. This mechanism would also explain the ability of the kinase-inactive MEKK4 to block activation of JNK by TRAF4 and MEKK4. To test this hypothesis, we examined the association of wild-type HA-tagged MEKK4 with FLAG-tagged MEKK4K1361R and found that wild-type MEKK4 coprecipitated weakly with the kinase-inactive MEKK4K1361R and that coprecipitation of wild-type and kinase-inactive MEKK4K1361R is significantly enhanced by the presence of TRAF4 (Fig. 5B). To further ascertain the ability of dimerization of MEKK4 to promote signaling to JNK, we utilized a cell permeable synthetic dimerizer AP20187. The kinase domain of MEKK4 was fused to two FKBP domains containing a point mutation Phe36 → Val (FV). AP20187 binds to F with 1000× greater affinity than for endogenous FKBP (11Fan L. Freeman K.W. Khan T. Pham E. Spencer D.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 2273-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells expressing VHA-JNK alone displayed a minimal response to AP20187 (Fig. 5C). The addition of the chemical dimerizer AP20187 to cells expressing both HA-FV -MEKK4 and HA-JNK resulted in significant induction of JNK activation as measured by in vitro phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun by HA-JNK (Fig. 5C). Together, these data demonstrate the ability of TRAF4 to induce the oligomerization of MEKK4 and promote MEKK4 activation and show that dimerization is sufficient to induce MEKK4-dependent JNK activation.FIGURE 5Activation of MEKK4 by dimerization. A, TRAF4 promotes MEKK4 kinase activity. FLAG-MEKK4 was cotransfected with either empty vector or TRAF4. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with purified kinase-inactive His-MKK6. Phosphorylation of His-MKK6 was detected with anti-phospho-MKK3/6 antibody. B, coprecipitation of HA-MEKK4wt with FLAG-MEKK4K1361R is enhanced by TRAF4. 293 cells were cotransfected with HA-MEKK4wt and FLAG-MEKK4K1361R in the absence or presence of TRAF4. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and probed with an anti-HA antibody. C, dimerization of MEKK4 by AP20187 increases MEKK4-dependent JNK activation. 293 cells were cotransfected with HA-JNK and HA-FV-MEKK4 or empty vector. Cells were treated with either vehicle alone (ethanol) or 20 nm AP20187 for the indicated times. Immunoprecipitated HA-JNK was incubated with GST-c-Jun, and phosphorylation of substrate was determined using a phospho-specific anti-c-Jun antibody. Total levels of HA-JNK and HA-FV-MEKK4 were determined by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cumulatively, our results show that the TRAF domain of TRAF4 associates with the kinase domain of MEKK4 and promotes MEKK4 activation and signaling to JNK. The kinase-inactive MEKK4K1361R behaves as a dominant negative inhibitory mutant in TRAF4 complexes, inhibiting the activation of wildtype MEKK4. Despite intensive investigation, upstream receptor pathways that regulate TRAF4 have not been identified. Several lines of evidence suggest that TRAF4 is an atypical member of the TRAF family. Unlike TRAF1 transgenics, and TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5 and TRAF6 knock-outs that each display immune deficiencies, TRAF4 knock-outs have normal immune systems (3Dempsey P.W. Doyle S.E. He J.Q. Cheng G.

Instead, TRAF4 knock-outs display severe open neural tube and skeletal defects similar to the MEKK4 knock-out and the MEKK4K1361R knock-in (4Regnier C.H. Masson R. Kedinger V. Textoris J. Stoll I.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In vitro binding experiments have shown that TRAF4 interacts weakly with the LTβR and p75 nerve growth factor receptor but not at all with TNFR1, TNFR2, Fas, or CD40 (16Fleckenstein D.S. Dirks W.G.

Furthermore, TRAF4 shows highest homology with the Drosophila TRAF (DTRAF1) with 45% amino acid identity, suggesting that TRAF4 may represent an archaic member of the TRAF family (1Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Both DTRAF1 and TRAF4 have seven zinc fingers (as compared with five in TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6) and have a truncated coiled-coil domain (1Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 19Liu H. Su Y.C. Becker E. Treisman J. Skolnik E.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 101-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). DTRAF1 has also been shown to activate JNK via a mechanism involving binding to the MAP4K Misshapen (19Liu H. Su Y.C. Becker E. Treisman J. Skolnik E.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 101-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The similarity of TRAF4 to DTRAF1 and the significant differences from other mammalian TRAF family members suggest that regulation of TRAF4, the non-classical mammalian TRAF, may be functionally different from other TRAF proteins (6Sax J.K. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36435-36444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although we do not know the upstream stimuli for initiating TRAF4 activation of MEKK4 during development, we show that MEKK4 and TRAF4 associate in the developing embryo. The existence of an endogenous complex, the coregulation of the JNK signaling pathway, and the overlapping phenotypes of the TRAF4 knock-out and the MEKK4 knock-out and MEKK4K1361R knock-in demonstrate the relevance of the TRAF4/MEKK4 interaction and suggest that TRAF4 and MEKK4 are in a common pathway (4Regnier C.H.

https://openalex.org/W1995411599,"Solid-state 13C NMR measurements of intact soybean leaves labeled by 13CO2 (at subambient concentrations) show that excess glycine from the photorespiratory C2 cycle (i.e. glycine not part of the production of glycerate in support of photosynthesis) is either fully decarboxylated or inserted as 13C-labeled glycyl residues in proteins. This 13C incorporation in leaf protein, which is uniformly 15N labeled by 15NH415NO3, occurs as soon as 2 min after the start of 13CO2 labeling. In those leaves with lower levels of available nitrogen (as measured by leaf nitrate and glutamine-glutamate concentrations), the excess glycine is used primarily as glycyl residues in protein. Solid-state 13C NMR measurements of intact soybean leaves labeled by 13CO2 (at subambient concentrations) show that excess glycine from the photorespiratory C2 cycle (i.e. glycine not part of the production of glycerate in support of photosynthesis) is either fully decarboxylated or inserted as 13C-labeled glycyl residues in proteins.

In those leaves with lower levels of available nitrogen (as measured by leaf nitrate and glutamine-glutamate concentrations), the excess glycine is used primarily as glycyl residues in protein. We recently measured photorespiration in soybean leaves by in vivo labeling with 13CO2 (99 atom % 13C, 200–400 ppm by volume in 21% O2 and 79% N2) for 2–8 min, followed by solid-state magic angle spinning 13C NMR detection of the label in the intact, lyophilized leaf (1Cegelski L. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).

Schaefer J. Adv. Magn. Reson. 1989; 13: 58-83Google Scholar) tracked the incorporation of 13C label into intermediates in the Calvin cycle as a function of time. The sensitivity of REDOR to the internuclear separation of a heteronuclear pair of spins (2Gullion T. Schaefer J. Adv. Magn. Reson. 1989; 13: 58-83Google Scholar) was used to determine the fraction of 13C label in the leaf that is within two covalent bonds of 31P, so that the REDOR difference spectrum detected only labeled phosphorylated carbons. This allowed quantification of the 13C isotopic enrichment of the Calvin cycle all of whose participants have a carbon that is two bonds from 31P. rotational-echo double resonance cross-polarization magic angle spinning glycine decarboxylase acronym for a frequency-selective NMR irradiation scheme using a string of short, weak pulses ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase parts per million rotational-echo double resonance cross-polarization magic angle spinning glycine decarboxylase acronym for a frequency-selective NMR irradiation scheme using a string of short, weak pulses ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase parts per million After 2 min of labeling by 300 ppm of 13CO2, the protein peaks had the same intensities as those of a leaf at natural abundance in the full-echo spectrum, and the sugar peaks were only slightly enhanced. The 8-rotor cycle 13C{31P} REDOR difference spectrum, on the other hand, had a significantly enhanced sugar peak intensity, more than five times that of an unlabeled leaf. These spectra indicated that by 2 min after the start of labeling, gas exchange had replaced unlabeled CO2 within the leaf, and the Calvin cycle intermediates were already at least partially labeled. By 4 min after the start of labeling, the accumulation of 13C in the full-echo sugar peak was obvious, but the 13C{31P} REDOR difference peak had not significantly increased. This result indicated that as soon as 2 min after the start of labeling, all 12CO2 within the leaf had been replaced by 13CO2, and 13C label had been distributed uniformly within ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). However, the 13C isotopic enrichment of RuBP was not 99%, but a lower value that depended on the flux of salvaged photorespiratory unlabeled carbon returned to the Calvin cycle (3Ogren W.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 415-442Crossref Google Scholar) as (phospho)glycerate (Fig. 1). Thus, the isotopic enrichment of the Calvin cycle for a fixed value of the 13CO2 concentration determines the ratio of photosynthetic (p) to photorespiratory (r) carbon fluxes, pc/rc. The subscripts denote that the ratio of rates is measured by the isotopic enrichment of the Calvin cycle and so all the CO2 that evolves results from glycerate production. The pc/rc ratio was 5.7:1 for both 200- and 300-ppm labeling 13CO2 concentrations (1Cegelski L. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The pc/rc ratio is the maximum possible value for the ratio of rates of photosynthesis and photorespiration. The ratio is lowered by evolution of additional CO2 from decarboxylation of glycine (produced in the light) that is not related to production of glycerate and maintenance of the Calvin cycle. The p/r ratio takes all evolved CO2 into account and was measured by net carbon assimilation rates, which were determined from 13C spin counts converted into total carbon (13C + 12C) by the isotopic enrichments of the Calvin cycle from the REDOR results. At ambient CO2 concentration, the p/r ratio was 5.7:1 (1Cegelski L. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) so that the rate of photorespiratory CO2 loss was 21% of net CO2 assimilation, about 80% of the value estimated from Rubisco kinetics parameters (4Sharkey T.D. Physiol. Plant. 1988; 73: 147-152Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar). At low external CO2 concentrations, the p/r ratio was less than 5.7:1, but the net carbon assimilation rates indicated that the rate of decarboxylation of glycine was not directly proportional to the oxygenase activity of Rubisco (1Cegelski L. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) as is commonly assumed (4Sharkey T.D. Physiol. Plant. 1988; 73: 147-152Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar). That is, the amount of glycerate from the C2 cycle (Fig. 1) entering the Calvin cycle was not a constant at low CO2 concentration, but rather decreased, which means that the photorespiratory release of CO2 resulting from glycerate production (via glycine and serine) also decreased. This, in turn, resulted in the accumulation in the leaf of excess glycine from the oxygenase activity of Rubisco (i.e. glycine not used for the production of glycerate). In this report, we describe the use of solid-state 13C and 15N NMR to correlate carbon and nitrogen metabolism and discover the metabolic fate of excess glycine in the leaf between 2 and 6 min after the start of labeling with 13CO2. At subambient CO2 concentrations, which typically occur as the result of water stress and the associated increased stomatal resistance, we find that a significant fraction of the excess glycine is incorporated into a leaf protein with a high glycine, high α-helix content. We believe that this protein is a structural cell wall component of protoxylem elements used for intercellular water transport (5Ringli C. Keller B. Ruser U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1430-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and we therefore propose that the photorespiratory C2 cycle is being used as a CO2 monitor within the leaf to signal a potential water stress. Growth of Soybean Plants—Glycine max (cv. Williams 82) was grown outdoors (June–August 2004) on the roof of the Washington University McMillen Laboratories building. The soybeans were grown in 30-cm diameter pots (6 plants per pot) filled with a mixture of one-third perlite and two-thirds top soil. Approximately 2 weeks after planting, when the first trifoliolates emerged, the pots were fertilized each day with 100 ml of a 1 g/liter 15NH415NO3 solution. The 15N label (99 atom % 15N, Isotec, Miamisburg, OH) was used to distinguish 13C label in amino acids from that in organic acids and proteins. This high level of fertilizer suppressed symbiotic nitrogen fixation, as evidenced later by the scarcity of root nodules. The 15N enrichment of the leaves was ∼50%, as determined by solid-state 15N NMR spin counts (6Schaefer J. Stejskal E.O. McKay R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 88: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), less than that of the ammonium nitrate because of unlabeled nitrogen sources in the top soil. The plants were watered by hand, typically every 2 h during the day. Labeling with 13CO2—Labeling with 13CO2 (99 atom % 13C) was performed soon after flowers appeared, ∼8 weeks after planting. The labeling was performed between 10 AM and 2 PM on August 5, 2004. Details of the labeling have been reported elsewhere (1Cegelski L. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Solid-State NMR—Spectra were obtained using a 6-frequency transmission line probe (7Schaefer, J. & McKay, R. A. (1999) U.S. Patent 5861748Google Scholar), having a 12-mm long, 6-mm inside diameter analytical coil and a Chemagnetics/Varian magic angle spinning ceramic stator. Lyophilized samples were contained in thin wall Chemagnetics/Varian 5-mm outside diameter zirconia rotors. The rotors were spun at 7143 Hz with the speed under active control to within ±2 Hz. The spectrometer was controlled by a Tecmag pulse programmer. Radiofrequency pulses for 31P (202 MHz), 13C (125 MHz), and 15N (50.3 MHz) were produced by 1-kilowatt American Microwave Technology power amplifiers. Proton (500 MHz) radiofrequency pulses were generated by a 1-kilowatt Amplifier Systems tube amplifiers driven by a 50-watt American Microwave Technology power amplifier. The π-pulse lengths were 6 μs for 31P, 8 μs for 13C, and 9 μs for 15N. A 12-T static magnetic field was provided by an 89-mm bore Magnex super-conducting solenoid. Proton-carbon cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) transfers were made with radiofrequency fields of 62.5 kHz. Proton dipolar decoupling was 100 kHz during data acquisition. CPMAS intensities were compared leaf-to-leaf on an absolute basis by normalization with respect to the natural abundance aliphatic carbon signal intensities between 0 and 30 ppm. The normalization reduced the effect of variations between leaves in protein content. REDOR was used to restore the dipolar couplings between heteronuclear pairs of spins that are removed by magic angle spinning (2Gullion T. Schaefer J. Adv. Magn. Reson. 1989; 13: 58-83Google Scholar). REDOR experiments are always done in two parts, once with rotor-synchronized dephasing pulses (S) and once without (full-echo, S0). The dephasing pulses change the sign of the heteronuclear dipolar coupling, and this interferes with the spatial averaging resulting from the motion of the rotor. The difference in signal intensity (REDOR difference, ΔS = S0 - S) for the observed spin in the two parts of the REDOR experiment is directly related to the corresponding distance to the dephasing spin (2Gullion T. Schaefer J. Adv. Magn. Reson. 1989; 13: 58-83Google Scholar). All 15N{31P} and 13C{15N} REDOR spectra were collected with standard xy-8 phase cycling (9Gullion T. Baker D.B. Conradi M.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 89: 479-484Google Scholar), on both observed and dephasing channels. Frequency selective 13C π pulses were generated using the so-called DANTE sequence (10Morris G.A. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1978; 29: 433-462Google Scholar). The 13C radiofrequency was shifted on resonance for the peak to be inverted and 64 rotor-asynchronous 0.5-μs pulses produced an 80% inversion. Following a z-axis π/2 restoration pulse, a delay of 10 ms was sufficient to equilibrate the populations of directly bonded 13C-13C pairs (11Bork V. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 78: 348-354Google Scholar), one member of which had been inverted by the DANTE π pulse. This procedure was used to establish connectivities between 13C labels in early metabolites of photosynthesis and photorespiration. Glycyl Residues in Protein—The total 13C assimilation in a leaf labeled by 300 ppm of 13CO2 for 6 min is determined by subtracting the cross-polarization magic angle spinning 13C NMR spectrum of an unlabeled leaf from that of the labeled leaf (Fig. 2). The dominant peaks in the difference spectrum arise from the -CH2O-products of the Calvin cycle (65–105 ppm). The major sugar peak occurs at 72.6 ppm (relative to external tetramethylsilane). Non-sugar peaks appear in the carbonyl and methylene carbon regions (in blue) and arise from products of the oxygenase activity of Rubisco. Two carbonyl carbon peaks are observed in the difference spectrum of Fig. 2. The low field peak centered at 179 ppm (with about a 3-ppm width) is assigned to glycerate, serine, some glycine, and possibly lesser amounts of glycolate (1Cegelski L. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). None of these carbonyl carbons has a directly bonded nitrogen. The high field carbonyl carbon shift of 171 ppm is characteristic of a glycine carbonyl carbon in a peptide bond in an α-helical local conformation (12Saitô H. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1986; 24: 835-852Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). It is not consistent with a carbonyl carbon in a free amino acid or organic acid. The diminution of intensity of the 171-ppm peak following a 1-ms 13C{15N} REDOR evolution period (inset in red) proves that the carbonyl carbon is directly bonded to nitrogen, and so this peak is assigned to glycyl residues in proteins. The ∼35% reduction in intensity is consistent with the 50% 15N isotopic enrichment of all nitrogen in the leaf, and a product of evolution time and dipolar coupling of just over 1 (2Gullion T. Schaefer J. Adv. Magn. Reson. 1989; 13: 58-83Google Scholar). The methylene carbon peak at 43 ppm also shows 13C{15N} dephasing (Fig. 2, red) and has the α-carbon shift of a glycyl residue (12Saitô H. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1986; 24: 835-852Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In addition, the 43-ppm methylene carbon peak has a direct link to the 171-ppm carbonyl carbon peak, as established by the results of a selective inversion experiment (Fig. 3). In this experiment, the total 13C signal at 171 ppm (label and natural abundance) is inverted and then stored along the magnetic field by a π/2 restoration pulse. The inverted population then partially equilibrates with the normal Boltzmann population of 13Cs. The equilibration occurs via dipolar coupling and is complete in 10 ms for a 2-kHz 13C-13C coupling (11Bork V. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 78: 348-354Google Scholar). Thus, a positive-going peak in the difference spectrum (Fig. 3, top), which does not appear in the corresponding natural abundance difference spectrum (Fig. 3, inset), indicates the presence of a 13C-13C double-labeled covalent bond, characteristic of the uniformly labeled products of the Calvin cycle. The observed 13C-15N and 13C-13C dipolar couplings of Figs. 2 and 3, together with characteristic 13C chemical shifts at 171 and 43 ppm, are only consistent with high concentrations of glycyl residues in leaf protein. Other plausible metabolites have NMR parameters that are not observed. Organic acids from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, for example, can match the 43-ppm shift of the methylene carbon, but not the 171-ppm shift of the carbonyl carbon or the observed 13C-15N dipolar coupling. A 13C-13C link of the 43-ppm methylene carbon peak to the 179-ppm carbonyl carbon peak of Fig. 2 is much weaker (Fig. 4, middle and top) than to the 171-ppm peak (Fig. 3, middle and top), indicating that more of the 179-ppm peak arises from glycerate (which has no methylene carbon) than from glycine, 6 min after the start of the labeling. Early Carbon Assimilation—The total carbon assimilation for soybean leaves labeled for just 2 min shows pronounced differences in the routing of label as a function of 13CO2 concentration (see Fig. 6 of Ref. 1Cegelski L. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). At near ambient CO2 concentration (400 ppm), the dominant carbonyl carbon peak has a 179-ppm shift and is matched in intensity by a 43-ppm peak, both consistent with the presence of free glycine. Previous 13C{31P} REDOR measurements have shown that a significant amount of labeled glycerate has not accumulated by 2 min after the start of labeling (1Cegelski L. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). At subambient 13CO2 concentrations, the glycine peak decreases in intensity and the 171-ppm glycyl peptide peak increases. As the carboxylase activity of the Calvin cycle decreases, the demand for glycerate decreases and the apparent immediate metabolic response is a rerouting of free glycine away from glycerate production and into protein synthesis. This rerouting is also seen for the leaf labeled by 200 ppm of 13CO2 for 4 min. The difference spectrum for that leaf, obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the leaf labeled for 2 min, has a pronounced 171-ppm peptide carbonyl carbon peak (Fig. 5, top). The leaf labeled by 300 ppm of 13CO2 for 4 min, on the other hand, is significantly different: no carbonyl carbon peak at all appears in the difference spectrum (Fig. 5, bottom). We will discuss this comparison in more detail after we present the nitrogen assimilation results in the next two subsections. Nitrogen Assimilation—The 15N NMR spectra of two 13CO2-labeled soybean leaves are shown in Fig. 6. These are REDOR full-echo spectra after a 29-ms evolution period so the intensities of protonated nitrogens are reduced somewhat relative to those of non-protonated nitrogens (13McDowell L.M. Schmidt A. Cohen E.R. Studelska D.R. Schaefer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, familiar assignments of peaks (13McDowell L.M. Schmidt A. Cohen E.R. Studelska D.R. Schaefer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14McDowell L.M. Poliks B. Studelska D.R. O'Connor R.D. Beusen D.D. Schaefer J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 11-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to protein main chain and lysine, arginine, and histidine side chain nitrogens, and to ribosomal RNA purines, are easily made (arrows, Fig. 6, middle). There are virtually no variations in the relative intensities of peaks arising from these structural nitrogens from one leaf to another. There are, however, significant variations in the intensities of the peaks associated with the dynamic metabolic nitrogen pools of nitrate and glutamine-glutamate. The nitrate peak appears at 350 ppm (15Skokut T.A. Manchester J. Schaefer J. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 579-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the glutamine-glutamate amine peak at 30 ppm (15Skokut T.A. Manchester J. Schaefer J. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 579-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Skokut T.A. Varner J.E. Schaefer J. Stejskal E.O. McKay R.A.

The amine nitrogen has the same shift in both glutamine and glutamate. The glutamine amide-nitrogen shift is obscured by the massive 95-ppm peptide nitrogen peak. The top and middle spectra of Fig. 6 illustrate the extremes observed in the leaf-to-leaf metabolic nitrogen pools for plants grown in 2004. Qualitative levels of metabolic nitrogen pools are summarized in TABLE ONE, along with the total 15N content, for leaves exposed to a variety of 13CO2 labeling concentrations on plants grown in three different summers.TABLE ONE15N incorporation in leaves labeled by 13CO2 for short timesLabeling conditions, 13CO295-ppm peptide 15N{31P}ΔS/S0a29-ms dipolar evolution from 208 rotor cycles with magic angle spinning at 7143 HzNitrate relative to peptide amidebNitrate signal intensity relative to peptide second (n = +2) spinning-sideband intensityGlutamine-glutamate amine relative to peptide amidecGlutamine-glutamate amine intensity relative to peptide first (n = –1) spinning-sideband intensityRelative total 15N incorporationppm/min400/2dFrom 2004 13CO2 labeling experiments (Ref. 1)0.0141.00.760.69300/2dFrom 2004 13CO2 labeling experiments (Ref. 1)0.0170.50.440.70200/4dFrom 2004 13CO2 labeling experiments (Ref. 1)0.0191.40.621.00200/2eFrom 2001 13CO2 labeling experiments on plants 15N-labeled similarly to those in 20040.0211.60.751.08200/2dFrom 2004 13CO2 labeling experiments (Ref. 1)0.0221.50.621.001000/4fFrom 2003 exposure to 12CO2 for plants 15N-labeled similarly to those in 20040.0231.00.561.39300/4dFrom 2004 13CO2 labeling experiments (Ref. 1)0.0241.00.940.60400/2eFrom 2001 13CO2 labeling experiments on plants 15N-labeled similarly to those in 20040.0252.20.901.20Natural abundanceeFrom 2001 13CO2 labeling experiments on plants 15N-labeled similarly to those in 20040.0263.01.001.211000/2fFrom 2003 exposure to 12CO2 for plants 15N-labeled similarly to those in 20040.0280.60.541.49a 29-ms dipolar evolution from 208 rotor cycles with magic angle spinning at 7143 Hzb Nitrate signal intensity relative to peptide second (n = +2) spinning-sideband intensityc Glutamine-glutamate amine intensity relative to peptide first (n = –1) spinning-sideband intensityd From 2004 13CO2 labeling experiments (Ref. 1Cegelski L.

Schmidt A. Cohen E.R. Studelska D.R. Schaefer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For phosphorylated lysines and arginines, both side chain and main chain nitrogens contribute to the REDOR difference. A single 31P within the binding site of a uniformly 15N-labeled 50-kDa protein will result in contributions to a REDOR difference signal from 5–10 main chain nitrogens so that the 95-ppm ΔS/S0 ≈ .01 (14McDowell L.M. Poliks B. Studelska D.R. O'Connor R.D. Beusen D.D. Schaefer J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 11-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rubisco and glycine decarboxylase (GDC) are by far the most abundant proteins in the leaf (18Douce R. Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Rébeillé F. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 4: 167-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and so the 15N{31P} REDOR dephasing for the most part reports on the extent of contact of these proteins with phosphorous. Leaf-to-leaf variation in dephasing is more pronounced for the (primarily) main chain peptide nitrogen peak at 95 ppm than for any of the side chain nitrogens (Fig. 7). Values of the 95-ppm 15N{31P} dephasing after 29 ms of dipolar evolution for leaves labeled under a variety of CO2 concentrations are presented in TABLE ONE. Variations in Glycyl Incorporation in Leaf Protein—Two of the leaves of TABLE ONE have a 95-ppm 15N{31P} ΔS/S0 that is relatively small, with a value between 0.014 and 0.017. For the leaf labeled by 400 ppm of 13CO2 for 2 min (ΔS/S0 = .014), almost all the 13C label passing through the oxygenase path of Rubisco had been routed to glycine (see Fig. 6 in Ref. 1Cegelski L. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). There was no significant incorporation of glycyl residues into protein. The leaf was photosynthetically active, considering the extent of label incorporated into sugar in just 2 min. Based on these results, we take an observed 95-ppm 15N{31P} ΔS/S0 of about 0.015 as representative of the protein main chain-phosphorous contact for a lyophilized leaf that had fully activated Rubisco and sufficiently activated GDC to convert all of the oxygenase product of Rubisco into glycerate via glycine and the C2 pathway. The other low value of 15N{31P} dephasing (ΔS/S0 = 0.017) is observed for the leaf labeled by 300 ppm of 13CO2 for 2 min. This leaf appeared to be normal, with size and color comparable to those of the other leaves labeled in 2004. Nevertheless, the leaf had unusually small nitrate and glutamine-glutamate metabolic nitrogen pools, as well as a low total incorporation of 15N (TABLE ONE). Perhaps this leaf had been damaged or inadvertently covered or shaded and was somehow developmentally atypical. In any event, the leaf was apparently unable to use the single carbons that result from the total decarboxylation of glycine, for example to synthesize other amino acids (19Noctor G. Foyer C.H. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 1895-1908Google Scholar), and instead incorporated all excess glycine directly into protein (see Fig. 6 of Ref. 1Cegelski L. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The more typical value of the 95-ppm peptide nitrogen ΔS/S0 for leaves labeled under non-ambient CO2 concentrations is between 0.019 and 0.028 (TABLE ONE). For example, the REDOR dephasing for the leaf labeled with 300 ppm of 13CO2 for 4 min (Fig. 7, right) is 0.024, a value which is in the middle of the 0.019–0.028 range. This leaf has no observable carbonyl carbon label (Fig. 5, bottom), which means that all the product of the oxygenase activity of Rubisco had been decarboxylated. That is, for every two oxygenations of Rubisco in the light, two CO2 molecules are released, contrary to the conventional assumption in this situation of the release of one CO2 (4Sharkey T.D. Physiol. Plant. 1988; 73: 147-152Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Activation of additional GDC for total glycine decarboxylation requires additional ATP (18Douce R. Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Rébeillé F. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 4: 167-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (316) Google Scholar), which moves sequestered inorganic phosphate into dispersed biophosphate. We attribute the increase in 15N{31P} peptide dephasing from 0.015 to about 0.025 to adventitious proximity of ATP and GDC in the lyophilized leaf. There is no corresponding increase for the lysine, arginine, and histidine side chain 15N{31P} dephasing, because there is no increase in the level of phosphorylation of these side chains, and therefore no increase in specific 15N-31P proximities. Most of the leaves in TABLE ONE appear to have been in a metabolic state characterized by high values of 15N{31P} ΔS/S0, including the natural abundance leaf harvested under steady-state conditions in the light. We conclude therefore that in their normal state, soybean leaves are fully capable of diverting excess glycine from the C2 pathway into either direct protein synthesis or full decarboxylation. Leaf Metabolism in Low CO2—Under normal conditions, the CO2 concentration within a soybean leaf drops to that of the leaves in TABLE ONE labeled with subambient CO2 concentrations only as the result of a water stress and the associated increased stomatal resistance and decreased gas diffusivity (20Bunce J.A. Plant Cell Environ. 1998; 21: 115-120Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This combination depletes the CO2 within the leaf but has little effect on the much more abundant O2 so that the carboxylase activity of Rubisco is reduced but not the oxygenase activity. The metabolism within the leaf immediately responds to the resulting higher level of glycine (relative to glycerate) by incorporating glycyl residues into protein (Fig. 2), by fully decarboxylating glycine (Fig. 5, bottom), or by some combination of the two (Fig. 5, top). The specific short term response appears to depend on the status of the nitrogen metabolic pools within the leaf (TABLE ONE) and the extent of GDC activation, presumably in such a way that the net productivity or efficiency of the leaf (or plant) is optimized. A component of this strategy might include synthesizing protein as part of a protective, fast response by the leaf to an anticipated water stress, well before any internal structural damage has occurred. The basis for this suggestion is that the glycyl residues of Fig. 2 have a carbonyl carbon isotropic chemical shift of 171 ppm. The average shift for glycyl residues in proteins is 174 ppm (21Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) so that the incorporation of glycine into a variety of local conformations is unlikely. The 171-ppm glycine shift indicates unambiguously an α-helical conformation both in solution and in the solid state (12Saitô H. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1986; 24: 835-852Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 22Laws D.D. Bitter L.H.-M. Liu K. Ball H.L. Kaneko K. Wille H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Pines A. Wemmer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11686-11690Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A β-sheet conformation might have been expected for a high glycine content protein (23Cassab G.I. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 281-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), but the 168-ppm shift for β-sheets is not observed. High concentrations of glycyl residues in α-helical conformations are consistent with the formation of glycine-rich protein (GRP), a cell wall structural protein often found localized in xylem elements used for intercellular water transport (5Ringli C. Keller B. Ruser U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1430-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). GRPs can have glycine contents representing up to 60–70% of all amino acid residues (23Cassab G.I. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 281-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and in some instances have been identified with secondary structures matching that of α-helical collagen (5Ringli C. Keller B. Ruser U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1430-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Additional experiments are needed to confirm these preliminary assignments and conclusions. Plant Growth in High CO2—Atmospheric CO2 levels are anticipated to be 550 ppm (by volume) in about 40 years (24Prentice I.C. Houghton J.T. Ding Y. Griggs D.J. Noguer M. van der Linden P.J. Dai X. Maskell K. Johnson C.A. Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 183-238Google Scholar), which should lead to increased photosynthetic activity. Increased levels of nitrogen within the plant, achieved either by fertilization or by increased rooting volumes for N2-fixing plant systems, should then lead to enhanced plant productivity by matching increased carbon assimilation with increased nitrogen assimilation (25Drake B.G. Gonzalez-Meier M.A. Long S.P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biology. 1997; 48: 609-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar, 26Farage P.K. McKee I.F. Long S.P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, in experiments with high CO2 concentrations, the expected theoretical gain in productivity has not been realized, at least not for soybeans grown in the open field (no artificial canopies, no root constraints, no nitrogen limitations) under 550 ppm of free-air CO2-enhanced conditions (27Rogers A. Allen D.J. Davey P.A. Morgan P.B. Ainsworth E.A. Bernacchi C.J. Cornic G. Dermody O. Dohleman F.G. Heaton E.A. Mahoney J. Zhu X.-G. Delucia E.H. Ort D.R. Long S.P. Plant Cell Environ. 2004; 27: 449-458Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The deficit in productivity appears to be correlated with insufficient levels of the RuBP substrate for Rubisco (27Rogers A. Allen D.J. Davey P.A. Morgan P.B. Ainsworth E.A. Bernacchi C.J. Cornic G. Dermody O. Dohleman F.G. Heaton E.A. Mahoney J. Zhu X.-G. Delucia E.H. Ort D.R. Long S.P. Plant Cell Environ. 2004; 27: 449-458Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the deficit is that the observed long term dependence of nitrate assimilation on photorespiration, possibly via the production of NADH in the peroxisome, is a limiting factor (28Rachmilevitch S. Cousins A.B. Bloom A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11506-11510Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A reduction in photorespiration means a reduction in nitrate assimilation, which could lead to reduced carbon utilization including protein synthesis. With this explanation, however, the connection to limiting RuBP is not immediately obvious. We offer another possibility based on our observation (from 13C isotopic enrichment measurements) at ambient and subambient CO2 concentrations that the rate of turnover of the Calvin cycle is directly proportional to the demand for glycerate returned from the C2 cycle: slower turnover, less glycerate; faster turnover, more glycerate (1Cegelski L. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). If all of the glycine produced by Rubisco oxygenation indeed fueled glycerate production and Calvin cycle turnover, then other pathways for C2 glycine use, including full decarboxylation (see Fig. 5), would be limited. Reduced respiratory decarboxylation could ultimately result in reduced nitrate assimilation (19Noctor G. Foyer C.H. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 1895-1908Google Scholar). There is no sign of such a single purpose use of glycine in the high CO215N{31P} REDOR dephasing results of TABLE ONE. The observed ΔS/S0 values of 0.023 and 0.028 suggest fully active GDC. At 550 ppm of CO2 therefore, the combination of increased Rubisco carboxylase activity and decreased oxygenase activity (25Drake B.G. Gonzalez-Meier M.A. Long S.P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biology. 1997; 48: 609-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar) means that there is not enough glycerate returning from the C2 pathway to maintain fully the increased turnover rate of the Calvin cycle. The limiting factor is therefore the available triose in the Calvin cycle, which is manifest as a shortage of the sugar substrate for Rubisco, RuBP. Solid-State NMR and Correlation of Carbon and Nitrogen Metabolism in Intact Leaves—Solid-state NMR of an intact, chemically stable, lyophilized leaf allows the detection of all 13C and 15N incorporated in the leaf, regardless of whether the label is in a component that is soluble or insoluble, extractable, or intractable. Besides this accurate spin counting for compositional analysis (17Mesnard F. Ratcliffe R.G. Photosyn. Res. 2005; 83: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), solid-state measurements of inter-residue 13C-15N dipolar couplings in leaf proteins are important for assignments like the identification of glycyl residues (Fig. 2). These couplings would be lost if the leaf were subjected to conventional extraction and digestion. In addition, observations of in situ protein chemical shifts can reveal local conformations (12Saitô H. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1986; 24: 835-852Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and this structural information is also lost if the protein is extracted, even if it is not digested. Finally, although some of the correlations of carbon and nitrogen metabolism obtained from solid-state NMR and discussed above are speculative at this point, the physical proximities and intermolecular dipolar couplings of 13C, 15N, and 31P in metabolites in the leaf are parameters that should help provide the tests of more insightful future correlations. To implement these tests, the leaf must stay intact. Once the tests have been completed, degradative analysis is always an option. We thank Astrid Sivertsen and Robert O'Connor for preliminary 30 MHz 15N NMR measurements on leaves in 2002 and 2003."
https://openalex.org/W1983011124,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the central regulator of reproduction in vertebrates. GnRHs have recently been identified in protochordates and retain the conserved N- and C-terminal domains involved in receptor binding and activation. GnRHs of the jawed vertebrates have a central achiral amino acid (glycine) that favors a type II′ β-turn such that the N- and C-terminal domains are closely apposed in binding the GnRH receptor. However, protochordate GnRHs have a chiral amino acid in this position, suggesting that they bind their receptors in a more extended form. We demonstrate here that a protochordate GnRH receptor does not distinguish GnRHs with achiral or chiral amino acids, whereas GnRH receptors of jawed vertebrates are highly selective for GnRHs with the central achiral glycine. The poor activity of the protochordate GnRH was increased >10-fold at vertebrate receptors by replacement of the chiral amino acid with glycine or a d-amino acid, which favor the type II′ β-turn. Structural analysis of the GnRHs using ion mobility-mass spectrometry and molecular modeling showed a greater propensity for a type II′ β-turn in GnRHs with glycine or a d-amino acid, which correlates with binding affinity at vertebrate receptors. These findings indicate that the substitution of glycine for a chiral amino acid in GnRH during evolution allows a more constrained conformation for receptor binding and that this subtle single amino acid substitution in a site remote from the ligand functional domains has marked effects on its structure and activity.

In vertebrates, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 2The abbreviations used are: GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; pGlu, pyroglutamic acid; IM-MS, ion mobility-mass spectrometry.2The abbreviations used are: GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; pGlu, pyroglutamic acid; IM-MS, ion mobility-mass spectrometry. is synthesized in hypothalamic neurones and conducted a few millimeters in the hypophysial portal system to the anterior pituitary, where it binds to high affinity receptors in gonadotrophs to stimulate the release of gonadotropins (1.Sealfon S.C. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 180-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The gonadotropins in turn stimulate hormone and gamete production by the testes and ovaries. GnRHs have also been isolated from protochordate species (2.Powell J.F. Reska-Skinner S.M. Prakash M.O. Fischer W.H. Park M. Rivier J.E. Craig A.G. Mackie G.O. Sherwood N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

GnRHs and GnRH receptors have also been found to directly affect vertebrate gonadal function (5.Hsueh A.J. Schaeffer J.M. J. Steroid Biochem. 1985; 23: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), possibly reflecting the earliest role of GnRH as exemplified in protochordates (6.King J.A. Millar R.P. Parhar I.S.

It appears, therefore, that GnRHs have an ancient evolutionary role as regulators of reproduction, first through direct neural delivery to the gonads and later as hypothalamic neuroendocrine regulators of the gonads indirectly through gonadal stimulation by gonadotropins.To date 13 structural variants of the GnRH decapeptide have been identified in vertebrates (8.Millar R.P.

All of the GnRHs are characterized by the conservation of the N-terminal residues (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser) and the C-terminal residues (Pro-Gly-NH2) with the exception of two conservative substitutions (Fig. 1). In cartilaginous and bony fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, all of the GnRHs are further characterized by the presence of a glycine residue in position six (Fig. 1). Being archiral, the glycine residue allows the peptide to assume a type II′ β-turn conformation, which is essential for high binding affinity and biological activity in mammals (1.Sealfon S.C.

This feature is likely to limit the formation of a type II′ β-turn conformation, and these GnRHs would be expected to have correspondingly low binding affinities and biological activities at GnRH receptors of higher vertebrates (1.Sealfon S.C. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 180-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 6.King J.A. Millar R.P. Parhar I.S. Sakuma Y. GnRH Neurones: Gene to Behavior.

Coincident with the evolution of the jawed fish, structural changes in GnRH and its receptor required the peptide to interact in the folded type II′ β-turn conformation. To investigate this notion, we have synthesized and studied the structure and biological activity of three GnRHs from a tunicate protochordate (Ciona intestinalis) at catfish, chicken, human, and protochordate GnRH receptors. We demonstrate that these protochordate GnRHs have low biological activity at jawed vertebrate GnRH receptors but that high biological activity is generated when the natural chiral amino acid in position six is replaced by the achiral glycine, which is characteristic of jawed vertebrate GnRHs. We also studied the structure of these peptides employing a combination of ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and molecular modeling and demonstrated a correlation of the biological activity at vertebrate receptors with the ability of the peptides to assume the folded more compact conformation. These findings reveal a co-evolution of GnRH and its cognate receptor in which the receptors of early evolved organisms bind an extended structure of GnRH, whereas the receptors of higher organisms require a folded type II′ β-turn conformation of GnRH in which the N and C termini are in close apposition when bound to the receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptides—Ciona I, II, and III GnRH, Gly6-Ciona I GnRH, and d-Ala6-Ciona I GnRH were synthesized by conventional solid phase methodology and purified by high performance liquid chromatography to >98% purity. Mammalian GnRH was from Peninsula Laboratories (Bachem Ltd., Merseyside, UK).Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Plasmid DNA for transient transfection was prepared using Maxi-Prep columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured as previously described for COS-1 cells (12.Pfleger K.D. Bogerd J. Millar R.P. Mol.

These are Ciona A and Ciona B GnRH receptors previously referred to as Ci-GnRHR1 and Ci-GnRHR2.Receptor Binding Assays—Whole cell receptor binding assays used the 125I-[His5,d-Tyr6]GnRH analog for the vertebrate receptors and 125I-GnRH II for the Ciona receptor (13.Pawson A.J. Maudsley S.R. Lopes J. Katz A.A. Sun Y.M. Davidson J.S. Millar R.P. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3860-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected COS-7 cells in 12-well culture plates were washed once with ice-cold HEPES, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 5 h on ice in the same medium with 106 cpm/well radiolabeled GnRH analog and varying concentrations of unlabeled GnRH peptides (13.Pawson A.J. Maudsley S.R. Lopes J. Katz A.A. Sun Y.M. Davidson J.S. Millar R.P. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3860-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were then rapidly washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 0.1 m NaOH, and the lysate radioactivity was counted. Nonspecific binding (consistently less than 10% of total binding) was determined using vector-transfected (pcDNA1/amp) COS-7 cells and subtracted from total binding to give specific binding. Assays were conducted in triplicate and repeated in three separate experiments.Total Inositol Phosphate Assays—GnRH stimulation of total inositol phosphate production was assayed as previously described (18.Flanagan C.A.

Briefly, transiently transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% dialyzed heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 0.5 μCi/well myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) for 48 h. Medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 1 ml of buffer (140 mm NaC1, 20 mm HEPES, 4 mm KC1, 8 mm glucose 1 mm MgC12, 1 mm CaC12, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 10 mm LiC1 and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 10 mm LiCl and GnRH agonist at the indicated concentrations. Reactions were terminated by the removal of agonist and the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 10 mm formic acid, which was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Total [3H]inositol phosphates were separated from the formic acid cell extracts on AG-X8 anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad) and eluted with a 1 m ammonium format, 0.1 m formic acid solution. The associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Assays were conducted in triplicate and repeated in three separate experiments.Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry—The gas-phase collision cross-sections of mammalian GnRH, Ciona 1 GnRH, and its two substituted derivates were determined using an ion mobility mass spectrometer, as previously described (20.Wyttenbach T. Kemper P.R. Bowers M.T. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Process. 2001; 212: 13-23Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, ions created by electrospray ionization are injected into a temperature-regulated drift cell pressurized with helium to 5 torr. The ions drift under the influence of a weak electrostatic field and are retarded by collisions with the buffer gas. On exiting the cell, ions are selected by a quadrupole mass filter, and their arrival time distributions are recorded. Arrival times are collected at several drift voltages, and the mobility (K) of the ion is obtained from the gradient of a plot of arrival time versus the pressure of helium divided by the drift voltage. This mobility is used to determine the experimental collision cross-section of the ion (σ) according to the equation K = [(3e)/(16N)][(2π)/(μκBT)]1/2[1/σ] as described (21.Mason E.A. MacDaniel E.W. Transport Properties of Ions in Gases. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Crossref Google Scholar).Molecular Structures of GnRH Peptides—Analysis of the structures of mammalian GnRH, Ciona I GnRH, and two substituted Ciona I variants was conducted using molecular mechanics. All calculations were performed using the ff99 AMBER force field (22.Ponder J.W. Case D.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 66: 27-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar), employing the Amber7 suite of programs to refine the energy of the peptide models. Residues for the N-terminal pyrolyzed glutamic acid and the amidated glycine present at the C terminus generated using the RESP procedure (23.Wang J. Cieplak P. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 2000; 21: 1049-1074Crossref Scopus (3447) Google Scholar) and the ANTECHAMBER facility within the Amber 7 suite of programs (amber.scripps.edu). IM-MS data were obtained for these peptides both as singly ([M+H]+) and doubly ([M+2H]2+) protonated ions. From gas-phase basicities (24.Harrison A.G. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1997; 16: 201-217Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar) it is most probable that Arg8 in mammalian GnRH will be protonated in [M+H]+and that the [M+2H]2+ ion will contain protonated His2. In the protochordate Ciona I peptides, Arg8 is substituted by Ser8, and it is extremely likely that their [M+H]+ ions contain protonated histidine. The protonation state of His2 is variable in physiological conditions, and therefore calculations were performed with both protonated and unprotonated histidine for the Ciona I peptides and for the singly and doubly protonated form of mammalian GnRH. At most physiological pH values, Arg8 of mammalian GnRH will be protonated; hence, calculations on the neutral species have not been performed for this peptide. The Ciona I [M+2H]2+ ions probably arise due to protonation of the amide Gly10; however, since we cannot determine the biological significance of this chemical form and due to some ambiguity in assigning this site of charge, the doubly protonated peptides were not investigated further in this study. For each of these 8 chemically distinct peptides, 300 candidate gas-phase minimized structures were generated using a simulated annealing approach. An initial structure was subjected to dynamics at 800 K for 30 ns and then cooled in a stepwise fashion to 0 K before an energy minimization. This minimized structure was then used as the seed for the next cycle. The two lowest energy structures for each species were then subjected to 1 ns of molecular mechanics at 300 K for the [M+H]+ ions. This was performed in vacuo and employing the Born Solvent distance-dependent dielectric model to simulate their dynamic structure in an aqueous environment (25.Bashford D. Case D.A. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2000; 51: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). For the neutral Ciona I peptides, these extended dynamics calculations were only performed with the use of the solvent model. This procedure generates 1000 co-ordinate files for each 1 ns, i.e. co-ordinates are saved every ps, with the potential energy surface sampled every fs. No weighting was given to any of the amino acids, and translational energies are removed every ps. Each molecular mechanics data set was analyzed, and conformational variables such as the N-C termini distance and overall peptide flexibility were compared with those found for mammalian GnRH examined under identical conditions. Collision cross-sections for each low energy structure obtained via the simulated annealing procedure were calculated using the projection approximation (26.Wyttenbach T. Bowers M.T. Top. Curr. Chem. 2003; 255: 207-232Crossref Google Scholar). This was also employed to elucidate conformational changes occurring to these peptides during molecular dynamics.RESULTSReceptor Binding—All three Ciona GnRHs had low affinity for the human receptor (IC50 > 1 μm) in comparison to mammalian GnRH (7.5 nm) (Fig. 2A, TABLE ONE). Similar results were found in binding of these peptides to the chicken and catfish (data not shown) GnRH receptors. In contrast Ciona I and Ciona II had low affinities (918 and 988 nm) at the Ciona A receptor, which were similar to that of mammalian GnRH (1390 nm) (Fig. 2B). Ciona II had a considerably lower affinity (5600 nm) and may be the cognate ligand for a second Ciona GnRH receptor (17.Kusakabe T. Mishima S. Shimada I. Kitajima Y. Tsuda M. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 322: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which expressed poorly and, therefore, did not allow binding studies (data not shown). Because Ciona I was the most active of the Ciona peptides at the human receptor, this was selected for studies to determine whether substitution of the chiral amino acid in position six would increase activity at the human receptor. Replacement of Ala6 with the achiral Gly6 or with the type II′ β-turn-constraining d-Ala6 resulted in a marked increase (36–46-fold) in binding affinity (Fig. 2C, TABLE ONE). Similar results were obtained for the chicken (Fig. 2D) and catfish (data not shown) GnRH receptors.FIGURE 2Binding of mammalian, Ciona, and position-six substituted Ciona I GnRHs to human, Ciona A, and chicken GnRH receptors. COS-7 cells were transfected with human, Ciona A, and chicken GnRH receptors, incubated with radiolabeled GnRH analogs and increasing doses of unlabeled GnRHs and analogs in triplicate, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, and the bound radioactivity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Points are the mean ± S.E.

Agreement between the measured and calculated values is very good. The gas-phase cross-section of mammalian GnRH is smaller than that obtained for the Ciona I GnRH, and substitution of l-Ala6 with d-Ala6 or Gly6 reduces the cross-section to approach that of mammalian GnRH. Fig. 4 shows representative low energy structures obtained from the in vacuo simulations of the peptide ions. The general conformation of all of the peptides is comparable, as might be expected based on their sequence homologies. All form compact structures with a hairpin shape to the polypeptide backbone, which is sustained through non-covalent interactions across this structure. The radius is larger for the Ciona I form than that found for the Gly6- or d-Ala6-substituted Ciona I (Fig. 4), in agreement with the IM-MS cross-section data (TABLE TWO).

As described under “Results” and in TABLE THREE, the cross-peptide radius for Ciona I peptide is larger than for the other peptides (b, c, and d), which possesses a tighter turn around residues 5 and 6. In all of these peptides the proton carrying group (histidine for the Ciona peptides and arginine for mammalian GnRH) “caps” the polypeptide ring, thereby providing points for non-covalent interactions that stabilize these compact geometries of gas-phase ions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)By performing molecular dynamics on these low energy structures, the conformational space available to them is sampled, thus probing the stability of interactions formed.

https://openalex.org/W2010896039,"A carboxylate group of D1-Glu-189 in photosystem II has been proposed to serve as a direct ligand for the manganese cluster. Here we constructed a mutant that eliminates the carboxylate by replacing D1-Glu-189 with Gln in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and we examined the resulting effects on the structural and functional properties of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in photosystem II. The E189Q mutant grew photoautotrophically, and isolated photosystem II core particles evolved oxygen at ∼70% of the rate of control wild-type particles. The E189Q OEC showed typical S2 state electron spin resonance signals, and the spin center distance between the S2 state manganese cluster and the YD (D2-Tyr-160), detected by electron-electron double resonance spectroscopy, was not affected by this mutation. However, the redox potential of the E189Q OEC was considerably lower than that of the control OEC, as revealed by the elevated peak temperature of the S2 state thermoluminescence bands. The mutation resulted in specific changes to bands ascribed to the putative carboxylate ligands for the manganese cluster and to a few carbonyl bands in mid-frequency (1800 to 1100 cm−1) S2/S1 Fourier transform infrared difference spectrum. Notably, the low frequency (650 to 350 cm−1) S2/S1 Fourier transform infrared difference spectrum was also uniquely changed by this mutation in the frequencies for the manganese cluster core vibrations. These results suggested that the carboxylate group of D1-Glu-189 ligates the manganese ion, which is influenced by the redox change of the oxidizable manganese ion upon the S1 to S2 transition.

The OEC converts two water molecules to one oxygen molecule through a light-driven reaction cycle with five intermediate states denoted Sn (n = 0-4), where n represents the number of stored oxidizing equivalents. In the dark, the OEC is predominantly in a thermally stable S1 state and advances to the next oxidation state, S2, by absorbing a photon. The OEC reaches the highest oxidation state, S4, by accumulating four oxidizing equivalents after three flashes and then relaxes to the lowest oxidation state, S0, concurrent with the release of an oxygen molecule (2Joliot P.

Several carboxylate and histidine ligands were characterized spectroscopically using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and isotope labeling. The replacement of D1-Asp-170 with His resulted in marked changes in the low frequency (650 to 500 cm−1) S2/S1 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum (16Chu H.-A. Debus R.J. Babcock G.T.

Hillier W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1367-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Isotopic bands for the 13C-labeled C-terminal carboxylate of D1-Ala-344 appeared in the mid-(19Chu H.-A.

Consistently, replacement of the methyl side group of D1-Ala-344 with another group induced characteristic changes in OEC properties (21Mizusawa N. Kimura Y. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Nakazawa S.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14644-14652Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, S state-dependent changes of the isotopic bands showed that the manganese ion associated with the D1-Ala-344 carboxylate is oxidized upon the S1 to S2 transition and re-reduced during the S3 to S0 transition (20Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Yamanari T. Ishii A. Ono T.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2078-2083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The C-terminal carboxylate was not defined in the electron density map of the diffraction data but was assumed to be feasible to ligate a Ca2+ ion (14Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar). However, FTIR studies showed that neither Ca2+ depletion nor 44Ca-labeling induced spectral change of the carboxylate bands, including those for the C-terminal carboxylate (23Kimura Y. Hasegawa H. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 84: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ligation of the D1-Ala-344 carboxylate to a redox-active manganese ion but not to a Ca2+ ion was strongly supported by the FTIR study using Synechocystis in which calcium was biosynthetically replaced with strontium (24Strickler M.A. Walker L.M. Hillier W. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8571-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The ligation of histidine to the manganese cluster is suggested based on electron spin echo envelope modulation (25Tang X.-S. Diner B.A. Larsen B.S. Gilchrist M.L. Lorigan G.A. Britt R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and FTIR (26Noguchi T. Inoue Y. Tang X.-S.

PCC 6803 having a histidine containing two 15N atoms in the imidazole ring. X-ray models showed that the carboxylate side group of D1-Glu-189 serves as a unidentate ligand for the manganese cluster consistently (14Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar, 15Biesiadka J. Loll B. Kern J. Irrgang K.-D. Zouni A. Phys. Chem. Chem.

Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar) of the hydrogen bond to YZ tyrosine. The PS II cores isolated from D1-E189D, D1-E189G, D1-E189N, D1-E189S, and D1-E189H mutants evolved no oxygen despite possessing the functional reaction centers (27Debus R.J. Campbell K.A. Pham D.P. Hays A.-M.A. Britt R.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6275-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In these particles, neither an S1 nor an S2 multiline ESR signal was observed; however, an S2YZ. state split signal was apparent under multiple turnover conditions. Furthermore, the accelerated charge recombination of QA− and YZ. (27Debus R.J. Campbell K.A. Pham D.P. Hays A.-M.A. Britt R.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6275-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) indicated a change in the redox potential of YZ in these mutants. It was then proposed that D1-Glu-189 is part of a hydrogen bond network around YZ and the manganese cluster for rapid electron/proton transfer from the manganese cluster to YZ (27Debus R.J. Campbell K.A. Pham D.P. Hays A.-M.A. Britt R.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6275-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, the D1-E189Q, D1-E189R, and D1-E189K mutants grew photoautotrophically with ∼70-80% oxygen evolution compared with wild-type (27Debus R.J. Campbell K.A. Pham D.P. Hays A.-M.A. Britt R.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6275-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). They showed normal electron transfer from YZ to P680+. as well as from the manganese cluster to YZ. (28Clausen J. Winkler S. Hays A.-M.A. Hundelt M. Debus R.J. Junge W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1506: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the PS II cores isolated from E189Q mutants produced normal S1 and S2 multiline ESR signals (27Debus R.J. Campbell K.A. Pham D.P. Hays A.-M.A. Britt R.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6275-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The largely normal OEC properties in these mutants seem to be inconsistent with the proposed role of the D1-Glu-189 carboxylate for ligating the manganese ion as well as hydrogen bonding to YZ, because the carboxylate group is absent in the mutants, and the negatively charged residue was replaced with a neutral or positively charged residues. Therefore, the structural and functional roles of D1-Glu-189 are still largely unresolved. In the present study, we constructed the Synechocystis D1-E189Q mutant, which lacks the carboxylate side group but is expected to induce nonspecific structural perturbations minimally. The structural and functional properties of the mutant were examined by means of ESR, thermoluminescence, and FTIR spectroscopy in isolated active PS II core particles. The D1-E189Q mutation induced minimal changes in the magnetic properties of the manganese cluster but resulted in the characteristic changes in the redox potential and ligation geometry of the manganese cluster. Based on these and other findings, the structural and functional roles of D1-Glu-189 are discussed. Sample Materials—A host strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 for site-directed mutagenesis (B-His/NΔAA) was constructed by replacing a portion of psbA1, psbA2, and psbA3 genes with DNA fragments conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, spectinomycin, and tetracycline, respectively, and a hexahistidine tag was attached to the C terminus of the CP47 protein (21Mizusawa N.

Mutations were introduced into the psbA2 gene of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cloned in pNA219, which retains a DNA fragment conferring resistance to kanamycin downstream of the psbA2 gene, as described elsewhere (21Mizusawa N. Kimura Y. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Nakazawa S. Teramoto H. Ono T.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29622-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For construction of the D1-E189Q strain, Glu-189 codon GAG was changed to CAG. A plasmid bearing the mutation was transformed into the host strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and single colonies were selected for their photoautotrophic growth ability on solid BG-11 medium containing 5 μg/ml kanamycin. For constructing a wild-type control strain, a plasmid bearing the wild-type psbA2 gene was transformed into the host strain. Synechocystis cells were photoheterotrophically grown in liquid BG-11 medium supplemented with 5 mm glucose at 30 °C under 30-50 μmol of photons/m2/s. Harvested cells were disrupted using a bead beater (Bio-Spec Products), and the resulting thylakoid membranes were solubilized with n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, and PS II particles were affinity-purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) as described previously (21Mizusawa N.

The purified core particles were washed with medium A (400 mm sucrose, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 6.0) supplemented with 10% (w/v) PEG6000, and suspended in medium A after extensive washing with medium A. For analysis of protein composition, PS II core particles were solubilized with 1% SDS, followed by separation using SDS-PAGE on a 16-22% gradient gel containing 7.5 m urea (21Mizusawa N. Kimura Y.

FTIR Measurements—Mid-frequency (1800 to 1100 cm−1) FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS-66v/S spectrophotometer equipped with an MCT detector (EG&G Optoelectronics D316/6) (29Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Low frequency (650 to 350 cm−1) FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bomen MB102 spectrophotometer equipped with a silicon bolometer (Infrared Laboratories, HDL-5) (29Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PS II core particles suspended in a medium containing 40 mm sucrose, 10 mm Mes-NaOH, 5 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2, pH 6.0, were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 min, and a portion (∼40 μg of Chl) of the resulting pellet was directly mixed with 0.3 μl of sodium ferricyanide solution (0.2 m stock) added as an electron acceptor on either a BaF2 disk (13 mm inner diameter) for mid-frequency or an AgBr disk (13 mm inner diameter) for low frequency measurements. Sample temperature was maintained at 250 ± 0.03 K using a homemade cryostat (29Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Sample cores were illuminated with a flash provided from a frequency-doubled Nd3+:YAG laser (Spectra Physics INDI-50, 532 nm, pulse width 6-7 ns) with flash energy of ∼10 mJ/cm2 at the sample surface. Single beam spectra were accumulated at 4 cm−1 resolution in the mid-frequency (150 scans) or low frequency (60 scans) region before and after flash illumination, and light-minus-dark difference spectra were calculated. To improve signal-to-noise ratio, 25-29 mid-frequency difference spectra (3750-4350 scans) or 91-96 low frequency difference spectra (5460-5760 scans) were averaged. ESR Measurements—X-band CW and pulsed ESR experiments were performed on a Bruker ESR 580 spectrometer equipped with a cylindrical (ER4122SHQ) or cylindrical dielectric (ER4117DHQ-H) cavity. Sample core particles were suspended in a medium (400 mm sucrose, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 6.0, and 0.1 mm potassium ferricyanide) to be 4 mg of Chl/ml, transferred to a Spracil quartz ESR sample tube, and illuminated at 213 K for 5 s with cold light (Hayashi, LA-150TX). Sample temperature for ESR measurements was controlled using a gas flow temperature control system (Oxford Instruments, ESR900 or CF935). For ESE ELDOR measurements, a three-pulse sequence was used as described previously (30Hara H. Kawamori A. Astashkin A.V. Ono T.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 140-146Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with microwave pulses of 16-, 24-, and 24-ns duration for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd pulse, respectively. A microwave synthesizer (Hewlett Packard, HP83751B) was used as the second microwave source. Other Measurements—Thermoluminescence glow curves were measured as described previously (21Mizusawa N. Kimura Y. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Nakazawa S. Teramoto H. Ono T.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29622-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells and PS II core particles were suspended in medium A at 250 μg of Chl/ml in the presence of 0.1 mm DCMU and illuminated at 0 °C with a xenon flash. The O2 evolution activity was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode in medium A at 25 °C in the presence of 1 mm 2,5-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone and 2 mm potassium ferricyanide for cells or 4 mm potassium ferricyanide for core particles as described (21Mizusawa N.

TABLE ONE shows the effects of the E189Q mutation on cell growth and O2 evolution activity. The mutant cells grew photoautotrophically under both high and low light conditions and showed high O2 evolution activity, although the rates were somewhat lower than those of the wild-type control. The PS II core particles isolated from the mutant cells showed high O2 evolution activity, which was lower relative to that from the wild-type cells in agreement with the differences in whole cell activity and growth. These properties of the E189Q mutant were basically consistent with those reported previously (27Debus R.J. Campbell K.A. Pham D.P. Hays A.-M.A. Britt R.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6275-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).TABLE ONEPhotoautotrophic growth and PS II activities in wild-type control and D1-E189Q mutants of Synechocystis sp.

Therefore, it is conceivable that the lower O2 activity in the mutant core particles is not ascribed to differences in the protein compositions but reflects some change in the intrinsic properties of the OEC induced by the mutation. Fig. 1 shows the flash-induced S2QA− thermoluminescence glow curves of the cells (Fig. 1a) and PS II core particles (Fig. 1b) in the wild-type control (dashed curves) and E189Q mutant (solid curves). The wild-type cells showed an S2QA− band (+DCMU) at ∼9 °C, consistent with that reported previously (21Mizusawa N. Kimura Y. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Nakazawa S. Teramoto H. Ono T.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29622-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The peak temperature of the S2QA− band in the mutant cells was elevated to 24 °C. The wild-type and mutant PS II core particles showed S2QA− bands at 20 and 30 °C, respectively. Notably, the peak temperature was upshifted in the mutant cores, which agrees with trends observed in the thermoluminescence bands of the whole cells, although the bands appeared at a relatively higher temperature for the core particles than the cells. Presumably, some differences in the salt and pH conditions proximal to PS II between the whole cells and core particles are attributable to the observed difference. The results indicate that the redox potential of the S2 state manganese cluster was lowered by replacement of D1-Glu-189 with Gln, which may be responsible for the reduced O2 evolution activity in the mutant, as shown in TABLE ONE. Fig. 2 shows the effects of the mutation on the light-induced S2 state ESR spectra for the wild-type control (Fig. 2a) and E189Q mutant (Fig. 2b) PS II core particles. Both spectra showed a prominent g = 2 S2 multiline signal and Fe2+QA− signal at g = 1.9, and a negligibly small g = 4.1 S2 signal (Fig. 2, inset), although the intensity of the multiline signal in the mutant spectrum was ∼70% that of the control spectrum. Apparently, the smaller multiline intensity is not ascribed to the conversion of the multiline to the g = 4.1 S2 signal. No change in the hyperfine structure of the multiline signal by the mutation is consistent with the reported results (27Debus R.J. Campbell K.A. Pham D.P. Hays A.-M.A. Britt R.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6275-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results indicated that the intra-magnetic structure of the S2 state manganese cluster was not affected by replacement of Glu-189 with Gln. The absence of the putative carboxylate ligand for the manganese ion in the E189Q mutant may result in a subtle positional change of the manganese cluster in PS II if the carboxylate is responsible for the ligation of the manganese cluster, even though the intra-cluster magnetic structure was not affected by the mutation. To address this issue, mutation effects on the distance between YD tyrosine and the manganese cluster were evaluated. Fig. 3 shows the experimental (open circles) and simulated (solid lines) ESE ELDOR spectra for the pair of spins composed of the radical of YD tyrosine and S2 multiline center of the manganese cluster in the wild-type control (Fig. 3a) and E189Q mutant (Fig. 3b) PS II core particles. The distance between the two centers was determined to be 26.7 Å with an accuracy of 0.2 Å for the wild-type and the mutant particles, indicating that the mutation does not induce any positional change of the manganese cluster in PS II, although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the relative arrangement of the manganese cluster on a sphere made by the 26.7 Å radius vector from YD tyrosine was changed. Notably, the distance obtained was slightly shorter than that obtained in spinach (27.1 Å) (30Hara H. Kawamori A. Astashkin A.V. Ono T.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 140-146Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting a subtle difference in the relative position of the manganese cluster between cyanobacteria and higher plants. Fig. 4 shows the mid-frequency (1800 to 1100 cm−1) S2/S1 FTIR difference spectra of the wild-type control (Fig. 4a, black) and E189Q mutant (Fig. 4a, magenta) PS II core particles. The wild-type spectrum showed characteristic S2/S1 vibrational features, such as symmetric (1450 to 1300 cm−1) and asymmetric (1600 to 1500 cm−1) stretching modes from the putative carboxylate ligands for the manganese cluster as well as amide I (1700 to 1600 cm−1) and II (1600 to 1500 cm−1) modes from polypeptide backbones (29Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The E189Q spectrum showed S2/S1 vibrational features similar to those of wild-type spectrum in general, but distinctive differences were observed, particularly in the symmetric carboxylate stretching region. Predominant S2/S1 carboxylate stretching bands at 1435(+)/1417(-) cm−1 were shifted slightly upward by this mutation, resulting in the appearance of differential bands at 1441(+)/1421(-) cm−1, whereas other symmetric carboxylate bands did not change and occurred at the same positions as those in the wild-type spectrum. Most of the asymmetric carboxylate stretching and amide II bands were not affected by the mutation, with the exception of minor changes near 1520 to 1500 cm−1. In contrast, several bands at 1700 to 1600 cm−1 in the E189Q spectrum were clearly different from those in the wild-type spectrum; intensity of the negative band at 1678 cm−1 decreased and its peak position was shifted slightly upward to 1680 cm−1. To inspect the spectral changes induced by the E189Q mutation more closely, a double difference spectrum (Fig. 4b) was obtained by subtracting the E189Q spectrum from the wild-type spectrum after normalization with respect to peak-to-peak intensity of ferrocyanide (2037 cm−1) and ferricyanide (2115 cm−1) bands (29Kimura Y.

Centrosome separation is initiated in G2 phase and completed in M phase. This critical process for cell division is targeted by G2/M checkpoint.

Constitutively active Plk1 overrides the inhibition of centrosome separation induced by DNA damage. This inhibition is dependent on ATM, but not on Chk2 or Chk1. Nek2 is a key regulator of centrosome separation and is a target of Plk1 in blocking centrosome separation. We found that Plk1 can phosphorylate Nek2 in vitro and interacts with Nek2 in vivo. Down-regulation of Plk1 with RNA interference prevents Nek2-induced centrosome splitting. DNA damage is known to inhibit Plk1 activity.

To maintain the integrity of the genome, mammalian cells have developed surveillance mechanisms called checkpoints that arrest the cell cycle after activation by unreplicated or damaged DNA (1Elledge S.J.

The activation of this checkpoint requires the functions of checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related). Upon activation, ATM or ATR can phosphorylate and activate many proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2, P53 and BRCA1, therefore elicit a subsequent cell cycle arrest (5Walworth N.C.

It consists of a pair of centrioles surrounded by a protein matrix called pericentriolar material (10Schnackenberg B.J. Palazzo R.E. Biol. Cell. 1999; 91: 429-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the cell cycle, centrosomes are duplicated and segregated along with the genome. The centrosome cycle has been divided into several steps including centrosome duplication, centrosome maturation, centrosome separation, and centriole disorientation (11Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).

Cerniglia G.J. Nigg E.A. Yen T.Y. Muschel R.J. Radiat. Res. 2004; 162: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the checkpoint pathways and genes involved in this cellular response to DNA damage are not known.Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is involved at several points in mitotic progression (16Nigg E.A.

Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1617-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). At mitosis, Plk1 activates phosphatase cdc25C, a positive regulator of cdc2/cyclin B (20Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Taieb F.E. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1791-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21Hutchins J.R. Clarke P.R. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 41-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cdc2/cyclin B is the major cyclin that regulates G2/M phase transition (22Ohi R. Gould K.L. Curr. Opin.

Plk1 also contributes to the mitotic exit by regulating the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) (24Kotani S. Tugendreich S. Fujii M. Jorgensen P.M. Watanabe N. Hoog C. Hieter P. Todokoro K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 371-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 25Golan A. Yudkovsky Y. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15552-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Plk1 has a role in centrosome maturation and separation. Inhibition of Plk1 by anti-Plk1 antibody causes duplicated, but unseparated, centrosomes (26Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In addition, the centrosomes were reduced in size, and the expected accumulation of γ-tubulin and MPM-2 immunoreactivity was impaired (26Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Plk1 kinase activity is inhibited by DNA damage in G2 and in mitosis in an ATM- or ATR-dependent manner (27Smits V.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 41656-41660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of mutant Plk1s whose activities are constitutively active can override the G2 arrest induced by DNA damage. Therefore the evidence supports the contention that Plk1 is a target of the DNA damage response (27Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The information that Plk1 regulates centrosome function and its activity is down-regulated after irradiation led us to explore its effects on radiation-induced inhibition of centrosome separation.Nek2 is a cell cycle-regulated serine/threonine kinase of the NIMA (never in mitosis A) family (29Fry A.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12899-12905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Nek2 is located at the centrosome and has been implicated in centrosome splitting in mammalian cells (30Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 31Fry A.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6184-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). There are two alternatively spliced forms of Nek2, Nek2A, and Nek2B (32Hames R.S. Fry A.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Nek2A is elevated in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, whereas Nek2B is present during S, G2, and mitosis (32Hames R.S. Fry A.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Nek2A, but not Nek2B, stimulates centrosome disjunction and is required for the formation of bipolar mitotic spindles (33Faragher A.J. Fry A.M. Mol. Boil. Cell. 2003; 14: 2876-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Nek2A forms a complex with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and the centrosomal Nek2-associated protein, C-Nap1 (34Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 35Fry A.M. Mayor T. Meraldi P. Stierhof Y.D. Tanaka K. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1563-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Nek2A can phosphorylate itself, PP1, and C-Nap1, whereas PP1 can dephosphorylate both Nek2A and C-Nap1 (34Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Coexpression of PP1 with Nek2A suppresses centrosome splitting, whereas ectopic expression of inhibitor protein 2, a physiological inhibitor of PP1, stimulating splitting (36Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3749-3757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Eto M. Elliott E. Prickett T.D. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44013-44020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have shown that irradiated cells fail to activate Nek2 and that radiation inhibits the centrosome splitting induced by overexpression of Nek2, suggesting that inhibition of centrosome separation as a DNA damage response is mechanistically linked to Nek2 (15Fletcher L. Cerniglia G.J. Nigg E.A. Yen T.Y. Muschel R.J. Radiat. Res. 2004; 162: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the upstream regulator of Nek2 in this DNA damage checkpoint pathway remained to be determined.Here we show that a constitutively active mutant of Plk1 can override the inhibition of centrosome separation after ionizing radiation. The inhibition of centrosome separation is dependent on ATM but not on Chk2 or Chk1. Plk1 interacts with Nek2 in vivo and can phosphorylate Nek2 in vitro. Furthermore, inhibition of Plk1 by siRNA prevents Nek2-induced centrosome splitting. Our data indicate that Plk1 acts upstream of Nek2 in the signaling pathway, which leads to the inhibition of centrosome separation after IR.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Cell Treatment—HeLa and U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Centrin-GFP-Hela cell line was maintained in selective media containing G418 (200 μg/ml, Mediatech). Tetracycline-inducible GFP-Nek2A-U2OS cell line is a gift from Dr. Andrew Fry (University of Leicester, UK), and maintained in selective media containing Zeocin (200 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and hygromycin B (100 μg/ml, Roche Applied Science) (33Faragher A.J. Fry A.M. Mol. Boil. Cell. 2003; 14: 2876-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Tetracycline (2 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium to induce and maintain expression of GFP-Nek2A.Cells were synchronized in G1/S using a thymidine block (2 mm, Sigma) for 16 h. Cells were then released from the block by washing three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and thymidine/deoxycytidine (2.5 × 10-5 m). After 3 h, cells were irradiated using a Shepherd Mark 1 Model 68A cesium irradiator. Caffeine (Sigma) was added at a concentration of 3 mm. Cycloheximide was added at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Sigma) was added at a concentration of 20 μm.Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cell pellets were resuspended in citrate buffer and stained with propidium iodide as described (38Fletcher L. Muschel R.J. Radiat. Res. 2003; 159: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Data were acquired with Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer and analyzed using CellQuest (Version 2.01.2).Transfection—Myc-tagged wild type (wt) Plk1, kinase inactive mutant K82R and constitutively active mutant T210D Plk1 were cloned into a PRCCMV vector and obtained from Dr. Eric Nigg's laboratory. HeLa cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 10 5/ml in 6-well plates (35 mm/well) and transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with GFP-centrin plasmid (0.5 μg) and wt Plk1 or T210D mutant Plk1(0.5 μg). GFP-Nek2 U2OS cells or U2OS cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes, transfected with wt Plk1 or T210D Plk1 plasmids (4 μg). After 24-48 h, cells are subjected for analysis.siRNA Interference—Double stranded ATM, Chk2 or Plk1 SMART-POOL siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). Double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides corresponding to firefly luciferase (Dharmacon) were used as controls. Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was used to transfect HeLa and U2OS cells as specified by the manufacturers.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Transfected cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were incubated with anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz) or anti-GFP antibody (University of Alberta, Canada) overnight at 4 °C, followed by an additional 1-h incubation with Protein A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz). Immunocomplexes were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Western blot analysis was performed by loading samples on a 10% SDS/PAGE and transferring to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were incubated with various antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against ATM and goat polyclonal antibody against Plk1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Immunofluorescence Staining—The cells were grown on coverslips, transfected, and cultured for 24-48 h before fixation. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol for 2 min. After washing three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, coverslips were stained with mouse anti-myc antibody for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody for 1 h. Samples were mounted in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. Images were collected using a Hamamatsu digital camera and OpenLab software. Centrosome separation was assayed by counting GFP-centrin. Centrosomes were classified as separated if they were >2 μm apart from one another.In Vitro Kinase Assay—For Plk1 kinase assay, anti-myc immunoprecipitates were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml dephosphorylated casein in Plk1 washing buffer (20 mm Hepes,150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA,0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF) supplemented with 10 μm ATP and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. For in vitro phosphorylation assay, anti-Plk1 immunoprecipitates were incubated with 100 ng of recombinant Nek2 protein in Plk1 washing buffer with 10 μm ATP and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The intensity of the bands was measured by AlphaImager 2200 program.PP1 Activity Assay—PP1 was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-PP1α monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) from protein samples. The immune complexes were then incubated with 30 μl of protein G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz) washed three times with lysis buffer followed by Ser/Thr assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm CaCl2). PP1 activity was assayed using a Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). The PP1 immune complex beads in 50 μl of Ser/Thr assay buffer were incubated with the phosphopeptide KRp-TIRR at 30 °C for 30 min. The beads were pelleted, and 25 μl of supernatant was analyzed for free phosphate in the malachite green assay by dilution with 100 μl of developing solution (Malachite Green). After incubation for 15 min, the release of phosphate was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 620 nm in a microtiter plate reader.RESULTSTo evaluate the role of Plk1 in the failure of centrosome separation after IR, we used a constitutively active mutant of Plk1 that is not inhibited after DNA damage. In this mutant, Thr-210 was changed to Asp (T210D) (39Lee K.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3408-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with myc-tagged wild type or constitutively active mutant (T210D) Plk1 plasmids and irradiated 24 h after transfection. Four hours after IR, cell lysates were assayed for Plk1 activity using β-casein as a substrate. Although the activity of wild type Plk1 decreased by 61%, the activity of the T210D Plk1 mutant remained unchanged, confirming that the activity of the T210D Plk1 mutant was not inhibited by IR (Fig. 1A) (27Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). To test the effect of Plk1 activity after IR on centrosome separation, we co-transfected wild type Plk1 or T210D Plk1 with GFP-centrin into HeLa cells. The GFP-centrin was expressed to allow easy visualization of the centrosomes and as a transfection marker. These cells were then synchronized with a thymidine block, followed by irradiated with 6 grays. Cells transfected with GFP-centrin alone were used as a control. Centrosome separation was assayed by microscopic evaluation of GFP-centrin in the transfected cells 12 h after release from the thymidine block (Fig. 1B). Centrosomes were classified as separated if they were >2 μm apart from one another. After partial synchronization, 40% of the cells in G2/M based on fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and 58% of all cells had separated centrosomes (Fig. 1C). However, 60% of the irradiated, synchronized cells were in G2, whereas only 35% of all irradiated cells had separated centrosomes, consistent with our previous data showing that IR inhibits centrosome separation. Expression of wild type Plk1 produced similar results to those seen in control cells. Transient expression of the T210D Plk1 mutant in irradiated cells induced a similar frequency of separated centrosome to that seen in nonirradiated cells (51 and 54%, respectively), indicating that the constitutively active mutant of Plk1 overrode IR induced inhibition of centrosome separation.Because inhibition of Plk1 by DNA damage is ATM- or ATR-dependent (28van Vugt M.A. Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41656-41660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of ATM on centrosome separation after IR. It has been shown that caffeine can override the DNA damage checkpoint by direct inhibition of the checkpoint kinase ATM (40Blasina A. Price B.D. Turenne G.A. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1135-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 41Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore treated synchronized and irradiated GFP-centrin HeLa cells with caffeine and measured centrosome separation. As in figure 2A, without addition of caffeine, centrosomes were separated in 63% nonirradiated cells and 38% in irradiated cells. However, in the presence of caffeine, there was essentially no inhibition of centrosome separation by IR. To confirm that ATM affected the response of inhibition of centrosome separation by IR, we inhibited ATM expression in GFP-centrin HeLa cells using siRNA. There is an ∼30% decrease in ATM protein level showing by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2B indicates that there was a partial release from inhibition of centrosome separation in irradiated cells treated with siRNA against ATM. Because Chk2 is a downstream target of ATM and is known to mediate many functions of ATM, we examined the effect of Chk2 down-regulation on centrosome separation. Western blot analysis indicates nearly 80% suppression of Chk2 protein expression by siRNA against Chk2 (Fig. 2D). As shown in Fig. 2C, inhibition of Chk2 expression failed to affect centrosome separation in irradiated cells, excluding its role in the IR-induced inhibition of centrosome separation. We also show that down-regulation of Chk1 by siRNA has no effect on centrosome separation (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Inhibition of centrosome separation by IR depends on ATM not Chk2 or Chk1. GFP-centrin HeLa cells were treated with caffeine (A), siRNA against ATM (B), Chk1 or Chk2 (C), synchronized with a thymidine block, irradiated after release. Centrosome separation was determined by counting centrosomes stained with GFP-centrin. Centrosomes >2 μm were considered as separated. Values are given as the percentage of the cells with separated centrosomes ± S.D. for three independent experiments. Around 200 cells/experiment were counted. D, Western blot shows ATM, Chk2, and Chk1 expression after siRNA treatment. siRNA against firefly luciferase GL3 was used as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previously, we have shown that the kinase activity of Nek2 decreased in response to IR (15Fletcher L. Cerniglia G.J. Nigg E.A. Yen T.Y. Muschel R.J. Radiat. Res. 2004; 162: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that Plk1 might be an upstream regulator of Nek2 and that inhibition of Plk1 activity by IR might lead to a decrease in Nek2 activity. Because Nek2 phosphorylation is associated with its kinase activity (34Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we tested whether Plk1 could phosphorylate Nek2 in vitro. We immunoprecipitated Plk1 in cells transfected with the kinase inactive K82R mutant, wild type, or T210D Plk1 plasmids using antibody against Plk1. The immunocomplex was incubated with recombinant Nek2 protein in kinase buffer containing γ-32P. Incorporation of γ-32P was seen as a band at 52 kDa in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel detected by autoradiography, indicative of Nek2 phosphorylation. The intensity of the bands was measured by AlphaImager 2200 program and plotted (Fig. 3A). Although Nek2 is autophosphorylated, expression of wild type or kinase active Plk1 increased Nek2 phosphorylation in vitro as seen in Fig. 3A.FIGURE 3Plk1 regulates the activity of Nek2. A, Plk1 phosphorylates Nek2 in vitro. Lysates of U2OS cells transfected with wt, K82R, or T210D Plk1 plasmids were immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibody against Plk1. The immunocomplex was incubated with recombinant Nek2 protein in kinase buffer containing γ-32P. Incorporation of γ-32P into Nek2 was detected by autoradiography and the intensity of the bands was quantified by AlphaImager 2200 program. Nonspecific IgG antibodies served as immunoprecipitation controls. Phosphorylation was normalized with the control sample, and the result is a representative of two independent experiments. B, Plk1 promotes Nek2A degradation. Inducible GFP-Nek2A-U2OS cells were transfected with myc-tagged wt or T210D Plk1 plasmids. Four hours after GFP-Nek2A was induced by tetracycline, cycloheximide was added. Samples were collected at indicated time points and subjected to Western blot analysis. C, Plk1 interacts with Nek2A in vivo. Inducible GFP-Nek2A-U2OS cells were transfected with myc-tagged wt or T210D Plk1 plasmids. Tetracycline was added to induce GFP-Nek2A, and MG132 was added to prevent Nek2 degradation. Samples were collected and immunoprecipitated with antibody against myc or GFP. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted (IB) with either anti-GFP or anti-myc antibody. D, Plk1 does not alter PP1α phosphatase activity. U2OS cells transfected with wt or T210D Plk1 plasmids were immunoprecipitated with antibody against PP1α and subjected to phosphatase assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Plk1 and Nek2 are both found in the centrosome (19Golsteyn R.M. Mundt K.E. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1617-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 30Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). We asked whether they could interact with each other. When we transfected wild type or T210D mutant Plk1 into inducible GFP-Nek2A U2OS cells where GFP-Nek2A was expressed upon tetracycline addition, we found that Nek2A protein levels decreased after Plk1 transfection. In the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, Nek2A protein levels decreased more rapidly in Plk1-transfected cells, indicating that Plk1 was involved in the degradation of Nek2 (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with published results showing that Plk1 activates APC activity and reports showing that Nek2 is degraded by the APC (24Kotani S. Tugendreich S. Fujii M. Jorgensen P.M. Watanabe N. Hoog C. Hieter P. Todokoro K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 371-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 42Hames R.S. Wattam S.L. Yamano H. Bacchieri R. Fry A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7117-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, to test the interaction between Plk1 and Nek2, it was necessary to prevent Nek2A protein degradation. We added the proteasome inhibitor MG132 after GFP-Nek2A had been induced. The protein samples from GFP-Nek2A U2OS cells transfected with myc-tagged Plk1 plasmids were immunoprecipitated with either GFP antibody or myc antibody. The presence of associated proteins was determined by immunoblotting using either myc antibody or GFP antibody. As shown in Fig. 3C, Nek2A was coimmunoprecipitated with Plk1 and vise versa, indicating that Plk1 and Nek2 interact with each other in vivo.Because Nek2 forms a complex with PP1 in vivo (34Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and PPl can dephosphorylate and inactivate Nek2 (34Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that Plk1 was acting through phosphorylation to inactivate PP1, leading to the increase of Nek2 kinase activity. We transfected wild type or T210D mutant Plk1 into U2OS cells, and immunoprecipitated cells with antibody against PP1α. A phosphatase assay was performed using a Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). There was no difference in PP1α phosphatase activity between Plk1 transfected cells and control cells (Fig. 3D), indicating that Plk1 did not change the phosphatase activity of PP1α.Finally, we tested whether suppression of Plk1 could inhibit Nek2 induced centrosome separation. To address this question, we treated inducible GFP-Nek2A-U2OS cells with siRNA against Plk1. Decreased Plk1 expression was determined by Western blot analysis. We then induced Nek2A expression by using tetracycline and studied centrosome separation in the cells. Overexpression of GFP-Nek2A stimulated a premature splitting of centrioles in 70% of cells, which is consistent with previous observations (33Faragher A.J. Fry A.M. Mol. Boil. Cell. 2003; 14: 2876-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, the splitting of centrioles was suppressed in the cells treated with siRNA against Plk"

Clostridium difficile toxins A and B and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin use UDP-glucose as the donor for glucosylation of Rho/Ras GTPases. In contrast, α-toxin from Clostridium novyi N-acetylglucosaminylates Rho GTPases by using UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as a donor substrate. Based on the crystal structure of C. difficile toxin B, we studied the sugar donor specificity of the toxins by site-directed mutagenesis. The changing of Ile-383 and Gln-385 in toxin B to serine and alanine, respectively, largely increased the acceptance of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as a sugar donor for modification of RhoA. The Km value was reduced from 960 to 26 μm for the double mutant. Accordingly, the potential of the double mutant of toxin B to hydrolyze UDP-N-acetylglucosamine was higher than that for UDP-glucose. The changing of Ile-383 and Gln-385 in the lethal toxin of C. sordellii allowed modification of Ras in the presence of UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine and reduced the acceptance of UDP-glucose as a donor for glycosylation. Vice versa, the changing of the equivalent residues in C. novyi α-toxin from Ser-385 and Ala-387 to isoleucine and glutamine, respectively, reversed the donor specificity of the toxin from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to UDP-glucose. These data demonstrate that two amino acid residues are crucial for the co-substrate specificity of clostridial glycosylating toxins.

The changing of Ile-383 and Gln-385 in toxin B to serine and alanine, respectively, largely increased the acceptance of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as a sugar donor for modification of RhoA. The Km value was reduced from 960 to 26 μm for the double mutant. Accordingly, the potential of the double mutant of toxin B to hydrolyze UDP-N-acetylglucosamine was higher than that for UDP-glucose. The changing of Ile-383 and Gln-385 in the lethal toxin of C. sordellii allowed modification of Ras in the presence of UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine and reduced the acceptance of UDP-glucose as a donor for glycosylation. Vice versa, the changing of the equivalent residues in C. novyi α-toxin from Ser-385 and Ala-387 to isoleucine and glutamine, respectively, reversed the donor specificity of the toxin from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to UDP-glucose. These data demonstrate that two amino acid residues are crucial for the co-substrate specificity of clostridial glycosylating toxins. Clostridium difficile is a causative agent of pseudomembranous colitis and in many cases is responsible for antibiotic-associated diarrhea (1Kelly C.P. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. N. Engl. J.

The N terminus harbors the catalytic domain, whereas the C terminus and the middle part of the large proteins appear to be involved in binding and translocation of the toxins into target cells (7Hofmann F.

Toxins A and B from C. difficile, the hemorrhagic toxin from C. sordellii, and the α-toxin from C. novyi have the same protein substrate specificity and modify RhoA, Rac, Cdc42, and other Rho subfamily GTPases. The lethal toxin from C. sordellii glucosylates Rac but not Rho (11Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Green G.A. Aktories K. J. Biol.

In addition, Ras proteins are substrates for this toxin. All clostridial toxins utilize UDP-glucose as co-substrate with the exception of the α-toxin from C. novyi, which uses UDP-GlcNAc (13Selzer J.

Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank identifier 2BVL). Based on this work we were able to identify amino acid residues that determine the co-substrate specificity of the toxins. Here we report on site-directed mutagenesis resulting in the change of the donor substrate specificity of toxin B and C. sordellii lethal toxin from UDP-glucose to UDP-GlcNAc. Vice versa, the donor specificity of the α-toxin from C. novyi was changed from UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-glucose. Materials—UDP-[14C]glucose (287.4 mCi/mmol), UDP-N-acetyl-d-[14C]glucosamine (288 mCi/mmol), and UDP-[14C]galactose (258 mCi/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and PCR primers were from Biochip Technologies (Freiburg, Germany). All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from commercial sources. Polymerase Chain Reactions—Amplification of the toxin fragments toxin-B546 of C. difficile VPI 10463, the fragment LT546 of C. sordellii 6018, and the fragment α551 of C. novyi type A strain ATCC 19402 were performed as described previously (7Hofmann F.

Site-directed Mutagenesis of Toxin Fragments—The QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene), in combination with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase, was used for the replacement of 1-5 nucleotides in the pGEX2T-LT546, pGEX2T-CN551, or pGEX2T-B546 plasmid. Primers were constructed as follows: toxin-B546 I383S (primer pair CDB_I383S), 5′-GTAAGGGTATTAGTAATCAAGGGCTAATTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAAATTAGCCCTTGATTACTAATACCCTTAC-3′ (antisense); toxin-B546 I383G (primer pair CDB_I383G), 5′-GTAAGGGTATTGGAAATCAAGGGCTAATTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAAATTAGCCCTTGATTTCCAATACCCTTAC-3′ (antisense); toxin-B546 I383S/Q385A (primer pair CDB_I383S/Q385A), 5′-GTAAGGGTATTAGTAATGCAGGGCTAATTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAAATTAGCCCTGCATTACTAATACCCTTAC-3′ (antisense); toxin-B546 I383G/Q385A (primer pair CDB_I383G/Q385A), 5′-GTAAGGGTATTGGAAATGCAGGGCTAATTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAAATTAGCCCTGCATTTCCAATACCCTTAC-3′ (antisense); LT546 I383S/Q385A (primer pair LT_ I383S/Q385A), 5′-CTCTGTTAGTAATGCAGCCTTAATTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAAATTAAGGCTGCATTACTAACAGAG-3′ (antisense); and α551 S385I/A387Q (primer pair CN_S385I/A387-Q), 5′-GAAAAAAAACTTTTATCAATCAGTTTATAATTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAAATTATAAACTGATTGATAAAAGTTTTTTTTC-3′ (antisense). Corresponding plasmids were selected in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue followed by transformation into E. coli BL-21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) for expression. Sequencing—All constructs and according variants of toxin-B546, LT546, and α551 were checked by sequencing with ABI PRISM™ dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit and ABI 310 cycle sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Toxin fragments were expressed as GST fusion proteins from the E. coli expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) as reported previously (7Hofmann F. Busch C. Prepens U. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11074-11078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was used for purification. Proteins were cleaved from a GST fusion protein with thrombin in TBP-150 elution buffer (100 μg/ml thrombin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) for at least 1 h at 4 °C. Thrombin was removed by binding to benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant GTP-binding proteins RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, H-Ras, and RalA were prepared as GST fusion proteins as described (16Just I. Wilm M. Selzer J. Rex G. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13932-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Glycosylation Reaction—Recombinant GTP-binding proteins (50 μg/ml) were incubated with recombinant toxin fragments (5 μg/ml) and 10 μm UDP-[14C]sugars in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for indicated times at 37 °C. Total volume was 20 μl. Labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging (Amersham Biosciences). Labeling of N-Acetylglucosaminylated Proteins—[14C]Galactosylation of GlcNAc-modified proteins was performed as described previously (13Selzer J. Hofmann F. Rex G. Wilm M. Mann M. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25173-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). N-Acetylglucosaminylated GTP-binding proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and galactosylated by 100 milliunits of β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.38) in the presence of 10 μm UDP-[14C]galactose (1 μCi) by gentle agitation for 2 h at 25 °C. After extensive washing the blot slice was analyzed by phosphorimaging. UDP-Sugar Hydrolase Assay—UDP-sugar hydrolysis was performed as described (16Just I. Wilm M. Selzer J. Rex G. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13932-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Toxin fragments and mutants were incubated with 20 μm UDP-[14C]sugars and 100 μm corresponding unlabeled UDP-sugars in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μm bovine serum albumin, and 100 μm MnCl2. Total volume was 20 μl. Samples of 1 μl were taken at each time point and subjected to thin layer chromatography with polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Merck) and 0.2 mm LiCl as mobile phase to separate the hydrolyzed sugar from UDP-sugars. The plates were dried and analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis. Quantification was carried out with ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of Km Values—Initial rate data for the glycosyltransferase reactions were determined by varying the UDP-sugar concentrations from ∼0.1-2 × Km. The experiments were performed with a fixed RhoA concentration of 130 μm. The Michaelis-Menten constants were obtained by computer-assisted analysis of Lineweaver-Burk plots of initial velocities from at least three independent experiments with the curve-fitting function in SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc.). Molecular Modeling of the Active Site of α-Toxin—Alignments of the catalytic domain of α-toxin from C. novyi (GenBank™ accession number Z48636) and toxin B (GenBank™ accession number X53138) were obtained using ClustalW. Energy minimization after the manual introduction of mutations according to the alignment was done using CNS (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Images were created with POVScript+ (19Fenn T.D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 944-947Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and POVRAY (www.povray.org). Whereas toxin B uses UDP-glucose as a co-substrate, α-toxin from C. novyi only accepts UDP-GlcNAc (13Selzer J. Hofmann F. Rex G. Wilm M. Mann M. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25173-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of toxin B was solved (14Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The catalytic cores of toxin B and α-toxin differ by only three amino acid substitutions, I383S, Q385A, and L519S (all numbered according to toxin B). Whereas Leu-519 interacts with the α-phosphate of the co-substrate, Ile-383 and Gln-385 are located near the C2 atom of the glucose moiety (14Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), (Fig. 1B). Comparison of these residues within the group of clostridial glycosylating toxins (Fig. 1C) illustrates that Ile-383 and Gln-385 are conserved in all toxins with the exception of the α-toxin, which has serine and alanine residues at these positions as shown in Fig. 1B as a model. Therefore, we changed Ile-383 and Gln-385 to serine and alanine in a fragment of toxin B, which covers the catalytic domain (amino acid residues 1-546). We studied the modification of RhoA by this catalytic fragment in the presence of UDP-glucose or UDP-GlcNAc. Fig. 2A shows that the change of Ile-383 to serine slightly increased the labeling of RhoA in the presence of UDP-GlcNAc; accordingly, the kcat increased from 11 to 420 h-1 (see TABLE ONE). The same was true for exchanging Gln-385 to alanine; kcat increased to 514 h-1. Interestingly, the exchange of both residues largely increased the ability of toxin B to modify RhoA in the presence of UDP-GlcNAc (kcat at 2380 h-1). Conversely, the acceptance of UDP-glucose decreased slightly for the toxin double mutant.FIGURE 2A, co-substrate specificity of toxin-B546 mutants. In vitro glycosylation of RhoA (1 μg) by the recombinant enzyme domain of toxin B, toxin-B546, with residues Ile-383 and/or Gln-385 exchanged to the appropriate amino acids serine and alanine of α-toxin in the presence of UDP-[14C]glucose or UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (10 μm), respectively, for 30 min at 37 °C. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-stained, and the radiolabeled proteins were detected by PhosphorImager analysis.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Afterward, the blot slice was incubated with 100 milliunits of galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.38) in the presence of UDP-[14C]galactose for 1.5 h at 22 °C.

Therefore we performed a glycosyltransferase reaction with members of the Rho and Ras family as protein substrates. Fig. 3 shows that RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 were modified but, as expected, not H-Ras and RalA. The protein substrate recognition remained unchanged. To test whether UDP-GlcNAc was indeed attached to Rho proteins, we performed a second reaction with galactosyltransferase T, which transfers galactose from UDP-galactose exclusively onto N-acetylglucosamine but not onto glucose. Fig. 2B shows that after modification of RhoA by GlcNAc, the galactosyltransferase is able to modify RhoA by [14C]galactosylation. Concomitantly with the acceptance of UDP-GlcNAc as a co-substrate in the glycosylation of RhoA by the mutant toxin, the Km value for UDP-GlcNAc decreased. As shown in TABLE ONE, the Km value for UDP-GlcNAc was 960 μm for the wild-type toxin B fragment. With toxin-B I383S and Q385A the Km values decreased to 61 and 52 μm, respectively. For the double mutant (toxin-B546 I383S/Q385A), the Km value was reduced to 26 μm. Accordingly, these amino acid exchanges had major consequences for the glycohydrolase activity of the toxin fragment. Whereas the wild-type catalytic domain of toxin B cleaved UDP-glucose in the absence of protein substrate (Fig. 4A), UDP-GlcNAc was not hydrolyzed (Fig. 4B). By contrast, the double mutant of toxin B was capable of hydrolyzing UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 4B). Next, we studied whether the exchange of the conserved residues Ile-383 and Gln-385 had the same consequences in C. sordellii LT. As mentioned above, LT accepts H-Ras and Rac but not RhoA as protein substrates (11Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Green G.A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10149-10153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, the modification of Ras by LT was studied. Fig. 5 shows that Ras was labeled by the wild-type fragment of LT with UDP-[14C]glucose but not with UDP-[14C]GlcNAc. However, the double mutant (LT1-546 I383S/Q385A) modified Ras in the presence of UDP-GlcNAc, whereas the labeling with radioactive UDP-glucose was significantly reduced. This change in donor substrate specificity was again corroborated by the glycohydrolase activity. As expected, only the double mutant is capable of hydrolyzing UDP-GlcNAc in the absence of a protein substrate (Fig. 4C). Finally, we studied the consequences of the exchange of the equivalent residues in C. novyi α-toxin, which accepts UDP-GlcNAc but almost no UDP-glucose (15Busch C. Schömig K. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6378-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Within the catalytic active fragment of α-toxin (residues 1-551), Ser-385 and Ala-387 were changed to isoleucine and glutamine, respectively. Fig. 6 shows that these changes resulted in the labeling of Rho in the presence of UDP-[14C]glucose, whereas the labeling by UDP-[14C]GlcNAc was blocked. This change in the ability of α-toxin to use UDP-glucose was also reflected in changes in the Km values for the activated sugars (see TABLE ONE). Whereas the wild-type α-toxin fragment exhibited a Km value of ∼300 μm, this value was reduced to 4 μm for the double mutant. Again, the glycohydrolase activity of the double mutant proves the acceptance of UDP-glucose as co-substrate (Fig. 4E), whereas UDP-GlcNAc was not hydrolyzed by the double mutant (Fig. 4D). Members of the family of clostridial glycosylating toxins differ in their co-substrate specificity (3Schirmer J. Aktories K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Just I. Gerhard R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 152: 23-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Whereas C. difficile toxin A and B and also C. sordellii LT and hemorrhagic toxin use UDP-glucose as a donor substrate, α-toxin from C. novyi prefers UDP-GlcNAc and causes N-acetylglucosaminylation of their protein substrates (13Selzer J. Hofmann F. Rex G. Wilm M. Mann M. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25173-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15Busch C. Schömig K. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6378-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here, we report the change of the co-substrate specificity of clostridial glycosylating toxins on the basis of the recently solved crystal structure analysis of toxin B (14Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This study solved the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of toxin B complexed with Mn2+ and the donor UDP-glucose, which was cleaved into UDP and glucose by the hydrolase activity of the toxin. The catalytic domain resembles the three-dimensional structure of a type A glycosyltransferase (20Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 21Unligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Toxin B is a retaining glucosyltransferase. Because the close environment of the C1″ atom of glucose lacks any catalytic base and has nonpolar residues, a SNi mechanism rather than a double displacement reaction has been suggested to be responsible for the retaining transferase reaction of the glucose moiety onto the protein substrate RhoA (14Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In close vicinity to the glucose moiety, several amino acid residues are found that are conserved within the family of clostridial glycosylating toxins. Interestingly, Ile-383 and Gln-385 are conserved in all UDP-glucose utilizing toxins, whereas the α-toxin, which uses UDP-GlcNAc, has a serine and alanine residue at these positions. Deduced from the crystal structure of toxin B, it has been suggested that UDP-GlcNAc would not be accommodated in the catalytic groove with residues Ile-383 and Gln-385 present (14Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, we changed these residues in toxin B to those of α-toxin. Indeed, exchange of these residues increased the acceptance of UDP-GlcNAc as a donor substrate for toxin B with a decrease of the Km from ∼960 to 26 μm for the double mutant. These findings support the view that sterical hindrance is a major reason for the donor sugar specificity (illustrated as a model in Fig. 7). A comparable situation has been observed for the glycosyltransferases that define the specificity in human AB0(H) blood group biosynthesis. In this case, an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GTA) uses UDP-GalNAc to convert the H-antigen to the A-antigen, whereas a highly related transferase (GTB; only four residues differ) uses UDP-galactose to convert H-antigen into B-antigen. Only one amino acid residue (Leu-266 in GTA and Met-266 in GTB) located in the catalytic cleft is responsible for this difference in donor substrate specificity (22Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Moreover, a single point mutation (P234S) has been described recently that completely changes the GTB type (UDP-galactose) into an GTA type (UDP-GalNAc) (17Marcus S.L. Polakowski R. Seto N.O. Leinala E. Borisova S. Blancher A. Roubinet F. Evans S.V. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12403-12405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Conformational changes involving the critical Met-266 residue were suggested as inducing these effects. Thus, minor change of the structural environment of the catalytic center can induce significant changes in the donor-substrate specificity. We also tested the consequences of changes of Ile-383 and Gln-385 in C. sordellii LT, which uses the same donor substrate as toxin B but a different protein substrate. Again, the I383S and Q385A mutations changed the co-substrate specificity from UDP-glucose to UDP-GlcNAc. Interestingly, in this case the substrate specificity was not only broadened but also reversed. This means that the affinity for UDP-glucose was reduced as compared with UDP-GlcNAc in the mutant. Finally, we were able to change the co-substrate specificity of the C. novyi α-toxin from UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-glucose by exchanging the equivalent residues Ser-385 and Ala-387 to isoleucine and glutamine, respectively. Again, this mutation resulted in a reversal of the specificity from UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-glucose. This suggests that sterical hindrance is not the entire reason for substrate specificity. Most likely, the exchange of the bulkier isoleucine and glutamine residues to serine and alanine provides additional interaction sites that may stabilize the binding of UDP-GlcNAc and increase its affinity toward the transferase. A similar mechanism has been suggested for the conversion of the sugar donor specificity in the blood group defining N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferases (22Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar)."

https://openalex.org/W2151163622,"In this study, we describe a rapid immunoaffinity purification procedure for gel-free tandem mass spectrometry-based analysis of endogenous protein complexes and apply it to the characterization of complexes containing the SRm160 (serine/arginine repeat-related nuclear matrix protein of 160 kDa) splicing coactivator. In addition to promoting splicing, SRm160 stimulates 3'-end processing via its N-terminal PWI nucleic acid-binding domain and is found in a post-splicing exon junction complex that has been implicated in coupling splicing with mRNA turnover, export, and translation. Consistent with these known functional associations, we found that the majority of proteins identified in SRm160-containing complexes are associated with pre-mRNA processing. Interestingly, SRm160 is also associated with factors involved in chromatin regulation and sister chromatid cohesion, specifically the cohesin subunits SMC1alpha, SMC3, RAD21, and SA2. Gradient fractionation suggested that there are two predominant SRm160-containing complexes, one enriched in splicing components and the other enriched in cohesin subunits. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments, as well as combinatorial RNA interference in Caenorhabditis elegans, support the existence of conserved and functional interactions between SRm160 and cohesin."
https://openalex.org/W2100537640,"To gain a better understanding of how Crk II regulates the function of the Abl tyrosine kinase, we explored the function of the C-terminal linker and SH3 domain, a region of Crk II that is still poorly understood. Molecular modeling, tryptophan fluorescence, and covariation sequence alignment indicate that the Crk-SH3-C has a unique binding groove and RT loop not observed in typical SH3 domains. Based on these models, we made a series of mutations in the linker and in residues predicted to destabilize the putative binding pocket and RT loop. In Abl transactivation assays, Y222F and P225A mutations in the linker resulted in strong transactivation of Abl by Crk II. However, mutations predicted to be at the surface of the Crk SH3-C were not activators of Abl. Interestingly, combinations of activating mutations of Crk II with mutations in the highly conserved PNAY sequence in the SH3-C inactivated the activating mutations, suggesting that the SH3-C is necessary for activation. Our data provide insight into the role of highly conserved residues in the Crk-SH3-C, suggesting a mechanism for how the linker and the Crk-SH3-C function in the transactivation of the Abl tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2012711829,"p53 mRNA levels are tightly regulated during the cell cycle with its transcription being induced prior to DNA synthesis. However, the mechanism controlling this regulation is not well defined. Through characterizing an additional 1000 bp of upstream DNA sequences of the murine p53 gene, we identified new positive and negative regulatory elements. Furthermore, we found a trans-acting factor(s) that binds within a positive cis-acting element (-972/-953) in a manner indicative of regulation during the cell cycle. When Swiss3T3 cells are arrested by serum depletion p53 mRNA levels decrease and binding of this regulatory factor(s) to the promoter is reduced. Upon serum stimulation, the regulatory factor(s) binds the promoter and p53 mRNA levels increase prior to the cells entering S phase. When the factors are experimentally sequestered from the promoter or when the regulatory element is deleted from the promoter, p53 promoter activity is reduced. There is no further reduction in p53 promoter activity upon serum depletion and the kinetics of induction upon serum stimulation is delayed by approximately 5 h. These findings indicate that a factor(s) binding within the -972/-953 regulatory element on the p53 promoter is important for the proper regulation of p53 mRNA expression in response to mitogen stimulation. Our initial findings indicate that a member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors may play a role in this regulation."

To test the redox function of carotenoids in this pathway, we replaced the ζ-carotene desaturase gene (zds) or both the zds and phytoene desaturase (pds) genes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with the phytoene desaturase gene (crtI) of Rhodobacter capsulatus, producing carotenoids with shorter conjugated π-electron systems and higher reduction potentials than β-carotene.

A carotenoid molecule is an extended polyene chain with a variety of end groups and has been thought of as a “molecular wire,” because, in the one-electron oxidized form, or carotenoid radical cation, the hole is delocalized over the entire conjugated π-system.

Among photosynthetic reaction centers, carotenoid photooxidation is unique to PS II, which uses light energy to catalyze the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen. The process of water oxidation involves highly oxidizing species that can also oxidize a carotenoid molecule. Carotenoid radical cations have been identified as intermediates in the secondary electron transport pathway of PS II (2.Schenck C.C. Diner B. Mathis P. Satoh K. Biochim. Biophys.

Detergent-solubilized PS II core complexes contain up to 25 different integral membrane and extrinsic polypeptide subunits, including the D1/D2 complex and light-harvesting pigment-protein complexes CP43 (PsbC) and CP47 (PsbB). Light energy is absorbed by the chlorophyll-containing light-harvesting antenna and transferred to the primary donor chlorophyll(s) coordinated by the D1/D2 polypeptides. The term “PS II reaction centers” describes a structure that includes the D1 and D2 polypeptides, cytochrome b559 (Cyt b559), PsbI, and protein-bound cofactors that include six chlorophyll a (Chl a) molecules, two pheophytin a (Pheo a) molecules, a tightly bound plastoquinone (QA) and an exchangeable plastoquinone (QB). The primary photochemical reactions in PS II are initiated by the absorption of light energy by the primary chlorophyll donor (most likely chlorophyll BA) (7.Dekker J.P. Van Grondelle R. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 63: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 8.Prokhorenko V.I. Holzwarth A.R. J. Phys. Chem.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9265-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The excited state of this chlorophyll drives charge separation, producing a reduced pheophytin (PheoA-) and a chlorophyll radical cation species, P680+. The charge separation is stabilized by transfer of the electron from PheoA- to QA, forming the state, P680+ QA-. Under normal physiological conditions, the very high potential oxidant, P680+, is reduced by electrons from the oxygen-evolving complex via a redox-active tyrosine (YZ). However, there are several conditions known, some of them of physiological relevance, in which the donation of an electron from the oxygen-evolving complex to P680+ is inhibited or retarded, allowing the highly oxidizing P680+ (EM ∼ 1.1-1.3 V) (10.Diner B.A. Rappaport F. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 551-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) to abstract an electron from other sources. ChlorophyllZ (ChlZ), Cyt b559, and carotenoid (Car) have been identified as electron donors to P680+ and are thought to comprise an alternate electron transfer pathway that has been suggested to protect PS II against uncontrolled oxidative reactions of the strong oxidant P680+. Cytochrome b559 and the ChlZ accessory chlorophylls (ChlZD1 and ChlZD2) are located at the periphery of the PS II reaction center (Fig. 1). Because these species can be oxidized by P680+ despite their location ≥30Å away, it has been postulated that β-carotene enables long distance electron transfer in PS II from Cyt b559 to P680+ by acting as an electron wire, forming an intermediate cation radical. Earlier studies suggested that the carotenoid molecule is the primary donor to P680+ at low temperature, followed by subsequent oxidation of ChlZ and Cyt b559 (3.Hanley J. Deligiannakis Y. Pascal A. Faller P. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8189-8195Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 5.Tracewell C.A. Cua A. Stewart D.H. Bocian D.F. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has been obtained for the involvement of two carotenoid molecules in this pathway, most likely the all-trans-β-carotenes in the reaction center (6.Telfer A. Frolov D. Barber J.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9127-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although four crystal structures of PS II core complexes have been determined, the location of the carotenoids in the D1 and D2 polypeptides remains uncertain because of the limited resolution of the diffraction data, 3.2-3.8 Å (12.Zouni A.

Phys. 2004; 6: 4733-4736Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Because of the snake-like structure of carotenoids, they are difficult to identify in the electron density, although a carotenoid was modeled in a very similar location in the D2 polypeptide in two of the structures. In two of the x-ray crystal structures, a second carotenoid was modeled in the D2 polypeptide, but with different orientations. No carotenoids have been modeled in the D1 polypeptide even though the accessory Chl ligated to His-118 in D1 (ChlZD1) can be photooxidized (16.Stewart D.H. Cua A. Chisholm D.A. Diner B.A. Bocian D.F. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10040-10046Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and a carotenoid located in the D1 subunit would supply a feasible pathway for electron transfer. However, a pathway for electron transfer from ChlZD1 to P680 through intermediate chlorophylls in CP43 has been suggested (17.Vasil'ev S. Brudvig G.W. Bruce D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The uncertainty in the location of the carotenoid molecules in the structure of PS II also means that the exact pathway of the alternate electron transfer is unknown. To increase our understanding of the role that carotenoids play in this electron transfer pathway, we decided to alter the carotenoid reduction potential and to study the effect of this alteration on the alternate pathway. The PS II reaction center binds two β-carotene molecules, which have 11 conjugated double bonds each (18.Kobayashi M. Maeda H. Watanabe T. Nakane H. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 138-140Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19.Eijckelhoff C. Dekker J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 21-28Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is known that, as the number of double bonds of the polyene backbone increases, the wavelength maximum of the S2-S0 optical transition increases, and the molecule is easier to oxidize. Therefore, by decreasing the number of conjugated double bonds the carotenoid will be more difficult to oxidize, likely altering electron transfer through the secondary electron transfer pathway. There have been recent suggestions indicating that the reduction potential of P680+/P680 might be higher than previously thought (20.Rappaport F. Guergova-Kuras M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Lavergne J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8518-8527Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 21.Cuni A. Xiong L. Sayre R. Rappaport F. Lavergne J. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2004; 6: 4825-4831Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Replacing β-carotene with a carotenoid that is more difficult to oxidize would also test the oxidative capacity of P680+. Exchanging cofactors in proteins has been demonstrated for many systems and has been useful in determining energy differences between redox cofactors. Extraction of carotenoids from PS II reaction centers has been demonstrated (22.Tomo T. Mimuro M. Iwaki M. Kobayashi M. Itoh S. Satoh K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 21-30Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, this extraction requires harsh conditions, resulting in the loss of Chl molecules. Reconstitution of carotenoids into solvent-extracted PS II and into carotenoid-less bacterial reaction centers has, however, been reported (23.Cox R.P. Bendall D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 347: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24.Agalidis I. Lutz M. Reiss-Husson F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 589: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25.Farhoosh R. Chynwat V. Gebhard R. Lugtenburg J. Frank H.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 66: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A more gentle approach to this problem is to alter the carotenoid composition of PS II by changing the types of carotenoids available in vivo to be incorporated into the pigment-protein complex. As in green algae (26.Trebst A. Depka B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we have found that cyanobacteria grown in the presence of carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitors do not assemble PS II, even in the presence of carotenoid supplements, presumably because the cells are unable to take up carotenoids from the growth medium. Therefore, this is not a viable method to replace β-carotene in PS II with another carotenoid. We show here that we can produce carotenoids that are not native to Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by modifying the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of this organism. We have learned what types of carotenoids can be incorporated into PS II. We have found that gene deletions that block β-carotene formation do not result in PS II formation (27.Bautista J.A. Rappaport F. Guergova-Kuras M. Cohen R.O. Golbeck J.H. Wang J.Y. Béal D. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20030-20041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, expressing phytoene desaturase from Rhodobacter capsulatus in Synechocystis in place of the endogenous ζ-carotene and phytoene desaturases, results in the accumulation of carotenoids that can be incorporated into PS II. In this way, PS II core complexes from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 can be genetically modified to produce carotenoids with fewer than 11 conjugated double bonds. Herein, we report the construction of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 carotenoid mutants and characterization of PS II core complexes from the carotenoid mutant cells. Using low temperature visible and near-IR spectroscopy to detect the formation of new carotenoid radical cation species, we measure the formation and decay of the carotenoid and chlorophyll radical cations to probe the sequence of electron transfer steps in the secondary electron transfer pathway. Overall, these experiments provide new insight into the role of carotenoids in the secondary electron transfer pathways and assembly of PS II. Deletion Mutants—The genes for phytoene desaturase (pds) and ζ-carotene desaturase (zds) were deleted separately in the genome of the wild type (WT) Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and replaced by a kanamycin resistance cassette. A PCR copy of the gene to be deleted (zds or pds) that included 500 bases upstream and downstream of the gene was ligated onto a pGEM-T plasmid vector (Promega A1360) using T4 DNA ligase and amplified in XL1-Blue Escherichia coli-competent cells (Stratagene 200249). These plasmids were named pA-zdsSyn or pB-pdsSyn, respectively. The 500 bases flanking each gene together with the ligated pGEM-T plasmid vector between them were copied by PCR using primers designed to give unique restriction enzyme sites to the termini of the PCR product. The PCR product was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and then ligated using T4 DNA ligase to a kanamycin resistance cassette with the same sticky ends as the PCR product. The final plasmid construct was then amplified in XL1-Blue E. coli-competent cells and used to transform the WT Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strain. Single Replacement Mutant (Pdscap1)—The zds gene in the Synechocystis WT His tag strain (28.Lakshmi K.V. Reifler M.J. Chisholm D.A. Wang J.Y. Diner B.A. Brudvig G.W. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 72: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) encodes ζ-carotene desaturase (Zds), which converts ζ-carotene to lycopene, converted in turn by lycopene cyclase to β-carotene. This gene was replaced by the crtI gene of R. capsulatus, which encodes a phytoene desaturase, which converts phytoene to neurosporene, converted in turn by lycopene cyclase to β-zeacarotene (see below). This gene replacement should result (Fig. 2) in the loss of β-carotene expression with 11-double bonds and its replacement by β-zeacarotene with 9 conjugated double bonds. Plasmid pA-zdsSyn above was copied by PCR, excluding the zds gene using primers that gave unique restriction sites to the termini of the PCR product. The primers introduced a KpnI site in place of the gene ATG start codon and a XbaI site in place of the TAA stop codon. This PCR product was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and then ligated to PCR-amplified R. capsulatus crtI designed with the same sticky ends as the PCR product. The R. capsulatus crtI was derived from plasmid pGABX2 (29.Schmidt A. Sandmann G. Armstrong G.A. Hearst J.E. Boeger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The primers introduced a KpnI site 100 bases upstream of the NCBI designated start codon for this gene and an XbaI site 24 bases downstream of the TGA stop codon. Following ligation, the new plasmid, called pA-crtIRhod, was then amplified in XL1-Blue E. coli-competent cells and digested with XbaI, which gave a single cut. A streptomycin resistance cassette with XbaI sticky ends was ligated into the cut plasmid using T4 DNA ligase. The final plasmid construct was then amplified in XL1-Blue E. coli-competent cells and used to transform the WT Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 His tag strain. Double Replacement Mutant (Pdscap2)—To more completely channel the conversion of phytoene to β-zeacarotene, the endogenous Synechocystis pds gene, still present in the single replacement mutant was also replaced with the R. capsulatus crtI gene. Plasmid pB-pdsSyn containing the Synechocystis pds gene was copied by PCR, excluding the pds gene, using primers that gave unique restriction sites to the termini of the PCR product. The primers introduced a KpnI site in place of the gene ATG start codon and an XbaI site in place of the TAA stop codon. This PCR product was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and then ligated to PCR-amplified R. capsulatus crtI as described above to give plasmid pB-crtIRhod. This plasmid was amplified in XL1-Blue E. coli-competent cells and digested with XbaI, which gave a single cut. A kanamycin resistance cassette with XbaI sticky ends was ligated into the cut plasmid using T4 DNA ligase. The final plasmid construct was then amplified in XL1-Blue E. coli-competent cells and used to transform Pdscap1. This gave a double replacement mutant with two copies of the R. capsulatus crtI gene. Transformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 WT (His-tagged) 4His-tagged PS II refers to the presence of a hepahistidine tag located at the C terminus of CP47 (28.Lakshmi K.V. Reifler M.J.

Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Successful transformants were selected on Petri plates containing BG-11 plus 5 mm glucose with 50 μg/ml kanamycin or 100 μg/ml streptomycin and grown in very dim light (∼0.1 μmol of photons m-2 s-1) at 30 °C. Antibiotic-resistant colonies representing successful transformants were replated seven times in BG-11 plus 5 mm glucose plates with 200 μg/ml kanamycin, for the deletion mutants or 100 μg/ml streptomycin, for the single replacement mutant, to obtain full segregation. Deletion mutations and single replacement mutation were confirmed by extracting total pigments from the cells and analyzing for the complete absence of β-carotene by HPLC. The cells were also unable to produce β-carotene under nonselective conditions (without kanamycin or streptomycin) indicating complete segregation. For the double replacement mutant, the fully segregated single replacement strain was subjected to another round of transformation, this time using plasmid pB-crtIRhod with a kanamycin resistance cassette ligated 5 bases after the stop codon of R. capsulatus crtI. The transformation procedure was the same as above except that incubation of the fully segregated single replacement strain with the plasmid construct was done in dim light (∼0.1 μmol photons m-2s-1). Wild-type Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were grown in liquid BG-11 plus 5 mm glucose medium as described (31.Rögner M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Tang X.S. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4594-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 33.Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar). The mutants were grown in BG-11 with 5 mm glucose in very dim light (∼1 μmol of photons m-2 s-1). Isolation of the thylakoid membranes from these cells was performed as previously described (31.Rögner M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Tang X.S. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4594-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The thylakoid membranes were suspended at a concentration of 1 mg/ml chlorophyll in Buffer A (25% glycerol, 20 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm MES, pH 6.0). After addition of a one-eighth volume of 10% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (β-DM), the suspension was stirred for 20 min and then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in a 45-Ti rotor (Beckman-Coulter) for 10 min. The supernatant was then loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acidagarose resin of ∼40 ml pre-equilibrated with Buffer B (Buffer A containing 0.03% β-DM) in a fritted column. The mixture was made 5 mm in imidazole by adding appropriate volumes of a 2 m imidazole stock solution and nutated in the dark at 4 °C for 30 min. Afterward, the column was drained and washed with 700 ml of Buffer C (Buffer A containing 0.1% β-DM and 5 mm imidazole). His-tagged PS II was eluted with 160 ml of buffer D (Buffer B containing 100 mm imidazole). The eluant containing PS II was made 1 mm in EDTA and concentrated in a Millipore concentrator utilizing a YM 100 Diaflo ultrafiltration membrane. The concentrated sample was then desalted by passing it through a gel filtration column (Econo-Pac 10 DG, Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with Buffer B then further concentrated in an Amicon Ultra-4 concentrator (Millipore) with a 100,000 molecular weight cutoff. The samples were then frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C until use. PS II core complexes were manganese-depleted for low temperature near-IR measurements. The complexes in Buffer B were diluted 1:1 with Buffer B containing 10 mm hydroxylamine and 2 mm EDTA, and incubated in the dark for 30 min. The samples were transferred to an Amicon Ultra-4 concentrator (Millipore) with a 100,000 molecular weight cutoff filter and centrifuged at 5,000 × g to reduce the volume to ∼100 μl. The sample was diluted twice to a volume of 4 ml with Buffer B containing 2 mm EDTA and concentrated to 100 μl. The Mn2+-depleted sample was diluted and mixed with glycerol and Buffer B to a final concentration of 63% glycerol, 20 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.03% β-DM, and 50 mm MES, pH 6.0. The chlorophyll content of the cells was determined by extraction with 100% methanol and using the 79.24 ml/mg extinction coefficient of Lichtenthaler (34.Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9154) Google Scholar) at 665 nm. For total pigment analysis, PS II core complexes were extracted with a 50:50 acetone/methanol mixture under dim light. The mixture was centrifuged for 2 min (10,000 × g), and a 50-μl aliquot of the supernatant was immediately filtered (0.45 μm, Millex-LH polytetrafluoroethylene) and injected onto a reverse-phase HPLC column (Zorbax-ODS, 4.6 mm × 15 cm, Rockland Technologies) equilibrated with methanol:ethyl acetate (68:32, v/v). The separation was performed in isocratic mode using the same solvent system (35.Giorgi L.B. Nixon P.J. Merry S.A. Joseph D.M. Durrant J.R. De Las Rivas J. Barber J. Porter G. Klug D.R. J. Biol.

The relative chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations were determined by measuring the area of their respective peaks in the HPLC chromatogram and dividing by the extinction coefficients according to Giorgi et al. (35.Giorgi L.B. Nixon P.J. Merry S.A. Joseph D.M. Durrant J.R. De Las Rivas J. Barber J. Porter G. Klug D.R. J. Biol.

Birkhauser, Basel1995: 13-62Google Scholar). The eluted carotenoids were identified by their absorbance spectra using the diode array detector of the HPLC (Agilent Series 1100) and by their mobility using β-carotene and zeaxanthin standards. PS II core complexes were diluted to ∼10 μm Chl in a buffer containing 20 mm MES/NaOH (pH 6.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.02% β-DM, 2 mm ferricyanide, and 65% glycerol. The sample (1.5. ml) was placed in a plastic cuvette with a 1-cm path length, inserted into a liquid nitrogen bath cryostat (DN 1704 from Oxford), and dark-adapted. The cryostat was then cooled to 77 K with liquid nitrogen and centered in the measuring beam of a Cary 1E UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) using a home-built cryostat holder. Spectra were recorded with data intervals of 0.1 nm, a scan speed of 60 nm/min, and a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm. The difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the absorbance spectrum in the dark-adapted state from those measured after 2-min illumination of the sample with continuous white light from a 200-watt halogen lamp. PS II core complex samples were prepared in a buffer containing 63% glycerol, 20 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm MES (pH 6.0) and transferred to a plastic cuvette (Sigma) with a path length of 1 cm. The samples were treated with 100 μm potassium ferricyanide to oxidize Cyt b559, dark-adapted for 1 h, slowly frozen in a liquid nitrogen bath, and transferred to an Oxford Optistat cryostat mounted in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences λ-20 spectrophotometer. All experiments were performed on samples equilibrated at the specified temperature inside the Optistat for at least 1 h or until the baseline was stable. Samples were illuminated by a specified number of flashes at 532 nm from the second harmonic of an Nd:YAG Q-switched laser LAB-150-10 (Spectra-Physics) operating at 10 Hz. A beam splitter was used to vary the laser power delivered to the sample. A 1064 nm filter was also used to further reduce the level of first harmonic present in the laser beam. Typically, the flash energy was 150-180 mJ per pulse. The laser was coupled to the cryostat by a fiber optic cable (Schott-Fostec). Illumination of the sample by a series of pulses was achieved by manually triggering the laser Q-switch every 2-5 s, as specified below. In some cases, the laser Q-switch was triggered by a home-built laser controller device. The device is a counter that detects a transistor-transistor logic pulse from the laser indicating that the flash lamp has fired. After the specified number of flashes (or time since the laser operates at 10 Hz), the laser controller device triggers the Q-switch electronically. The total number of flashes and repetition rate (<10 Hz) can be specified by binary i"
https://openalex.org/W2147001533,"Exposure of cardiac myocytes to anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) increases myocyte oxidant stress and converts the myocytes to a proinflammatory phenotype. These oxidant-induced effects are prevented by pretreatment of the myocytes with an oxidant stress (A/R or H2O2) 24 h earlier (oxidant tolerance). Although NF-kappaB and AP-1 (nuclear signaling) and Mn-SOD and eNOS (effector enzymes) have been implicated in the development oxidant tolerance, the precise relationship between the nuclear transcription factors and the effector enzymes in the development of oxidant tolerance has not been defined. Herein, we show that an initial A/R challenge results in nuclear accumulation of both NF-kappaB and AP-1 (EMSA). In addition, blockade of nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB (SN50) or AP-1 (decoy oligonucleotide) prevents the development of oxidant tolerance, i.e., the second A/R challenge produces the same quantitative effects as the initial A/R challenge. In this model, nuclear translocation of both NF-kappaB and AP-1 is required for induction of Mn-SOD, while nuclear translocation of AP-1, but not NF-kappaB, is a prerequisite for induction of eNOS. Collectively, our findings indicate that NF-kappaB and AP-1 work in concert to ensure the induction eNOS and Mn-SOD, which in turn are important for the development of oxidant tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1972972536,"The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene product is a tumor suppressor that is mutated or inactivated in many types of human cancers. Although Rb is known to be an upstream negative regulator of Abl protein tyrosine kinase, we propose here that Rb also functions as a downstream effector of Abl that plays a positive role in survival of Abl-dependent human tumor cells, including Bcr/Abl-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We show that Rb is constitutively phosphorylated at tyrosine in Abl-dependent tumor cells, and that Abl phosphorylates Rb specifically at Y805 within the C-terminal domain of the molecule. We also show that ectopic expression of Rb induces apoptosis in Abl-dependent tumor cells by inhibiting the Abl tyrosine kinase activity, and that Rb-induced apoptosis is compromised by Abl-catalysed phosphorylation of Rb at Y805. Furthermore, the silencing of endogenous Rb by RNA interference induced apoptosis in Abl-dependent tumor cells. Thus, our findings suggest that Abl-catalysed tyrosine phosphorylation of Rb is necessary for survival of Abl-dependent human tumor cells, and raises the possibility that this phosphorylated Rb can be a molecular target for cancer therapy aimed at inducing apoptosis of Abl-dependent tumor cells, such as Bcr/Abl-positive CML."

In this study, we determined whether or not there were other important elements and binding proteins for basal CTα transcription in the Pcyt1a promoter, and if other Ets family proteins bind to the Ets-1-binding site. The results indicate the formation of a ternary complex with Ets-1 binding at -49/-47 and Sp1 binding at -58/-54 of the Pcyt1a promoter that is important for activating CTα transcription. When nuclear extracts of COS-7 cells expressing various Ets family repressors were incubated with DNA probes, binding of Net to the probes was observed. Net dose-dependently depressed the promoter-luciferase activity by 98%, even when co-expressed with Ets-1. RNA interference targeting Net caused an increase of endogenous CTα mRNA. After synchronizing the cell cycle in NIH3T3 cells, CTα mRNA increased at the S-M phase corresponding to an increase of Ets-1 mRNA and a decrease of Net mRNA.

Three Sp1-binding core elements, -139/-136, -67/-62, and -19/-14, have been identified, and they are involved in basal, activator, and suppressor activities. Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 can competitively bind to these elements and regulate the expression of the CTα gene (20Bakovic M. Waite K. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were stably transfected with a cDNA encoding Ras, there was increased binding of Sp3 to the -67/-62 region. Thus, Sp3 is an important factor for CTα expression in these fibroblasts (25Bakovic M. Waite K. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported that the murine CTα gene promoter is positively regulated by an enhancer element (Eb) located between -103 and -83 bp, and there was a protein bound to Eb in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells. We identified TEF-4 as that binding protein (21Sugimoto H. Bakovic M. Yamashita S. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12338-12344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It was interesting that TEF-4 enhanced the basal transcription of CTα in COS-7 cells by interactions with elements shorter than -71 that do not contain TEF-4-binding site. When we determined the main transcriptional region involved in basal CTα transcription, Ets-binding core element -49/-47 (EBS) was identified as the binding site of Ets-1, and its stimulating activity was enhanced by TEF-4 (22Sugimoto H. Sugimoto S. Tatei K. Obinata H. Bakovic M. Izumi T. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19716-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined whether or not there were other important elements and binding proteins for basal CTα transcription, and whether other Ets family proteins bind to the EBS. We identified a newly recognized important site for basal CTα transcription located at -58/-54, which was clarified as an additional binding site for Sp1. We demonstrate that that Sp1 binding at -58/-54 interacts with Ets-1 binding at the EBS and promotes CTα transcription. We also identify Net, an Ets-related protein, as a potent inhibitor of CTα transcription. Materials—The luciferase vector pGL3-basic that contains the cDNA for Photinus pyraris luciferase, the control pRL-CMV or pRL-TK vector that contains the cDNA for Renilla reniformis luciferase, and the dual-luciferase reporter assay system were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). FuGENE 6™ transfection reagents, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (high glucose), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Roche Applied Science, Sigma, and Invitrogen, respectively. COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan).

The mouse full-length cDNAs coding murine Elk-1, Net, ERF, Fli-1, and Tel were obtained through PCR of a reverse-transcribed product of mRNA from NIH3T3 cells using Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with the complementary primers, 5′-CTAGTGATGGACCCATCTGTGACGC-3′ and 5′-TGGCTTCTGGGGCCCTGGGGAGAGC-3′ for Elk-1; 5′-CTGGGTATGGAGAGTGCAATCACGC-3′ and 5′-GGATTTCTGAGAGCTGGGGGACAGC-3′ for Net; 5′-CCCAGCATGAAGACCCCGGCGGACAC-3′ and 5′-GGAATCTCGGTGCTCCAGGGAGAGTTG-3′ for ERF; 5′-GGCCAAATGGACGGGACTATTAAGG-3′ and 5′-GTAGTAGCTGCCTAAGTGTGAAGGC-3′ for Fli-1; and 5′-GTGAGACATGTCTGAGACTCCTGCTC-3′ and 5′-TTCCCGGGTCTCTTCCTTTACAGCC-3′ for Tel with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase high fidelity (Invitrogen). The 1.25-1.66-kb PCR products were cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5 (Invitrogen) in-frame with a V5 tag. The expression constructs were named as pcEts-1, pcElk-1, pcNet, pcERF, pcFli-1, and pcTel, and the sequences were confirmed. cDNA encoding Sp1 (pcSp1) was kindly obtained from Dr. Norman Wong, University of Calgary. A construct (pcNetm1) for a mutated Net (Netm1), in which two lysine residues (Lys-49 and Lys-51 in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of Net) were replaced with asparagine residues, was created from pcNet by PCR using QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the complementary primer 5′-GGCCTCCGCAACAACAACACCAACATGAAC-3′. The cDNAs in pcNet and pcNetm1 were subcloned into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) to fuse the recombinant proteins at the C terminus of GFP, and the resultant expression vectors were named pEGFP-Net (for the expression of GFP-Net) and pEGFP-Netm1 (for GFP-Netm1), respectively.

Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To prepare mutated promoters, GGCGG (-58/-54) was mutated to AACAA and named LUC.mC7-c or LUC.mD1.5-c, TCC (-49/-47) was converted to AAA and named LUC.mC7-b or LUC.mD1.5-b, and both GGCGG (-58/-54) and TCC (-49/-47) were changed to AACAA and AAA, respectively, and named LUC.mC7-cb or LUC.mD1.5-cb. These mutations were created from LUC.C7 or LUC.D1.5 by PCR using QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kits. The mutated complementary primers were used for making each mutated construct, and the resulting plasmids were used for transformation of Escherichia coli strain JM109 cells. The sequences of all deleted and mutated constructs were confirmed. Tissue Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assays—COS-7 or NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (2.5 × 105) were plated on 60-mm plates (Discovery Labware) and grown overnight. Seven and a half μl of FuGENE 6™ was suspended in 250 μl of serum-free medium and mixed with 0.125, 0.4, or 1.25 μg of pcEts-1, pcNet, pcERF, pcFli-1, pcTel, or pcDNA for preparation of nuclear extracts to perform gel-shift analyses, immunoblot analysis, or total mRNA for RT-PCR. For luciferase assays, cells (1 × 105) were plated on 35-mm plates and grown overnight. Three μl of FuGENE 6™ was suspended in 100 μl of serum-free medium and mixed with 0.5 μg of the CTα promoter-luciferase constructs (see above), 0.001 μg of pRL-CMV or pRL-TK Renilla vector as a transfection control, and 0.005-0.5 μg of either pcEts-1, pcSp1, pcElk-1, pcNet, pcERF, pcFli-1, pcTel, pcNetm1, or pcDNA. Transfection was initiated by dropwise addition of DNA suspension to the cell culture. Twenty four or 48 h later, cells were harvested and lysed in 200 μl of Passive lysis buffer (Promega), and 5 μl of the cell lysate was used for the dual-luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by using the ratio of the activities obtained with the CTα promoter mutated or deletion constructs (see above) and the pRL-CMV or pRL-TK construct carrying the cytomegalovirus or thymidine kinase promoter-luciferase fusion. When the effects of Sp1 on CTα promoter were examined, luciferase values were normalized against total protein concentration determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad) as the Renilla luciferase activity was affected by the transfection of pcSp1. Synchronization of the Cell Cycle—NIH3T3 cells (1 × 105) were plated on 60-mm plates and grown overnight. Twenty four h later, DMEM with 10% FBS was changed to DMEM with 0.5% FBS. After 3 days of serum starvation, the medium was changed to DMEM with 10% FBS. To analyze the phase of the cell cycle at the indicated time after 10% FBS supplementation, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and then stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). After cells were stained, flow cytometric analysis was performed using Epics XL (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). To analyze the cellular localization of Net, transfection was initiated by dropwise addition of pEGFP, pEGFP-Net, or pEGFP-Netm1 (0.5 μg) and FuGENE 6™ suspension to the cell culture 2 h after 10% FBS supplementation. Twenty four h after transfection, GFP images were obtained with a Leica DM IRBE fluorescent microscopy (Leica microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with a filter set for GFP. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electromobility Gel-shift Assays—COS-7 cells were cultured and transfected with plasmids as described above. After 48 h, nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells were prepared according to Andrews and Faller (27Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (19Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Five hundred pmol of the opposite strands of pS (5′-GGGCGGGCGGGAGGCGGGACTTCCGGTCC-3′), pmS-c (5′-GGGCGGGCGGGAaacaaGACTTCCGGTCC-3′), pmS-b (5′-GGGCGGGCGGGAGGCGGGACTaaaGGTCC-3′), pE (5′-GGCGGGAGGCGGGACTTCCGGTCCGCAGTC-3′), pmE-c (5′-GGCGGGAaacaaGACTTCCGGTCCGCAGTC-3′), pmE-b (5′-GGCGGGAGGCGGGACTaaaGGTCCGCAGTC-3′), and pmE-cb (5′-GGCGGGAaacaaGACTaaaGGTCCGCAGTC-3′) were annealed (70 °C, 10 min) in 100 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm NaCl and then cooled to room temperature. An aliquot (10 pmol) of the double-stranded oligonucleotides was 5′-end-labeled with [32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on a Sephadex G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). A DNA protein-binding reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature in 40 μl of 1× binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), 1 μl of the radiolabeled probe (50,000-80,000 cpm), and nuclear extracts of COS-7 cells. In some cases, unlabeled double-stranded pS (100-fold molar excess), anti-Ets-1/-2 antibody, anti-Sp1 antibody, anti-NF-κB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) was included in the incubation mixture. The labeled probe was separated from DNA-protein complexes by electrophoresis on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in Tris borate/EDTA buffer (44.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 44.5 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C until the xylene cyanol dye reached 5 cm from the bottom of the gel. Autoradiography was performed by exposure of the gel to an imaging plate for 15-30 min, and the images were analyzed by Fuji BAS-2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). RNAi Analysis—dsRNAs named Random (5′-CGAUUCGCUAGACCGGCUUCAUUGC-3′) as a control and Net-878 (5′-GCAAAAAACCCAAAGGCUUGGAAAU-3′) from 878 to 903 nucleotide sequence from ATG of Net cDNA were obtained. NIH3T3 cells (1 × 105) were plated on 35-mm dishes, and medium was changed to 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) after 24 h. Five μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) was suspended in 250 μl of Opti-MEM and then mixed with 100 pmol of dsRNA. Transfection was initiated by dropwise addition of dsRNA suspension to the cell culture to a final concentration of 50 nm in the medium. Opti-MEM containing 30% FBS (625 μl) was added to the medium 4 h later, and total RNA was obtained after 24, 48, and 72 h. RT-PCR—COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells were cultured and transfected as described above. After cells were cultured for the indicated times, total RNA was obtained with RNA extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantification of the amounts of mRNA of CTα, Ets-1, Net, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) in COS-7 or NIH3T3 cells, 0.5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed at 50 °C for 30 min and then subjected to 31 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) using one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (MJ Research, MA). The primers used for CTα were 5′-ATGCACAGTGTTCAGCCAA-3′ for COS-7 cells or 5′-ATGCACAGAGTTCAGCTAAAG-3′ for NIH3T3 cells (sense) and 5′-GGGCTTACTAAAGTCAACTTCAA-3′ (antisense), and they produced an ∼200-bp CTα fragment. The primers of RT-PCR analysis for Ets-1 were 5′-GGCACCATGAAGGCGGCCGTCGATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTCTTTGGGGATTCCCAGTCG-3′ (antisense), for Net were 5′-GTACACAAACTTCTGCCCGATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGGGTATGGAGAGTGCAATCACGC-3′ (antisense), and for G3PDH were 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (antisense). The contents of CTα, Ets-1, or Net mRNAs were normalized to those of the G3PDH mRNA using DNA Engine Opticon 2 system. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as means ± S.D. Group means were compared by Student's t test or Cochran-Cox test after analysis of variance to determine the significance of difference between the individual means. Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. Gel-shift Analysis of Nuclear Extracts of COS-7 Cells with pS and pE Promoter Elements—As we reported before (21Sugimoto H. Bakovic M. Yamashita S.

When we searched the CTα promoter region using the TRANSFAC transcription factor data base, several consensus elements for the binding sites of transcription factors were identified (22Sugimoto H. Sugimoto S. Tatei K. Obinata H. Bakovic M. Izumi T. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19716-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Sp1 was suggested to bind to -62/-50 regions (Fig. 1A), and NF-κB was also suggested to bind to -55/-46. To test whether or not there were other proteins that bind to the Pcyt1a promoter elements from -70 to -36 in nuclear extracts, we prepared pS (-70/-42) and pE (-65/-36) probes (Fig. 1, B and C). After transfection with pcEts-1 into COS-7 cells for 48 h, nuclear extracts of COS-7 cells were incubated with pS. There were slow moving bands indicated by arrow b as shown in Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2. The band disappeared when Sp1 binding consensus GGCGG (-58/-54) was mutated to AACAA as in pmS-c (Fig. 1B, lanes 9 and 10). To confirm what kind of nuclear proteins bind to pS, nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-Sp1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6) or anti-NF-κB (lanes 7 and 8). After incubation with anti-Sp1, the band intensity was much decreased (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6), and supershifts indicated by arrow a appeared in Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6. However, when nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-NF-κB (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8), the intensity of the band did not change compared with lanes 1 and 2, respectively. These results indicated that the promoter element from -58 to -54 is an important site for Sp1 binding. When nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-Sp1, the upper slow moving band indicated in Fig. 1B, arrow b, clearly decreased its density, and weak supershifts indicated by arrow a were detected in lanes 5 and 6. Therefore, the anti-Sp1 antibody was thought to have two effects on Sp1 binding to the DNA probe: inhibition of binding and formation of a larger complex detected as a super gel-shift. When EBS core element (-49/-47) was mutated to AAA as in pmS-b, the intensity of the bands for Sp1 binding did not change in Fig. 1B, lanes 11 and 12, compared with lanes 1 and 2, respectively. Therefore, the pS element is sufficient for Sp1 binding, and EBS (-49/-47) is not necessary for direct Sp1 binding to pS. After transfection with pcEts-1 into COS-7 cells for 48 h, nuclear extracts were prepared and incubated with the pE probe. There were slow moving bands indicated by arrow a in Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2, and the band intensities of the DNA-protein complexes were increased after transfection of pcEts-1. There were faster moving bands indicated by arrow b after pcEts-1 transfection in Fig. 1C, lanes 2, 4, and 6. The intensity of both upper and lower bands was clearly decreased after incubation of nuclear extracts with anti-Sp1, and weak shifts indicated by arrows c and d in Fig. 1C were recognized in lanes 3 and 4, respectively. After incubation of nuclear extracts with anti-Ets-1/2, the intensities of both upper and lower bands were also decreased (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6 compared with lanes 1 and 2, respectively). These results indicate that the upper and lower bands indicated by arrows a and b in Fig. 1C consist of DNA-protein complexes of Ets-1, Sp1, and pE DNA probe with or without other protein(s), respectively. To confirm the binding elements for Ets-1 and Sp1 in pE, we prepared three mutated probes, pmE-c mutated at Sp1-binding consensus core (-58/-54) (Fig. 2B, lanes 3-10), pmE-b mutated at EBS core element (-49/-47) (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8), and pmE-cb mutated at both sites (Fig. 1C, lanes 9 and 10). As shown in Fig. 1C, when nuclear extracts were incubated with pmE-b, the slow moving bands in lanes 7 and 8 indicated by arrow e were weaker than the band at the same position in lanes 1 and 2. When nuclear extracts were incubated with pmE-cb, the slow moving bands in Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8, completely disappeared. These results indicate that both -58/-54 and -49/-47 elements are important for Ets-1 and Sp1 binding. Sp1 and Ets-1 Co-operatively Bind to pE—To confirm the above hypothesis, nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with pcEts-1 were incubated with anti-V5 antibody to recognize V5-tagged Ets-1. There was a fast moving band indicated by arrow b in lane 2, Fig. 2A. The supershift in Fig. 2A, lane 4, indicated by arrow c appeared after incubation with anti-V5 antibody, and the lower band in lane 2 disappeared. When anti-Sp1 antibody was incubated with nuclear extracts, two bands indicated by arrows a and b in Fig. 2A decreased their intensities, and a shift indicated by arrow d was newly recognized (lane 6). When both anti-Sp1 and anti-V5 antibodies were incubated with nuclear extracts, the slow moving band in Fig. 2A, lane 4 Fig. 2A indicated by arrow c and the fast moving band in lane 6 indicated by arrow d decreased (lane 8). These results strongly suggest that the faster moving band indicated from arrow d (Fig. 2A, lane 6) is the complex of Ets-1 and pE DNA probe, and these results strengthen the possibility that the faster moving band indicated by arrow b (lane 2) is the ternary complex of Ets-1, Sp1, and pE DNA p"

To investigate the role of PLZF in the regulation of cytoadhesion molecules involved in the mobilization of hemopoietic cells, we have analysed PLZF and very late antigen 4 (VLA-4) expression in normal and leukemic cells. In hematopoiesis, we found a negative correlation between PLZF and VLA-4 expression, except for the megakaryocytic lineage. In contrast, we observed a positive correlation between PLZF and VLA-4 expression in a panel of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. In K562 cells expressing PLZF (K562-PLZF), we found that the expression of VLA-4 and c-kit was downmodulated. We have investigated the possibility for VLA-4 or the c-kit receptor to be direct target genes of PLZF in K562-PLZF cells and identified a PLZF DNA-binding site within the VLA-4 promoter. Furthermore, decrease in VLA-4 expression was associated with loss of adhesion on fibronectin-coated plates, which promotes drug-induced apoptosis of K562-PLZF cells. Our findings indicate that VLA-4 is a potential target gene of PLZF. However, in primary AMLs the control of PLZF on VLA-4 expression is lost. Altogether, we suggest that VLA-4 modulation by PLZF may represent an important step in the control of normal and leukemic cell mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W1965677291,"The process of clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation/disassembly involves numerous proteins that act cooperatively. Phosphorylation is an important regulatory mechanism governing protein interactions in CCVs, and many of the core and accessory proteins of the CCV machinery are reversibly phosphorylated in vivo. CK2 is highly enriched in CCVs and is capable of phosphorylating a number of peripheral membrane proteins involved in the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. At least some of these phosphorylation events have been shown to be inhibitory for CCV assembly, and CK2 has been shown to be inactive when associated with intact CCVs. Here we show that CCV membranes inhibit CK2 activity even after incubation in trypsin, indicating that a component of the lipid bilayer may be the inhibitory factor. Consistent with this, we showed that liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphates inhibit the activity of CK2 and that CK2 binds to those liposomes. Notably, liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), a component of CCVs, bind CK2 and inhibit its activity. Furthermore, we showed that the binding of CK2 to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes is via the active site of CK2, thus providing a molecular explanation for the inhibition of CK2 activity when it is bound to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes. Thus CK2 is inactive in CCVs because of the fact that it is bound to the CCV membrane via an interaction between PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the CCV membrane and the active site in CK2.

Several mechanisms are employed by eukaryotic cells for the internalization of material from their surroundings, one of these is clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). 2The abbreviations used are: CMEclathrin-mediated endocytosisCCVclathrin-coated vesiclePEphosphatidylethanolaminePCphosphatidylcholinePSphosphatidylserinePHpleckstrin homology. CME allows the internalization of nutrients, hormones, and other molecules from the plasma membrane into intracellular compartments. It occurs via a process of plasma membrane invagination and vesicle internalization that involves the formation of a clathrin coat on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. The coat consists of a lattice of clathrin triskelia, polymers of three clathrin heavy chains, each of which is bound to one of two clathrin light chains (LCa and LCb). Receptors and their ligands are recruited into CCVs forming at the plasma membrane, a process that involves a range of accessory proteins, including a specific adaptor complex (AP-2) that has the bivalent capacity to interact with both clathrin and the cytosolic domains of receptors destined for internalization (reviewed in Ref. 1Brodsky F.M.

The assembly and disassembly of CCVs need to be well regulated and coherent processes if CME is to occur efficiently. Part of the mechanism by which these processes are regulated appears to involve protein phosphorylation; many of the core and accessory proteins of the CCV machinery are reversibly phosphorylated in vivo (e.g. see Refs. 2Korolchuk V.I. Banting G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Bar-Zvi D. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9614-9621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hao W. Luo Z.

However, although it is evident that phosphorylation is an important regulatory mechanism for CCV formation/disassembly, the exact role of the particular kinases involved remains unclear. Previously, it was shown that purified CCV fractions are highly enriched in the protein kinase CK2 and that CK2 is required for clathrin-dependent endocytosis (3Bar-Zvi D. Branton D. J. Biol.

CK2 is able to phosphorylate a number of endocytic proteins, including clathrin light chain, the α- and β2-subunits of the AP-2 adaptor complex, amphiphysin, dynamin, AP180, and synaptotagmin (2Korolchuk V.I.

As CK2 is thought to be a constitutively active protein kinase, there must be one or more potent mechanisms to inhibit the enzyme when required. In agreement with this, we have shown that CK2 is inactive on intact CCVs but active after the uncoating of CCVs (2Korolchuk V.I. Banting G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The inactivity of CK2 when associated with CCVs is because of inhibition by an unknown component of lipid membranes. Polyphosphoinositides play an important role in the process of CME. Different cellular membranes are characterized by specific sets of polyphosphoinositides, with PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 being of particular interest to those studying endocytosis. Their role is to recruit adaptor and accessory proteins to endocytic sites (reviewed in Refs. 11Simonsen A. Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin.

Similarly, other proteins essential for CME (AP-180, epsin, and dynamin) are recruited to the plasma membrane via an interaction between a specific protein domain (ANTH, ENTH, and PH, respectively) and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (16Brodin L.

The CCV-associated polyphosphoinositide 5′ phosphatase synaptojanin has been proposed to perform this role (19Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y.

Currently protein phosphorylation and phospholipid metabolism are viewed as two independent mechanisms regulating endocytosis. Here we show that CK2 binds to polyphosphoinositides and that this binding inhibits CK2 activity while CK2 is present in intact CCVs. Further, we show that this interaction occurs directly via the active site of CK2, thus providing a mechanism for inhibiting CK2 activity in an intact CCV. Reagents were from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. Anti-α- and -β-subunits of CK2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. hCK2 pT7-7 plasmid was kindly provided by Y-.S. Bae (Kyungpook National University, Taegu, Korea). Recombinant human CK2 was from Roche Applied Science. [γ32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Porcine brains were provided by Dr. M. Bailey (University of Bristol Veterinary School). diC16 phosphoinositides were from Cell Signals, Inc. Production of Recombinant Proteins—CK2 in pT7-7 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on heparin-Sepharose followed by chromatography on Mono-Q as described elsewhere (20Zandomeni R. Zandomeni M.C. Weinmann R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21Benetti P.H. Kim S.I. Chaillot D. Canonge M. Chardot T. Meunier J.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Mutants of CK2 were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and then expressed and purified as for the wild type CK2. Activity of purified proteins was determined in kinase assays using clathrin as a substrate, and recombinant human CK2 was used as a control. The fragment of CK2 β-subunit encompassing residues 51-110 was isolated from a rat liver cDNA library by reverse transcription-PCR. This fragment was then subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was expressed and purified using glutathione S-transferase binding resin (Novagen). Preparation of Clathrin-coated Vesicles and Stripped Proteins—Clathrin-coated vesicles were purified to homogeneity from porcine brains as previously described (2Korolchuk V.I. Banting G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CCVs were uncoated using 1 m Tris, pH 7.0, with subsequent centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Clathrin was purified from the supernatant fraction according to Ref. 22Pearse B.M. Robinson M.S. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1951-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar. Stripped membranes were resuspended in Tris-buffered saline to a final protein concentration of 1-2 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. Proteolytic Digest of Stripped Membranes—50 μl of stripped membranes were incubated with 0, 100, or 500 μg/ml trypsin for 30 or 60 min. After incubation, trypsin was inhibited by the addition of 200 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor, and membranes were separated from soluble protein by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgCl2 buffer. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—Liposomes containing single lipids (phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), or phosphatidylinositol) were prepared from dried lipid films by sonication three times for 10 s in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgCl2 buffer. In all other cases, liposomes were prepared by sonication as described above from mixtures of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylserine in equimolar ratio as a backbone lipid supplemented with 20-90% phosphatidylinositol, 20% of cholesterol, phosphatidic acid, or diacylglycerol or 10% of the relevant diC16 phosphoinositide. 5 μg of purified bovine clathrin were phosphorylated by 2 microunits of purified CK2 for 10 min at room temperature in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 7.4 MBq ml-1 [γ32P]ATP, and 25 μl of liposomes (final concentration of lipid was 1.1 mm) or stripped CCV membranes. The phosphorylation reaction was stopped by the addition of 12.5 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min and loaded on SDS-PAGE gels (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film. Liposome Binding Assay—Liposome binding assays were performed as described elsewhere (24Cozier G.E. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S. Kupzig S. Bottomley J.R. Millard T.H. Banting G. Cullen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28261-28268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In brief, lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylserine were supplemented with 10% of the relevant diC16 phosphoinositide prior to being dried, resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2 m sucrose, 20 mm KCl buffer, and sonicated 3 times for 10 s. The liposomes obtained were incubated with 250 ng of purified CK2 for 10 min at 30 °C and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, samples were blotted to nitrocellulose, and the presence of CK2 was detected by immunoblotting as described previously (2Korolchuk V.I. Banting G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—All analysis and modeling of CK2 was performed using the program package Swiss-PdbViewer. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) molecule was introduced into the relevant region of the CK2 structure with the 1-phosphate position (the phosphate where the rest of the PtdIns(4,5)P2 molecule is attached) pointing away from the bulk of the CK2 molecule toward the most likely position where the membrane would be if PtdIns(4,5)P2 bound in that site. The Ins(1,4,5)P3 molecule was then moved and rotated to best fit into the space available while allowing potential interactions with nearby basic residues (Arg, Lys, and His). The aim of this modeling is only to show there is sufficient space for the Ins(1,4,5)P3 molecule and that there are potential basic residues nearby that could provide interactions with the Ins(1,4,5)P3. The structure of the CK2 molecule was not altered in any way to allow space for the Ins(1,4,5)P3 or to orientate any of the nearby basic residues into positions where they could make possible interactions with the Ins(1,4,5)P3. If the Ins(1,4,5)P3 did bind into either of these binding sites, it would be expected that the CK2 molecule would undergo at least some conformational changes to give the best shape of the binding site and to maximize any interactions with the Ins(1,4,5)P3. Residues chosen for site-directed mutagenesis were based on being localized and orientated to point in or nearby to the position of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in the model structure. Which Component of CCV Membranes Inhibits CK2 Activity?—Previously we have shown that CK2 is not active when associated with CCVs and that it could be inhibited by CCV-derived membranes (2Korolchuk V.I. Banting G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have already shown that heat treatment (70 °C for 15 min) of CCV membranes does not abolish their ability to inhibit CK2 activity (2Korolchuk V.I. Banting G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that the inhibitory factor was unlikely to be a protein component of the CCV membrane. Consistent with this, we found that incubation of CCV membranes in the presence of trypsin failed to abolish the ability of those membranes to inhibit CK2 activity (Fig. 1A). CCV membranes were stripped of peripheral membrane proteins by incubation in 1 m Tris-HCl and then treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin for different times. Membranes were then separated from soluble proteins by centrifugation, part of each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the density of bands corresponding to Coomassie-stained proteins was measured. Another part of each membrane fraction was used for the inhibition of clathrin light chain phosphorylation by CK2 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The amount of phosphorylated clathrin light chain (determined densitometrically) was compared with the amount of protein present in the membrane fraction (as described above). We observed that untreated membranes inhibited phosphorylation of clathrin by up to 60%. This degree of inhibition was not significantly changed when membranes were trypsinized and the amount of protein in them was reduced by up to 80%. These data argue against the possibility that the protein component of CCV membranes inhibits CK2 activity. A complex mixture of different lipids remains after trypsin cleavage of the proteins in CCV membranes. To determine which lipids might be able to inhibit CK2 activity, we initially screened simple liposomes (of single lipid composition) for their ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of clathrin light chain by CK2. Of those lipids initially tested, only phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) inhibited the activity of CK2 (Fig. 1B). Liposomes composed of other phospholipids (i.e. PE, PC, or PS) did not have any effect on CK2 activity (Fig. 1B). Incorporation of cholesterol, phosphatidic acid, or diacylglycerol into “backbone liposomes” composed of equimolar amounts of PE, PC, and PS failed to affect the activity of CK2 (data not shown). However, the presence in backbone liposomes of PtdIns was able to inhibit CK2 activity but only when it was present at high concentrations (data not shown). This suggested that PtdIns is unlikely to be a physiologically relevant membrane-bound inhibitor of CK2 but did suggest that higher phosphorylated forms of PtdIns might be worthy of investigation in this regard. Polyphosphoinositides Inhibit and Bind CK2—To test whether polyphosphoinositides can bind and inhibit CK2, we performed kinase assays (using clathrin light chain as substrate for CK2) in the presence of liposomes of different composition. The liposomes consisted of the PE:PC:PS backbone mix alone or that mix including different polyphosphoinositides at 10% of the total lipid concentration. Although PE:PC:PS liposomes alone did not have any effect on CK2 activity (data not shown), all of those containing polyphosphoinositides inhibited the activity of CK2, although to different extents (Fig. 2). The most efficient inhibition was observed by PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (<20% of initial activity). PtdIns(4,5)P2 is known to be an important anchoring molecule in biological membranes, and it is of note that it mediates the attachment of numerous peripheral membrane proteins involved in CME to the cytosolic face of plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 25Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was tempting to speculate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 could also anchor CK2 to the plasma membrane and at the same time render it inactive prior to inclusion in CCVs. Indeed, liposome binding experiments demonstrated that CK2 binds to liposomes containing polyphosphoinositides. Moreover there is some correlation between binding and the inhibitory activity of those polyphosphoinositides (Fig. 3). However, it is probable that binding of CK2 to cellular membranes is not solely mediated by the interaction with PtdIns(4,5)P2, because others have shown that protein-protein interactions are also likely to play a role (26Sarrouilhe D. Filhol O. Leroy D. Bonello G. Baudry M. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This would explain why we were unable to see any effect on the amount of CK2 associated with cellular membranes when PtdIns(4,5)P2-protein interactions were blocked with neomycin or competed by overexpression of the PLCδ-PH domain. 3V. I. Korolchuk, G. Cozier, and G. Banting, unpublished observations. Identification of a Polyphosphoinositide Binding Site on CK2—As CK2 does not contain any known specialized PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding domain, it was pertinent to determine the molecular mechanism by which CK2 interacts with polyphosphoinositides. The current view is that CK2 binds to lipid membranes via the acidic loop of its β-subunit, in particular through the region encompassing amino acid residues 51-110 (26Sarrouilhe D. Filhol O. Leroy D. Bonello G. Baudry M. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Leroy D. Filhol O. Quintaine N. Sarrouilhe D. Loue-Mackenbach P. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 191: 43-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is unlikely that this acidic region could mediate interaction with the negatively charged head groups of polyphosphoinositides, we generated a construct encoding this sequence fused to glutathione S-transferase. As might be expected, the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein neither bound to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes nor prevented binding of purified CK2 to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes (data not shown). Moreover, in contrast to others (27Leroy D. Filhol O. Quintaine N. Sarrouilhe D. Loue-Mackenbach P. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 191: 43-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we were unable to release CK2 from isolated membranes using this fusion protein. The crystal structure of heterotetrameric CK2 was solved recently (28Niefind K. Guerra B. Ermakowa I. Issinger O.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5320-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This enabled us to screen for potential PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding sites on the CK2 surface. In search for a site that would electrostatically interact with the negatively charged lipid head group, we first turned our attention to a basic cluster containing several lysines and arginines; i.e. K74KKKIKR80 and Arg155 in the CK2 α-subunit (Fig. 4, A and B). This was an especially attractive candidate, as this region is thought to be a potential binding site for the strong CK2 inhibitor heparin (29Krehan A. Lorenz P. Plana-Coll M. Pyerin W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4966-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). By analogy to heparin binding to this site and inhibiting CK2 activity, it is plausible to imagine that interaction of polyphosphoinositides with this region would also inhibit CK2 activity. This hypothesis was supported by data indicating that heparin inhibits binding of CK2 to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5A, heparin inhibits binding of CK2 to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes. Following liposome binding assays in the presence or absence of 10 μm heparin, CK2 was detected in liposome pellets by immunoblotting using an antibody to the α-subunit of CK2 followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection and quantitation using Scion Image software. B, expression of recombinant mutant CK2 proteins. Recombinant mutant CK2 proteins were expressed and purified as described under “Materials and Methods,” separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected as in A. wt, wild type. C, all kinase-active CK2 mutants were inhibited by PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes. The kinase activity of different CK2 mutants was assayed using clathrin light chain as substrate in the presence of backbone liposomes (PC:PE:PS) that either contained (+) or did not contain (-) 10% PtdIns(4,5P)2. Reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. The band corresponding to phosphorylated clathrin light chain is shown. The autoradiograph is representative of three independent experiments. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because heparin inhibits binding of CK2 to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes, we used an in silico approach to generate a model of how PtdIns(4,5)P2 might bind to this region of CK2 and identified several residues in CK2 that would be critical for direct interaction with PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 4B). Two of these residues (Lys76 and Arg155) were individually and collectively mutated to alanine or glutamic acid. All single and double mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified the same as for wild type CK2 (Fig. 5B). All mutants still bound to heparin-Sepharose as efficiently as the wild type CK2. Those mutants containing R155E were inactive, whereas R155A mutants retained ∼50% of their activity. In phosphorylation assays (using clathrin light chain as substrate) all active mutants were inhibited by PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes as efficiently as the wild type CK2 (Fig. 5C). This argues against a role for the basic cluster of the CK2 α-subunit in binding to and being inhibited by polyphosphoinositides. Finally, we turned our attention to the ATP binding site of the CK2 α-subunit. As the published structure (28Niefind K. Guerra B. Ermakowa I. Issinger O.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5320-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and our modeling data (Fig. 4,A and C) show, this region also contains a number of basic residues that can potentially interact with the head group of PtdIns(4,5P)2. In the case of this model, inhibition of CK2 activity would be a direct consequence of the lipid head group blocking the active site and not allowing substrate access. Because in the crystal structure of CK2 (28Niefind K. Guerra B. Ermakowa I. Issinger O.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5320-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) the active site cleft is blocked with a non-hydrolyzable analogue of ATP (AMP-PNP), we have included AMPPNP in liposome binding assays and shown that it prevents binding of CK2 to liposomes containing polyphosphoinositides, the most complete inhibition of binding being that to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes (Fig. 6). We have previously shown that the protein kinase CK2 is present but catalytically inactive in CCVs and that CK2 is capable of phosphorylating the majority of peripheral membrane proteins present within the CCV that are substrates for phosphorylation (2Korolchuk V.I. Banting G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CK2 is activated as the CCV starts to uncoat, leading to the phosphorylation of peripheral membrane proteins (2Korolchuk V.I. Banting G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Several of these membrane proteins have been shown to be assembly-incompetent when phosphorylated (4Hao W. Luo Z. Zheng L. Prasad K. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22785-22794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Nordstedt C. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 4408-4415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus their phosphorylation as the CCV uncoats would ensure that the CCV coat does not reform on the vesicle from which it has just been released but would allow the coat components to be recycled for another round of CME following dephosphorylation. We have now shown that CK2 binds to liposomes containing the polyphosphoinositide PtdIns(4,5)P2 (a known component of CCV membranes) and that binding of CK2 to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes inhibits the activity of CK2. A molecular explanation for CK2 being inhibited by binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes is provided by our observation that CK2 binds to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes via the active site of the enzyme. It is of note that another component of CCVs is the polyphosphoinositide 5′-phosphatase synaptojanin which has been implicated as playing a role in the uncoating of CCVs (19Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P. Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that the PtdIns(4,5)P2 present in the membrane of forming and nascent CCVs would provide both an anchor for CK2 and a means of ensuring that CK2 is inactive as the CCV is generated. Following CCV formation and the activation of synaptojanin, PtdIns(4,5)P2 would be hydrolyzed to PtdIns (4)P, releasing the inhibition on CK2 and allowing it to phosphorylate those CCV peripheral membrane proteins it recognizes as substrates. The regulation of CK2 activity by its binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2 would therefore impose some directionality on the process of CCV coat assembly and disassembly by allowing coat assembly when CK2 is in the PtdIns(4,5)P2-bound inactive state and inhibiting coat reassembly when PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been hydrolyzed to PtdIns (4)P and CK2 is no longer inactive.
