Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a motor neuron degenerative disease (Kiernan et al., 2011Kiernan M.C. Vucic S. Cheah B.C. Turner M.R. Eisen A. Hardiman O. Burrell J.R. Zoing M.C.

The recent identification of aberrant GGGGCC (G4C2) intronic repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011DeJesus-Hernandez M. Mackenzie I.R. Boeve B.F. Boxer A.L. Baker M.

C9ORF72 patients carry from tens to hundreds of G4C2 repeats, while the majority of unaffected individuals have no more than 2 to 25 repeats (Rutherford et al., 2012Rutherford N.J. Heckman M.G. Dejesus-Hernandez M. Baker M.C. Soto-Ortolaza A.I. Rayaprolu S. Stewart H. Finger E. Volkening K. Seeley W.W. et al.Length of normal alleles of C9ORF72 GGGGCC repeat do not influence disease phenotype.Neurobiol. Aging. 2012; 33: e5-e7, e7PubMed Google Scholar). Correlation between these expanded repeats and severity of clinical manifestations has yet to be established. Repeat expansions in genes cause many hereditary diseases in humans (La Spada and Taylor, 2010La Spada A.R. Taylor J.P. Repeat expansion disease: progress and puzzles in disease pathogenesis.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which G4C2 repeat expansions cause neurodegeneration are under intense investigation. Decreased C9ORF72 mRNA expression levels were detected in C9-ALS/FTD patient lymphoblasts (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011DeJesus-Hernandez M. Mackenzie I.R. Boeve B.F. Boxer A.L. Baker M. Rutherford N.J. Nicholson A.M. Finch N.A. Flynn H. Adamson J. et al.Expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in noncoding region of C9ORF72 causes chromosome 9p-linked FTD and ALS.Neuron. 2011; 72: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3412) Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that the intronic expansions could cause downregulation of the C9ORF72 protein, which could then be responsible for neurodegeneration. Support for this loss-of-function hypothesis was first reported in zebrafish (Ciura et al., 2013Ciura S. Lattante S. Le Ber I. Latouche M. Tostivint H. Brice A. Kabashi E. Loss of function of C9orf72 causes motor deficits in a zebrafish model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Ann. Neurol. 2013; 74: 180-187PubMed Google Scholar), although confirmation is still lacking in mammalian models. Lines of evidence supporting a gain-of-toxic-function hypothesis of pathogenesis have recently started to emerge. For instance, sense and antisense G4C2 repeat RNA transcripts accumulate in nuclear foci in neurons of different CNS areas of C9-ALS/FTD patients (Zu et al., 2013Zu T. Liu Y. Bañez-Coronel M. Reid T. Pletnikova O. Lewis J. Miller T.M. Harms M.B. Falchook A.E. Subramony S.H. et al.RAN proteins and RNA foci from antisense transcripts in C9ORF72 ALS and frontotemporal dementia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E4968-E4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar); antisense oligonucleotides against C9ORF72 transcripts reduced RNA-binding protein sequestration and increased glutamate sensitivity of neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of C9-ALS patients (Donnelly et al., 2013Donnelly C.J. Zhang P.W. Pham J.T. Haeusler A.R. Mistry N.A. Vidensky S. Daley E.L. Poth E.M. Hoover B.

Zamiri B. Stanley S.Y. Macgregor Jr., R.B. Pearson C.E. The disease-associated r(GGGGCC)n repeat from the C9orf72 gene forms tract length-dependent uni- and multimolecular RNA G-quadruplex structures.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 9860-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), which sequester ribonucleoproteins critical for cell survival (Haeusler et al., 2014Haeusler A.R. Donnelly C.J. Periz G.

Sattler R. et al.C9orf72 nucleotide repeat structures initiate molecular cascades of disease.Nature. 2014; 507: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Furthermore, repeat-associated, non-ATG initiated (RAN) translation has been reported in several nucleotide repeat disorders (Zu et al., 2011Zu T. Gibbens B. Doty N.S. Gomes-Pereira M. Huguet A. Stone M.D. Margolis J. Peterson M. Markowski T.W. Ingram M.A. et al.Non-ATG-initiated translation directed by microsatellite expansions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). RAN-translated proteins from sense and antisense transcripts were reported accumulating in C9-ALS/FTD tissues (Ash et al., 2013Ash P.E. Bieniek K.F. Gendron T.F. Caulfield T. Lin W.L. Dejesus-Hernandez M. van Blitterswijk M.M. Jansen-West K. Paul 3rd, J.W.

Indeed, some of these RAN-translated proteins were recently described to cause toxicity (Kwon et al., 2014Kwon I. Xiang S. Kato M. Wu L. Theodoropoulos P. Wang T. Kim J. Yun J. Xie Y. McKnight S.L.

All of the different and potentially toxic instances appear not to be mutually exclusive, as evidence for their coexistence was found in postmortem patient samples (Gendron et al., 2013aGendron T.F. Bieniek K.F. Zhang Y.J. Jansen-West K. Ash P.E. Caulfield T. Daughrity L. Dunmore J.H. Castanedes-Casey M. Chew J. et al.Antisense transcripts of the expanded C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat form nuclear RNA foci and undergo repeat-associated non-ATG translation in c9FTD/ALS.Acta Neuropathol. 2013; 126: 829-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). However, it remains challenging to tease out their individual contributions and mechanisms of toxicity. We were able to independently model these different C9ORF72 pathogenic instances. By transfecting cortical and motor neurons with constructs engineered by a randomized codon strategy to express C9RAN proteins avoiding GC repeat sequences, or constructs encoding intronic expanded G4C2 sequences that do not initiate RAN translation, and constructs that efficiently knock down C9ORF72, we deciphered by means of time-lapse live-cell imaging their respective impact on neuronal viability. We also established transgenic Drosophila models of C9RAN proteins. We found that one of the antisense C9RAN proteins, the Proline-Arginine dipeptide (PR), is potently neurotoxic when expressed in vivo and neurons with nuclear PR aggregates have a much higher risk to undergo degeneration. In addition, induced motor neurons (iMNs) derived from C9-ALS patients showed intranuclear PR+ aggregates, increased number of extracellular PR aggregates in the dish, and dramatic decrease in survival compared to controls. Nuclear PR aggregates were also found in human spinal cord tissues from C9ORF72 ALS/FTD patients. Interestingly, we found that poly-PR peptides aggregate in nucleoli, causing enlargement of the nucleolus, cell stress responses, and ultimately cell death. In PR-expressing neurons, death is preceded by a decreased number of RNA-processing bodies (P-bodies) and by the appearance of cytosolic stress granules. These findings suggest that nuclear aggregation of PR peptides initiates a cascade of events leading to neurodegeneration via global perturbation in RNA processing and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. In vivo, pathogenic intronic G4C2 repeat expansions undergo RAN translation on both sense and antisense transcripts using all reading frames, giving rise to five dipeptide repeat proteins (DRPs) of presumably variable length (antisense: poly-PR and poly-PA; sense: poly-GA and poly-GR; both sense: poly-GP) (Ash et al., 2013Ash P.E.

USA. 2013; 110: E4968-E4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). DRPs form aggregates in C9 patients in different neurons, including those not affected by disease (Gendron et al., 2013aGendron T.F. Bieniek K.F. Zhang Y.J. Jansen-West K. Ash P.E. Caulfield T.

USA. 2013; 110: E4968-E4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). It remains an open question whether and which DRPs initiate toxicity in neurons. To decipher the neurotoxic profiles of the various DRPs, we transfected mouse motor neuron-like NSC34 cells, as well as primary cortical and motor neurons, with DRP-encoding constructs of different lengths (25- to 400-dipeptide-long sequences) tagged with GFP to aid identification of transfected cells. Constructs were designed to express DRPs in an ATG-dependent translation and with a randomized codon strategy to ensure expression of only the chosen DRP sequence at the desired length. This approach allowed us to engineer stable constructs containing moderate GC content encoding up to 400-dipeptide-long repeats for GR and GA, 200 for PR and PA, and 50 for GP and to avoid potential toxicity induced by G4C2 repeats expansion at transcript level (Figure S1 available online). Proper expression of DRP constructs in NCS34 cells was assessed by western blot analysis using anti-DRPs (Ash et al., 2013Ash P.E. Bieniek K.F. Gendron T.F. Caulfield T. Lin W.L. Dejesus-Hernandez M. van Blitterswijk M.M. Jansen-West K. Paul 3rd, J.W. Rademakers R. et al.Unconventional translation of C9ORF72 GGGGCC expansion generates insoluble polypeptides specific to c9FTD/ALS.Neuron. 2013; 77: 639-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) (Figure S2A) and GFP antibodies. Notably, the arginine-rich dipeptides, PR and GR, were consistently expressed at somewhat lower levels, whereas expression levels of the other DRPs were comparable (Figure S2B). Confocal microscopy analysis showed distinct PR and GR nuclear aggregates, whereas GA- and PA-expressing cells revealed predominant cytoplasmic aggregates. Conversely, GP displayed diffused localization (Figure S2C). The different DRPs had analogous localization patterns when transfected in cortical and motor neurons (Figures S2D and S2E). We next sought to evaluate toxicity by longitudinal, live-cell imaging that gauged survival of DRP-expressing neurons. Mature cortical neurons (10 days in vitro [DIV10]) (Lesuisse and Martin, 2002Lesuisse C. Martin L.J. Long-term culture of mouse cortical neurons as a model for neuronal development, aging, and death.J. Neurobiol. 2002; 51: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) were cotransfected with GFP-tagged DRP constructs and Td-Tomato reporter driven by the synapsin promoter. This aided live visualization of transfected neurons (Figures S3A, S3B, and S3C). The same GFP+ and Td-tomato+ cortical neurons were followed at 24 hr intervals, up to several days posttransfection. Expression of PR50 dramatically decreased cortical neuron survival (Figure 1A), while the other four DRPs did not (Figure 1B). Most of PR50-mediated cell death occurred in the first 72 hr posttransfection. Interestingly, image analysis revealed that the majority of neurons harboring PR nuclear aggregates died within 24–48 hr after aggregates formed, while neurons featuring diffused pattern of PR expression survived (Figure 1C). This was confirmed by Kaplan-Meier survival and risk-of-death analysis performed on cohorts of neurons displaying either nuclear aggregates or diffused localization (Figure 1D). PR neurotoxicity did not significantly vary with increased length of repeats (Figure 1E), and the effect appeared to be concentration dependent (Figure 1F). Clear length-dependent neurotoxicity was instead seen for poly-GR. Conversely, poly-PA, GA, and GP were not significantly, or just marginally (poly-PA), toxic at the longest lengths tested. Expression levels were comparable among the DRPs of different lengths (Figure 1G). PR50 was also toxic to primary motor neurons. However, these neurons were equally susceptible to expression of GR50 (Figures S4A and S4B), which aggregated in the nucleus, similarly to PR50 although less aggressively (Figures S2 and S4B). Notably, hippocampal neurons, which are marginally affected in C9-FTD (Warren et al., 2013Warren J.D. Rohrer J.D. Rossor M.N. Clinical review. Frontotemporal dementia.BMJ. 2013; 347: f4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), were also vulnerable to PR toxicity, but to a much lesser extent than cortical neurons and despite comparable expression levels, assessed as intensity of GFP fluorescence signal (Figures S4C, S4D, and S4E). Localization pattern of PR and extent of its toxicity did not depend on the presence of the GFP tag in the dipeptide sequence as the expression of untagged PR50 displayed similar toxic and localization profile as the GFP-tagged dipeptide (Figures S4F, S4G, and S4H). In contrast to the toxic effect of PR50 on both cortical and motor neurons, we found that SOD1-G93A displayed selective toxicity toward motor neurons (Figures S4I and S4J). This observation is consistent with the fact that the SOD1-G93A mutation causes pure ALS with no FTD symptoms. It was recently shown that expanded G4C2 repeats are toxic to neuronal cell lines and zebrafish embryos (Lee et al., 2013Lee Y.B. Chen H.J. Peres J.N. Gomez-Deza J. Attig J. Stalekar M. Troakes C. Nishimura A.L. Scotter E.L. Vance C. et al.Hexanucleotide repeats in ALS/FTD form length-dependent RNA foci, sequester RNA binding proteins, and are neurotoxic.Cell Rep. 2013; 5: 1178-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A still open question is whether G4C2 repeat expansions, harbored in an intronic sequence, cause neurodegeneration independently of the C9ORF72 gene sequence. We generated plasmids containing 0, 21, and 42 G4C2 repeats (R0, R21, R42) in an artificial intronic sequence inserted between two EGFP exons (Figures S5A and S5B) and transfected primary cortical neurons. These neurons could be readily identified for live-cell imaging by the concomitant Td-tomato and GFP fluorescence (Figure S5C). GFP expression was confirmed by western blot analysis of lysates of R0-R42-transfected NSC34 cells probed with an anti-GFP antibody (Figure S5D). Expression of the G4C2 transcripts was verified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis (Figure S5E), which revealed prevalent nuclear localization of the G4C2 RNA transcript signal in cells transfected with R21 and R42 but not with R0. Longitudinal live-cell imaging analysis showed that R42-transfected cortical neurons survived significantly less than R0- or R21-expressing neurons (Figure 2A). The risk of death increased ∼2-fold (Figure 2B). R42 construct displayed dose-dependent toxicity with a threshold effect seen at 50% of the amount of transfected cDNA (Figure 2C). R42-expressing motor neurons had higher risk of death compared to R21 and controls (Figures 2D and 2E), whereas survival of hippocampal neurons was not affected by the R42 transcript (Figure 2F). RNA sequence made of 38 G4C2 repeats can initiate RAN translation when expressed in HEK cells in a repeat length-dependent manner (Mori et al., 2013Mori K. Weng S.M. Arzberger T. May S. Rentzsch K. Kremmer E. Schmid B. Kretzschmar H.A. Cruts M. Van Broeckhoven C. et al.The C9orf72 GGGGCC repeat is translated into aggregating dipeptide-repeat proteins in FTLD/ALS.Science. 2013; 339: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). To determine whether R42 neurotoxicity in our culture systems was mediated by RAN translation, we performed western blot analysis on lysates of R0-R42-transfected motor neuron-like NSC34 cells using anti-DRPs antibodies. We found no evidence for formation of any of the five possible DRPs (Figure 3A). This was further confirmed in cortical neurons transfected with R42 by immunocytochemistry and dot blot analysis (Figures 3B and 3C). While intronic R42 repeats do not produce detectable DRPs, we found that the concomitant expression of a subtoxic concentration of R42 repeat transcripts (50% of the dose normally used) greatly enhanced the damaging effect of a marginally toxic concentration (50% of the dose) of PR50 on cortical neurons (Figure 4A). On the other hand, the prevalently cytosolic expression of GA aggregates in combination with R42 did not produce the same synergistic effect (Figure 4B).Figure 4PR50 Nuclear Aggregates Colocalize with Nucleolin and Mediate Cellular Stress ResponsesShow full caption(A) Cortical neurons transfected with a combination of R42 and PR50 constructs (0.4 μg R42 + 0.4 μg PR50 + 0.2 μg Td-tomato; total 1 μg/well cDNA) displayed significant increase in cumulative risk of death compared to the other three possible combinations, suggesting that R42 and PR50 increased neural toxicity synergistically.

The development of new methods to create these essential connections in a rapid and practical fashion has been the focus of numerous organic chemists. This endeavour relies heavily on the ability to form C-C bonds in the presence of sensitive functional groups and congested structural environments. Here we report a chemical transformation that allows the facile construction of highly substituted and uniquely functionalized C-C bonds. Using a simple iron catalyst, an inexpensive silane and a benign solvent under ambient atmosphere, heteroatom-substituted olefins are easily reacted with electron-deficient olefins to create molecular architectures that were previously difficult or impossible to access. More than 60 examples are presented with a wide array of substrates, demonstrating the chemoselectivity and mildness of this simple reaction."

The medical bionic technology used to design, manufacture and implant such prostheses is still in its relative infancy, with various technologies and surgical approaches being evaluated. We hypothesised that a suprachoroidal implant location (between the sclera and choroid of the eye) would provide significant surgical and safety benefits for patients, allowing them to maintain preoperative residual vision as well as gaining prosthetic vision input from the device. This report details the first-in-human Phase 1 trial to investigate the use of retinal implants in the suprachoroidal space in three human subjects with end-stage retinitis pigmentosa. The success of the suprachoroidal surgical approach and its associated safety benefits, coupled with twelve-month post-operative efficacy data, holds promise for the field of vision restoration.

Although AUTS2 is often disrupted in patients with neuronal disorders, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis is unclear. We investigated the role of AUTS2 as part of a previously identified PRC1 complex (PRC1-AUTS2), and in the context of neurodevelopment. In contrast to the canonical role of PRC1 in gene repression, PRC1-AUTS2 activates transcription. Biochemical studies demonstrate that the CK2 component of PRC1-AUTS2 neutralizes PRC1 repressive activity, whereas AUTS2-mediated recruitment of P300 leads to gene activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrated that AUTS2 regulates neuronal gene expression through promoter association. Conditional targeting of Auts2 in the mouse central nervous system (CNS) leads to various developmental defects. These findings reveal a natural means of subverting PRC1 activity, linking key epigenetic modulators with neuronal functions and diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2057758931,"The dynamics of two correlated electrons can be reconstructed from the quantum interference of low-lying doubly excited states in helium, as observed in attosecond transient-absorption spectra, and can be controlled by tuning the interaction with a visible laser field of variable intensity. Although the concerted motion of two or more bound electrons controls all chemical reactions, understanding and probing of such electron dynamics remains challenging. The motion of single electrons has been observed with attosecond time resolution, but comparable experiments on two-electron motion have not yet been realized. Christian Ott and colleagues now show that the dynamics of two correlated electrons in helium can be reconstructed from attosecond transient-absorption spectra measured with unprecedented high spectral resolution and in the presence of an intensity-tuneable visible laser field. Future experiments using the same approach are expected to provide benchmark data for testing theory, and might even make it possible to probe metastable electronic transition states that are at the heart of fundamental chemical reactions. The concerted motion of two or more bound electrons governs atomic1 and molecular2,3 non-equilibrium processes including chemical reactions, and hence there is much interest in developing a detailed understanding of such electron dynamics in the quantum regime. However, there is no exact solution for the quantum three-body problem, and as a result even the minimal system of two active electrons and a nucleus is analytically intractable4. This makes experimental measurements of the dynamics of two bound and correlated electrons, as found in the helium atom, an attractive prospect. However, although the motion of single active electrons and holes has been observed with attosecond time resolution5,6,7, comparable experiments on two-electron motion have so far remained out of reach. Here we show that a correlated two-electron wave packet can be reconstructed from a 1.2-femtosecond quantum beat among low-lying doubly excited states in helium. The beat appears in attosecond transient-absorption spectra5,7,8,9 measured with unprecedentedly high spectral resolution and in the presence of an intensity-tunable visible laser field. We tune the coupling10,11,12 between the two low-lying quantum states by adjusting the visible laser intensity, and use the Fano resonance as a phase-sensitive quantum interferometer13 to achieve coherent control of the two correlated electrons. Given the excellent agreement with large-scale quantum-mechanical calculations for the helium atom, we anticipate that multidimensional spectroscopy experiments of the type we report here will provide benchmark data for testing fundamental few-body quantum dynamics theory in more complex systems. They might also provide a route to the site-specific measurement and control of metastable electronic transition states that are at the heart of fundamental chemical reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2072519673,"A protein degradation pathway is found at the inner nuclear membrane that is distinct from, but complementary to, endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation, and which is mediated by the Asi protein complex; a genome-wide library screening of yeast identifies more than 20 substrates of this pathway, which is shown to target mislocalized integral membrane proteins for degradation. The endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway mediates protein homeostasis in cells by tagging misfolded proteins of the ER with the protein ubiquitin. Ubiquitylated proteins are subsequently degraded within the cytoplasm. The nuclear membrane is continuous with the ER membrane, prompting Michael Knop and colleagues to ask whether protein quality control also operates in the inner nuclear membrane (INM). The authors find that there is a protein degradation pathway at the INM (mediated by the Asi protein complex) that is distinct from, but complementary to, the ERAD. An unbiased screening of a genome-wide library of yeast identified more than 50 substrates for this pathway, which is shown to have a role in the degradation of integral membrane proteins mislocalized to the INM. The authors propose that this ERAD-like pathway may ensure inappropriate proteins are excluded from the nucleus. The nuclear envelope is a double membrane that separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The inner nuclear membrane (INM) functions in essential nuclear processes including chromatin organization and regulation of gene expression1. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum and is the site of membrane protein synthesis. Protein homeostasis in this compartment is ensured by endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathways that in yeast involve the integral membrane E3 ubiquitin ligases Hrd1 and Doa10 operating with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc6 and Ubc7 (refs 2, 3). However, little is known about protein quality control at the INM. Here we describe a protein degradation pathway at the INM in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mediated by the Asi complex consisting of the RING domain proteins Asi1 and Asi3 (ref. 4). We report that the Asi complex functions together with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc6 and Ubc7 to degrade soluble and integral membrane proteins. Genetic evidence suggests that the Asi ubiquitin ligase defines a pathway distinct from, but complementary to, ERAD. Using unbiased screening with a novel genome-wide yeast library based on a tandem fluorescent protein timer5, we identify more than 50 substrates of the Asi, Hrd1 and Doa10 E3 ubiquitin ligases. We show that the Asi ubiquitin ligase is involved in degradation of mislocalized integral membrane proteins, thus acting to maintain and safeguard the identity of the INM."

https://openalex.org/W1986673759,"Habitat destruction and overhunting are two major drivers of mammal population declines and extinctions in tropical forests. The construction of roads can be a catalyst for these two threats. In Southeast Asia, the impacts of roads on mammals have not been well-documented at a regional scale. Before evidence-based conservation strategies can be developed to minimize the threat of roads to endangered mammals within this region, we first need to locate where and how roads are contributing to the conversion of their habitats and illegal hunting in each country. We interviewed 36 experts involved in mammal research from seven Southeast Asian countries to identify roads that are contributing the most, in their opinion, to habitat conversion and illegal hunting. Our experts highlighted 16 existing and eight planned roads - these potentially threaten 21% of the 117 endangered terrestrial mammals in those countries. Apart from gathering qualitative evidence from the literature to assess their claims, we demonstrate how species-distribution models, satellite imagery and animal-sign surveys can be used to provide quantitative evidence of roads causing impacts by (1) cutting through habitats where endangered mammals are likely to occur, (2) intensifying forest conversion, and (3) contributing to illegal hunting and wildlife trade. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to identify specific roads threatening endangered mammals in Southeast Asia. Further through highlighting the impacts of roads, we propose 10 measures to limit road impacts in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2029240457,"In the current study we show that non-verbal food-evoked emotion scores significantly improve food choice prediction over merely liking scores. Previous research has shown that liking measures correlate with choice. However, liking is no strong predictor for food choice in real life environments. Therefore, the focus within recent studies shifted towards using emotion-profiling methods that successfully can discriminate between products that are equally liked. However, it is unclear how well scores from emotion-profiling methods predict actual food choice and/or consumption. To test this, we proposed to decompose emotion scores into valence and arousal scores using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and apply Multinomial Logit Models (MLM) to estimate food choice using liking, valence, and arousal as possible predictors. For this analysis, we used an existing data set comprised of liking and food-evoked emotions scores from 123 participants, who rated 7 unlabeled breakfast drinks. Liking scores were measured using a 100-mm visual analogue scale, while food-evoked emotions were measured using 2 existing emotion-profiling methods: a verbal and a non-verbal method (EsSense Profile and PrEmo, respectively). After 7 days, participants were asked to choose 1 breakfast drink from the experiment to consume during breakfast in a simulated restaurant environment. Cross validation showed that we were able to correctly predict individualized food choice (1 out of 7 products) for over 50% of the participants. This number increased to nearly 80% when looking at the top 2 candidates. Model comparisons showed that evoked emotions better predict food choice than perceived liking alone. However, the strongest predictive strength was achieved by the combination of evoked emotions and liking. Furthermore we showed that non-verbal food-evoked emotion scores more accurately predict food choice than verbal food-evoked emotions scores."

In this study, we have investigated whether ether lipids affect the release of exosomes in PC-3 cells. To increase the cellular levels of ether lipids, the ether lipid precursor hexadecylglycerol was added to cells. Lipidomic analysis showed that this compound was in fact able to double the cellular levels of ether lipids in these cells. Furthermore, increased levels of ether lipids were also found in exosomes released by cells containing high levels of these lipids. Interestingly, as measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis, cells containing high levels of ether lipids released more exosomes than control cells, and these exosomes were similar in size to control exosomes. Moreover, silver staining and Western blot analyses showed that the protein composition of exosomes released in the presence of hexadecylglycerol was changed; the levels of some proteins were increased, and the levels of others were reduced. In conclusion, this study clearly shows that an increase in cellular ether lipids is associated with changes in the release and composition of exosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1981088148,"Hubble Space Telescope observations of the stellar cluster NGC 1651, which is approximately two billion years old, show that the colour–brightness distribution of stars old enough to have left the main sequence can be explained only by a single-age population, despite having a feature usually interpreted to indicate an age spread of more than 300 million years. Hubble Space Telescope observations of the stellar cluster NGC 1651 reveal a colour–brightness distribution of stars old enough to have left the main sequence that is consistent with the presence of a simple 'single-age' stellar population. This conclusion runs counter to now commonly held idea that clusters that are more than 500 million years old — NGC 1651 is about two billion years old — consist of multiple populations of stars of different ages or metallicities. The authors find no evidence to support the presence of multiple populations and suggest that the extended main-sequence turn-off regions observed in intermediate-age star clusters are not indicative of a broad stellar age spread, but rather of the presence of a population of rapidly rotating stars. Stars spend most of their lifetimes on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. The extended main-sequence turn-off regions—containing stars leaving the main sequence after having spent all of the hydrogen in their cores—found in massive (more than a few tens of thousands of solar masses), intermediate-age (about one to three billion years old) star clusters1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 are usually interpreted as evidence of internal age spreads of more than 300 million years2,4,5, although young clusters are thought to quickly lose any remaining star-forming fuel following a period of rapid gas expulsion on timescales of order 107 years9,10. Here we report, on the basis of a combination of high-resolution imaging observations and theoretical modelling, that the stars beyond the main sequence in the two-billion-year-old cluster NGC 1651, characterized by a mass of about 1.7 × 105 solar masses3, can be explained only by a single-age stellar population, even though the cluster has a clearly extended main-sequence turn-off region. The most plausible explanation for the existence of such extended regions invokes a population of rapidly rotating stars, although the secondary effects of the prolonged stellar lifetimes associated with such a stellar population mixture are as yet poorly understood. From preliminary analysis of previously obtained data, we find that similar morphologies are apparent in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams of at least five additional intermediate-age star clusters2,3,5,11, suggesting that an extended main-sequence turn-off region does not necessarily imply the presence of a significant internal age dispersion."
https://openalex.org/W1987101659,"It is well known that the Neolithic transition spread across Europe at a speed of about 1 km/yr. This result has been previously interpreted as a range expansion of the Neolithic driven mainly by demic diffusion (whereas cultural diffusion played a secondary role). However, a long-standing problem is whether this value (1 km/yr) and its interpretation (mainly demic diffusion) are characteristic only of Europe or universal (i.e. intrinsic features of Neolithic transitions all over the world). So far Neolithic spread rates outside Europe have been barely measured, and Neolithic spread rates substantially faster than 1 km/yr have not been previously reported. Here we show that the transition from hunting and gathering into herding in southern Africa spread at a rate of about 2.4 km/yr, i.e. about twice faster than the European Neolithic transition. Thus the value 1 km/yr is not a universal feature of Neolithic transitions in the world. Resorting to a recent demic-cultural wave-of-advance model, we also find that the main mechanism at work in the southern African Neolithic spread was cultural diffusion (whereas demic diffusion played a secondary role). This is in sharp contrast to the European Neolithic. Our results further suggest that Neolithic spread rates could be mainly driven by cultural diffusion in cases where the final state of this transition is herding/pastoralism (such as in southern Africa) rather than farming and stockbreeding (as in Europe)."

https://openalex.org/W2012648887,"Post-transcriptional processing of mRNA transcripts plays a critical role in establishing the gene expression profile of a cell. Such processing events are mediated by a host of factors, including RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs. A number of critical cellular pathways are subject to regulation at multiple levels that allow fine-tuning of key biological responses. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is a tumor suppressor and an important modulator of mRNA translation that is regulated by a number of mechanisms, most notably as a target of the oncomiR, miR-21. Here, we provide evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of PDCD4 by the RNA-binding proteins, HuR and TIA1. Complementary approaches reveal binding of both HuR and TIA1 to the PDCD4 transcript. Consistent with a model where RNA-binding proteins modulate the PDCD4 transcript, knockdown of HuR and/or TIA1 results in a significant decrease in steady-state PDCD4 mRNA and protein levels. However, fractionation experiments suggest that the mode of regulation of the PDCD4 transcript likely differs in the cytoplasm and the nucleus as the pool of PDCD4 mRNA present in the cytoplasm is more stable than the nuclear pool of PDCD4 transcript. We observe a competitive mode of binding between HuR and TIA1 on the PDCD4 transcript in the cytoplasm, suggesting that these two factors dynamically interact with one another as well as the PDCD4 transcript to maintain tight control of PDCD4 levels. Overall, this study reveals an additional set of regulatory interactions that modulate the expression of PDCD4, a key pro-apoptotic factor, and also reveals new insights into how HuR and TIA1 functions are integrated to achieve such regulation. Background: PDCD4 is regulated by multiple mechanisms and is involved in tumor promotion. Results: PDCD4 mRNA is bound by the RNA-binding proteins HuR and TIA1, resulting in modulation of PDCD4 mRNA and protein levels. Conclusion: This study describes a dynamic regulation of PDCD4 mRNA via the 3′UTR. Significance: This work reveals an additional regulatory mechanism that modulates levels of the tumor suppressor PDCD4."
https://openalex.org/W2109322623,"Objective Infections due to Gram-negative bacteria exhibit seasonal trends, with peak infection rates during warmer months. We hypothesized that the likelihood of a bloodstream infection due to Gram-negative bacteria increases with proximity to the equator. We tested this hypothesis and identified geographical, climatic and social factors associated with this variability. Design We established a network of 23 international centers in 22 cities. Setting: De-identified results of positive blood cultures from 2007–2011 and data sources for geographic, climatic and socioeconomic factors were assembled for each center. Participants Patients at the 23 centers with positive blood cultures. Main outcome Due to variability in the availability of total culture volumes across sites, our primary outcome measure was the fraction of positive blood cultures that yielded Gram-negative bacteria; sources of variability in this outcome measure were explored using meta-regression techniques. Results The mean fraction of bacteremia associated with Gram-negative bacteria was 48.4% (range 26.4% to 61.8%). Although not all sites displayed significant seasonality, the overall P-value for seasonal oscillation was significant (P<0.001). In univariate meta-regression models, temperature, latitude, latitude squared, longitude, per capita gross domestic product and percent of gross domestic product spent on healthcare were all associated with the fraction of bacteremia due to Gram-negative bacteria. In multivariable models, only percent of gross domestic product spent on healthcare and distance from the equator (ie. latitude squared) were significantly associated with the fraction of bacteremia due to Gram-negative bacteria. Conclusions The likelihood of bacteremia due to Gram-negative bacteria varies markedly between cities, in a manner that appears to have both geographic (latitude) and socioeconomic (proportion gross domestic product devoted to health spending) determinants. Thus, the optimal approach to initial management of suspected bacteremia may be geographically specific. The rapid emergence of highly antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative pathogens may have geographically specific impacts."
https://openalex.org/W1971794132,"Abstract Although the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes lacking cholesterol and anionic lipids adopts a conformation where agonist binding is uncoupled from channel gating, the underlying mechanism remains to be defined. Here, we examine the mechanism behind lipid-dependent uncoupling by comparing the propensities of two prokaryotic homologs, GLIC and ELIC, to adopt a similar uncoupled conformation. Membrane-reconstituted GLIC and ELIC both exhibit folded structures in the minimal PC membranes that stabilize an uncoupled nAChR. GLIC, with a large number of aromatic interactions at the interface between the outermost transmembrane α-helix, M4, and the adjacent transmembrane α-helices, M1 and M3, retains the ability to flux cations in this uncoupling PC membrane environment. In contrast, ELIC, with a level of aromatic interactions intermediate between that of the nAChR and GLIC, does not undergo agonist-induced channel gating, even though it does not exhibit the expected biophysical characteristics of the uncoupled state. Engineering new aromatic interactions at the M4-M1/M3 interface to promote effective M4 interactions with M1/M3, however, increases the stability of the transmembrane domain to restore channel function. Our data provide direct evidence that M4 interactions with M1/M3 are modulated during lipid sensing. Aromatic residues strengthen M4 interactions with M1/M3 to reduce the sensitivities of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels to their surrounding membrane environment."

To this end, we conducted a daily diary study (N = 72) and an experience sampling study (N = 34). Results showed that the relationship between enthusiasm, cheerfulness, optimism, contentedness, gloominess, miserableness, uneasiness (in both studies 1 and 2), calmness, relaxation, tenseness, depression, worry (only in Study 1) on one hand and intrinsic motivation on the other hand was moderated by positive emotion differentiation for the positive emotions and by negative emotion differentiation for the negative emotions. Altogether, these findings suggest that for people who are unable to distinguish between different specific positive emotions the relationship between those specific positive emotions and intrinsic motivation is stronger, whereas the relationship between specific negative emotions and intrinsic motivation is weaker for people who are able to distinguish between the different specific negative emotions. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

The majority of PAR-activating proteases described to date are soluble proteases that are active during injury, coagulation, and inflammation. Less investigation, however, has focused on the potential for membrane-anchored serine proteases to regulate PAR activation. Testisin is a unique trypsin-like serine protease that is tethered to the extracellular membrane of cells through a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor.

This compound was previously identified as a female-produced sex attractant pheromone of Desmocerus californicus californicus. Headspace volatiles from female Desmocerus aureipennis aureipennis contained (R)-desmolactone, and the antennae of adult males of two species responded strongly to synthetic (R)-desmolactone in coupled gas chromatography-electroantennogram analyses. In field bioassays in California, Oregon, and British Columbia, traps baited with synthetic (R)-desmolactone captured males of several Desmocerus species and subspecies. Only male beetles were captured, indicating that this compound acts as a sex-specific attractant, rather than as a signal for aggregation. In targeted field bioassays, males of the US federally threatened subspecies Desmocerus californicus dimorphus responded to the synthetic attractant in a dose dependent manner. Our results represent the first example of a ""generic"" sex pheromone used by multiple species in the subfamily Lepturinae, and demonstrate that pheromone-baited traps may be a sensitive and efficient method of monitoring the threatened species Desmocerus californicus dimorphus, commonly known as the valley elderberry longhorn beetle."
https://openalex.org/W2035067779,"Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) accounts for over 85% of AMD cases in the United States, whereas Japanese AMD patients predominantly progress to wet AMD or polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. Recent genome-wide association studies have revealed a strong association between AMD and an insertion/deletion sequence between the ARMS2 (age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2) and HTRA1 (high temperature requirement A serine peptidase 1) genes. Transcription regulator activity was localized in mouse retinas using heterozygous HtrA1 knock-out mice in which HtrA1 exon 1 was replaced with β-galactosidase cDNA, thereby resulting in dominant expression of the photoreceptors. The insertion/deletion sequence significantly induced HTRA1 transcription regulator activity in photoreceptor cell lines but not in retinal pigmented epithelium or other cell types. A deletion construct of the HTRA1 regulatory region indicated that potential transcriptional suppressors and activators surround the insertion/deletion sequence. Ten double-stranded DNA probes for this region were designed, three of which interacted with nuclear extracts from 661W cells in EMSA. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of these EMSA bands subsequently identified a protein that bound the insertion/deletion sequence, LYRIC (lysine-rich CEACAM1 co-isolated) protein. In addition, induced pluripotent stem cells from wet AMD patients carrying the insertion/deletion sequence showed significant up-regulation of the HTRA1 transcript compared with controls. These data suggest that the insertion/deletion sequence alters the suppressor and activator cis-elements of HTRA1 and triggers sustained up-regulation of HTRA1. These results are consistent with a transgenic mouse model that ubiquitously overexpresses HtrA1 and exhibits characteristics similar to those of wet AMD patients. Background: The biological function of insertion/deletion sequences associated with AMD has not been fully characterized. Results: The HTRA1 regulatory region contains an insertion/deletion sequence that is significantly up-regulated in retinal neuronal cell lines. Conclusion: HTRA1 expression is enhanced by a mutation in the insertion/deletion in the HTRA1 regulatory region. Significance: This is the characterization of the HTRA1 regulatory elements and the effect of insertion/deletion sequences associated with AMD."

https://openalex.org/W2056181910,"Rapeseed is one of the most important edible oil crops in the world and the seed yield has lagged behind the increasing demand driven by population growth. Winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is widely cultivated with relatively low yield in China, so it is necessary to find the strategies to improve the expression of yield potential. Planting density has great effects on seed yield of crops. Hence, field experiments were conducted in Wuhan in the Yangtze River basin with one conventional variety (Zhongshuang 11, ZS11) and one hybrid variety (Huayouza 9, HYZ9) at five planting densities (27.0×104, 37.5×104, 48.0×104, 58.5×104, 69.0×104 plants ha–1) during 2010–2012 to investigate the yield components. The physiological traits for high-yield and normal-yield populations were measured during 2011–2013. Our results indicated that planting densities of 58.5×104 plants ha–1 in ZS11 and 48.0×104 plants ha–1 in HYZ9 have significantly higher yield compared with the density of 27.0×104 plants ha–1for both varieties. The ideal silique numbers for ZS11 and HYZ9 were ∼0.9×104 (n m–2) and ∼1×104 (n m-2), respectively, and ideal primary branches for ZS11 and HYZ9 were ∼250 (n m–2) and ∼300 (n m–2), respectively. The highest leaf area index (LAI) and silique wall area index (SAI) was ∼5.0 and 7.0, respectively. Moreover, higher leaf net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and water use efficiency (WUE) were observed in the high-yield populations. A significantly higher level of silique wall photosynthesis and rapid dry matter accumulation were supposed to result in the maximum seed yield. Our results suggest that increasing the planting density within certain range is a feasible approach for higher seed yield in winter rapeseed in China."
https://openalex.org/W2119795893,"Background Genetic variants within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) represent the strongest genetic susceptibility factors for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Identifying the causal variants within this genetic complex represents a major challenge due to strong linkage disequilibrium and an overall high physical density of candidate variants. We aimed to refine the MHC association in a geographically restricted PSC patient panel. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 365 PSC cases and 368 healthy controls of Scandinavian ancestry were included in the study. We incorporated data from HLA typing (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB3, -DRB1, -DQB1) and single nucleotide polymorphisms across the MHC (n = 18,644; genotyped and imputed) alongside previously suggested PSC risk determinants in the MHC, i.e. amino acid variation of DRβ, a MICA microsatellite polymorphism and HLA-C and HLA-B according to their ligand properties for killer immunoglobulin-like receptors. Breakdowns of the association signal by unconditional and conditional logistic regression analyses demarcated multiple PSC associated MHC haplotypes, and for eight of these classical HLA class I and II alleles represented the strongest association. A novel independent risk locus was detected near NOTCH4 in the HLA class III region, tagged by rs116212904 (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 2.32 [1.80, 3.00], P = 1.35×10−11). Conclusions/Significance Our study shows that classical HLA class I and II alleles, predominantly at HLA-B and HLA-DRB1, are the main risk factors for PSC in the MHC. In addition, the present assessments demonstrated for the first time an association near NOTCH4 in the HLA class III region."

https://openalex.org/W2045676586,"Invertebrates rely on an innate immune system to combat invading pathogens. The system is initiated in the presence of cell wall components from microbes like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), β-1,3-glucan (βG) and peptidoglycan (PG), altogether known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), via a recognition of pattern recognition protein (PRP) or receptor (PRR) through complicated reactions. We show herein that shrimp hemocytes incubated with LPS, βG, and PG caused necrosis and released endogenous molecules (EMs), namely EM-L, EM-β, and EM-P, and found that shrimp hemocytes incubated with EM-L, EM-β, and EM-P caused changes in cell viability, degranulation and necrosis of hemocytes, and increased phenoloxidase (PO) activity and respiratory burst (RB) indicating activation of immunity in vitro. We found that shrimp receiving EM-L, EM-β, and EM-P had increases in hemocyte count and other immune parameters as well as higher phagocytic activity toward a Vibrio pathogen, and found that shrimp receiving EM-L had increases in proliferation cell ratio and mitotic index of hematopoietic tissues (HPTs). We identified proteins of EMs deduced from SDS-PAGE and LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses. EM-L and EM-P contained damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including HMGBa, HMGBb, histone 2A (H2A), H2B, and H4, and other proteins including proPO, Rab 7 GPTase, and Rab 11 GPTase, which were not observed in controls (EM-C, hemocytes incubated in shrimp salt solution). We concluded that EMs induced by PAMPs contain DAMPs and other immune molecules, and they could elicit innate immunity in shrimp. Further research is needed to identify which individual molecule or combined molecules of EMs cause the results, and determine the mechanism of action in innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1966503742,"To determine the structural origins of diverse ligand response specificities among metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), we combined computational approaches with mutagenesis and ligand response assays to identify specificity-determining residues in the group I receptor, mGluR1, and the group III receptors, mGluR4 and mGluR7. Among these, mGluR1 responds to l-glutamate effectively, whereas it binds weakly to another endogenous ligand, l-serine-O-phosphate (l-SOP), which antagonizes the effects of l-glutamate.

Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) 2The abbreviations used are: mGluRmetabotropic glutamate receptorETevolutionary tracel-SOPl-serine-O-phosphatePDBProtein Data Bank. are important for modulating signaling by glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Pharmacology and functions of metabotropic glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). The mGluRs have been implicated in a range of functions including protection from neuronal excitotoxicity, dim light phototransduction, and learning and memory. These homodimeric receptors have multiple functional domains and subdomains, including the extracellular N-terminal domain, which includes the “Venus flytrap” ligand-binding module, the cysteine-rich domains, the transmembrane segments and interhelical loops, and C-terminal intracellular domains. Ligand binding triggers a series of complex and poorly understood conformational changes, which include closing of the ligand-binding module and changes in interactions at the dimerization interfaces, ultimately leading to unknown conformational changes at intracellular interaction sites that allow activation of specific heterotrimeric G proteins and other cellular interaction partners. metabotropic glutamate receptor evolutionary trace l-serine-O-phosphate Protein Data Bank. Because of the immense therapeutic potential for drugs targeting these receptors, there has been considerable interest in trying to understand the structural basis of the specificity with which these receptors recognize ligands and generate functional responses upon binding. Many different synthetic ligands have been tested on native and mutant forms of the receptors in efforts to uncover the rules governing the potency and efficacy of such ligands. An alternative approach that complements such conventional approaches is to draw on the countless number of structure-function experiments carried out by nature in the course of evolution by extracting the record of such experiments residing in the ever growing mass of sequence data. A computational method for extracting such information, known as the evolutionary trace, has been applied to many different protein-ligand systems with consistent success (2Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R.

Here we ask whether this approach can be applied to the ligand-binding domain of mGluR to unravel the amino acid residues that determine their ligand specificities. Because our approach relies on evolutionary information, we have focused on specificity toward the competing ligands to which the receptors of interest are naturally exposed to and must discriminate for or against. In a recent study (9Kang H.J. Menlove K. Ma J. Wilkins A. Lichtarge O. Wensel T.G. Selectivity and evolutionary divergence of metabotropic glutamate receptors for endogenous ligands and G proteins coupled to phospholipase C or TRP channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 29961-29974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we conducted a thorough re-examination of the responses of mGluR to amino acids present at significant levels in cerebrospinal fluid and found evidence that group I (mGluR1 and mGluR5), group II (mGluR2 and mGluR3), and group III (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8) receptors all bind to and are activated by l-Glu, albeit with varying efficacies and potencies and that the only other endogenous ligand that can activate or inhibit them is l-serine-O-phosphate (l-SOP). Whereas group III mGluRs are activated by l-SOP, groups I and II are not, but l-SOP does bind to and inhibit mGluR1 and mGluR2 (9Kang H.J. Menlove K. Ma J. Wilkins A. Lichtarge O. Wensel T.G.

Chem. 2014; 289: 29961-29974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Even among group III mGluRs, there are substantial differences in ligand affinities and responses. In particular, mGluR7 has much lower affinity for l-Glu and l-SOP than the other group III receptors and also displays lower efficacy for both ligands. The work described here tests the hypothesis that these differences in ligand binding and responsiveness between and among subgroups of mGluR have conferred selection advantages over the course of evolution and that the records of those evolutionary processes are embodied in the patterns of sequence variation among the mGluR family members. In particular, we have focused on the hypotheses that it has been important for mGluR1 to develop and maintain weak binding and no activation in response to l-SOP, while maintaining strong binding and activation in response to l-Glu, for mGluR7 to display weak binding and efficacy but low selectivity for both l-Glu and l-SOP and for mGluR4 to maintain strong binding and activation in response to both ligands. We have tested these hypotheses by using the evolutionary trace, in conjunction with computational structure analysis of the ligand-binding pocket, to identify important amino acid positions within the ligand-binding domain and then exchanging residue identities at those positions between mGluR4 on the one hand and either mGluR1 or mGluR7 on the other to test for functional changes. Recently we tested 10 amino acids that are known to be present at substantial concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid, as well as d-serine-O-phosphate, on mGluR from groups I, II, and III and found that only l-Glu and l-SOP displayed measurable interactions (9Kang H.J. Menlove K. Ma J. Wilkins A. Lichtarge O. Wensel T.G.

Therefore, in this study, we restricted the ligands analyzed to those two. We used a combination of sequence and structure analysis to determine the functionally important residues that differentiate group I (mGluR1 and mGluR5), group II (mGluR2 and mGluR3), and group III (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8). Evolutionary trace analysis was performed with rvET and piET algorithms (10Mihalek I. Res I. Lichtarge O. A family of evolution-entropy hybrid methods for ranking protein residues by importance.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1265-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 11Wilkins A.D. Venner E. Marciano D.C. Erdin S. Atri B. Lua R.C. Lichtarge O.

The rvET algorithm measures the importance of a residue based on its variation pattern in the context of the phylogenetic tree. The piET algorithm differs from rvET in that it considers structure and common variation patterns between contacting residues. We used the structure of the glutamate-bound extracellular ligand-binding domain of mGluR1 (PDB code 1EWK) (12Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Structural views of the ligand-binding cores of a metabotropic glutamate receptor complexed with an antagonist and both glutamate and Gd3+.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2660-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) to perform piET calculations on the ligand-binding domain sequences. The submitted protein sequence of rat mGluR4 is NP_073157.1. To construct a multiple sequence alignment, protein sequences were gathered from a BLAST search of the NCBI reference sequence database and aligned with PROMALS3D (13Pei J. Kim B.H. Grishin N.V. PROMALS3D: a tool for multiple protein sequence and structure alignments.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). To identify functional homologues, the proteins sequences were filtered based on protein length (90% of the query protein) and sequence identity (>20%). Evolutionary trace analysis was performed on 311 mGluR homologues. To identify the key residues that differentiate group III from group I/group II, we constructed a set of target substitutions. First, we determined the key residues using rvET analysis of the mGluR subfamily. The residues ranked in the top 30% were selected. We then determined the residues that varied in amino acid type in the respective positions between group III and group I/II. To focus on the targets most likely relevant to ligand response specificity, we eliminated from consideration any residue greater than 20 Å from the bound ligand glutamate in PDB code 1EWK. These steps led to a unique set of six targets that can be found in Table 1 and Fig. 2. Each residue number refers to the corresponding position in the alignments of mGluR4 and mGluR7 to mGluR1, i.e. the numbering in mGluR1 (PDB code 1EWK) is used throughout.TABLE 1Mutations and positions in sequence and structureMutantNumber in mGluR1Number in mGluR4Number in mGluR7RankDistance from ligand%ÅGroups I/II (mGluR1) vs. Group III (mGluR4) Q170 M (M170Q)17016416.011.0 S189A (A189S)18918320.04.2 G319S (S319G)31931314.03.7 L342P (P342L)34233616.07.5 S344R (R344S)34433830.011.1 N415D (D415N)41541128.014.5mGluR4 vs. mGluR7 N74K74747445.32.5 E191D19118518531.99.3 D195N19518918929.913.2 P207S20720120110.78.6 S209T20920320340.410.6 F210Y21020420440.612.2 K239S23923323324.88.7 V288I28828228449.614.1 D293E29328728935.75.1 E294D29428829044.47.2 I338V33833233429.013.8 Q341L34133533725.99.6 Open table in a new tab To identify the key residues that differentiate mGluR7 from the rest of group III, we constructed a second set of substitutions. We found that rvET led to no targets in the top 30%, and therefore we used the updated piET algorithm and expanded the set to include the residues in the top 45%. We then determined at which of these residue positions the amino acid type differs between mGluR7 and the rest of group III. We again eliminated any targets greater than 20 Å from the bound ligand glutamate in PDB code 1EWK. These steps led to a unique set of targets that can be found in Table 1 and Fig. 2.

Pharmacology and functions of metabotropic glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar) intergroup receptor comparison (group I (mGluR1 and mGluR5) and group II (mGluR2 and mGluR3) versus group III (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8)) and (2Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Cohen F.E. An evolutionary trace method defines binding surfaces common to protein families.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar) intermember comparison (mGluR4 versus mGluR7) among group III mGluRs (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 and Table 1). These comparisons were made between subsets of mGluR that respond oppositely to l-SOP (groups I/II versus group III) or respond to l-SOP and l-Glu in ways that differ quantitatively (mGluR4/6 versus mGluR7). In addition, the residues selected were all within 20 Å of the bound ligand and ranked highly in evolutionary importance. Therefore they represented logical targets for altering ligand response specificity, based on the hypothesis that the evolution of receptors with divergent responses to l-SOP and l-Glu has conferred selective advantage. The residue sets identified by ET are indicated in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 and Table 1. When the residues at these positions in mGluR1 were substituted, one at a time, for those at the equivalent positions in mGluR4, all mGluR4 single-point mutants were able to reach the membrane and respond to ligands but displayed significant changes in potency or efficacy in our cell-based Ca2+ release assay. At 100 μm l-SOP, the assay demonstrated the hypothesized importance of these residues, because the residue-swapped versions of mGluR4 displayed significantly decreased function in efficacy or potency. Activation of Gαqo in response to l-SOP was diminished for four of the residue swaps: P342L, D415N, R344S, and S319G. Dose-response curves revealed that l-SOP potency was diminished for P342L, D415N, and R344S (Fig. 2). The maximal response was decreased for P342L and S319G (Fig. 2). Therefore, four of six mGluR4 mutants showed impaired interaction with l-SOP. These mutants showed similar effects with l-Glu. P342L, R344S, and D415N (Fig. 2) showed lowered l-Glu potency compared with WT, and P342L and S319G showed lowered efficacy for l-Glu (Fig. 2), indicating that the corresponding residues in mGluR4 are involved in recognition of not only l-SOP, but also l-Glu. To test whether these same positions are also important for ligand responses in mGluR1, we generated reciprocal mutations by swapping the corresponding amino acids from mGluR4 into mGluR1. For the reciprocal mGluR1 mutants, three of six residue swaps showed increased affinity or selectivity for l-SOP. Recently, we found that l-SOP behaves as an antagonist for mGluR1 at submillimolar concentrations (9Kang H.J. Menlove K. Ma J. Wilkins A. Lichtarge O. Wensel T.G. Selectivity and evolutionary divergence of metabotropic glutamate receptors for endogenous ligands and G proteins coupled to phospholipase C or TRP channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 29961-29974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To test the antagonistic effect of l-SOP on mGluR1 mutants, varying concentrations of l-Glu and a fixed concentration of l-SOP were applied to mGluR1 or mGluR1 mutant-expressing cells. Then the ratio of the EC50 values derived from l-Glu dose-response curves from calcium release assays in the presence and absence of l-SOP was used as an indication of the potency of the antagonistic effect. Of the residues tested, mGluR1-N415D showed a 50% enhancement of l-SOP potency (p < 0.05), with an EC50 value of 0.5 ± 0.1 mm (mean ± S.E., n = 3) as compared with the WT-mGluR1 EC50 value of 1.2 ± 0.12 mm (mean ± S.E., n = 6) (see Fig. 4, A–C). This gain of l-SOP potency by mGluR1-N415D is consistent with the loss of potency by its reciprocal mutant mGluR4-D415N (Fig. 3C). It is striking that the residue is 15 Å away from the bound ligand (based on an l-Glu bound x-ray structure of mGluR1 and l-SOP computationally docked in the x-ray structure of mGluR7, 2E4Z (9Kang H.J.

Interestingly, there are two mutants, mGluR1-S344R and mGluR1-L342P, that significantly decreased the l-Glu response (for mGluR1-S344R, p < 0.05, n = 6, for mGluR1-L342P, p < 0.005, n = 4) but retained the WT potency of l-SOP inhibition, providing greatly enhanced selectivity toward l-SOP versus l-Glu (Fig. 4, C and D, and Table 2). The reciprocal mutants mGluR4-R344S and mGluR4-P342L decreased l-SOP potency, confirming that these positions are involved in l-SOP recognition/binding (Fig. 3C). These results suggest an evolutionary divergence corresponding to the functional separation of group III receptors from group I and group II, in which mGluR1 acquired or retained residues that eliminate physiological l-SOP responses while retaining high sensitivity to l-Glu, whereas mGluR4 retained or acquired residues that allowed sensitivity to physiological levels of both ligands.TABLE 2Activation profiles of mGluR1 mutants for l-Glu or l-SOPKi for l-SOPKi ratio to WTEC50 for l-GluEC50 ratio to WTmmμmmGluR1-WT1.2 ± 0.131 ± 0.152.63 ± 0.411 ± 0.22Q170M1.92 ± 0.161.56 ± 0.214.5 ± 1.01.73 ± 0.49S189A1.02 ± 0.080.84 ± 0.112.13 ± 0.290.81 ± 0.17G319S1.5 ± 0.441.41 ± 0.491.7 ± 0.60.65 ± 0.26L342P1.23 ± 0.291.20 ± 0.2618.6 ± 5.37.07 ± 2.3S344R0.93 ± 0.090.77 ± 0.1133.7 ± 2.812.8 ± 2.3N415D0.51 ± 0.110.43 ± 0.092.1 ± 0.70.79 ± 0.31mGluR1–6M1.83 ± 0.271.53 ± 0.2865.41 ± 6.624.8 ± 4.69 Open table in a new tab To find residues important for the functional divergence of mGluR7, for which both l-Glu and l-SOP have low potency and efficacy, from mGluR4, which is much more sensitive to both ligands, we swapped multiple ET residues from mGluR4 into mGluR7.

https://openalex.org/W1967919827,"Despite the growing interest in membrane proteins, their crystallization remains a major challenge. In the course of a crystallographic study on the multidrug ATP-binding cassette transporter BmrA, mass spectral analyses on samples purified with six selected detergents revealed unexpected protein contamination visible for the most part on overloaded SDS-PAGE. A major contamination from the outer membrane protein OmpF was detected in purifications with Foscholine 12 (FC12) but not with Lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) or any of the maltose-based detergents. Consequently, in the FC12 purified BmrA, OmpF easily crystallized over BmrA in a new space group, and whose structure is reported here. We therefore devised an optimized protocol to eliminate OmpF during the FC12 purification of BmrA. On the other hand, an additional band visible at ∼110 kDa was detected in all samples purified with the maltose-based detergents. It contained AcrB that crystallized over BmrA despite its trace amounts. Highly pure BmrA preparations could be obtained using either a ΔacrAB E. coli strain and n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside, or a classical E. coli strain and lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol for the overexpression and purification, respectively. Overall our results urge to incorporate a proteomics-based purity analysis into quality control checks prior to commencing crystallization assays of membrane proteins that are notoriously arduous to crystallize. Moreover, the strategies developed here to selectively eliminate obstinate contaminants should be applicable to the purification of other membrane proteins overexpressed in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2094655557,"The traditional quantitative genetics model was used as the unifying approach to derive six existing and new definitions of genomic additive and dominance relationships. The theoretical differences of these definitions were in the assumptions of equal SNP effects (equivalent to across-SNP standardization), equal SNP variances (equivalent to within-SNP standardization), and expected or sample SNP additive and dominance variances. The six definitions of genomic additive and dominance relationships on average were consistent with the pedigree relationships, but had individual genomic specificity and large variations not observed from pedigree relationships. These large variations may allow finding least related genomes even within the same family for minimizing genomic relatedness among breeding individuals. The six definitions of genomic relationships generally had similar numerical results in genomic best linear unbiased predictions of additive effects (GBLUP) and similar genomic REML (GREML) estimates of additive heritability. Predicted SNP dominance effects and GREML estimates of dominance heritability were similar within definitions assuming equal SNP effects or within definitions assuming equal SNP variance, but had differences between these two groups of definitions. We proposed a new measure of genomic inbreeding coefficient based on parental genomic co-ancestry coefficient and genomic additive correlation as a genomic approach for predicting offspring inbreeding level. This genomic inbreeding coefficient had the highest correlation with pedigree inbreeding coefficient among the four methods evaluated for calculating genomic inbreeding coefficient in a Holstein sample and a swine sample."

The current model states that NCoR-mediated repression requires its direct interaction with PPARγ in the repressive conformation. Previous studies, however, have shown that DNA-bound PPARγ is incompatible with a direct, high-affinity association with NCoR because of the inherent ability of PPARγ to adopt the active conformation. Here we show that NCoR acquires the ability to repress active PPARγ-mediated transcription via G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2), a component of the NCoR corepressor complex. Unlike NCoR, GPS2 can recognize and bind the active state of PPARγ. In GPS2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, loss of GPS2 markedly reduces the corepressor function of NCoR for PPARγ, leading to constitutive activation of PPARγ target genes and spontaneous adipogenesis of the cells. GPS2, however, is dispensable for repression mediated by unliganded thyroid hormone receptor α or a PPARγ mutant unable to adopt the active conformation. This study shows that GPS2, although dispensable for the intrinsic repression function of NCoR, can mediate a novel corepressor repression pathway that allows NCoR to directly repress active PPARγ-mediated transcription, which is important for the optimal corepressor function of NCoR for PPARγ. Interestingly, GPS2-dependent repression specifically targets PPARγ but not PPARα or PPARδ. Therefore, GPS2 may serve as a unique target to manipulate PPARγ signaling in diseases.Background: PPARγ tends to adopt an active conformation that cannot be directly bound by NCoR.Results: GPS2 binds to active PPARγ, facilitates its repression by NCoR, and is required for the optimal NCoR corepressor function for PPARγ.Conclusion: GPS2 mediates a novel NCoR repression pathway targeting active PPARγ.Significance: The GPS2-dependent pathway provides new insights into how NCoR regulates PPARγ function in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2022904975,"This research examines the relationships between El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), water level, precipitation patterns and carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange rates in the freshwater wetland ecosystems of the Florida Everglades. Data was obtained over a 5-year study period (2009-2013) from two freshwater marsh sites located in Everglades National Park that differ in hydrology. At the short-hydroperiod site (Taylor Slough; TS) and the long-hydroperiod site (Shark River Slough; SRS) fluctuations in precipitation patterns occurred with changes in ENSO phase, suggesting that extreme ENSO phases alter Everglades hydrology which is known to have a substantial influence on ecosystem carbon dynamics. Variations in both ENSO phase and annual net CO2 exchange rates co-occurred with changes in wet and dry season length and intensity. Combined with site-specific seasonality in CO2 exchanges rates, El Niño and La Niña phases magnified season intensity and CO2 exchange rates at both sites. At TS, net CO2 uptake rates were higher in the dry season, whereas SRS had greater rates of carbon sequestration during the wet season. As La Niña phases were concurrent with drought years and extended dry seasons, TS became a greater sink for CO2 on an annual basis (-11 to -110 g CO2 m-2 yr-1) compared to El Niño and neutral years (-5 to -43.5 g CO2 m-2 yr-1). SRS was a small source for CO2 annually (1.81 to 80 g CO2 m-2 yr-1) except in one exceptionally wet year that was associated with an El Niño phase (-16 g CO2 m-2 yr-1). Considering that future climate predictions suggest a higher frequency and intensity in El Niño and La Niña phases, these results indicate that changes in extreme ENSO phases will significantly alter CO2 dynamics in the Florida Everglades."

The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of measuring urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) levels in the diagnosis of atopic diseases in early childhood.Children aged 0 through 4 years from a birth cohort in the Prediction of Allergies in Taiwanese Children (PATCH) study were enrolled. Urinary LTE4 levels were measured and its association between total serum IgE levels, allergen-specific IgE sensitization and atopic diseases were assessed.A total of 182 children were regular followed up at clinics for a four-year follow-up period. Urinary LTE4 levels appeared to be elevated in children with total serum IgE levels exceeding 100 kU/L, allergen-specific IgE sensitization after 2 years of age. Elevation of urinary LTE4 levels (≥500 pg/mg of creatinine) significantly discriminated high serum total IgE levels (≥100 kU/L) at age 2 (P = 0.027). A higher level of total serum IgE or urinary LTE4 was significantly associated with the risk of developing allergic rhinitis and asthma at age 3. A significantly higher urinary LTE4 level was found in children with a combination of IgE sensitization and asthma at age 4.Urinary LTE4 levels appear to be highly associated with IgE sensitization and its related allergic airway diseases after age 2.

https://openalex.org/W1964041937,"Clinical research has become increasingly globalized, but the extent of globalization has not been assessed. To describe the globalization of clinical research, we used all (n = 13,208) multinational trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov to analyzed geographic connections among individual countries. Our findings indicate that 95% (n = 185) of all countries worldwide have participated in multinational clinical research. Growth in the globalization of clinical research peaked in 2009, suggesting that the global infrastructure that supports clinical research might have reached its maximum capacity. Growth in the globalization of clinical research is attributable to increased involvement of non-traditional markets, particularly in South America and Asia. Nevertheless, Europe is the most highly interconnected geographic region (60.64% of global connections), and collectively, Europe, North America, and Asia comprise more than 85% of all global connections. Therefore, while the expansion of clinical trials into non-traditional markets has increased over the last 20 years and connects countries across the globe, traditional markets still dominate multinational clinical research, which appears to have reached a maximum global capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1997938839,"Cutaneous wound healing is delayed by protein malnutrition (PM). On the other hand, estrogen promotes cutaneous wound healing by its anti-inflammatory and cell proliferation effects. Therefore, we hypothesized that estrogen administration in protein-malnourished ovariectomized (OVX) female mice might improve the inflammatory response and promote cutaneous wound healing as well as normal nutrition. To test this hypothesis, we used full-thickness excisional wounds in Control SHAM, PM SHAM, PM OVX and PM OVX+17β-estradiol mice. The Control diet included 200 g/kg protein and the PM diet included 30 g/kg protein. The ratio of wound area in the Control SHAM group was significantly smaller than those in the three PM groups. In addition, microscopic findings also showed that the ratio of collagen fibers, the ratio of myofibroblasts and the number of new blood vessels in the Control SHAM group were significantly greater than those in the three PM groups. However, the number of Ym1-positive cells as an anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophage marker in the PM OVX+17β-estradiol group was significantly higher than those in the other three groups. These results indicate that the appearance of anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages was promoted by estrogen administration; however, it could not promote cutaneous wound healing upon a low-protein diet. Therefore, it may be confirmed that nutrition is more important for promoting cutaneous wound healing than estrogen administration."

This study aimed at determining the fate of non-cellulosic polysaccharides during cotton textile processing. We analyzed non-cellulosic cotton fibre polysaccharides during different steps of cotton textile processing using GC-MS, HPLC and comprehensive microarray polymer profiling to obtain monosaccharide and polysaccharide amounts and linkage compositions. Additionally, in situ detection was used to obtain information on polysaccharide localization and accessibility. We show that pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharide levels decrease during cotton textile processing and that some processing steps have more impact than others. Pectins and arabinose-containing polysaccharides are strongly impacted by the chemical treatments, with most being removed during bleaching and scouring. However, some forms of pectin are more resistant than others. Xylan and xyloglucan are affected in later processing steps and to a lesser extent, whereas callose showed a strong resistance to the chemical processing steps. This study shows that non-cellulosic polysaccharides are differently impacted by the treatments used in cotton textile processing with some hemicelluloses and callose being resistant to these harsh treatments."

Here we first established an immortalized feeder cell line by introducing four antibiotic resistance genes simultaneously into the original SNL 76/7 feeder cell line utilizing the PiggyBac system. This is the feeder cell line with the most diverse types of antibiotic resistance genes reported so far, which will enable researchers to perform simultaneous multiplex gene transfer or gene targeting experiments in ES cells. With such feeder cell line, we were able to quantitatively characterize the transposition efficiency of PiggyBac system in mouse ES cells using five transposons carrying different inducible fluorescence proteins and antibiotic resistance genes, and the efficiency ranged from about 2% for one transposon to 0.5% for five transposons. The highly efficient multiplex gene transfer mediated by PiggyBac will no doubt provide researchers with more choices in biomedical research and development."
https://openalex.org/W2045753285,"Progressive retinal degenerations are among the most common causes of blindness both in human and in dogs. Canine progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) resembles human retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and is typically characterized by a progressive loss of rod photoreceptors followed by a loss of cone function. The disease gradually progress from the loss of night and day vision to a complete blindness. We have recently described a unique form of retinopathy characterized by the multifocal gray/brown discoloration and thinning of the retina in the Swedish Vallhund (SV) breed. We aimed to identify the genetic cause by performing a genome wide association analysis in a cohort of 18 affected and 10 healthy control dogs using Illumina's canine 22k SNP array. We mapped the disease to canine chromosome 17 (p = 7.7×10−5) and found a 6.1 Mb shared homozygous region in the affected dogs. A combined analysis of the GWAS and replication data with additional 60 dogs confirmed the association (p = 4.3×10−8, OR = 11.2 for homozygosity). A targeted resequencing of the entire associated region in four cases and four controls with opposite risk haplotypes identified several variants in the coding region of functional candidate genes, such as a known retinopathy gene, MERTK. However, none of the identified coding variants followed a compelling case- or breed-specific segregation pattern. The expression analyses of four candidate genes in the region, MERTK, NPHP1, ANAPC1 and KRCC1, revealed specific upregulation of MERTK in the retina of the affected dogs. Collectively, these results indicate that the retinopathy is associated with overexpression of MERTK, however further investigation is needed to discover the regulatory mutation for the better understanding of the disease pathogenesis. Our study establishes a novel gain-of-function model for the MERTK biology and provides a therapy model for retinopathy MERTK inhibitors. Meanwhile, a marker-based genetic counseling can be developed to revise breeding programs."

See Articles p.355 & p.361 Stephen Cusack and colleagues have solved the crystal structure of the complete influenza polymerase, comprising subunits PA, PB1 and PB2, bound to its viral RNA promoter. In the first of two papers they present the structure of the polymerase from a bat-specific influenza A virus, which is evolutionarily close to human/avian influenza A strains. The second paper presents the structure of the polymerase from a human isolate of influenza B. Together, the structures provide a wealth of information about how the influenza polymerase functions and how the different subunits interact with each other."
https://openalex.org/W2137609924,"Background Theory predicts that prey facing a combination of predators with different feeding modes have two options: to express a response against the feeding mode of the most dangerous predator, or to express an intermediate response. Intermediate phenotypes protect equally well against several feeding modes, rather than providing specific protection against a single predator. Anti-predator traits that protect against a common feeding mode displayed by all predators should be expressed regardless of predator combination, as there is no need for trade-offs. Principal Findings We studied phenotypic anti-predator responses of zebra mussels to predation threat from a handling-time-limited (crayfish) and a gape-size-limited (roach) predator. Both predators dislodge mussels from the substrate but diverge in their further feeding modes. Mussels increased expression of a non-specific defense trait (attachment strength) against all combinations of predators relative to a control. In response to roach alone, mussels showed a tendency to develop a weaker and more elongated shell. In response to crayfish, mussels developed a harder and rounder shell. When exposed to either a combination of predators or no predator, mussels developed an intermediate phenotype. Mussel growth rate was positively correlated with an elongated weaker shell and negatively correlated with a round strong shell, indicating a trade-off between anti-predator responses. Field observations of prey phenotypes revealed the presence of both anti-predator phenotypes and the trade-off with growth, but intra-specific population density and bottom substrate had a greater influence than predator density. Conclusions Our results show that two different predators can exert both functionally equivalent and inverse selection pressures on a single prey. Our field study suggests that abiotic factors and prey population density should be considered when attempting to explain phenotypic diversity in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W2118121288,"Variation in immune defence in birds is often explained either by external factors such as food availability and disease pressure or by internal factors such as moult and reproductive effort. We explored these factors together in one sampling design by measuring immune activity over the time frame of the moulting period of Arctic-breeding barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis). We assessed baseline innate immunity by measuring levels of complement-mediated lysis and natural antibody-mediated agglutination together with total and differential leukocyte counts. Variation in immune activity during moult was strongly associated with calendar date and to a smaller degree with the growth stage of wing feathers. We suggest that the association with calendar date reflected temporal changes in the external environment. This environmental factor was further explored by comparing the immune activity of geese in the Arctic population with conspecifics in the temperate climate zone at comparable moult stages. In the Arctic environment, which has a lower expected disease load, geese exhibited significantly lower values of complement-mediated lysis, their blood contained fewer leukocytes, and levels of phagocytic cells and reactive leukocytes were relatively low. This suggests that lower baseline immune activity could be associated with lower disease pressure. We conclude that in our study species, external factors such as food availability and disease pressure have a greater effect on temporal variation of baseline immune activity than internal factors such as moult stage."
https://openalex.org/W2007958710,"Lewis Carroll's English word game Doublets is represented as a system of networks with each node being an English word and each connectivity edge confirming that its two ending words are equal in letter length, but different by exactly one letter. We show that this system, which we call the Doublets net, constitutes a complex body of linguistic knowledge concerning English word structure that has computable multiscale features. Distributed morphological, phonological and orthographic constraints and the language's local redundancy are seen at the node level. Phonological communities are seen at the network level. And a balancing act between the language's global efficiency and redundancy is seen at the system level. We develop a new measure of intrinsic node-to-node distance and a computational algorithm, called community geometry, which reveal the implicit multiscale structure within binary networks. Because the Doublets net is a modular complex cognitive system, the community geometry and computable multi-scale structural information may provide a foundation for understanding computational learning in many systems whose network structure has yet to be fully analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2032563733,"Assessment of cerebral ischemia often employs dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI) with evaluation of various peak enhancement time parameters. All of these parameters use a single time threshold to judge the maximum tolerable peak enhancement delay that is supposed to reliably differentiate sufficient from critical perfusion. As the validity of this single threshold approach still remains unclear, in this study, (1) the definition of a threshold on an individual patient-basis, nevertheless (2) preserving the comparability of the data, was investigated.The histogram of time-to-peak (TTP) values derived from DSC-MRI, the so-called TTP-distribution curve (TDC), was modeled using a double-Gaussian model in 61 patients without severe cerebrovascular disease. Particular model-based zf-scores were used to describe the arterial, parenchymal and venous bolus-transit phase as time intervals Ia,p,v. Their durations (delta Ia,p,v), were then considered as maximum TTP-delays of each phase.Mean-R2 for the model-fit was 0.967. Based on the generic zf-scores the proposed bolus transit phases could be differentiated. The Ip-interval reliably depicted the parenchymal bolus-transit phase with durations of 3.4 s-10.1 s (median = 4.3s), where an increase with age was noted (∼30 ms/year).Individual threshold-adjustment seems rational since regular bolus-transit durations in brain parenchyma obtained from the TDC overlap considerably with recommended critical TTP-thresholds of 4 s-8 s. The parenchymal transit time derived from the proposed model may be utilized to individually correct TTP-thresholds, thereby potentially improving the detection of critical perfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2045325144,"Competition is ubiquitous in many complex biological, social, and technological systems, playing an integral role in the evolutionary dynamics of the systems. It is often useful to determine the dominance hierarchy or the rankings of the components of the system that compete for survival and success based on the outcomes of the competitions between them. Here we propose a ranking method based on the random walk on the network representing the competitors as nodes and competitions as directed edges with asymmetric weights. We use the edge weights and node degrees to define the gradient on each edge that guides the random walker towards the weaker (or the stronger) node, which enables us to interpret the steady-state occupancy as the measure of the node's weakness (or strength) that is free of unwarranted degree-induced bias. We apply our method to two real-world competition networks and explore the issues of ranking stabilization and prediction accuracy, finding that our method outperforms other methods including the baseline win–loss differential method in sparse networks."
