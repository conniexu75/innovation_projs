https://openalex.org/W2134145060,"A psychological space is established for any set of stimuli by determining metric distances between the stimuli such that the probability that a response learned to any stimulus will generalize to any other is an invariant monotonic function of the distance between them. To a good approximation, this probability of generalization (i) decays exponentially with this distance, and (ii) does so in accordance with one of two metrics, depending on the relation between the dimensions along which the stimuli vary. These empirical regularities are mathematically derivable from universal principles of natural kinds and probabilistic geometry that may, through evolutionary internalization, tend to govern the behaviors of all sentient organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2089511414,"Biomaterials are being used with increasing frequency for tissue substitution. Complex devices such as total joint replacements and the total artificial heart represent combinations of polymers and metal alloys for system and organ replacement. The major barriers to the extended use of these devices are the possibility of bacterial adhesion to biomaterials, which causes biomaterial-centered infection, and the lack of successful tissue integration or compatibility with biomaterial surfaces. Interactions of biomaterials with bacteria and tissue cells are directed not only by specific receptors and outer membrane molecules on the cell surface, but also by the atomic geometry and electronic state of the biomaterial surface. An understanding of these mechanisms is important to all fields of medicine and is derived from and relevant to studies in microbiology, biochemistry, and physics. Modifications to biomaterial surfaces at an atomic level will allow the programming of cell-to-substratum events, thereby diminishing infection by enhancing tissue compatibility or integration, or by directly inhibiting bacterial adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2019943307,"Contemporary research in cognitive psychology reveals the impact of nonconscious mental structures and processes on the individual's conscious experience, thought, and action. Research on perceptual-cognitive and motoric skills indicates that they are automatized through experience, and thus rendered unconscious. In addition, research on subliminal perception, implicit memory, and hypnosis indicates that events can affect mental functions even though they cannot be consciously perceived or remembered. These findings suggest a tripartite division of the cognitive unconscious into truly unconscious mental processes operating on knowledge structures that may themselves be preconscious or subconscious."

Mutations that affect the ability of the envelope glycoprotein to form syncytia in CD4+ cells can be divided into five groups: those that decrease the binding of the envelope protein to the CD4 molecule, those that prevent a post-binding fusion reaction, those that disrupt the anchorage of the envelope glycoprotein in the membrane, those that affect the association of the two subunits of the envelope glycoprotein, and those that affect post-translational proteolytic processing of the envelope precursor protein. These findings provide a functional model of the HIV envelope glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2053037116,"The African green monkey nonlymphoid cell line cos-1 produces infectious HTLV-III virus following transfection with biologically active molecular clones of HTLV-III. Transfected cos-1 cells produce large amounts of viral RNA and protein. We have used this rapid transfection system to study the regulatory functions and synthetic capacity of the HTLV-III genome, as well as mutants derived from it. Analysis of transfected lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines suggests that tat-III-mediated trans-activation of viral gene expression is operative predominantly, if not exclusively, at a posttranscriptional level. We have also identified an additional HTLV-III-encoded gene that controls viral gene expression through regulation of the relative proportions of the various viral RNA transcripts and is required for viral replication."

https://openalex.org/W2028549678,A complementary DNA clone derived from rat brain messenger RNA has been isolated on the basis of homology to the human thyroid hormone receptor gene. Expression of this complementary DNA produces a high-affinity binding protein for thyroid hormones. Sequence analysis and the mapping of this gene to a distinct human genetic locus indicate the existence of multiple human thyroid hormone receptors. Messenger RNA from this gene is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion with highest levels in the central nervous system.

https://openalex.org/W2004518245,"Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix) learned a category for syllable-initial [d] followed by a dozen different vowels. After learning to categorize syllables consisting of [d], [b], or [g] followed by four different vowels, quail correctly categorized syllables in which the same consonants preceded eight novel vowels. Acoustic analysis of the categorized syllables revealed no single feature or pattern of features that could support generalization, suggesting that the quail adopted a more complex mapping of stimuli into categories. These results challenge theories of speech sound classification that posit uniquely human capacities."
https://openalex.org/W2053813431,"The validity of mouse liver tumor end points in assessing the potential hazards of chemical exposure to humans is a controversial but important issue, since liver neoplasia in mice is the most frequent tumor target tissue end point in 2-year carcinogenicity studies. The ability to distinguish between promotion of background tumors versus a genotoxic mechanism of tumor initiation by chemical treatment would aid in the interpretation of rodent carcinogenesis data. Activated oncogenes in chemically induced and spontaneously occurring mouse liver tumors were examined and compared as one approach to determine the mechanism by which chemical treatment caused an increased incidence of mouse liver tumors. Data suggest that furan and furfural caused an increased incidence in mouse liver tumors at least in part by induction of novel weakly activating point mutations in ras genes even though both chemicals did not induce mutations in Salmonella assays. In addition to ras oncogenes, two activated raf genes and four non-ras transforming genes were detected. The B6C3F1 mouse liver may thus provide a sensitive assay system to detect various classes of proto-oncogenes that are susceptible to activation by carcinogenic insult. As illustrated with mouse liver tumors, analysis of activated oncogenes in spontaneously occurring and chemically induced rodent tumors will provide information at a molecular level to aid in the use of rodent carcinogenesis data for risk assessment."

The transduced keratinocytes secreted biologically active growth hormone into the culture medium. When grafted as an epithelial sheet onto athymic mice, these cultured keratinocytes reconstituted an epidermis that was similar in appearance to that resulting from normal cells, but from which human growth hormone could be extracted. Transduced epidermal cells may prove to be a general vehicle for the delivery of gene products by means of grafting."
https://openalex.org/W2002781096,"A novel mobilizable intracellular compartment was identified in human neutrophils by latent alkaline phosphatase activity. This compartment is mobilized to the plasma membrane much more readily than any identified granule subset and has kinetics of up-regulation in the membrane similar to those reported for a variety of receptor proteins. Triton X-100 permeabilization of both intact human neutrophils and subcellular fractions obtained by density-gradient centrifugation revealed that 70 percent of the alkaline phosphatase is located in an intracellular compartment distinct from primary, secondary, and gelatinase granules and from the plasma membrane. This compartment fully translocates to the plasma membrane after stimulation with nanomolar concentrations of the chemotactic peptide N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine."
https://openalex.org/W1971314065,"The splicing process, which removes intervening sequences from messenger RNA (mRNA) precursors is essential to gene expression in eukaryotic cells. This site-specific process requires precise sequence recognition at the boundaries of an intervening sequence, but the mechanism of this recognition is not understood. The splicing of mRNA precursors occurs in a multicomponent complex termed the spliceosome. Such an assembly of components is likely to play a key role in specifying those sequences to be spliced. In order to analyze spliceosome structure, a stringent approach was developed to obtain splicing complexes free of cellular contaminants. This approach is a form of affinity chromatography based on the high specificity of the biotin-streptavidin interaction. A minimum of three subunits: U2, U5, and U4 + U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles were identified in the 35S spliceosome structure, which also contains the bipartite RNA intermediate of splicing. A 25S presplicing complex contained only the U2 particle. The multiple subunit structure of the spliceosome has implications for the regulation of a splicing event and for its possible catalysis by ribozyme or ribozymes."

https://openalex.org/W1500459843,"A physical DNA binding assay was employed to analyze the binding of yeast RNA polymerase III transcription factor C (TFIIIC) to tRNA genes. The assay allowed us to measure the equilibrium constants for specific and nonspecific TFIIIC-DNA binding and to assess the effects of tRNATyr-DNA gene promoter mutations on binding. Sequence alterations in the B block element of the promoter greatly affect the equilibrium constant for specific TFIIIC binding (K8). Mutations which decrease tRNATyr homology to the recognized B block consensus sequence drastically reduce K8 (43- to 370-fold), while mutations which increase homology increase K8 (4- to 5-fold). By contrast, point mutations in the A block element of the tRNATyr promoter have less than 2-fold effects on K8; however, total deletion of A block sequences reduces K8 2- to 5-fold. These results indicate that TFIIIC-rTNA gene binding involves interactions with both A block and B block sequences, but B block interactions dominate, and the relative contribution of A block interactions is small. Since A block sequences are absolutely required for active tRNA gene transcription, the binding results suggest that the role of A block sequences in transcription is not confined solely to TFIIIC binding."
https://openalex.org/W1602991363,"Abstract A new Mr 43,000 tropomyosin-binding protein (TMBP) has been identified in erythrocyte membranes by binding of 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter tropomyosin to nitrocellulose blots of membrane proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. This protein is not actin, because 125I-tropomyosin does not bind to purified actin on blots. Binding of 125I-tropomyosin to this protein is specific because it is inhibited by excess unlabeled tropomyosin but not by F-actin or muscle troponins. This protein has been purified to 95% homogeneity from a 1 M Tris extract of tropomyosin-depleted erythrocyte membranes by DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite chromatography, followed by gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 44. The purified protein has a Stokes radius of 3.9 nm and a sedimentation coefficient of 2.8 S, corresponding to a native molecular weight of 43,000. Binding of 125I-tropomyosin to the purified TMBP saturates at one tropomyosin molecule (Mr 60,000) to two Mr 43,000 TMBPs, with an affinity of about 5 X 10(-7) M. The TMBP is associated with the membrane skeleton after extraction of membranes with the non-ionic detergent, Triton X-100, and is present with respect to tropomyosin at a ratio of about one for every two tropomyosin molecules. Because there is enough tropomyosin for two tropomyosin molecules to be associated with each of the short actin filaments in the membrane skeleton, the erythrocyte membrane TMBP, together with tropomyosin, could function to restrict the number of spectrin molecules attached to each of the short actin filaments and thus specify the hexagonal symmetry of the spectrin-actin lattice. Alternatively, this TMBP could be homologous to one of the muscle troponins and might function with tropomyosin to regulate erythrocyte actomyosin-ATPase activity and influence erythrocyte shape."
https://openalex.org/W1487010108,"We studied the in vitro assembly and stability of RNA polymerase III transcription complexes on the 5 S RNA and tRNAMet genes of Xenopus and the VA genes of adenovirus. Complete and partial assemblies were formed on these genes using transcription factor IIIA from Xenopus ovaries and factors IIIB and IIIC from HeLa cells. The complexes were purified away from unbound factors by filtration through Sepharose 4B columns and then assayed for transcription in the presence of Xenopus polymerase III. The 5 S gene complexes were also investigated using a postlabeling DNase I footprinting technique that we devised. The binding of factor IIIA to the 5 S gene facilitated the binding of factor IIIC; this subassembly was required for factor IIIB to bind. On the VA I and tRNA genes, factor IIIC alone bound and allowed IIIB to bind. RNA polymerase bound last to form a preinitiation complex, but it was less stably affixed than any of the factors. The complete factor complexes on the 5 S and VA I genes were strikingly stable to brief exposure to high salt concentrations, and the stability of the factor IIIB interaction was limiting. Two modes of IIIC binding were distinguished that differed in stability and specificity. Assembly of the complexes did not require ATP, and faithful transcription occurred when adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate was substituted for ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2040539838,"In eukaryotes pre-tRNA species are processed at the 5′ end by an endonuclease. Here we describe the first characterization of the structure of a eukaryotic pre-tRNA 5′ processing endonuclease. The 5′ pre-tRNAase, isolated from X. laevis ovaries, copurifies with a 16S macromolecular complex consisting of at least 14 polypeptides ranging in MW from about 20,000 to 32,000. These polypeptides comprise a cylindrical particle, apparently organized as a stack of four rings, similar or identical to a ubiquitous eukaryotic subcellular particle described in the literature over the past 15 years. Similar copurification is observed for the enzyme from HeLa cells, suggesting that the X. laevis enzyme is representative of a general class of eukaryotic pre-tRNA 5′ processing nuclease."
https://openalex.org/W2166483827,"Rat liver slices were pulse labeled for 6 min with [3H]mevalonolactone and then chased for 90 min with unlabeled mevalonolactone in order to study the mechanism of dolichyl phosphate biosynthesis. The cholesterol pathway was also monitored and served to verify the pulse-chase. Under conditions in which radioactivity in the methyl sterol fraction chased to cholesterol, radioactivity in alpha-unsaturated polyprenyl (pyro)-phosphate chased almost exclusively into dolichyl (pyro)phosphate. Lesser amounts of radioactivity appeared in alpha-unsaturated polyprenol and dolichol, and neither exhibited significant decline after 90 min of incubation. The relative rates of cholesterol versus dolichyl phosphate biosynthesis were studied in rat liver under four different nutritional conditions using labeled acetate, while the absolute rates of cholesterol synthesis were determined using 3H2O. From these determinations, the absolute rates of dolichyl phosphate synthesis were calculated. The absolute rates of cholesterol synthesis were found to vary 42-fold while the absolute rates of dolichyl phosphate synthesis were unchanged. To determine the basis for this effect, the rates of synthesis of cholesterol and dolichyl phosphate were quantitated as a function of [3H]mevalonolactone concentration. Plots of nanomoles incorporated into the two lipids were nearly parallel, yielding Km values on the order of 1 mM. In addition, increasing concentrations of mevinolin yielded parallel inhibition of incorporation of [3H]acetate into cholesterol and dolichyl phosphate. The specific activity of squalene synthase in liver microsomes from rats having the highest rate of cholesterol synthesis was only 2-fold greater than in microsomes from rats having the lowest rate. Taken together, the results suggest that the maintenance of constant dolichyl phosphate synthesis under conditions of enhanced cholesterogenesis is not due to saturation of the dolichyl phosphate pathway by either farnesyl pyrophosphate or isopentenyl pyrophosphate but coordinate regulation of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and a reaction on the pathway from farnesyl pyrophosphate to cholesterol."

https://openalex.org/W1547215445,"Of 30 proteins identified in medium from primary Sertoli cell-enriched cultures, five of these proteins appear to increase primarily in response to testosterone. Using high performance liquid chromatography, two of these proteins, designated CMB-22 and CMB-23, were purified to apparent homogeneity from medium. Both are monomeric proteins with apparent molecular weights of Mr 37,000 and Mr 40,000, respectively. Both interact with concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin on lectin blots. CMB-22 has a pI of 5.8; CMB-23 has two distinctive isoelectric variants with pIs of 5.4 and 5.2, the latter variant was designated CMB-23 Isoform. Polyvalent antisera raised against purified CMB-22 and CMB-23 in rabbits cross-reacted with one another. Removal of carbohydrate from these proteins by either enzymatic or chemical treatments reduced their apparent molecular weights but did not abolish their size differences on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Peptide maps generated by Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 and visualized by silver staining and immunoblots suggest that CMB-22 and CMB-23 are similar but distinctive proteins that share almost identical epitopes. A radioimmunoassay was developed and used to measure total immunoreactive CMB-22-like material (CMB-22 plus CMB-23 immunoreactivity) in culture media, biological fluids, and tissue extracts. The results of these studies showed that the secretion of CMB-22-like material is unique with regard to other proteins that have been identified in Sertoli cell-enriched cultures. That is, CMB-22-like material is secreted by Sertoli cell-enriched cultures, but cannot be detected in media from cultures of intact tubular segments in vitro. In addition, immunoreactive material is also not detected in the testicular fluids from interstitium, tubule, or rete testis. This is in striking contrast to other Sertoli cell proteins which are present in substantial concentrations in these fluids. These observations suggest that the secretion and possibly the hormone responsiveness of CMB-22 and CMB-23 are normally suppressed in the intact tubule both in vivo and in vitro. We propose that studies of CMB-22 and CMB-23 will provide important insights into cell-cell interactions in the seminiferous epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2058047705,"The topographic map of cell position in the avian retina is inverted in its projection to the optic tectum. Dorsal retinal ganglion cell axons project to ventral tectum, and ventral retinal ganglion cells project to dorsal tectum. Topographic gradients of toponymic (TOP) cell surface molecules along the dorsoventral axes of retina and tectum also are inverted. TOP molecules are most abundant in dorsal retina and ventral tectum and least abundant in ventral retina and dorsal tectum during the period of initial retinal-tectal interaction. Thus, TOP molecules may be involved in orienting the retinotectal map."
https://openalex.org/W1970425406,"In the early decades of the century a number of geneticists and psychologists believed that intelligence in the economically advanced nations was in secular decline. Contrary to this expectation, recent data for a number of countries have shown that intelligence has been increasing at rates far greater than hitherto considered probable. A compilation of this data by Flynn for 14 economically advanced nations has shown that intelligence quotient (IQ) rises have generally been within the range of 2-12 IQ points per decade. These recent studies raise several questions, among which are precisely what abilities have been increasing over time; and whether existing data are correct in suggesting that the secular rise in Britain is lower than that in other countries. We report here that in English children there has been an increase over the past 50 years of 12.42 IQ points, averaging 2.48 points per decade. The increase has been in fluid intelligence, the mental power that underlies the acquisition of cognitive skills, rather than in crystallized intelligence, which represents the cognitive skills acquired in a particular culture."

https://openalex.org/W1969997692,"Human malignant melanoma cells express specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (mel-CSPG) on the surface, both in vivo and in vitro. Melanocytes in normal skin show no detectable mel-CSPG but can be induced to express the antigen when cultured in the presence of cholera toxin and the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Most other cell types do not express mel-CSPG either in vivo or in vitro. A study was designed to examine regulatory signals controlling mel-CSPG expression. The gene encoding mel-CSPG was mapped to human chromosome 15, and this chromosome was introduced into rodent cells derived from distinct differentiation lineages. Three types of mel-CSPG--expressing hybrids were found: (i) hybrids derived from human melanomas; (ii) hybrids derived from human cells that do not express mel-CSPG; and (iii) hybrids derived from human cells expressing mel-CSPG that are antigen-negative but that are induced to express mel-CSPG when cultured on extracellular matrix instead of plastic surfaces. Thus, mel-CSPG expression can be controlled both through intrinsic signals, provided by the differentiation program of the rodent fusion partner, and through extrinsic signals, provided by specific cell-matrix interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1958895744,"In vitro incubation of human plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL) with human blood polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) for 1 h at 37 degrees C resulted in an increased (2-4-fold) release into the medium of an enzymatic activity which co-eluted with LDL by column chromatography at physiological ionic strength but dissociated from it in high salt media in an ultracentrifugal field. The release of this enzymatic activity increased with increasing concentration of LDL in the medium and caused the hydrolysis of the LDL apoprotein B100 as indicated by the appearance of 7-8 low molecular weight bands (immunoreactive with anti-LDL) which were not present in the electropherogram of control LDL. The proteolytic activity was identified as an elastase by the following criteria: 1) capacity to hydrolyze the synthetic substrate methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide known to be specific for the PMN elastase, 2) pattern of apo-B proteolysis identical to that exhibited by pure PMN elastase, 3) inhibition of the proteolysis by the elastase inhibitor methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-CH2Cl, 4) identity in molecular weight (28,000-30,000) of this activity with a pure preparation of PMN elastase labeled with [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate. Based on thiobarbituric acid analyses and the lack of effect by vitamin E, oxidative events appeared to play no detectable role in apo-B proteolysis. Since we previously reported (Byrne, R. E., Polacek, D., Gordon, J. I., and Scanu, A. M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14531-14543) that high density lipoprotein-3 promotes the in vitro release of PMN elastase which cleaves apo-A-II, it is apparent that in vitro, both LDL and high density lipoprotein, two of the major plasma lipoprotein classes, can affect the export from PMN of an elastase which exhibits proteolytic action on apo-B and apo-A-II."
https://openalex.org/W1578966267,Growth-inhibitory concentrations of racemic sn-1(3)-dodecylglycerol inhibit the incorporation of [14C] glycerol into lipids and lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus mutans BHT and alter the per cent composition of the glycerolipids. Increases in phosphatidic acid and diphosphatidylglycerol (at the expense of phosphatidylglycerol) contribute the most to the change in lipid composition. No cellular lysis occurs under these conditions. Radioactive racemic sn-1(3)-dodecylglycerol is readily taken up by the cell and is metabolized primarily to lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid with smaller amounts converted to phosphatidylglycerol and diacylglycerol. The accumulation of phosphatidic acid and the loss of viability respond in parallel to different concentrations of dodecylglycerol. An increase in CTP is also observed which together with the increase in phosphatidic acid suggests a possible impairment in the synthesis of CDP-diacylglycerol.

https://openalex.org/W1564334094,"Arginine residues in the transit peptides of mitochondrial precursors are proposed to be important for uptake into mitochondria. To study this further, we have used cassette mutagenesis to create site-specific amino acid replacements within the transit peptide of rat mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase. Plasmids containing mutant sequences were expressed in vitro and tested in a mitochondrial uptake system utilizing isolated rat liver mitochondria. Substitution for arginine at position 14 with asparagine, glutamine, or alanine decreased the relative import level by 20-30% compared to the wild-type sequence when assayed in 1-h uptake experiments. Although lysine substitution did not alter import, substitution with glutamic acid decreased import by 40%. Alanine substitution for arginines at both positions 14 and 15 also dramatically decreased import. Uptake was partially restored in this mutant when positive charge was inserted at a new location within the transit peptide. Time course experiments showed that the initial rates of import were decreased in these mutants, as were the relative amounts of incorporated protein. These results were best explained by the loss of positive charge following amino acid substitutions for the arginine residues and suggest that the role of the charge is to enhance the efficiency of membrane translocation."

H. halobium's HMG-CoA reductase was soluble and required NADPH as its reduced coenzyme. Maximum HMG-CoA reductase activity (4-10 nmol/min/mg of soluble protein) was obtained in buffers which contained 3.5 M KCl. Mevinolin (a) blocked growth of H. halobium, (b) was a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (Ki = 20 nM), (c) did not cause the paradoxical increase in assayable reductase activity, as reported for eukaryotic cells, and (d) caused a rapid (within 30 min) 8-12-fold accumulation of intracellular HMG-CoA. Mevalonate blocked and reversed mevinolin-mediated HMG-CoA accumulation. Although mevinolin-treated cell's growth was restored by mevalonate, HMG-CoA reductase's activity was not. Thus, H. halobium is a unique biological model which allows one to study the regulation of intracellular HMG-CoA concentration and not HMG-CoA reductase activity (content) in response to mevalonate availability."

https://openalex.org/W1517278511,"The gene for tRNAMet1 from Xenopus oocytes was transcribed in a cell free system with components isolated from a HeLa cell-free extract. It was found that, apart from the established assembly of transcription factors IIIB and IIIC on tRNA genes into stable transcription complexes, these factors can also associate with the enzyme in the absence of DNA to form a functional polymerase III complex. These complexes can be isolated in a highly active form from the bulk of other cellular proteins by mild methods such as gel filtration or density gradient centrifugation. When associated with RNA polymerase III into a functional complex, the transcription factors IIIB and IIIC can clearly be differentiated from free transcription factors, which individually display a much lower relative molecular mass. The polymerase complexes are stable against 1 M KCl, rendering unlikely that they represent fortuitous aggregates including RNA polymerase III and transcription factors IIIB and IIIC. These complexes are sensitive to dilution and, whereas transcription factor IIIC binds to the enzyme more tightly, factor IIIB tends to leak from the complex upon dilution of the protein concentration. From these results it is clear that in addition to their function as DNA-binding protein(s), transcription factors IIIB and IIIC can directly interact with RNA polymerase III without prior binding to the promoter region of the gene to be transcribed."
https://openalex.org/W1491501549,"Abstract Using a gel mobility-shift assay, a nuclear protein factor was identified in cardiac myocyte which binds specifically to a DNA fragment from the 5' region of the alpha-myosin heavy chain gene shown previously to contain a thyroid hormone-sensitive element. Methylation interference experiments located the binding site within a 24-base pair sequence from positions -599 to -576. A double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide containing this 24-base pair sequence bound to the factor and effectively competed with the natural binding site for factor binding. The factor was present in rat and human fibroblasts, and rat GH1 cells as well as L6E9 myoblasts and myotubes. The specificity with which this factor binds to DNA suggests that it could be involved in regulation of the alpha-myosin heavy chain gene."
https://openalex.org/W1975715901,"We have constructed three base-substitution mutants of the yeast tRNALeu3 gene. In two of them the ability to form an extended anticodon stem is lost. In the first mutant the bases encoding the anticodon change from TTG to GAC (positions 37, 36, 35); in the second, the nucleotides encoding the region of the intron that base-pair with the anticodon change from CAA to GTC (positions 48, 47, 46). The third is a double mutant characterized by both substitutions described above so that its ability to form an extended anticodon stem is restored. The precursors derived from the two single mutants are accurately spliced in the X. laevis germinal vesicles (GV) extract: pairing of the anticodon with the intron, therefore, is not required for the splicing reaction. The precursor derived from the double mutant is not spliced, indicating that the new extended anticodon stem exerts an inhibitory action. Since the double mutant precursor binds to the purified splicing endonuclease, binding and cleavage occur as two separable steps in the intron excision reaction."

LDL were digested with human kallikrein and thrombin to yield two major fragments: K1 (Mr 410,000) and K2 (Mr 145,000) and T1 (Mr 385,000) and T2 (Mr 170,000), respectively. The antigenic sequences, Mr, and amino acid compositions of K1 and K2 were identical to those of plasma B-74 and B-26; B-26 and K2 had identical NH2-terminal sequences and correspond to the NH2-terminal region of B-100. K1 was further degraded by kallikrein to give K3 (Mr 235,000) and K4 (Mr 170,000); these peptides correspond immunochemically to two newly discovered plasma LDL peptides B-44 and B-30 and are assigned as complementary fragments of B-74. The thrombin cleavage fragments, T1 and T2, did not correspond to B-74 and B-26. Neither kallikrein nor thrombin generated a fragment from B-100 corresponding to B-48 in chylomicrons. However, B-48 showed antigenic homology with B-26 and to the of B-74 adjoining B-26, indicating that its structure is represented in the NH2-terminal half of B-100. The structural studies further clarify the relatedness among the B-100, B-74, B-26, and B-48 polypeptides and should now make possible the delineation of the functional domains mediating the interactions of apolipoprotein B in the circulation and arterial wall."

The unknown kinin was purified from a pool of human urine. Amino acid sequencing revealed a structure similar to Lys-bradykinin except that proline in position 4 was replaced by alanine ([Ala3]Lys-bradykinin). Synthetic and endogenous [Ala3]Lys-bradykinins had similar high performance liquid chromotography elution volumes and both had vasodilator activity and contracted the rat uterus. Human urinary kallikrein incubated with semipurified human low molecular weight kininogen released 76% of the total kinins as Lys-bradykinin, 7% as bradykinin, and 17% as [Ala3]Lys-bradykinin. In contrast, rat urinary kallikrein released 86% bradykinin, 18% Lys-bradykinin, and negligible amounts of [Ala3]Lys-bradykinin. The study revealed the presence of a new kinin, [Ala3]Lys-bradykinin, in human urine and it also proves that the types of kinins generated intrarenally are species-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1532451690,"A protein synthesis inhibitor, solubilized from vaccinia virus (Ben-Hamida, F., Person, A., and Beaud, G. (1983) J. Virol. 45, 452-455), has been purified to homogeneity, yielding a basic protein with molecular mass of 11 kDa. This purified protein migrates as a single spot in two-dimensional gel analysis (isoelectric point above 8.6). It is phosphorylated by the vaccinia-associated protein kinase, and it aggregates in the absence of reducing agents. This 11-kDa protein inhibits protein synthesis when added to a reticulocyte lysate at a stoichiometric ratio of approximately one protein molecule/ribosome, and it associates with the ribosome fraction after incubation in reticulocyte lysates or in Ehrlich ascites tumor cell lysates. As previously described for the inhibitor associated with vaccinia cores, the purified inhibitor inhibits the formation of the 40 S ribosomal subunit X Met-tRNAi ribosomal initiation complex. It has no detectable effect on the formation of the ternary complex (Met-tRNAi X GTP X eucaryotic initiation factor 2). This inhibitor associated with vaccinia virus particles may be involved in the shutoff of host protein synthesis and may also be responsible for the absence of virus replication in some cell-virus systems."
https://openalex.org/W1557640045,"We have analyzed the transcription unit of the gene coding for the erythrocyte-specific histone H5. RNA transcripts elongated in vitro by permeabilized immature cells hybridized to the template strand of the structural gene as well as to 3'-flanking sequences. Approximately 90% of the engaged RNA polymerase II molecules terminate transcription within a region of about 500 base pairs immediately downstream of the polyadenylation site. S1 nuclease protection experiments indicated that the downstream sequences are also transcribed in vivo, their relative amounts reflecting the distribution of RNA polymerases observed in vitro. RNA molecules extending up to 1.14 kilobase pairs downstream of the polyadenylation site were detected, but no unique site of termination was found. The sequence of the transcription termination region shows no obvious homology to those of other RNA polymerase II termination regions. The possible involvement of altered DNA and/or chromatin structures in the transcription termination process is discussed."

On the basis of 1H NMR studies, Hurd and co-workers (Hurd, R. E., Robillard, G. T., and Reid, B. R. (1977) Biochemistry 16, 2095-2100) concluded that the interaction between positions 8 and 14 is absent in Escherichia coli tRNAs with only 3 base pairs in the dihydrouridine stem. We have taken advantage of the unique 15N chemical shift of N3 in thiouridine to identify 1H and 15N resonances for the imino units of S4U8 and s4U9 in E. coli tRNASer1 and tRNATyr2. Model studies with chloroform-soluble derivatives of uridine and 4-thiouridine show that the chemical shifts of the protons in the imino moieties move downfield from 7.9 to 14.4 ppm and from 9.1 to 15.7 ppm, respectively; whereas, the corresponding 15N chemical shifts move downfield from 157.5 to 162.5 ppm and from 175.5 to 180.1 ppm upon hydrogen bonding to 5'-O-acetyl-2',3'-isopropylidene adenosine. The large difference in 15N chemical shifts for U and s4U allows one to unambiguously identify s4U imino resonances by 15N NMR spectroscopy. E. coli tRNASer1 and tRNATyr2 were selectively enriched with 15N at N3 of all uridines and modified uridines. Two-dimensional 1H-15N chemical shift correlation NMR spectroscopy revealed that both tRNAs have resonances with 1H and 15N chemical shifts characteristic of s4UA pairs. The 1H shift is approximately 1 ppm upfield from the typical s4U8 resonance at 14.8 ppm, presumably as a result of local diamagnetic anisotropies. An additional s4U resonance with 1H and 15N shifts typical of interaction of a bound water or a sugar hydroxyl group with s4U9 was discovered in the spectrum of tRNATyr2. Our NMR results for tRNAs with 3-base pair dihydrouridine stems suggest that these molecules have an U8A14 tertiary interaction similar to that found in tRNAs with 4-base pair dihydrouridine stems."
https://openalex.org/W1602913660,"Plasma kallikrein and factor XIa circulate bound to high molecular weight kininogen, and such binding has been reported to protect these enzymes from inactivation by their respective inhibitors. However, this observation is controversial, and the effect of high molecular weight kininogen upon the interaction between kallikrein and C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) has been questioned. We have re-evaluated this reaction and studied the rate of inhibition of kallikrein by C1-INH in the presence and absence of high molecular weight kininogen. The second-order rate constant of inhibition of kallikrein by C1-INH was unaffected by saturating concentrations of high molecular weight kininogen. Our results suggest that although high molecular weight kininogen clearly augments the rate of formation of kallikrein and other enzymes of the contact activation pathway, it has no effect on the rate of enzyme inhibition by C1-INH."
