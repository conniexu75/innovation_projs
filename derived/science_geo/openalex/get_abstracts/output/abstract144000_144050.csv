https://openalex.org/W2020018917,"A qubit was designed that can be fabricated with conventional electron beam lithography and is suited for integration into a large quantum computer. The qubit consists of a micrometer-sized loop with three or four Josephson junctions; the two qubit states have persistent currents of opposite direction. Quantum superpositions of these states are obtained by pulsed microwave modulation of the enclosed magnetic flux by currents in control lines. A superconducting flux transporter allows for controlled transfer between qubits of the flux that is generated by the persistent currents, leading to entanglement of qubit information."

Pilus biogenesis proceeds by way of the chaperone/usher pathway. The x-ray structure of the FimC-FimH chaperone-adhesin complex from uropathogenic Escherichia coli at 2.5 angstrom resolution reveals the basis for carbohydrate recognition and for pilus assembly. The carboxyl-terminal pilin domain of FimH has an immunoglobulin-like fold, except that the seventh strand is missing, leaving part of the hydrophobic core exposed. A donor strand complementation mechanism in which the chaperone donates a strand to complete the pilin domain explains the basis for both chaperone function and pilus biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2135983073,"Amphiphilic polyhedron-shaped p -sulfonatocalix[4]arene building blocks, which have been previously shown to assemble into bilayers in an antiparallel fashion, have been assembled in a parallel alignment into spherical and helical tubular structures by the addition of pyridine N -oxide and lanthanide ions. Crystallographic studies revealed how metal ion coordination and substrate recognition direct the formation of these supramolecular assemblies. The addition of greater amounts of pyridine N -oxide changed the curvature of the assembling surface and resulted in the formation of extended tubules."
https://openalex.org/W1998919748,"Recently, methane (CH(4)) of possible abiogenic origin has been reported from many localities within Earth's crust. However, little is known about the mechanisms of abiogenic methane formation, or about isotopic fractionation during such processes. Here, a hydrothermally formed nickel-iron alloy was shown to catalyze the otherwise prohibitively slow formation of abiogenic CH(4) from dissolved bicarbonate (HCO(3)-) under hydrothermal conditions. Isotopic fractionation by the catalyst resulted in delta(13)C values of the CH(4) formed that are as low as those typically observed for microbial methane, with similarly high CH(4)/(C(2)H(6) + C(3)H(8)) ratios. These results, combined with the increasing recognition of nickel-iron alloy occurrence in oceanic crusts, suggest that abiogenic methane may be more widespread than previously thought."

In contrast, excitation with femtosecond infrared laser pulses enables also the formation of carbon dioxide. The desorption is caused by coupling of the adsorbate to the phonon bath of the ruthenium substrate, whereas the oxidation reaction is initiated by hot substrate electrons, as evidenced by the observed subpicosecond reaction dynamics and density functional calculations. The presence of this laser-induced reaction pathway allows elucidation of the microscopic mechanism and the dynamics of the carbon monoxide oxidation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2081305809,"Many Gram-negative pathogens assemble architecturally and functionally diverse adhesive pili on their surfaces by the chaperone-usher pathway. Immunoglobulin-like periplasmic chaperones escort pilus subunits to the usher, a large protein complex that facilitates the translocation and assembly of subunits across the outer membrane. The crystal structure of the PapD-PapK chaperone-subunit complex, determined at 2.4 angstrom resolution, reveals that the chaperone functions by donating its G 1 β strand to complete the immunoglobulin-like fold of the subunit via a mechanism termed donor strand complementation. The structure of the PapD-PapK complex also suggests that during pilus biogenesis, every subunit completes the immunoglobulin-like fold of its neighboring subunit via a mechanism termed donor strand exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2109526373,"Isoleucyl–transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase (IleRS) joins Ile to tRNA Ile at its synthetic active site and hydrolyzes incorrectly acylated amino acids at its editing active site. The 2.2 angstrom resolution crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus IleRS complexed with tRNA Ile and Mupirocin shows the acceptor strand of the tRNA Ile in the continuously stacked, A-form conformation with the 3′ terminal nucleotide in the editing active site. To position the 3′ terminus in the synthetic active site, the acceptor strand must adopt the hairpinned conformation seen in tRNA Gln complexed with its synthetase. The amino acid editing activity of the IleRS may result from the incorrect products shuttling between the synthetic and editing active sites, which is reminiscent of the editing mechanism of DNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W2001068122,"The pleiotropic effects of retinoic acid (RA) in mammalian cells are mediated by two classes of proteins: the retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABP-I and CRABP-II). Here we show that expression of CRABP-II, but not CRABP-I, markedly enhanced RAR-mediated transcriptional activation of a reporter gene in COS-7 cells. The equilibrium dissociation constants of complexes of CRABP-I or CRABP-II with RA were found to differ by 2-fold. It is thus unlikely that the distinct effects of the two proteins on transactivation stem from differential ligand-binding affinities. The mechanisms by which RA transfers from the CRABPs to RAR were thus investigated directly. The rate constant for movement of RA from CRABP-II, but not from CRABP-I, to RAR strongly depended on the concentration of the acceptor. The data suggest that transfer of RA from CRABP-I to RAR involves dissociation of the ligand from the binding protein, followed by association with the receptor. In contrast, movement of RA from CRABP-II to the receptor is facilitated by a mechanism that involves direct interactions between CRABP-II and RAR. These findings reveal a striking functional difference between CRABP-I and CRABP-II, and point at a novel mechanism by which the transcriptional activity of RA can be regulated by CRABP-II."
https://openalex.org/W2091973116,"Oxidative stress is associated with important pathophysiological events in a variety of diseases. It has been postulated that free radicals and lipid peroxidation products generated during the process may be responsible for these effects because of their ability to damage cellular components such as membranes, proteins, and DNA. In the present study, we provide evidence that oxidative stress causes a transient impairment of intracellular proteolysis via covalent binding of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a major end product of lipid peroxidation, to proteasomes. A single intraperitoneal treatment with the renal carcinogen, ferric nitrilotriacetate, caused oxidative stress, as monitored by accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, in the kidney of mice. In addition, transient accumulation of HNE-modified proteins in the kidney was also found by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical analyses. This and the observation that the HNE-modified proteins were significantly ubiquitinated suggested a crucial role of proteasomes in the metabolism of HNE-modified proteins.In vitro incubation of the kidney homogenates with HNE indeed resulted in a transient accumulation of HNE-modified proteins, whereas the proteasome inhibitor significantly suppressed the time-dependent elimination of HNE-modified proteins. We found that, among three proteolytic activities (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolase activities) of proteasomes, both trypsin and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolase activities in the kidney were transiently diminished in accordance with the accumulation of HNE-modified proteins during oxidative stress. The loss of proteasome activities was partially ascribed to the direct attachment of HNE to the protein, based on the detection of HNE-proteasome conjugates by an immunoprecipitation technique. These results suggest that HNE may contribute to the enhanced accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins via an impairment of ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent intracellular proteolysis."

To identify new transporters, the expressed sequence tag database was queried, and cDNA fragments with sequence similarity to the Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family were identified. Based on these sequences, rapid amplification of cDNA ends of human mammary gland cDNA was used to obtain a cDNA of 4.5 kilobases (kb). The open reading frame encodes a 642-amino acid protein named amino acid transporter B0+. Human ATB0+ (hATB0+) is a novel member of the Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family with the highest sequence similarity to the glycine and proline transporters. Northern blot analysis identified transcripts of ∼4.5 kb and ∼2 kb in the lung. Another tissue survey suggests expression in the trachea, salivary gland, mammary gland, stomach, and pituitary gland. Electrophysiology and radiolabeled amino acid uptake measurements were used to functionally characterize the transporter expressed in Xenopus oocytes. hATB0+ was found to transport both neutral and cationic amino acids, with the highest affinity for hydrophobic amino acids and the lowest affinity for proline. Amino acid transport was Na+ and Cl−-dependent and was attenuated in the presence of 2-aminobicyclo-[2.2.1]-heptane-2-carboxylic acid, a system B0+ inhibitor.

Amino acids do not permeate cell membranes and therefore require specialized transport proteins in order to cross the plasma membrane (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Transporters are classified based on sequence similarity, amino acid substrate specificity, and ion dependence. Ion-independent transporters carry amino acids according to their electrochemical gradient, whereas ion-coupled transporters use ion motive force to concentrate amino acids inside the cell (2Hediger M.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 15-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian plasma membrane amino acid transporters have been functionally classified into two groups based on their Na+-independent or Na+-dependent mechanism of action (3Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S.

Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Two gene families encode transporters that mediate Na+-independent amino acid transport. One such family, the cationic amino acid transporters, CAT1–CAT4, carries lysine, arginine, and histidine and possesses much lower affinity for other amino acids (5Deves R. Boyd C.A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 487-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Na+-independent amino acid transport is also induced by another family of proteins, which include 4f2hc (6Bertran J. Magagnin S.

Na+-dependent transporters utilize the electrochemical gradients of Na+ and other ions to actively transport amino acids. There are two gene families that encode Na+-dependent amino acid transporters. One Na+-dependent transporter family includes the excitatory amino acid transporters that transport glutamate and aspartate, EAAT1–5, the transporters for alanine, serine, and cysteine, ASCT1 and ASCT2, and the neutral amino acid transporter hATB0 (14Kanai Y. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Arriza J.L. Eliasof S. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4155-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). In addition to cotransport of amino acids and Na+, members of this family have been reported to cotransport H+ and countertransport K+ (16Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar,17Billups B. Attwell D. Nature. 1996; 379: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). An additional amino acid transporter family utilizes Cl− along with Na+ to transport amino acids and other organic substrates into the cell (18Shafqat S. Velaz-Faircloth M. Guadano-Ferraz A. Fremeau R.T.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1517-1529PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The Na+/Cl−-dependent transporter family includes transporters for γ-aminobutyric acid-like substrates (e.g. betaine and taurine), monoamines (e.g. serotonin and dopamine), and amino acids (e.g. glycine and proline) (20Borowsky B. Hoffman B.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1995; 38: 139-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The recent cloning of transporter genes enables correlation between individual transport proteins and transport systems described in specific cell types or tissues (21McGivan J.D. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Transport systems for amino acids have been classically characterized based on amino acid specificity, ion dependence, and pharmacological properties (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). One such transport system, designated B0+, is defined by Na+-dependent transport of both neutral and cationic amino acids (22Van Winkle L.J. Christensen H.N. Campione A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12118-12123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). System B0+ transport has been reported in mouse blastocysts (22Van Winkle L.J. Christensen H.N. Campione A.L. J. Biol.

In this study, we report the cloning and functional expression of a novel human amino acid transporter, hATB0+.1hATB0+ is a member of the Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family and transports both neutral and cationic amino acids in a Na+- and Cl−-dependent manner. Substrate specificity and pharmacology indicate that hATB0+ is the first molecularly characterized system B0+ amino acid transporter. Gene-specific primers were paired with adaptor ligated sequence-specific primers, AP1 and AP2, for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (34Chenchik A. Diachenko L. Moqadam F. Tarabykin V. Lukyanov S. Siebert P.D. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) using Advantage PolymeraseTM (CLONTECH). Primers were originally designed based on GenBank accession number AA526963 and were subsequently designed based on 5′ and 3′ RACE clones and correspond to nucleotides 534–558 and 577–596 for 5′ RACE and nucleotides 430–455 and 1969–1994 for 3′ RACE (Life Technologies, Inc.). For primary 5′ and 3′ RACE, a gene-specific primer was paired with AP1 to amplify mammary Marathon ReadyTM cDNA (CLONTECH). This PCR product was diluted 1:500 for secondary RACE reactions using a nested gene-specific primer and AP2. All 5′ and 3′ RACE products were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and transformed into TOP10 Escherichia coli using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Individual colonies were screened for insert size with PCR using M13 forward and reverse primers. DNA was sequenced at the University's Automated DNA Sequencing Facility on a Model 373A DNA Sequencer using the Taq DyeDeoxyTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Lasergene (DNA Star, Madison, WI) and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) were utilized for sequence analysis (35Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). To determine genomic structure, the BLAST 2 Sequences program was used to align genomic sequences (GenBank accession numbers AL034411 and Z96810) with the hATB0+cDNA sequence. Protein motifs were identified using ScanProsite (36Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), and membrane topology was predicted by TMpred (37Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374 (abstr.): 166Google Scholar) and Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity analysis. The probe was synthesized by PCR amplification of nucleotides 710–1896 of the hATB0+cDNA and labeled by random priming with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to a specific activity of approximately 1 × 107 cpm/ml using the Random Prime Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After prehybridization for 30 min at 68 °C in ExpressHybTM solution (CLONTECH), a human Multiple Tissue Northern blot and a human Master blot (CLONTECH) were hybridized with the cDNA probe in ExpressHybTM for 1 and 6 h, respectively. The Northern blot was washed three times with 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature and twice with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. The Master blot was washed five times in 2× SSC and 1% SDS at 65 °C and twice in 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 55 °C. Both blots were subsequently exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics) for 24 h or to autoradiography film for 48 h at −70 °C. To obtain the open reading frame for functional analysis, two primers corresponding to nucleotides 74–105 and 2001–2027 of the hATB0+ cDNA sequence were designed. PCR amplification of mammary gland Marathon ReadyTM cDNA with these primers yielded a single DNA band of ∼1.9 kb that was ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO. For efficient expression in Xenopus oocytes, the hATB0+ coding sequence was transferred into pKSPA, a modified pBluescript KS+ plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing (A)30, using Xba I and Hin dIII sites. One clone was subsequently used for all functional studies. The template for cRNA synthesis was prepared by Not I digestion of hATB0+-pKSPA or by PCR of hATB0+-pKSPA using M13 forward and reverse primers. cRNA was synthesized in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine; Ambion, Austin, TX). Xenopus oocytes were surgically removed, treated, and selected as described previously (38Goldin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 266-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 39Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In brief, Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) were anesthetized with 0.2% Tricaine. Oocytes were removed and treated with 4 mg/ml type 1A collagenase (Sigma) in a Ca2 -free solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) with 50 μg/ml gentamycin) for 1 h at room temperature. Oocytes were rinsed with the Ca2+-free solution and then rinsed with modified Ringer's solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.5 mm pyruvate and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Stage IV oocytes were selected and injected the following day with 5–10 ng of cRNA or water in a total volume of 50 nl. Oocytes were maintained at 19 °C in Ringer's solution supplemented with 0.5 mm pyruvate and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Three to seven days after injection, oocytes were used for electrophysiology or uptake experiments. All experiments were performed at room temperature (21 °C). Two electrode voltage clamp experiments were conducted using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Current was measured upon application of increasing concentrations of amino acids ranging from 1 μm to 10 mm for ∼15 s and washed for a period of ∼30 s in Ringer's solution. In ion dependence experiments, the NaCl concentration of the Ringer's solution was 100 mm, and Na+ and Cl− were substituted with equimolar concentrations of N-methyl-d-glucamine and gluconate, respectively. All experiments were conducted at a holding potential of −80 mV. Clampex was used to acquire data at 62.5 Hz (pClamp 6; Axon Instruments). After digital filtering at 1 Hz, data were analyzed by Clampfit (pClamp 6; Axon Instruments). l-[4,5-3H]Leucine (136 Ci/mmol), l-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine monohydrochloride (71 Ci/mmol), andl-[G-3H]glutamic acid (136 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were diluted to a concentration of 90 nmand used to assess amino acid uptake. After incubation with3H-amino acid in the appropriate Ringer ' s solution, oocytes were immediately washed four times with the same ice-cold solution, individually solubilized in 1% SDS, and counted by liquid scintillation. Initial time course experiments ofl-[3H]leucine transport indicated that uptake was linear from 1–10 min (data not shown); consequently, time points of 2 or 5 min were chosen. For ion dependence experiments, oocytes were initially rinsed three times in Na+ or Cl−-free solution. Sequence homology is commonly used to identify novel genes of emerging gene families. The expressed sequence tag (EST) database was queried to identify new members of the Na+/Cl−-dependent transporter family. After the identification of an EST (GenBank accession number AA526963) from mammary gland cDNA with homology to this family, RACE of human mammary gland Marathon ReadyTMcDNA was performed to clone the full-length gene. hATB0+ cDNA is 4.5 kb in length and has been submitted to GenBank (GenBank accession number AF151978). hATB0+possesses absolute identity with human ESTs (GenBank accession numbersAA526963, AA552658, and AA541466) and is highly similar (∼90%) to mouse ESTs (GenBank accession numbers AI006618, AI006510, AA592728, AI1429024, and AI605513). hATB0+ is a member of the Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family and shows the highest similarity (∼60%) to the glycine transporters GLYT1 (40Guastella J.

There are seven possible glycosylation sites on the second putative extracellular loop and one on the third putative extracellular loop. Two consensus sites for protein kinase C phosphorylation are located at Ser-40 and Ser-261. The Ser-40 site is also present in the amino acid transporters hGLYT2 and hPROT, and the protein kinase C consensus site located at Ser-261 is highly conserved among the Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family (20Borowsky B.

Periodic query of GenBank revealed genomic sequences that were identical to hATB0+ (GenBank accession number AL034411 and Z96810), and alignment with hATB0+cDNA predicts the gene structure. The coding sequence possesses 14 exons, each of which is ∼100–200 base pairs in length (Fig.1 B). Genomic organization is conserved among members of the Na+/Cl−-dependent transporter family, and the coding sequence of the transmembrane domains is not interrupted by introns (54Kawarai T.

The genomic sequences (GenBank accession numbers AL034411 and Z96810) were assigned to chromosome X at positions Xq24 and Xq22.1–23, respectively.

The highest expression was detected in the lung, fetal lung, trachea, and salivary gland, and lower levels of expression were detected in the mammary gland, stomach, and pituitary gland. Hybridization in the colon, uterus, prostate, and testis was very low (Fig.2 A). ESTs from human mammary gland, colon, and prostate and from mouse colon are in agreement with the Master blot tissue distribution data. A multiple tissue Northern blot showed no expression in the heart, brain, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney; or pancreas; however, transcripts of ∼4.5 and ∼2 kb were detected in the lung (Fig. 2 B). The predominant transcript of ∼4.5 kb corresponds to the length of the hATB0+ isolated cDNA, 4.5 kb. The application of substrate generated ionic current for all members of the Na+/Cl−-dependent transporter family studied electrophysiologically (63Lester H.A. Mager S. Quick M.W. Corey J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 219-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We therefore utilized a two-electrode voltage clamp to functionally characterize hATB0+ in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Oocytes injected with hATB0+ cRNA generated inward current in response to the application of neutral and cationic amino acids. The negatively charged amino acids, glutamate and aspartate, evoked no current. We never observed a current greater than 2 nA in uninjected or water-injected oocytes in response to the application of 1 mm of each amino acid. Despite some seasonal and batch-to-batch variation in expression levels, more than 20 batches of oocytes injected with hATB0+ cRNA responded to neutral and cationic amino acids. Amino acid-induced inward current was observed at all voltages from −140 to +40 mV, and the current was increased at more negative potentials (data not shown). Fig.3 A illustrates the typical current evoked by increasing concentrations of amino acid (1 μm to 1 mm of phenylalanine). Dose-response data for all amino acids that generated current were saturable. Data were initially fit to the Hill equation, and Hill coefficients were determined to be approximately 1. Subsequently, data were fit to a curve assuming a Hill coefficient equal to 1. TableI presents the EC50 values for all amino acids evoking transport current. hATB0+preferred hydrophobic amino acids but also had significant affinity for other neutral and cationic amino acids. The apparent affinity for nonpolar amino acids seems to increase with R group size, and the apparent affinity for polar amino acids seems to decrease with R group size. The affinity for proline was very low (EC50 > 5 mm) and probably would not be physiologically relevant.Table IConcentration-dependent amino acid-induced transport currentAmino acidEC50μmNonpolar Isoleucine6 ± 1 Leucine12 ± 2 Methionine14 ± 1 Valine36 ± 2 Alanine99 ± 36 Glycine111 ± 30 Proline>5 mmPolar Serine43 ± 5 Cysteine118 ± 33 Asparagine348 ± 84 Threonine405 ± 80 Glutamine633 ± 62Aromatic Phenylalanine17 ± 1 Tryptophan26 ± 6 Tyrosine92 ± 10Charged Histidine76 ± 20 Lysine100 ± 1 Arginine104 ± 35 AspartateN/D1-aN/D, not detectable.

A new type of Brownian ratchet, a geometrical Brownian ratchet, has been realized. Charged, fluorescently labeled phospholipids in a two-dimensional fluid bilayer were driven in one direction by an electric field through a two-dimensional periodic array of asymmetric barriers to lateral diffusion fabricated from titanium oxide on silica. Diffusion spreads the phospholipid molecules in the orthogonal direction, and the asymmetric barriers rectify the Brownian motion, causing a directional transport of molecules. The geometrical ratchet can be used as a continuous molecular sieve to separate mixtures of membrane-associated molecules that differ in electrophoretic mobility and diffusion coefficient."

Four of the five circadian genes identified to date influence responsiveness to freebase cocaine in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster . Sensitization to repeated cocaine exposures, a phenomenon also seen in humans and animal models and associated with enhanced drug craving, is eliminated in flies mutant for period , clock , cycle , and doubletime , but not in flies lacking the gene timeless . Flies that do not sensitize owing to lack of these genes do not show the induction of tyrosine decarboxylase normally seen after cocaine exposure. These findings indicate unexpected roles for these genes in regulating cocaine sensitization and indicate that they function as regulators of tyrosine decarboxylase."

Using purified components, FVIII was found to bind to LRP in a reversible and dose-dependent manner (Kd ≈ 60 nm). The interaction appeared to be specific because the LRP antagonist receptor-associated protein readily inhibited binding of FVIII to LRP (IC50 ≈ 1 nm). In addition, a 12-fold molar excess of the physiological carrier of FVIII, i.e. von Willebrand factor (vWF), reduced the binding of FVIII to LRP by over 90%. Cellular degradation of125I-labeled FVIII by LRP-expressing cells (≈ 8 fmol/105 cells after a 4.5-h incubation) was reduced by approximately 70% in the presence of receptor-associated protein. LRP-directed antibodies inhibited degradation to a similar extent, indicating that LRP indeed contributes to binding and transport of FVIII to the intracellular degradation pathway. Degradation of FVIII was completely inhibited by vWF. Because vWF binding by FVIII involves its light chain, LRP binding to this subunit was studied. In ligand blotting experiments, binding of FVIII light chain to LRP could be visualized. More detailed analysis revealed that FVIII light chain interacts with LRP with moderate affinity (kon≈ 5 × 104m−1s−1; koff ≈ 2.5 × 10−3 s−1; Kd ≈ 50 nm). Furthermore, experiments using recombinant FVIII C2 domain showed that this domain contributes to the interaction with LRP. In contrast, no association of FVIII heavy chain to LRP could be detected under the same experimental conditions. Collectively, our data demonstrate that in vitro LRP is able to bind FVIII at the cell surface and to mediate its transport to the intracellular degradation pathway.

This is apparent from the observations that LRP recognizes thrombin/antithrombin and factor Xa/α2-macroglobulin complexes and the Kunitz-type inhibitor tissue factor pathway inhibitor (9Kounnas M.Z.

In addition, LRP contributes to down-regulation of tissue factor expression at the surface of monocytes (12Hamik A. Setiadi H. Bu G. McEver R.P. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol.

The fact that deficiency or dysfunction of FVIII is associated with severe bleeding tendencies demonstrates that this cofactor is indispensable for appropriate hemostasis. FVIII comprises a domain structure (A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2) (15Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriquez H. O'Brien D.P. Rotblat F. Opperman H. Keck R. Wood W.I. Harkins R.N. Tuddenham E.G.D. Lawn R.M.

The heavy chain (90–220 kDa) contains the A1-A2-B domains and is heterogenous as a result of limited proteolysis within the B domain. The light chain (80 kDa) consists of the A3-C1-C2 domains. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of FVIII light chain together comprise the binding site for von Willebrand factor (vWF) (18Lollar P. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Parker C.G. J. Biol.

Activated FVIII consists of the A2 domain, which is noncovalently associated with the metal-ion linked A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer, whereas the B domain and the amino-terminal part of the A3 domain have been removed (23Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the release of the amino-terminal part, high affinity binding to vWF is lost (18Lollar P. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Parker C.G. J. Biol.

Blood. 1992; 79: 3130-3137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that vWF prevents FVIII from premature clearance. However, the mechanism by which FVIII is removed from the circulation has remained unidentified. In the present study, we investigated the possibility that FVIII is recognized by the multifunctional receptor LRP. To this end, the interaction between LRP and FVIII or its constituent subunits has been addressed using purified components. In addition, cellular degradation of FVIII has been studied. It is demonstrated that LRP recognizes FVIII as a ligand, and that binding involves the light chain of FVIII. Furthermore, both LRP-mediated binding and degradation of FVIII are down-regulated by vWF. Our data are in support of a mechanism in which LRP contributes to binding and internalization of FVIII. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Microtiter plates were from Dynatech (Plockingen, Germany). Cell culture plates, fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F12 (DMEM:F12) medium was from BioWittaker (Verviers, Belgium). The BIAcoreTM2000 biosensor system and reagents (amine-coupling kit and CM5 sensor chips) were from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). FVIII light chain, thrombin-cleaved FVIII light chain, and FVIII heavy chain were prepared as described previously (25Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol.

The integrity of the isolated subunits was assessed in reconstitution experiments as described previously (28Donath M.J.S.H. Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As expected, isolated subunits could effectively be reassembled into biologically active heterodimers (data not shown). Plasma-derived FVIII heterodimer was isolated as described previously (25Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FVIII was labeled with Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the IODO-GEN method (Pierce) as described previously (29Brinkman H.J. Koster P. Mertens K. van Mourik J.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), except that FVIII was stored in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) at −20 °C. Specific radioactivity was 4.2 (± 0.7) × 103 cpm/fmol FVIII (mean ± range; n = 2). Recombinant FVIII C2 domain (residues 2172–2332) was obtained using the baculovirus expression system as described previously (30Fijnvandraat K. Celie P.H.N. Turenhout E.A.M. ten Cate J.W. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Peters M. Voorberg J. Blood. 1998; 91: 2347-2352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described for FVIII light chain (25Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified recombinant wild-type vWF was kindly provided by Prof. H. P. Schwarz (Baxter-Immuno, Vienna, Austria). Purified LRP (31Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14011-14017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and serum containing polyclonal antibodies against LRP were a generous gift from Dr. S. K. Moestrup (University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark). Total IgG was purified from the serum using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B as recommended by the manufacturer. A plasmid encoding glutathione S-transferase fused to RAP (GST-RAP) was kindly provided by Dr. J. Kuiper (Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) and used for expression of GST-RAP in Escherichia coli DH5α as described previously (7Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST-RAP was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B as recommended by the manufacturer. Because the GST tag does not interfere with the binding properties of RAP (7Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GST-RAP was used throughout the present study. Purified anti-FVIII antibodies CLB-CAg 69, CLB-CAg 117, and CLB-CAg A have been described previously (25Lenting P.J. Donath M.J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-FVIII antibodies ESH4 (interferes with vWF binding) and ESH8 (promotes vWF binding to thrombin-cleaved FVIII) were obtained from American Diagnostica. Human albumin was from the division of products of CLB (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Bovine albumin (fraction V) was from Merck. Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using human albumin as a standard. FVIII activity was assayed using Coatest FVIII (Chromogenix AB, Mölndal, Sweden). Pooled plasma, which was calibrated against World Health Organization standard 91-666, was used as a standard. The amount of FVIII present in 1 ml of human plasma (1 unit/ml) was assumed to correspond to 0.4 nm (28Donath M.J.S.H. Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Binding studies were performed using a BIAcoreTM2000 biosensor system, based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. SPR analysis was performed essentially as described previously (33Horn I.R. Moestrup S.K. van den Berg B.M.M. Pannekoek H. Nielsen M.S. van Zonneveld A.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11770-11775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). LRP was immobilized onto a CM5-sensor chip, using the amine coupling kit as prescribed by the supplier, at indicated densities. A control channel was routinely activated and blocked in the absence of protein. Binding to coated channels was corrected for binding to noncoated channels (less than 5% of binding to coated channels). SPR analysis was assessed in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) at 25 °C with a flow rate of 5 μl/min or 20 μl/min, where appropriate. Regeneration of the sensor chip surface was performed by incubating with 100 mm H3PO4 for 2 min at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. For analysis of the association and dissociation curves in the obtained sensorgrams, BIAevaluation software (Biacore AB) was used. Interaction constants were determined by performing nonlinear fitting of data corrected for bulk refractive index changes according to a two-site model, using equations described previously (33Horn I.R. Moestrup S.K. van den Berg B.M.M. Pannekoek H. Nielsen M.S. van Zonneveld A.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11770-11775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Data fitting to a one-site model proved inappropriate, as judged from residual plots and statistical parameters (data not shown). Purified LRP (125 fmol/well) was adsorbed onto microtiter wells in 50 mm NaHCO3(pH 9.5) in a volume of 50 μl for 16 h at 4 °C. LRP-coated and noncoated wells were blocked with 1% (w/v) gelatin in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) in a volume of 100 μl for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, FVIII (40 nm) was added in the same buffer to LRP-coated and noncoated wells in the presence (0–1 μm) of GST-RAP in a volume of 50 μl and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Bound FVIII was quantified by incubating for 15 min at 37 °C with peroxidase-labeled antibody CLB-CAg 117. Cellular degradation of FVIII was examined essentially as described elsewhere (34Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells (ATCC CCL-61) were grown to 80–95% confluence in 24-well plates in DMEM:F12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Before incubation, cells were washed extensively with DMEM:F12 medium.125I-labeled FVIII (20 nm) was then added in a volume of 200 μl in DMEM:F12 medium containing 1% (w/v) bovine albumin and 5 mm CaCl2. In some experiments,125I-labeled FVIII was added in the presence of vWF (500 nm), GST-RAP (1 μm), or protein A-Sepharose purified polyclonal antibodies directed against LRP (0.9 mg/ml). After a 35-min incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed three times with 500 μl of DMEM:F12 to remove nonbound material. Subsequently, incubation was allowed to proceed for another 4.5 h at 37 °C in a volume of 200 μl of DMEM:F12 medium containing 1% (w/v) bovine albumin and 5 mm CaCl2, in the presence of freshly added competitor where appropriate. Then, 100 μl samples were drawn to determine the amount of degraded material. Degraded material is defined as radioactivity that is soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid (35Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In all experiments, a control was included in which the amount of degradation was assessed in the absence of cells. Ligand blotting experiments were performed essentially as described elsewhere (35Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of purified LRP was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 5% gel under nonreducing conditions and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. Blots were blocked with 1% (w/v) non-fat milk in 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). The blots were subsequently incubated with FVIII light chain (50 nm) in the absence or presence of GST-RAP (125 nm) in the same buffer containing 5 mmCaCl2 for 16 h at room temperature. After washing the blots, bound FVIII light chain was detected using the peroxidase-labeled anti-FVIII light chain-directed antibody CLB-CAg 69. Binding was visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine tablets (Ken-En-Tec, Copenhagen, Denmark). The interaction between LRP and FVIII was first investigated by SPR analysis using purified components. As shown in Fig. 1, an increase in response was observed as FVIII (80 nm) was passed over immobilized LRP (8 and 25 fmol/mm2), demonstrating that FVIII associates with LRP. Binding appeared to be dose-dependent in that the highest response was detected in case of the highest density of LRP (Fig. 1). Upon replacement of FVIII solution with buffer, the response started to decline gradually, indicating that FVIII dissociates from immobilized LRP. The interaction between LRP and FVIII was studied in more detail by assessment of the association and dissociation rate constants konand koff. The results are summarized in TableI. Binding of FVIII heterodimer to LRP could be described using a two-site model. The affinity constants (Kd) derived from kon and koff values are 59 and 65 nm, respectively. These data indicate that FVIII is able to bind to LRP with moderate affinity in a reversible and dose-dependent manner.Table IKinetic parameters for the binding of FVIII or its derivatives to LRPkoffkonKds−1M−1s−1nmFVIII heterodimer(1)7.1 (±1.1) × 10−21.2 (±0.1) × 10659 ± 10(2)9.8 (±0.2) × 10−31.5 (±0.4) × 10565 ± 17Light chain(1)2.5 (±0.2) × 10−34.8 (±1.5) × 10452 ± 17(2)4.3 (±0.2) × 10−23.3 (±0.3) × 105130 ± 13Thrombin-cleaved light chain(1)3.3 (±0.1) × 10−37.6 (±2.2) × 10443 ± 13(2)5.3 (±0.4) × 10−22.8 (±0.5) × 105189 ± 15Association and dissociation of various concentrations of FVIII, FVIII light chain, or thrombin-cleaved light chain to LRP (16 fmol/mm2) were assessed as described in the legend of Fig. 1, except that a flow rate of 20 μl/min was used. The concentrations tested were 60–120 nm for FVIII, 150–250 nmfor intact FVIII light chain, and 50–150 nm for thrombin-cleaved light chain. The data obtained for all concentrations tested were analyzed to calculate association rate constants (kon) and dissociation rate constants (koff) as described previously using a two-site binding model (33Horn I.R. Moestrup S.K. van den Berg B.M.M. Pannekoek H. Nielsen M.S. van Zonneveld A.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11770-11775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).

Each class of binding sites is referred to as 1 and 2, respectively. Affinity constants (Kd) were inferred from the ratio koff:kon. Data are based on two to six measurements using five different concentrations for each measurement. Data represent the average (±S.D.). The interaction between FVIII and LRP was further analyzed in competition experiments using the FVIII carrier protein vWF and the LRP antagonist RAP. With regard to RAP, its effect was tested in an immunosorbent assay by incubating immobilized LRP (125 fmol/well) with mixtures of FVIII (40 nm) and various concentrations of GST-RAP (0–1 μm). Residual FVIII binding was subsequently determined using an anti-FVIII-directed antibody. The amount of FVIII bound decreased when concentrations of GST-RAP were increased (Fig.2 A). Half maximum binding was found at a concentration of approximately 1 nm GST-RAP, showing that RAP efficiently inhibits the binding of FVIII to LRP. The effect of vWF on the interaction between LRP and FVIII was studied by SPR analysis. Whereas FVIII (40 nm) bound efficiently to LRP (16 fmol/mm2) in the absence of vWF, association with LRP was inhibited dose-dependently in the presence of vWF (10–500 nm) (Fig. 2 B). The presence of a 12-fold excess of vWF resulted in over 90% inhibition, indicating that vWF interferes with complex formation between FVIII and LRP. These data demonstrate that the interaction between FVIII and LRP may be inhibited at the level of LRP using RAP or at the level of FVIII using vWF. To address the contribution of LRP to the transport of FVIII to the endosomal degradation pathway, cellular degradation of FVIII was examined in experiments using CHO cells, which express LRP constitutively (6Fitzgerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanowsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It appeared that125I-labeled FVIII was rapidly degraded by CHO cells (≈ 8 fmol/105 cells after 4.5 h), and degradation did not occur in the presence of vWF (Fig. 3). The addition of GST-RAP (1 μm) inhibited degradation of125I-labeled FVIII by approximately 65% (Fig. 3). Moreover, a similar extent of inhibition was observed using polyclonal antibodies directed against LRP (Fig. 3). This demonstrates that LRP contributes to the cellular uptake and subsequent degradation of FVIII. To identify FVIII regions involved in binding of LRP, we first examined the interaction of LRP with the isolated heavy and light chain of FVIII. Using 100 nm FVIII heavy chain, no association of this subunit to LRP (25 fmol/mm2) could be detected (Fig.4 A). In contrast, in the presence of FVIII light chain (100 nm), a clear increase in response was found (Fig. 4 A), indicating that FVIII light chain displays binding to LRP. Binding of FVIII light chain to LRP was further investigated in ligand blotting experiments. When nitrocellulose filters containing purified LRP (1 μg) were incubated with FVIII light chain (50 nm), a clear band could be visualized (Fig. 4 B, lane I), whereas only a faint band was observed when incubated in the presence of FVIII light chain (50 nm) and RAP (125 nm) (Fig.4 B, lane II). Thus, these data strongly suggest that FVIII light chain comprises a site that is recognized by LRP. Because both vWF and LRP bind to FVIII light chain (18, Fig.4), we tested the possibility that LRP and vWF share similar sites within this part of the FVIII molecule. FVIII comprises two sites that are involved in vWF binding, one of which is located between residues 1649 and 1689 at the amino-terminal part of the light chain (18Lollar P. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10451-10455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Leyte A. Verbeet M.P. Brodniewicz-Proba T. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Biochem J. 1989; 257: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thrombin-cleaved FVIII light chain, which lacks this particular sequence, was therefore compared with intact light chain for binding to LRP by SPR analysis to reveal the kinetic parameters kon and koff. As for FVIII heterodimer, binding of both intact and thrombin-cleaved light chain to LRP could appropriately be described using a two-site model. Similar kon and koffvalues were obtained for both intact and thrombin-cleaved FVIII light chain, indicating that these proteins are similar in their interaction with LRP. Apparently, binding to LRP is independent of the amino-terminal part of FVIII light chain. Apart from its amino-terminal part, the carboxyl-terminal C2 domain of FVIII light chain also comprises a vWF binding site (19Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because vWF binding is inhibited by the C2 domain-directed antibody ESH4, the effect of this antibody on LRP binding was tested. As shown in Fig.5 A, ESH4 interfered with FVIII light chain binding to LRP. Inhibition appeared to be specific because ESH4 was unable to affect binding of tissue-type plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complexes to LRP (data not shown). Moreover, other FVIII light chain directed antibodies (CLB-CAg A and CLB-CAg 69) were unable to interfere with LRP binding (data not shown). Thus, these data suggest that the FVIII C2 domain contributes to the interaction with LRP. This was further investigated using recombinant C2 domain. However, even at high concentrations of this 17.5-kDa fragment (500 nm), only a modest association with LRP was observed (Fig. 5 B, line I). The conformation of the C2 domain may be affected by residues elsewhere in FVIII light chain or by the C2 domain-directed antibody ESH8 (37Saenko E.L. Shima M. Gilbert G.E. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27424-27431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Binding of the C2 domain to LRP was therefore addressed in the presence of this antibody. When complexes of C2 domain and antibody ESH8 were applied to LRP, a pronounced, dose-dependent increase in response could be observed (Fig. 5 B, lines II–IV), indicating that ESH8 promotes binding of the isolated C2 domain to LRP. Binding was dependent on exposure of the LRP binding site in the C2 domain because C2 domain-ESH8 complexes or C2 domain alone did not associate to LRP in the presence of antibody ESH4 (Fig. 5 B, lines V and VI). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that a LRP binding site is present within the C2 domain of FVIII light chain. The surface of cells comprises numerous receptors that contribute to the binding and internalization of plasma proteins. Among these receptors is LRP, a multifunctional, endocytic receptor that is involved in the transport of a wide spectrum of ligands from the cell surface to the endosomal degradation pathway. In the present study, evidence is provided that LRP recognizes coagulation procofactor FVIII as a ligand. First, in a system using purified components, FVIII proved to bind to LRP in a manner that is reversible and dose-dependent (Fig. 1). Furthermore, binding could be inhibited efficiently in the presence of the FVIII carrier protein vWF or the LRP antagonist RAP (Fig. 2). Finally, both RAP- and anti-LRP-directed antibodies interfered with cellular degradation of125I-labeled FVIII (Fig. 3). It is of interest to note that inhibition of LRP does not fully prevent FVIII degradation. Whether or not residual degradation involves a receptor-mediated process is currently under investigation. Irrespective thereof, our data indicate that the transport of FVIII from the cellular surface to the intracellular degradation pathway involves LRP. Because FVIII is structurally and functionally unrelated to the ligands of LRP that have been described thus far, it therefore provides a novel member of the already extensive range of established ligands for LRP. The affinity by which FVIII heterodimer binds to LRP was found to be approximately 60 nm (Table I). This is in the same range as reported for some of the other LRP ligands, such as hepatic lipase (52 nm) (38Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Wong H. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), β-amyloid precursor protein (80 nm) (39Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), two-chain urokinase (60 nm) (40Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (35 nm) (33Horn I.R. Moestrup S.K. van den Berg B.M.M. Pannekoek H. Nielsen M.S. van Zonneveld A.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11770-11775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The data obtained for FVIII binding to LRP are in agreement with a two-site binding model (Table I), indicating that multiple regions contribute to the interaction with LRP. FVIII light chain proved similar to the FVIII heterodimer in that LRP binding involves two classes of binding sites (referred to in Table I as 1 and 2). Furthermore, both proteins display similar affinity with regard to the class 1 binding site (Table I). Therefore, it seems conceivable that FVIII light chain serves an important role in the interaction between FVIII and LRP. It is noteworthy that the class 1 association and dissociation rate constants for FVIII heterodimer differ from that for FVIII light chain by 25-fold (Table I), suggesting that exposure of the LRP binding site in FVIII light chain is distinct from that in the FVIII heterodimer. The same may be true for the class 2 binding site because its affinity for LRP is 2–3-fold lower in FVIII light chain than in FVIII heterodimer. One explanation for this observation may be that the exposure of LRP binding sites within FVIII light chain depends on the presence of FVIII heavy chain. A similar mechanism has been reported previously for the interaction between FVIII light chain and vWF. The affinity for vWF increases 10-fold when FVIII light chain is associated with FVIII heavy chain (19Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the A2 domain isolated from thrombin-activated FVIII has the potential to associate with LRP (41Yakhyaev A. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D. Saenko E. Blood. 1997; 90 (suppl.): 31aGoogle Scholar). Our observation that FVIII heavy chain does not associate with LRP may result from a different experimental approach. Alternatively, it cannot be excluded that the LRP binding site within the FVIII A2 domain is exposed in a suboptimal manner when this domain is linked to the A1 and B domains. This opens the possibility that the binding site for LRP within the A2 domain requires proteolysis of the FVIII heavy chain by thrombin for its exposure. A positive identification of the LRP binding site on the FVIII light chain was achieved using the monoclonal antibody ESH4 (Fig. 5), which has previously been described to be directed against the FVIII C2 domain (42Scandella D. Gilbert G.E. Shima M. Nakai H. Eagleson C. Felch M. Prescott R. Rajalakshmi K.J. Hoyer L.W. Saenko E. Blood. 1995; 86: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the C2 domain contributes to the interaction with LRP. Indeed, purified recombinant C2 domain displayed modest binding to LRP (Fig. 5 B). Surprisingly, the binding of C2 domain to LRP was markedly increased in the presence of antibody ESH8 (Fig. 5B), in a manner that was more pronounced than that observed for other antibodies (data not shown). It has been well established that antibody ESH8 is able to change the conformation of the C2 domain in thrombin-cleaved FVIII light chain, resulting in altered affinities for vWF and phospholipids (37Saenko E.L. Shima M. Gilbert G.E. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27424-27431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 43Saenko E.L. Scandella D. Yakhyaev A.V. Greco N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27918-27926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It seems conceivable therefore that this antibody provokes a similar event in the isolated C2 domain, which then results in a more optimal exposure of the LRP binding site. The presence of a binding site for LRP within the C2 domain may explain the inhibitory effect of vWF (Fig. 2 B), which is known to bind to the C2 domain of FVIII (19Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, whether vWF and LRP share a common binding site within the C2 domain or whether vWF interferes with binding by sterical hindrance remains to be determined. In plasma, FVIII is in a dynamic equilibrium with vWF in which approximately 95% of the FVIII molecules have been calculated to be in complex with vWF (44Noe D.A. Haemostasis. 1996; 26: 289-303PubMed Google Scholar). In complex with vWF, cellular uptake and degradation of FVIII is almost fully suppressed (Fig. 3), indicating that the contribution of LRP to the cellular uptake of FVIII-vWF complexes in vivo is limited. However, in the absence of vWF, FVIII is degraded efficiently in a process that involves LRP (Fig.3). In this view, our findings may provide an explanation for the beneficial effect of vWF that has been reported with regard to the expression of recombinant FVIII in CHO cells (17Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6352-6362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Wise R.J. Dorner A.J. Krane M. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21948-21955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). vWF may well contribute to the accumulation of FVIII in medium by interfering with LRP-mediated uptake of FVIII. Our findings may also be of relevance to the in vivo survival of FVIII in the absence of vWF. The physiological significance of complex formation between FVIII and vWF is particularly apparent in patients having von Willebrand disease type 3, who have no detectable vWF protein. Not only do these patients have a secondary deficiency of FVIII, but they also have a considerably reduced half-life of intravenously administered FVIII (26Over J. Sixma J.J. Bouma B.N. Vlooswijk R.A.A. Beeser-Visser N.H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1981; 97: 332-344PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mannucci P.M. Tenconi P.M. Castaman G. Rodeghiero F. Blood. 1992; 79: 3130-3137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the decreased levels of FVIII in these patients are associated with increased binding and internalization of FVIII by LRP due to the absence of vWF. We thank Dr. J. Voorberg and E. A. M. Turenhout for preparation of medium containing the recombinant C2 domain and Dr. J. A. Kolkman for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2030008827,"Population cycles occur frequently in forest insects. Time-series analysis of fluctuations in one such insect, the southern pine beetle ( Dendroctonus frontalis ), suggests that beetle dynamics are dominated by an ecological process acting in a delayed density-dependent manner. The hypothesis that delayed density dependence in this insect results from its interaction with predators was tested with a long-term predator-exclusion experiment. Predator-imposed mortality was negligible during the increase phase, grew during the year of peak population, and reached a maximum during the period of population decline. The delayed nature of the impact of predation suggests that predation is an important process that contributes significantly to southern pine beetle oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2078349645,"The copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (SOD1) inserts the catalytic metal cofactor into SOD1 by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate here that this process involves the cooperation of three distinct regions of the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS): an amino-terminal Domain I homologous to the Atx1p metallochaperone, a central portion (Domain II) homologous to SOD1, and a short carboxyl-terminal peptide unique to CCS molecules (Domain III). These regions fold into distinct polypeptide domains as revealed through proteolysis protection studies. The biological roles of the yeast CCS domains were examined in yeast cells. Surprisingly, Domain I was found to be necessary only under conditions of strict copper limitation. Domain I and Atx1p were not interchangeable <i>in vivo</i>, underscoring the specificity of the corresponding metallochaperones. A putative copper site in Domain II was found to be irrelevant to yeast CCS activity, but SOD1 activation invariably required a C <i>X</i> C in Domain III that binds copper. Copper binding to purified yeast CCS induced allosteric conformational changes in Domain III and also enhanced homodimer formation of the polypeptide. Our results are consistent with a model whereby Domain I recruits cellular copper, Domain II facilitates target recognition, and Domain III, perhaps in concert with Domain I, mediates copper insertion into apo-SOD1."
https://openalex.org/W1983906692,"Intracellular membrane fusion is crucial for the biogenesis and maintenance of cellular compartments, for vesicular traffic between them, and for exo- and endocytosis. Parts of the molecular machinery underlying this process have been identified, but most of these components operate in mutual recognition of the membranes. Here it is shown that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is essential for bilayer mixing, the last step of membrane fusion. PP1 was also identified in a complex that contained calmodulin, the second known factor implicated in the regulation of bilayer mixing. The PP1-calmodulin complex was required at multiple sites of intracellular trafficking; hence, PP1 may be a general factor controlling membrane bilayer mixing."
https://openalex.org/W1999272374,"The presence of the age pigment lipofuscin is associated with numerous age-related diseases. In the retina lipofuscin is located within the pigment epithelium where it is exposed to high oxygen and visible light, a prime environment for the generation of reactive oxygen species. Although we, and others, have demonstrated that retinal lipofuscin is a photoinducible generator of reactive oxygen species it is unclear how this may translate into cell damage. The position of lipofuscin within the lysosome infers that irradiated lipofuscin is liable to cause oxidative damage to either the lysosomal membrane or the lysosomal enzymes. We have found that illumination of lipofuscin with visible light is capable of extragranular lipid peroxidation, enzyme inactivation, and protein oxidation. These effects, which were pH-dependent, were significantly reduced by the addition of the antioxidants, superoxide dismutase and 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)-octane, confirming a role for both the superoxide anion and singlet oxygen. We postulate that lipofuscin may compromise retinal cell function by causing loss of lysosomal integrity and that this may be a major contributory factor to the pathology associated with retinal light damage and diseases such as age-related macular degeneration.

Evidence has shown that the rate of lipofuscin accumulation corresponds to the aging rates in different species, being influenced by both metabolic activity and extent of oxidative stress (1Sohal R.S. Brunk U.T. Porta E.A. Lipofuscin and Ceroid Pigments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 17-29Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, a causal role for lipofuscin in the aging process or development of age-related diseases such as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, age-related macular degeneration, Ménière's disease, and cardiac hypertrophy has yet to be established (see Refs. 2Sohal R.S. Age Pigments. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1981Google Scholar and 3Boulton M. Osborne N. Chader G. Progress in Retinal Research. Pergamon Press, Tarrytown, NY1991: 125-151Google Scholar). Unlike other cells in the body, in which lipofuscin occurs through the autophagic breakdown of intracellular organelles (2Sohal R.S. Age Pigments. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1981Google Scholar), the major substrate for lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)1 of the eye is the undegradable end product resulting from the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (4Feeney-Burns L. Eldred G.E. Trans. Ophthalmol. Soc. U.K. 1983; 103: 416-421PubMed Google Scholar, 5Boulton M.E. McKechnie N.M. Breda J. Bayly M. Marshall J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1989; 30: 82-89PubMed Google Scholar) that are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin A. Ocular lipofuscin may have a unique role to play in aging of the RPE, a tissue that is continually exposed to visible light (400–700 nm) and high oxygen tensions (∼70 mm Hg). Studies have shown this type of lipofuscin to be a photoinducible generator of superoxide ions, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and lipid peroxides (6Boulton M.E. Dontsov A. Jarvis-Evans J.

These species can adversely affect cell function by damaging proteins, carbohydrates, DNA, and lipids (10Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Cross C.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 598-620PubMed Google Scholar). The position of lipofuscin within the lysosome infers that the first site of oxidative damage will be either the lysosomal membrane or the lysosomal enzymes. To test this hypothesis we have assessed the effect of photoactivated lipofuscin on (i) lipid peroxidation, (ii) enzyme function, and (iii) protein oxidation. We have confirmed that lipofuscin granules incubated with visible light induce lipid peroxidation and cause enzyme inactivation supporting our hypothesis that lipofuscin contributes to aging of the RPE and is a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration. Chemicals (at least reagent grade, unless otherwise stated) were purchased from Sigma or BDH and used as supplied. Acid phosphatase, catalase (thymol-free), and superoxide dismutase were purchased from Sigma. Universal buffer contained 30 mm citric acid, KH2PO4, and boric acid and was adjusted to the appropriate pH with 0.2 mNaOH. Lipofuscin granules were isolated from 60–70-year old individuals according to a procedure previously described (11Boulton M.E. Docchio F. Dayhaw-Barker P. Ramponi R. Cubeddu R. Vision Res. 1990; 30: 1291-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) except that mechanical homogenization was used instead of ultrasonication. Isolated granules were resuspended in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and dispersed by forcing them through a narrow gauge needle. Concentration of the granules was determined by counting on a hemocytometer. Solutions were diluted according to the methods described below. The reaction mixtures, prepared in 7-ml glass vials were incubated for up to 8 h in the presence or absence of full white light (400–1100 nm, 80–90 milliwatts/cm2) from a 15-V/150-watt halogen-ellipsoid-reflecktorlampe KL 1500 (Schott, Mainz, Germany) transmitted through glass fiber optics as described previously (6Boulton M.E. Dontsov A. Jarvis-Evans J. Ostrovsky M. Svistunenko D. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1993; 19: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The samples were constantly agitated using a magnetic stirrer. Illumination did not cause an increase in temperature during the incubation period, and each experiment was performed at least three times. Confluent human RPE cultures (passage 4) (12Boulton M. Marshall J. Mellerio J. Exp. Eye Res. 1983; 37: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were trypsinized and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in universal buffer, pH 7.0. Bovine photoreceptor outer segments (POS) were isolated by the method of Papermaster (13Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 107 POS/ml in universal buffer, pH 7.0. Samples were either used immediately or aliquoted (1 ml) for storage at −20 °C under nitrogen until use. The substrates (2.5 ml), with or without lipofuscin (final concentration, 1 × 107granules/ml), were incubated for up to 4 h in the presence or absence of white light. At 0-, 2-, and 4-h time intervals duplicate 0.4-ml samples were removed and analyzed for lipid oxidation by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay as described by Buege and Aust (14Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10913) Google Scholar). Substrate incubated with 25 μl of ascorbic acid (2.5 mm)/50 μl of Fe2+ sulfate (2.5 mm) was used as a positive control. A negative control was prepared by replacing substrate with 2.5 ml of universal buffer. The experiments were repeated in the presence of the antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD; final concentration, 30 μg/ml) (6Boulton M.E. Dontsov A. Jarvis-Evans J. Ostrovsky M. Svistunenko D. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1993; 19: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) or 1,4-diazabicyclo (2,2,2)-octane (DABCO; final concentration, 30 mm) (15Delmelle M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 27: 731-734Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The generation of certain reactive oxygen species and their ability to induce oxidation is pH-dependent (16Elstner E.F. Klin. Wochenschr. 1991; 69: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, the pH dependence of lipofuscin photoreactivity was determined. To allow comparison between the different pH values, the same batch of POS was used. In brief, suspensions of POS at 1 × 107/ml in universal buffer at pH 4.5, 7.0, and 10 were prepared. The amount of oxidation occurring in samples incubated with and without lipofuscin in the presence and absence of light over a 90-min period was determined by the TBA assay using duplicate 0.4-ml samples at time 0, 30, 60, and 90 min. 5 ml of catalase (300 units/ml phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) together with either 20 μl of lipofuscin (final concentration, 1 × 107 granules/ml) or phosphate-buffered saline were incubated in the presence or absence of white light for up to 1 h. At 15-min intervals, 900-μl aliquots were taken and immediately centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 3 min. 800 μl of the resulting supernatant was stored at 4 °C until the activity of catalase was assayed by the method of Cohen et al. (17Cohen G. Dembiec D. Marcus J. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated in the presence of SOD and DABCO as described above and mannitol (final concentration, 24 mm). The effect of lipofuscin on acid phosphatase activity was determined at pH 4.5 and 7.0 (enzyme inactivation occurred at pH > 7.0). 1 ml of acid phosphatase (10 milliunits/ml) was incubated for 1 h both with (1 × 107 granules/ml) and without lipofuscin at room temperature in the presence or absence of white light. At 15-min intervals, 125-μl aliquots of the enzyme solution were removed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g to pellet the lipofuscin. 100 μl of the resulting supernatant was then taken and stored at 4 °C to await analysis of enzyme activity using an assay based on the microassay of Cabral et al. (18Cabral L. Unger W. Boulton M. Lightfoot R. McKechnie N. Grierson I. Marshall J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1990; 31: 670-676PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated in the presence of SOD and DABCO as described above. 2.5 ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was prepared at 100 μg/ml in universal buffer, pH 4.5 and 7.0, with (final concentration, 4 × 106 granules/ml) or without lipofuscin. The samples were maintained at room temperature in the dark or exposed to white light for 8 h. 1-ml aliquots were removed at time 0 and after 8 h and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 3 min to pellet the lipofuscin. 2 × 450-μl aliquots were stored under nitrogen at −20 °C prior to analysis for 1) tryptophan oxidation and 2) protein aggregation/fragmentation. Tryptophan fluorescence, a measure of tryptophan oxidation, was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy with excitation at 285 and emission at 345 nm (19Jahngen-Hodge J. Taylor A. Shang F. Huang L.L. Mura C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Protein aggregation/fragmentation was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In brief, reduced and non-reduced samples were loading onto a stacking polyacrylamide gel (12% running gel and 3% stacking gel). Analysis of band intensity, following staining with 0.1% w/v Coomassie blue, was determined using an Ultrascan XL enhanced laser densitometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), taking triplicate readings per band. Each experiment was performed at least three times. Rates of lipid oxidation were estimated by fitting a linear model to the data using the program Inrate in the Simfit statistical package (20Bardsley W.G. Schuster S. Rigoulet M. Ouhabi R. Mazat J.P. Modern Trends in Biothermokinetics. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 455-458Crossref Google Scholar) after normalization of the data at time 0. To allow for interexperimental variations due to enzyme and lipofuscin, batch enzyme activity is expressed as a decrease relative to time 0 rather than an absolute value. Rates of enzyme inactivation were estimated by fitting an exponential model to the decay data after normalization of the data at time 0 using the program QNFIT in the Simfit package, which performs constrained non-linear least squares regression (20Bardsley W.G. Schuster S. Rigoulet M. Ouhabi R. Mazat J.P. Modern Trends in Biothermokinetics. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 455-458Crossref Google Scholar). Under “Results,” inactivation rates are quoted as change in absorbance units (AU) per min ± 95% confidence limits and were calculated from the mean of values obtained from at least three independent experiments. Photooxidation of cell membranes and POS was greatest in the presence of lipofuscin and increased with increasing duration of light exposure (Fig.1). After 4 h of incubation the irradiated samples containing lipofuscin demonstrated 2.3 and 1.8 times more TBA-reactive products for cell membranes and POS, respectively, compared with irradiated samples in the absence of lipofuscin (p < 0.01). Lipid substrates exposed to light alone demonstrated significant oxidation, but this was always less than in the presence of lipofuscin. There was no significant increase in TBA-reactive products in samples (both with and without lipofuscin) maintained in the dark or samples with lipofuscin alone exposed to light throughout the 4-h incubation. Although the same trend was seen in all experiments overall values varied between batches of lipofuscin and POS. Further experiments were undertaken using POS as substrate because of their greater susceptibility to lipid peroxidation. The degree of lipid peroxidation was pH-dependent (data not shown); oxidation of POS was observed in the presence of lipofuscin and light at pH 7.0 but was not detectable at either pH 4.5 or 10. The addition of the antioxidants SOD and DABCO resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of lipofuscin-photoinduced lipid peroxidation (p < 0.05) (TableI). POS incubated with lipofuscin and light demonstrated a mean oxidation rate of 20.5 × 10−2 AU/min compared with 7.9 and 8.0 × 10−2 AU/min in the presence of SOD and DABCO, respectively. Light-induced oxidation of POS in the absence of lipofuscin was also significantly reduced in the presence of DABCO and SOD.Table IThe effect of antioxidants on lipofuscin-induced lipid oxidation of photoreceptor outer segmentsIncubation conditionsMean oxidation rate × 10−4Range × 10−4 (mean ± 95% confidence limits)arbitrary units/min+ Light12.6 8.5–16.7+ Light + SOD7.65.7–9.6+ Light + DABCO7.44.2–9.3+ Lipofuscin + light20.520–21+ Lipofuscin + light + SOD7.97.1–8.8+ Lipofuscin + light + DABCO87.3–8.7POS (1 × 107/ml) were incubated in the presence and absence of lipofuscin (final concentration, 1 × 107granules/ml), with and without white light for 4 h. Experiments were undertaken in the presence or absence of SOD (final concentration, 30 μg/ml) or DABCO (final concentration, 30 mm). At 0-, 2-, and 4-h time intervals samples were removed and analyzed for lipid oxidation by the TBA assay. Lipid oxidation was determined by monitoring the formation of TBA-reactive products at 532 nm using the TBA assay. Open table in a new tab POS (1 × 107/ml) were incubated in the presence and absence of lipofuscin (final concentration, 1 × 107granules/ml), with and without white light for 4 h. Experiments were undertaken in the presence or absence of SOD (final concentration, 30 μg/ml) or DABCO (final concentration, 30 mm). At 0-, 2-, and 4-h time intervals samples were removed and analyzed for lipid oxidation by the TBA assay. Lipid oxidation was determined by monitoring the formation of TBA-reactive products at 532 nm using the TBA assay. Catalase incubated in the presence of light and lipofuscin was inactivated at a significantly higher rate than controls incubated under identical conditions but without lipofuscin (p < 0.05); samples incubated with lipofuscin exhibited approximately 2.5 times less activity than controls at the 60-min time point (Fig.2). In the absence of light, catalase inactivation occurred more slowly (p < 0.05), and no significant differences in inactivation rates between samples incubated with and without lipofuscin were observed. Because lipofuscin affected catalase activity only in the presence of light the effect of antioxidants on the inactivation process was determined only under such conditions (Table II). The addition of SOD failed to protect against lipofuscin-induced catalase inactivation suggesting that superoxide ions were not involved. Inclusion of DABCO in the incubation mixture resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of lipofuscin-photoinduced catalase inactivation (p < 0.05) with samples incubated with both lipofuscin and DABCO demonstrating a mean inactivation rate of 12 × 10−3 AU/min compared with 22 × 10−3AU/min for samples incubated with lipofuscin plus light. In the absence of lipofuscin DABCO itself had no significant effect on the rate of catalase inactivation. The addition of mannitol, a scavenger of hydroxy radicals, to the incubation mixture had no significant effect on the rate of lipofuscin-induced catalase inactivation or the assay system.Table IIThe effect of antioxidants on lipofuscin-induced inactivation of catalaseIncubation conditionsMean inactivation rate × 10−3Range × 10−3 (mean ± 95% confidence limits)arbitrary units/min+ Lipofuscin + light2220–24+ Lipofuscin + light + SOD1714–20+ Lipofuscin + light + DABCO1210–14+ Lipofuscin + light + mannitol2215–29+ Light8.26.4–10+ Light + SOD7.56.8–8.3+ Light + DABCO7.66.5–9.8+ Light + mannitol8.7 7.1–10.3Catalase (300 units/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was incubated in the presence and absence of lipofuscin (final concentration, 1 × 107 granules/ml), with and without white light for up to 60 min at pH 7. Experiments were performed in the presence or absence of SOD (final concentration, 30 μg/ml), DABCO (final concentration, 30 mm), or mannitol (final concentration, 24 mm). Samples were removed at 15-min intervals, and catalase activity was determined by monitoring the rate of H2O2 (50 μm) decomposition at 240 nm, 15 and 30 s after addition of enzyme. To allow for interexperimental variations due to enzyme and lipofuscin batch, enzyme activity is expressed as a decrease relative to time 0 rather than an absolute value.

To allow for interexperimental variations due to enzyme and lipofuscin batch, enzyme activity is expressed as a decrease relative to time 0 rather than an absolute value. In contrast to the light-dependent effect of lipofuscin on catalase, lipofuscin reduced acid phosphatase activity in both the presence and absence of light at pH 7.0 (Fig.3). Acid phosphatase activity in samples incubated with lipofuscin were inactivated at a significantly higher rate (∼2.5 × 10−2 AU/min) than controls (∼1.4 × 10−2 AU/min) incubated in the absence of lipofuscin (p < 0.05) (TableIII).Table IIIThe effect of SOD on lipofuscin-induced inactivation of acid phosphataseIncubation conditionsMean inactivation rate × 10−2Range × 10−2 (mean ± 95% confidence limits)arbitrary units/min− Light1.20.9–1.5+ Light1.51.0–1.8+ Lipofuscin − light2.62.3–3.0+ Lipofuscin + light2.52.0–3.0+ Lipofuscin − light + SOD1.81.0–2.6+ Lipofuscin + light + SOD1.40.9–1.9Acid phosphatase (10 milliunits/ml) was incubated in the presence and absence of lipofuscin (final concentration, 1 × 107granules/ml), with and without white light for up to 60 min at pH 7.

To allow for interexperimental variations due to enzyme and lipofuscin, batch enzyme activity is expressed as a decrease relative to time 0 rather than an absolute value. The rate of lipofuscin-induced enzyme inactivation in the presence of light was significantly reduced from ∼2.5 × 10−2AU/min to ∼1.4 × 10−2 AU/min by inclusion of SOD in the incubation mixture (p < 0.05) (Table III). Inclusion of SOD in the absence of light reduced the effect of lipofuscin from 2.6 × 10−2 AU/min to ∼1.8 × 10−2 AU/min. In the absence of lipofuscin and light, SOD had no effect on enzyme inactivation rates or the amount of residual activity after 60 min of incubation. DABCO was not assessed because it appeared to interfere with the assay system in the presence of light. When the above experiments were repeated at pH 4.5, no significant differences in inactivation rates between samples incubated with and without lipofuscin in the presence or absence of light were found. In the presence of light, lipofuscin induced a small (13.6 ± 0.2%) but significant reduction in tryptophan fluorescence after 8 h of incubation at pH 7.0 compared with light alone or in the dark in the presence or absence of lipofuscin (Fig.4). No significant effects were seen after incubation at pH 4.5. If oxidation had caused aggregation or fragmentation of the BSA a change in the single BSA band would have been observed. However, lipofuscin in the presence and absence of light failed to demonstrate any differences in either the density of the major BSA band or the appearance of additional higher or lower molecular weight bands (data not shown). This study has shown that lipofuscin can photoinduce the oxidation of lipid membranes and inactivate enzymes and that such effects are mediated by the production of reactive oxygen species. Age-related damage to lipid membranes and cellular proteins by such species has been implicated in the general aging process (reviewed in Ref. 21Harman D. Porta E.A. Lipofuscin and Ceroid Pigments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 3-15Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This is the first demonstration that lipofuscin-derived reactive oxygen species can induce such effects. Although the light intensity used in this study is ∼100-fold greater than normal retinal irradiance it is at least 100-fold less than that achieved when sun gazing. Thus the light intensity used in this study equates to that which induces photochemical-induced retinal cell loss in animals. With lipid oxidation, lipofuscin-derived superoxide ions appeared to be more important than singlet oxygen; inclusion of SOD in the incubation mixture induced a greater reduction in the effect of lipofuscin compared with the singlet oxygen scavenger DABCO. This result is surprising, because the redox potential of the (O2/O⨪2; superoxide) couple at −330 mV means that it is incapable of removing an allelic hydrogen from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) during the oxidation process (PUFA⋅/H+-PUFA-H = 600 mV), whereas singlet oxygen is a sufficiently powerful oxidizing agent to exert such an effect (O2(1Δg)/O⨪2 = 650 mV) (22Buettner G.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). At acidic pH values, the protonated form of superoxide (HO⨪2) is a sufficiently strong oxidizing agent to carry out PUFA oxidation. However, lipofuscin only exerted its effect at neutral pH, suggesting the involvement of some other mechanism. Superoxide ions can give rise to the highly reactive hydroxy radical via the Haber-Weiss reaction; this radical is capable of inducing lipid oxidation (23Paillous N. Fery-Forgues S. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The singlet oxygen may have been formed from lipofuscin itself, superoxide dismutation, interaction between superoxide and the hydroxy radical, or disproportionation of the lipid peroxy radical. It appeared to be more important toward the latter stages of the experiment (i.e. DABCO afforded a 39% protection at 2 h, rising to 50% after 4 h). The lag phase may be necessary to allow the generation of other products needed for singlet oxygen formation or damage to the granule membrane to allow these species to escape to exert their effects extragranularly. Concerning the effect of lipofuscin and light on enzyme function, the amount of inhibition and importance of individual reactive oxygen species depended on the type of enzyme. A greater effect was obtained when catalase rather than acid phosphatase was used. This was probably as a consequence of the heme groups contained within the catalase structure at the enzyme's active site (24Young R.W. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1988; 32: 252-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 25Miller D.M. Buettner G.R. Aust S.D. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). It was interesting that lipofuscin had a significant effect on acid phosphatase activity in the absence of light and suggests that in this case, two independent mechanisms were responsible for the inhibition of enzyme function. For catalase, singlet oxygen was the key reactive species in inducing damage, with no significant role of either superoxide or the hydroxy radical. However in this case, the involvement of superoxide ions was difficult to assess because of the spontaneous dismutation of these ions by catalase. These different susceptibilities to damage were probably reflections of the types, accessibility, and importance of oxidizable residues within the protein backbone and active site of the individual enzymes (26Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Vihko P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2609-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Gantchev and van Lier (27Gantchev T.G. van Lier J.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) found catalase to be inactivated by singlet oxygen. However, in their study the hydroxy radical was also implicated, and oxidative damage induced the formation of protein aggregates. These differences were probably due to 1) the free radical generating system used in their study; their system was soluble, possibly allowing generation of reactive oxygen species closer to the target and 2) the more drastic oxidizing conditions (i.e. long exposure periods and higher light exposures). Our study also demonstrated that lipofuscin is capable of oxidizing tryptophan within BSA. Using different regenerating systems Ogino and Okada (28Ogino T. Okada S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and Miura et al. (29Miura T. Muraoka S. Ogiso T. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1992; 85: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) also reported a free radical-induced decrease in tryptophan fluorescence. They also reported BSA fragmentation to be associated with free radical damage. No such effect was observed in this study; this may reflect the different free radical generating system. Whether lipofuscin can exert these oxidative effects in vivo remains open to question. No studies have examined age-related changes in the oxidative state of the RPE cell membrane, although evidence exists for age-related increases in the susceptibility to such damage of both RPE cell membranes (30De la Paz M.A. Anderson R.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1992; 33: 3497-3499PubMed Google Scholar) and membranes from other cell types (31Choe M. Jackson C. Yu B.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 32Mo J.Q. Hom D.G. Anderson J.K. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1995; 81: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Ohia S.E. Bagchi M.

These changes may result in decreased membrane fluidity (31Choe M. Jackson C. Yu B.P. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and increased membrane permeability (35Jain S.K. Ross J.D. Levy G.J. Little R.L. Duett J. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1989; 42: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). If such changes are induced by lipofuscin in vivo, they are likely to initially occur at the level of the lysosomal membrane. Evidence for this is provided by Wihlmark et al. (36Wihlmark U. Wrigstad A. Roberg K. Nilsson S. Brunk U. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the accumulation of lipofuscin-like material causes lysosomal instability following irradiation with blue light. Alternatively, damage to membrane potential due to damage of the proton pump may decrease the hydrogen ion concentration of the lysosome and hence alter enzyme function. The pH dependence of lipofuscin-induced effects suggests that reactive oxygen species pass part way through the lysosomal membrane, exerting their effects in the local environment of the lipid tail groups that will be at a more physiological pH. Age-related variations in RPE enzyme activities have been investigated and found to increase with donor age (37Boulton M.E. Moriarty P. Jarvis-Evans J. Marcyniuk B. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1994; 78: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In other cell types, such changes have been associated with higher levels of lipofuscin (38Brizzee K.R. Ordy J.M. Sohal R.S. Age Pigments. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1981: 317-334Google Scholar) and may be an attempt by the cell to digest this pigment or to increase enzyme activity in response to lipofuscin-induced enzyme inactivation. The next stage in demonstrating a direct role for lipofuscin in RPE cell toxicity will be to carry out intracellular studies."
https://openalex.org/W1995171968,RAG1 and RAG2 are essential for V(D)J recombination and lymphocyte development. These genes are thought to encode a transposase derived from a mobile genetic element that was inserted into the vertebrate genome 450 million years ago. The regulation of RAG1 and RAG2 was investigated in vivo with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenes containing a fluorescent indicator. Coordinate expression of RAG1 and RAG2 in B and T cells was found to be regulated by distinct genetic elements found on the 5' side of the RAG2 gene. This observation suggests a mechanism by which asymmetrically disposed cis DNA elements could influence the expression of the primordial transposon and thereby capture RAGs for vertebrate evolution.

In parasites lacking knobs, vascular adhesion is less efficient, and infected red cells are not able to immobilize successfully under hemodynamic flow conditions even though PfEMP1 is still present on the exterior of the infected red cell. We examined the interaction between the knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP), the parasite protein upon which knob formation is dependent, and PfEMP1, and we show evidence of a direct interaction between KAHRP and the cytoplasmic region of PfEMP1 (VARC).

Further experiments localized the high affinity binding regions of KAHRP to the 63-residue histidine-rich and 70-residue 5′ repeats. Deletion of these two regions from the KAHRP fragments abolished their ability to bind to VARC.

The excessive pathogenicity of P. falciparum appears to be related to an ability to cause infected red blood cells to adhere to vascular endothelium and sequester in the microvasculature of a variety of organs (1Macpherson G.G. Warrell M.J. White N.J. Looareesuwan S. Warrell D.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 385-401PubMed Google Scholar). Knob-like, electron-dense structures located at the membrane surface of infected red cells are the points of adhesion between infected red cells and the vascular endothelium (2Berendt A.R. Ferguson D.J.P. Gardner J. Turner G. Rowe A. McCormick C. Roberts D. Craig A. Pinches R. Elford B.C. Newbold C.I. Parasitology. 1994; 108: S19-S28Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Knob formation is critically dependent upon the expression of the knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP)1 (3Crabb B.S. Triglia T. Waterkeyn J.G. Cowman A.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), an 85–105-kDa parasite protein that associates with the red cell cytoskeletal proteins spectrin and actin (4Kilejian A. Rashid M.A. Aikawa M. Aji T. Yang Y.-F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to KAHRP, several other parasite proteins are also present in knobs including the mature parasite-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (MESA), P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 3 (PfEMP3) and P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) (5Coppel R.L. Cooke B.M. Magowan C. Mohandas N. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). PfEMP1 is a large (200–350 kDa) antigenically diverse parasite protein that is exported from the intracellular parasite and inserted into the red cell membrane (6Leech J.H. Barnwell J.W. Miller L.H. Howard R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 7Howard R.J. Barnwell J.W. Rock E.P. Neequaye J. Ofori-Adjei D. Lyon J.A. Saul A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) where it clusters over the knobs (8Baruch D.I. Pasloske B.L. Singh H.B. Bi X. Ma X.C. Feldman M. Taraschi T.F. Howard R.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 77-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). It is the ligand on the surface of infected red cells which mediates adhesion to a number of endothelial cell receptors including intercellular adhesion molecule 1, CD36, and thrombospondin (9Baruch D.I. Gormely J.A. Ma C. Howard R.J. Pasloske B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3497-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), resulting in the accumulation of infected red cells in the microvasculature (2Berendt A.R. Ferguson D.J.P. Gardner J. Turner G. Rowe A. McCormick C. Roberts D. Craig A. Pinches R. Elford B.C. Newbold C.I. Parasitology. 1994; 108: S19-S28Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).PfEMP1 proteins are encoded by var genes, a highly variable gene family with some 30–50 copies present per parasite genome (10Rubio J.P. Thompson J.K. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4069-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The first exon of a var gene encodes both the ectodomain and the transmembrane domain of PfEMP1 (11Su X. Heatwole V.M. Wertheimer S.P. Guinet F. Herrfeldt J.A. Peterson D.S. Ravetch J.A. Wellems T.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 89-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar); the second exon encodes a relatively conserved cytoplasmic domain (VARC), also called the acidic terminal segment (11Su X. Heatwole V.M. Wertheimer S.P. Guinet F. Herrfeldt J.A. Peterson D.S. Ravetch J.A. Wellems T.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 89-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignments of VARC regions from various var genes have shown that there is general conservation with some diversity among var genes which allows assignment of the highly charged VARC sequences into two general families or into intermediate hybrid groups (12Bonnefoy S. Bischoff E. Guillotte M. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which PfEMP1 is anchored into the membrane of infected red cells has not yet been elucidated, but detergent extraction experiments of infected red cells have revealed that PfEMP1 extraction requires ionic detergents such as SDS (13Aley S.B. Sherwood J.A. Howard R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggesting that PfEMP1 is associated with the cytoskeleton, perhaps by interaction of the VARC domain with the various components of the knobs. Previous studies have shown that parasites lacking a functional KAHRP gene, resulting either from loss of the structural gene by spontaneous deletion or by targeted gene disruption (14Pologe L.G. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1986; 322: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Crabb B.S. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Waller R.F. Caruana S.R. Davern K.M. Wickham M.E. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L.

Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Waller R.F. Caruana S.R. Davern K.M. Wickham M.E. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Cowman A.F.

Parasitology. 1991; 102: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Knobless infected red cells still express PfEMP1 on their membrane surface and are capable of adhering at normal levels when tested in static assays. Remarkably, however, when tested under flow conditions that mimic those in the vasculature in vivo (15Crabb B.S. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Waller R.F. Caruana S.R. Davern K.M. Wickham M.E. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Cowman A.F. Cell. 1997; 89: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) they show a grossly reduced ability to adhere. This decreased adhesiveness under flow can be best interpreted as being the result of defective anchoring of PfEMP1 into the membrane of knobless infected red cells, perhaps due to the absence of an anchoring interaction.In this study we have examined whether VARC may bind to KAHRP using recombinantly expressed fusion fragments of KAHRP and VARC. The protein binding data obtained demonstrate that VARC binds to at least two distinct regions of the KAHRP protein with dissociation constants (KD) comparable to those of other important protein-protein interactions among red cell cytoskeletal proteins and between red cell cytoskeletal proteins and parasite proteins in infected red cells. Experiments using smaller recombinant fusion proteins and deletion mutant proteins have mapped the two main VARC binding regions of KAHRP to regions of 63 and 70 amino acid residues, respectively.DISCUSSIONModification of red cell properties during parasite infection has been attributed to both the presence of parasite-encoded proteins at the red blood cell cytoskeleton and parasite-induced changes to red cell cytoskeletal proteins (for review, see Ref. 5Coppel R.L. Cooke B.M. Magowan C. Mohandas N. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most important acquired property is the capacity of red cells infected with mature parasites to adhere to the vascular endothelium and consequently, disappear from the peripheral circulation. This property is implicated strongly in the causation of severe forms of P. falciparum infection such as cerebral malaria. The work presented here suggests that the parasite adhesin PfEMP1 is anchored at the cell membrane by interaction with KAHRP. KAHRP is a major component of knobs, the electron-dense protuberances on the cytoplasmic face of the infected red cell membrane (24Kilejian A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4650-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 25Leech J.H. Barnwell J.W. Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Howard R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This interaction helps explain why PfEMP1 is found to be clustered at knobs (8Baruch D.I. Pasloske B.L. Singh H.B. Bi X. Ma X.C. Feldman M. Taraschi T.F. Howard R.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 77-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Previous work has identified an association between KAHRP and spectrin and actin (4Kilejian A. Rashid M.A. Aikawa M. Aji T. Yang Y.-F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus the net effect of the interaction between KAHRP and PfEMP1 would be to anchor indirectly PfEMP1 to the red cell membrane skeleton. This indirect linkage is likely to be the explanation of why PfEMP1 has the solubility properties of a cytoskeletal protein being insoluble in the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 (25Leech J.H. Barnwell J.W. Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Howard R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).We have shown that multiple regions of KAHRP bind VARC and have mapped two of these regions to peptide repeat domains comprised of 63 and 70 amino acid residues. We have also presented evidence of a third region of KAHRP which binds VARC, although we believe that this region plays a less significant role in the interaction of KAHRP and VARC than the 63- and 70-residue regions because of the lower affinity of interaction (KD (kin) = 1.3 × 10−5m). Such relatively short sequences make it likely that the binding motifs have a linear nature. The identification of multiple regions in KAHRP which bind VARC contrasts with other studies focused on interactions between parasite proteins and host proteins of the red cell membrane skeleton. For example, the interaction between MESA, which is localized on the cytoplasmic side of the red cell membrane (26Coppel R.L. Culvenor J.G. Bianco A.E. Crewther P.E. Stahl H.-D. Brown G.V. Anders R.F. Kemp D.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 20: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the red cell cytoskeletal protein, protein 4.1 (27Lustigman S. Anders R.F. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) has been localized to 19 residues located in the NH2-terminal region of MESA (17Bennett B.J. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15299-15306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA), which associates with the red cell cytoskeletal protein spectrin (28Foley M. Tilley L. Sawyer W.H. Anders R.F. Mol. Biol. Chem. 1991; 46: 137-148Google Scholar), contains a single 48-residue spectrin binding domain (29Foley M. Corcoran L. Tilley L. Anders R.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas a 30-residue domain confers binding of merozoite surface protein 1 to spectrin (30Herrera S. Rudin W. Herrera M. Clavijo P. Mancilla L. de Plata C. Matile H. Certa U. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mapping studies of KAHRP binding to the red cell cytoskeletal proteins spectrin and actin are less advanced with the binding domain localized to a 271-residue binding region that has not been further characterized (4Kilejian A. Rashid M.A. Aikawa M. Aji T. Yang Y.-F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Determination of the affinities (K(D)) for both GST-K1A and GST-K2A binding to GST-VARC1 gave values indicative of moderate affinity interactions: KD (kin) = 1 × 10−7m and KD (kin) = 3.3 × 10−6m, respectively. A value of KD (kin) = 1.3 × 10−5m was obtained for the binding of GST-K3 to GST-VARC1, indicating an interaction of less significance than the aforementioned regions. Comparison of these K(D)values with those obtained for other protein-protein interactions at the membrane of normal and infected red cells reveals that they are within the range of previously determined K(D) values. The binding of normal red cell cytoskeletal proteins spectrin and band 2.1 was measured at KD ≈ 10−7m, whereas binding between spectrin and band 4.1 returned a similar affinity (KD ≈ 10−7m) (31Tyler J.M. Reinhardt B.N. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7034-7039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The KD (Scat) obtained for the binding between the parasite protein MESA and its partner protein 4.1 was found to be (6.3 ± 1.2) × 10−7m (17Bennett B.J. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15299-15306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The K1A and K2A regions contribute individually to the interaction between KAHRP and VARC at affinities comparable to the single binding domains identified in spectrin-protein 4.1, spectrin-band 2.1, and MESA-protein 4.1. When considering the data obtained for each of K1A, K2A and K3 in conjunction with one another, its seems reasonable that the three regions may act cooperatively to result in an interaction of very high affinity. One caveat is that in the absence of a three-dimensional structure for KAHRP, it is not known whether it is possible for all three regions of KAHRP to interact with a single VARC. However, it is also possible that the three regions could react with separate VARC molecules providing a cross-linking effect that would serve to anchor a number of PfEMP1 molecules in a compact space. This would provide a high density of PfEMP1 ectodomains at the knob and improve binding affinity for endothelial cells. Perhaps it is the loss of clustering of PfEMP1 in the absence of knobs which explains the loss of adherence of knobless infected red cells under flow conditions while their binding ability appears to be maintained in the absence of flow-induced hemodynamic stress. Alternatively, the weakened adhesive properties may be caused by PfEMP1 being “pulled” out of the membrane of infected red cells, due to inadequate anchoring, when subjected to the physiological shear stresses that occur in the circulation in vivo.A prominent feature of many malaria proteins is the presence of extensive regions of sequences repeated in tandem (32Anders R.F. Barzaga N. Shi P.-T. Scanlon D.B. Brown L.E. Thomas L.M. Brown G.V. Stahl H.D. Coppel R.L. Kemp D.J. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. New Ser. 1987; 42: 333-342Google Scholar). It has been quite difficult to assign functional roles to these repeat regions. They are often the target of antibody-induced immunity in individuals living in endemic areas (33Anders R.F. Coppel R.L. Brown G.V. Kemp D.J. Prog. Allergy. 1988; 41: 148-172PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that they act as a form of immunological smoke screen diverting the immune system to low affinity nonprotective antibody responses (34Coppel R.L. Cowman A.F. Lingelbach K.R. Brown G.V. Saint R.B. Kemp D.J. Anders R.F. Nature. 1983; 306: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Anders R.F. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1986; 8: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Occasionally, additional roles have been suggested. For example, the repeats of the circumsporozoite protein have been proposed to play some role in the interaction of the sporozoite with the hepatocyte (36Aley S.B. Bates M.D. Tam J.P. Hollingdale M.R. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1915-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, more recently the binding site has been mapped to nonrepetitive sequence elsewhere in the circumsporozoite protein (37Cerami C. Frevert U. Sinnis P. Takacs B. Clavijo P. Santos M.J. Nussenzweig V. Cell. 1992; 70: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Similarly, the binding site of a second sporozoite protein, thrombospondin-related anonymous protein, for hepatocytes has also been mapped to a region of nonrepetitive sequence (38Muller H.M. Reckman I. Hollingdale M.R. Bujard H. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The binding domains of RESA, MESA and merozoite surface protein 1 mentioned above are all found in nonrepetitive sequence (17Bennett B.J. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the 271-residue spectrin/actin binding region of KAHRP does in fact contain the 5′ repeats (4Kilejian A. Rashid M.A. Aikawa M. Aji T. Yang Y.-F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the interacting domain has not been mapped to a defined peptide sequence within this region. In contrast, both high affinity KAHRP binding domains for VARC identified in this study are mapped to defined repeat regions. The interaction of KAHRP with VARC is likely to have an electrostatic component because at the pH of the infected red cell (39Yayon A. Cabantchik Z.I. Ginsburg H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the overall charges on the histidine-rich and 5′ repeats are positive (+7 and +11, respectively), whereas the overall charge on VARC is negative (−28). Allelic variation of KAHRP between different parasite isolates has revealed that the COOH-terminal region of KAHRP including the 3′ repeats is much more highly variable than the histidine-rich and 5′ repeats (40Kant R. Sharma Y.D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 41Hirawake H. Kita K. Sharma Y.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1360: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus it appears as if there are greater constraints on variation of the histidine-rich and 5′ repeats, and this may be because of their involvement in binding interactions with PfEMP1 and its role in aiding parasite survival by permitting adhesion and sequestration of infected red cells.Increased knowledge of the interactions between malaria parasites and their host red blood cells and between infected red cells and the vascular endothelium may aid the development of new or improved drug therapies. Infected red cells, particularly at later stages of parasite maturation which are sequestered, exhibit increased membrane permeability and as such should enable molecules capable of interfering with the KAHRP-PfEMP1 interaction to enter the infected red blood cell readily. Interference with the anchoring of PfEMP1 by inhibiting its interaction with KAHRP would render parasites unable to sequester in vivo by decreasing adhesive interactions with the vascular interior and increasing destruction rates of infected red cells in the spleen. This would have the effect of lowering parasitaemia and thus decreasing the severity of disease and the morbidity and mortality associated with P. falciparum malaria. Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of human malaria and is responsible for at least two million deaths worldwide each year. The excessive pathogenicity of P. falciparum appears to be related to an ability to cause infected red blood cells to adhere to vascular endothelium and sequester in the microvasculature of a variety of organs (1Macpherson G.G. Warrell M.J. White N.J. Looareesuwan S. Warrell D.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 385-401PubMed Google Scholar). Knob-like, electron-dense structures located at the membrane surface of infected red cells are the points of adhesion between infected red cells and the vascular endothelium (2Berendt A.R. Ferguson D.J.P. Gardner J. Turner G. Rowe A. McCormick C. Roberts D. Craig A. Pinches R. Elford B.C. Newbold C.I. Parasitology. 1994; 108: S19-S28Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Knob formation is critically dependent upon the expression of the knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP)1 (3Crabb B.S. Triglia T. Waterkeyn J.G. Cowman A.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), an 85–105-kDa parasite protein that associates with the red cell cytoskeletal proteins spectrin and actin (4Kilejian A. Rashid M.A. Aikawa M. Aji T. Yang Y.-F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to KAHRP, several other parasite proteins are also present in knobs including the mature parasite-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (MESA), P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 3 (PfEMP3) and P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) (5Coppel R.L. Cooke B.M. Magowan C. Mohandas N. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). PfEMP1 is a large (200–350 kDa) antigenically diverse parasite protein that is exported from the intracellular parasite and inserted into the red cell membrane (6Leech J.H. Barnwell J.W. Miller L.H.

Cell. 1995; 82: 77-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). It is the ligand on the surface of infected red cells which mediates adhesion to a number of endothelial cell receptors including intercellular adhesion molecule 1, CD36, and thrombospondin (9Baruch D.I. Gormely J.A. Ma C. Howard R.J. Pasloske B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PfEMP1 proteins are encoded by var genes, a highly variable gene family with some 30–50 copies present per parasite genome (10Rubio J.P. Thompson J.K. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4069-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The first exon of a var gene encodes both the ectodomain and the transmembrane domain of PfEMP1 (11Su X. Heatwole V.M.

Cell. 1995; 82: 89-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar); the second exon encodes a relatively conserved cytoplasmic domain (VARC), also called the acidic terminal segment (11Su X.

Amino acid sequence alignments of VARC regions from various var genes have shown that there is general conservation with some diversity among var genes which allows assignment of the highly charged VARC sequences into two general families or into intermediate hybrid groups (12Bonnefoy S. Bischoff E. Guillotte M. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PfEMP1 is anchored into the membrane of infected red cells has not yet been elucidated, but detergent extraction experiments of infected red cells have revealed that PfEMP1 extraction requires ionic detergents such as SDS (13Aley S.B. Sherwood J.A. Howard R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggesting that PfEMP1 is associated with the cytoskeleton, perhaps by interaction of the VARC domain with the various components of the knobs. Previous studies have shown that parasites lacking a functional KAHRP gene, resulting either from loss of the structural gene by spontaneous deletion or by targeted gene disruption (14Pologe L.G. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1986; 322: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Crabb B.S. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Waller R.F. Caruana S.R. Davern K.M. Wickham M.E. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L.

Parasitology. 1991; 102: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Knobless infected red cells still express PfEMP1 on their membrane surface and are capable of adhering at normal levels when tested in static assays. Remarkably, however, when tested under flow conditions that mimic those in the vasculature in vivo (15Crabb B.S. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Waller R.F. Caruana S.R. Davern K.M. Wickham M.E. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Cowman A.F. Cell. 1997; 89: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) they show a grossly reduced ability to adhere. This decreased adhesiveness under flow can be best interpreted as being the result of defective anchoring of PfEMP1 into the membrane of knobless infected red cells, perhaps due to the absence of an anchoring interaction. In this study we have examined whether VARC may bind to KAHRP using recombinantly expressed fusion fragments of KAHRP and VARC. The protein binding data obtained demonstrate that VARC binds to at least two distinct regions of the KAHRP protein with dissociation constants (KD) comparable to those of other important protein-protein interactions among red cell cytoskeletal proteins and between red cell cytoskeletal proteins and parasite proteins in infected red cells. Experiments using smaller recombinant fusion proteins and deletion mutant proteins have mapped the two main VARC binding regions of KAHRP to regions of 63 and 70 amino acid residues, respectively. DISCUSSIONModification of red cell properties during parasite infection has been attributed to both the presence of parasite-encoded proteins at the red blood cell cytoskeleton and parasite-induced changes to red cell cytoskelet"

Gold-labeled insulin served to locate the insulin-binding domain. The 3D structure was then fitted with available known high-resolution domain substructures to obtain a detailed contiguous model for this heterotetrameric transmembrane receptor. The 3D reconstruction indicates that the two α subunits jointly participate in insulin binding and that the kinase domains in the two β subunits are in a juxtaposition that permits autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the first step of insulin receptor activation."

Acetaldehyde is also a substrate for P450 2E1 oxidation to acetic acid, and kcat/Km for this reaction is at least 1 order of magnitude greater than that for ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde. Acetic acid accounts for 90% of the products generated from ethanol in a 10-min reaction, and the contribution of this second oxidation has been overlooked in many previous studies. The noncompetitive intermolecular kinetic hydrogen isotope effects on acetaldehyde oxidation to acetic acid (H(kcat/Km)/D(kcat/Km) = 4.5, and D kcat = 1.5) are comparable with the isotope effects typically observed for ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde, and kcat is similar for both reactions, suggesting a possible common catalytic mechanism. Rapid quench kinetic experiments indicate that acetic acid is formed rapidly from added acetaldehyde (∼450 min−1) with burst kinetics. Pulse-chase experiments reveal that, at a subsaturating concentration of ethanol, ∼90% of the acetaldehyde intermediate is directly converted to acetic acid without dissociation from the enzyme active site. Competition experiments suggest that P450 2E1 binds acetic acid and acetaldehyde with relatively high Kdvalues, which preclude simple tight binding as an explanation for rate-limiting product release.

The reaction mixture was chilled to 4 °C to avoid evaporation of the acetaldehyde product and then loaded onto a BakerbondTM quaternary amine 3-ml SPE column that had been washed with CH3OH and equilibrated with H2O as described for steady-state acetaldehyde oxidation assays (see below). The product was eluted with 3 ml of H2O, and the eluent was collected in ∼150-μl fractions. The major radioactive fractions were pooled, and the [1-2H,1-14C]acetaldehyde concentration was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry based on the 14C specific activity of 16.6 mCi mmol−1 indicated by the supplier. The identity of the product was confirmed by derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (33Shriner R.L. Fuson R.C. Curtin D.Y. The Systematic Identification of Organic Compounds. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1965: 253-254Google Scholar) followed by NMR and electrospray mass spectrometry. Based on1H NMR spectrometry (C2HCl3, δ 7.55 for the H-1 proton of the derivatized aldehyde), 2H incorporation was estimated to be ≥99 atom %. P450 2E1 (1.0 μm) was reconstituted with cytochrome b5 (2.0 μm), NADPH-P450 reductase (3.0 μm), andl-α-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (30 μm) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. For steady-state measurements, 100-μl reactions were initiated with an NADPH-generating system (34Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. Raven Press, New York1994: 1259-1313Google Scholar) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in reaction vials sealed with Teflon-lined rubber septa. [1-14C]Acetaldehyde (0–1.0 mm), [1-2H,1-14C]acetaldehyde (0–6.0 mm), or [1-14C]formaldehyde (0–3.0 mm) was also included in the incubation mixture. Reactions were terminated with 20 μl of a mixture of 17% ZnSO4(w/v). The quenched reaction mixture (100 μl) was loaded onto a BakerbondTM quaternary amine SPE 3-ml extraction column that had been washed with CH3OH and equilibrated with H2O. After loading, the reaction mixtures were applied, the columns were washed with 3 column volumes of H2O, and the [14C]acetic acid product was eluted with 2.0 ml of 1n HCl. The radioactive product was collected and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry, with calibration of counting efficiency using external 14C-toluene standards. In competition experiments, P450 2E1 was reconstituted as described for aldehyde oxidation assays. Ethanol (20 mm) was added to the reaction mixture. Acetic acid (0–50 mm, as indicated) was included as the competitive ligand. Ethanol oxidation reactions were initiated with an NADPH-generating system (34Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. Raven Press, New York1994: 1259-1313Google Scholar) and then proceeded for 10 min at 37 °C in reaction vials sealed with Teflon-lined rubber septa. Reactions were terminated with 20 μl of a mixture (1:1, v/v) of 17% ZnSO4 (w/v) and 0.55 mm semicarbazide and saturated Ba(OH)2 (5 μl), followed by centrifugation (three times at 103 × g for 10 min) to remove protein and salts. The acetaldehyde product was derivatized to form the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (33Shriner R.L. Fuson R.C. Curtin D.Y. The Systematic Identification of Organic Compounds. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1965: 253-254Google Scholar) and then analyzed by HPLC using a Zorbax 6.2 × 80-mm octadecylsilane reversed-phase analytical column (3 μm, DuPont) (H2O:CH3CN, 45:55, v/v; flow rate 2.0 ml min−1), monitoring A340 (35Brady J.F. Lee M.J. Li M. Ishizaki H. Yang C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 148-154PubMed Google Scholar). Acetic acid generated from [1-14C]ethanol was quantitated as described above. Deuterium isotope effects were determined by a noncompetitive method (2Northrop D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 607-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). P450 2E1 was incubated with unlabeled (d0) acetaldehyde or [1-2H]acetaldehyde (d1), and the products were analyzed as described. Km and kcat were calculated using the k·cat nonlinear regression program (Bio-Metallics, Princeton, NJ). Pre-steady-state acetaldehyde oxidation reactions were done in a quench-flow apparatus (model RQF-3, KinTek Corp., State College, PA). P450 2E1 (50 pmol) was reconstituted as described above and incubated in the presence of 200 μm [1-2H]acetaldehyde in a total volume of 25 μl (per injection). Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing with 25 μl of 1.0 mm NADPH (50-μl total reaction volume) for a period of time ranging from 2 ms to 2 min (as indicated) at 37 °C. In a similar reaction, ethanol oxidation was initiated by the addition of ethanol to reconstituted P450 2E1 (10Bell L.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29643-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched with 2.0% ZnSO4 (w/v), and acetic acid was quantitated as described for steady-state reactions. Kinetic pulse-chase experiments were conducted in a manner similar to the pre-steady-state experiments. Reconstituted P450 2E1 (50 pmol), preincubated with 10 or 30 mm [1-14C]ethanol (reaction concentrations were 5 and 15 mm [1-14C]ethanol, respectively), was rapidly mixed (using a quench-flow apparatus) with an equal volume of 1.0 mm NADPH. Reactions proceeded for 2 or 100 ms prior to being chased with a 5-fold volume excess of either H2O or 3 mm unlabeled acetaldehyde. The reaction continued for an additional 10 s before being quenched with 10 μl of 2.0% ZnSO4 (w/v). The [14C]acetic acid product was analyzed as described using BakerbondTM quaternary amine 3-ml SPE columns. Evidence of dissociation of the intermediate, acetaldehyde, was observed as dilution of specific activity in the product (acetic acid). P450 2E1 (1.0 μm) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 2.0-ml total volume) was divided equally between two cuvettes, and a base-line spectrum was acquired from 340 to 480 nm using an OLIS-Aminco DW2a spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). To the sample cuvette, 0.3 or 3.0 μm4-methylpyrazole was added, and the resulting “Type II” binding spectrum was recorded and designated as “100% binding.” Aqueous potassium acetate (pH 7.4, 0–35 mm) or acetaldehyde (0–15 mm) was titrated into both the sample and reference cuvettes, and disappearance of the 4-methylpyrazole-induced Type II binding spectrum was quantified on the basis of the decrease in the absorbance difference (ΔA) between 424 and 389 nm (ΔA = A424 −A389). Simulations modeling the observed kinetic data for ethanol oxidation by P450 2E1 were done by mathematical analysis using KINSIM for PC (April 3, 1997 version), obtained from Prof. C. Frieden (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) (36Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Regression analysis was performed using the companion program FITSIM (37Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Both programs were run in DOS version 7.0 on an IBM personal computer. Final fitting was done using FITSIM. Iterative nonlinear regression analysis of the curves is useful for further refinement of kinetic constants and for overall evaluation of the kinetic model based on the fit of the simulation to the experimental data. For several oxidations catalyzed by P450 2E1, deuterium substitution of the substrate produces an apparent isotope effect on V/K but not on V (kcat). Ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde by this P450, and rate-limiting product release has been proposed for this reaction (10Bell L.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29643-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Yang C.S. Ishizaki H. Lee M. Wade D. Fadel A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Acetaldehyde, the product of one such reaction characterized by this pattern of isotope effects, has been reported to be a substrate for P450 2E1 (25Kunitoh S. Asai H. Imaoka S. Funae Y. Monna T. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1996; 20: 22-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Terelius Y. Norsten-Höög C. Cronholm T. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Acetaldehyde was oxidized by P450 2E1 with a value of kcat/Kmat least 1 order of magnitude greater than for ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde (Table I). The Km parameter for the oxidation of acetaldehyde showed more variability than other parameters. For instance, a different preparation of P450 2E1 (than the one used in Table I) yielded kcat = 8.6 ± 0.8 min−1 and Km = 22 ± 3 mm for the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and kcat = 8.2 ± 0.8 min−1 and Km = 86 ± 7 μm for the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid, for an enzyme efficiency (V/K) 240-fold better for the latter reaction. In all work presented in the rest of this paper, direct comparisons of parameters were made only with the same enzyme preparations.Table ISummary and comparison of steady-state kinetic constants for reactions catalyzed by P450 2E1ReactionkcatKmV/Kmin−1mmmin−1mm−1CH3CH2OH → CH3CHO12.6 ± 0.410.4 ± 1.21.2CH3CHO → CH3COOH7.6 ± 0.20.50 ± 0.0315CH3CH2OH → CH3COOH6.0 ± 0.80.84 ± 0.427.1kcat and Km were calculated using the program k · cat.

Open table in a new tab kcat and Km were calculated using the program k · cat. All parameters were determined with a single set of enzymes. The indicated variability was estimated by the software program. Following deuterium substitution of the proton at the C-1 position of the acetaldehyde, a deuterium isotope effect on kcat/Km(D(V/K)) of 4.5 for the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid was measured (Fig. 2). By contrast, only a minimal isotope effect on kcat for this reaction was observed, D V = 1.4. In a reaction mixture that included only 2.0 mm ethanol as substrate, a concentration considerably lower than the Km for oxidation to acetaldehyde, there was little acetaldehyde product detected throughout the time course (Fig. 3). However, considerable formation of acetic acid was detected, ∼10-fold more than the amount of aldehyde detected after 10 min. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants for conversion of ethanol to acetic acid were determined for the overall reaction (Table I). In order to evaluate the potential for rate-determining product release within the context of acetaldehyde oxidation to acetic acid, it was necessary to follow pre-steady-state reaction kinetics in a single turnover experiment. Rapid quench kinetic studies demonstrated a rapid phase of acetic acid formation that includes the first turnover of the enzyme, stoichiometric with the amount of P450 2E1, and is over within ∼100 ms (Fig. 4 A). This “burst” is followed by a much slower phase of product formation, occurring at a rate similar to that measured in steady-state rate experiments. The rapid, pre-steady-state rate of product formation is ∼400 min−1 (Fig. 4 B), much faster than the kcat of 8 min−1 (Table I). Such a burst of product formation is indicative of a rate-limiting step occurring after product formation. Acetic acid was added to P450 2E1 reactions as an inhibitor of the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. In these competition experiments, the concentration of the substrate ethanol was equal to the Km for this reaction (TableI). Even at a concentration as high as 50 mm acetic acid, the rate of ethanol oxidation to acetic acid was decreased <5% (results not shown). This result is interpreted as an indication of poor affinity of the competitor, acetic acid, for the enzyme. The affinity of ligand binding to P450s can often be estimated using characteristic UV-visible binding spectra (340–480 nm), which result from perturbation of the heme in the presence of ligand. Acetaldehyde and acetic acid failed to reliably produce any such spectral changes in the P450 2E1 spectra. 4-Methylpyrazole, a high affinity competitive inhibitor of P450 2E1 reactions (38Koop D.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), binds to P450 2E1 to induce a “type II” spectral shift, with a minimum at 389 nm and a maximum at 424 nm characteristic of nitrogenous ligands. Acetaldehyde or acetic acid was titrated into a mixture of P450 2E1 (1.0 μm) in the presence of 0.3 or 3.0 μm4-methylpyrazole (Ks = 0.33 μm). A decrease in the type II binding spectrum was assumed to result from competition between 4-methylpyrazole and the added ligand. Neither acetaldehyde nor acetate proved to be an effective competitor of 4-methylpyrazole binding. Even at a concentration of 25 mm, acetaldehyde inhibited 4-methylpyrazole binding by <50%, and 35 mm acetic acid inhibited 4-methylpyrazole binding by <40% (results not shown). Although actual Kd values cannot be accurately calculated from the data, binding affinities are relatively weak, and the Kd values are estimated to be >10 mm. In a sequential reaction mechanism, the possibility exists that the initial substrate, once oxidized, can remain in the catalytic pocket of the enzyme as a substrate for a subsequent reaction, without exchange with the medium. Pulse-chase experiments were designed such that radiolabeled ethanol was converted to radiolabeled acetaldehyde (0–100 ms), and the reaction was chased with carrier acetaldehyde, at a concentration of 20 mm(10-fold above its Km). Radiolabel in the final product, acetic acid, is observed only if the labeled intermediate, acetaldehyde, is retained in the enzyme active site for oxidation. In these experiments, 40 and 80% of the radiolabel was recovered in the product acetic acid in reactions containing 5 and 15 mm[1-14C]ethanol (Km = 20 mm), respectively (TableII).Table IIResults of kinetic pulse-chase experiments[1-14C]Ethanol] (present during 100-ms pulse)[1-14C]Acetic acid formed[14C]Acetic acid remaining after chaseWithout 20 mm acetaldehyde chaseWith 20 mm acetaldehyde chasemmnmolnmol%50.32 ± 0.030.14 ± 0.0544 ± 16151.58 ± 0.101.41 ± 0.2089 ± 14P450 2E1 (1.0 μm) was reconstituted as described for steady-state reactions and then preincubated with [1-14C]ethanol.

Interestingly, the level of transforming activity correlated with clinical phenotypes; high group Ret with the A883F or M918T mutation and low group Ret with the E768D, V804L or S891A mutation were associated with the development of MEN 2B and FMTC, respectively.

Each of the above Ras-related proteins operates as a molecular switch that cycles between inactive GDP- and active GTP-bound states. This cycle is tightly controlled in vivo by two classes of regulatory proteins. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 promote the release of GDP from inactive Ras and stabilize the apoprotein so that it can acquire the active, GTP-bound state (5Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) meanwhile promote rapid hydrolysis of Ras-GTP back to the inactive GDP-bound state (21Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar), thus completing the cycle. Oncogenic mutations block GAP-stimulated GTPase activity, thus causing Ras to be locked in the active, GTP-bound, conformation. The various Ras proteins have both specific and overlapping sensitivities to GEFs and GAPs; e.g. the Ras GEF Sos1 can activate Ha-Ras and TC21 but not R-Ras or Rap1A (22Buday L. Downward J.

Additional Ras-interacting proteins (e.g. Rin1, AF6, and NORE) have been identified that may also serve as downstream effectors (24Kuriyama M. Harada N. Kuroda S. Yamamoto T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A.

A search of the NCBI expressed sequence tag data base for Ras-related gene products revealed a novel cDNA that, upon complete sequencing, was found to share 55% amino acid identity with TC21 and Ki-Ras4B. This protein has since been independently described as M-Ras (28Matsumoto K. Asano T. Endo T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and R-Ras3 (29Kimmelman A. Tolkacheva T. Lorenzi M.V. Osada M. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Following the introduction of an activating mutation equivalent to that known to potently enhance the oncogenic activity of Ha-Ras (30Der C.J. Finkel T. Cooper G.M. Cell. 1986; 44: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), overexpression of M-Ras(Q71L) caused morphologic and growth transformation in a manner similar to but distinct from Ha-Ras(Q61L). Similarly to Ha-Ras, overexpression of mutationally activated M-Ras also inhibited the differentiation of C2 myoblasts into myotubes. The ability of M-Ras to induce transcriptional activation and transformation was blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, suggesting the importance of ERK activation to its biological activity. However, M-Ras was considerably more effective than an activated MEK mutant (MEKΔED) at inducing NIH 3T3 cellular transformation, despite being a weaker activator of Elk-1. This suggested that multiple downstream targets contribute to M-Ras-induced transformation. However, M-Ras did not interact with Ras effectors in a yeast two-hybrid interaction assay. Although M-Ras did interact strongly with AF6, a putative downstream target of the Ha-Ras protein (24Kuriyama M. Harada N. Kuroda S. Yamamoto T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Yamamoto D. Prasad R. Croce C.

Biol. 1994; 59: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), AF6 overexpression did not contribute to fibroblast transformation. M-Ras was activated by the Ras-specific GEF, Sos1, and its GTPase activity was sensitive to p120 Ras GAP, suggesting that M-Ras can be regulated by similar upstream pathways to Ha-Ras. However, since M-Ras demonstrated differential Ras effector interactions as well as differential tissue distribution compared with Ha-, Ki-, or N-Ras, it may serve a unique physiological function. Clone AA035915 (Genome Systems Inc.) was found to encode a full-length mouse M-ras cDNA. 5′Bam HI and 3′ Bam HI and Eco RI sites were introduced by polymerase chain reaction-mediated DNA amplification. An activating Q71L mutation was also introduced by two-step polymerase chain reaction, and all products were sequenced prior to subcloning into the pZIP-NeoSV(X)1 (31Cepko C.L. Roberts B.E.

An ∼1,100-base pair fragment encoding the M-ras cDNA was radiolabeled using [α-32P]dCTP and a random-primed DNA-labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used to screen a mouse RNA Master Blot (CLONTECH), essentially as described by the manufacturers. Hybridization was detected by overnight autoradiography at −80 °C, using an intensifying screen. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected essentially as described (37Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Transforming focus forming assays and soft agar assays were performed in NIH 3T3 cells as previously outlined (37Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 38Quilliam L.A. Hisaka M.M. Zhong S. Lowry A. Mosteller R.D. Han J. Drugan J.K. Broek D. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11076-11082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The appearance of foci was scored 16 days post-transfection. For transcriptional activation assays, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 0.75 μg of pZIP-ras together with 125 ng of Gal4-Elk and 2.5 μg of 5XGal4-Luc reporter plasmids (39Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) plus the indicated co-stimuli. 24 h post-transfection, cells were starved (0.5% serum), and luciferase activity was assayed the following day essentially as described (40Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). C2 myoblast cells (provided by Y. Xhong) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. One μg of pZIP plasmid encoding WT or activated M-Ras(Q71L) or Ha-Ras(Q61L) proteins were transfected into C2 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation. After 24 h, cells were selected in growth medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 to establish mass populations of cells expressing the indicated Ras proteins. To induce differentiation, C2 cells were grown to 70% confluence and then fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum and 10 μg/ml insulin (Life Technologies). After approximately 7 days, cells were scored for acquisition of differentiated characteristics. NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3-HA-ERK2 (encoding hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged ERK2) plus 2 μg of pcDNA3 alone or encoding Ha-Ras(Q61L) or M-Ras(Q71L) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). After 24 h, cells were serum-starved (0.1%) overnight and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.27 m sucrose, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mmNa3VO4 50 mm NaF, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 19 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. HA-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco) and ERK kinase activity was determined using myelin basic protein (Sigma) as substrate, essentially as described (41Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). c-Jun N-terminal kinase assays were performed similarly following cotransfection of NIH 3T3 cells with pCMV-FLAG-JNK and using glutathione S-transferase-Jun-(1–79) as substrate. To determine p38 activation levels, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged p38α. Cells were serum-starved as above prior to lysis and Western blotting with an anti-activated p38 antibody (New England Biolabs). Equal loading of lanes was confirmed by blotting for FLAG-tagged p38 with M2 anti-FLAG antibody. Treatment with 10 μg/ml anisomycin (Calbiochem) for 10 min was used as a positive control for c-Jun N-terminal kinase or p38 activation. ERK activity in stable cell lines was determined using an anti-activated ERK polyclonal antiserum (Promega). The system used was a modification of the Fields' two-hybrid system, where one hybrid is fused between the LexA DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–211) and the Ha-Ras(G12V) or M-Ras(Q71L) protein. The second hybrid is a fusion between a nuclear localized VP16 acidic activation domain and full-length RalGDS, cRaf-1, A-Raf, B-Raf, or PI3K p110δ (provided by A. Vojtek), truncated AF6 (provided by L. van Aelst), Rin1 (provided by J. Colicelli), or c-Raf-1. Individually, these hybrids did not activate transcription. However, when co-expressed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that contains two integrated reporter constructs (yeast HIS3 and the bacterial lacZ gene), the yeast strain expressing both hybrid proteins that are capable of forming interactions is prototrophic for histidine and contains detectable β-galactosidase activity (42Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For β-galactosidase expression assays, yeasts co-expressing the indicated Ras and Ras effector plasmids were grown overnight in 5 ml of SC medium without Trp or Leu. Approximately 107 cells (based on A600) were resuspended in 1 ml of Z buffer, lysed by the addition of two drops of 10% SDS and three drops of chloroform, and cleared by microcentrifugation. Lysates were spiked with 200 μl of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml) and incubated at 28 °C until color developed. β-Galactosidase activity was expressed as A420 × 1000/(A600 × time). Human embryonic kidney, 293T, cells were plated at 8 × 105cells/90-mm dish and transfected the following day with pFLAG-CMV2-AF6 (encoding FLAG epitope-tagged AF6) and pCGN, pCGN-M-ras (Q71L), or pDCR-Ha-ras (G12V) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) or calcium phosphate precipitation as described (37Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Both Ras proteins were HA epitope-tagged. 48 h later, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 19 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation (refrigerated microcentrifuge, 10 min), the supernatant was precleared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 10 min. The supernatant was then tumbled with 5 μg of anti-HA antibody (Babco) and 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads for 60 min and washed four times with lysis buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7% gel). Following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.), co-precipitated AF6 was detected using M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vivo guanine nucleotide exchange assays were performed essentially as described (23Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated Ras and GEF proteins. After 36 h, cells were incubated in serum and phosphate-free medium for 30 min followed by similar medium supplemented with 150 μCi of 32Pi for an additional 4 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 19 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and clarified by microcentrifugation for 10 min, and Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA or FLAG antibody. Ras proteins were then denatured at 68 °C in 0.2% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and guanine nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates using 0.75m KH2PO4/HCl, pH 3.4, as solvent. Chromatograms were dried and quantified using an AMBIS β-scanner. To measure GAP activity, glutathione S-transferase-M-Ras and Ha-Ras fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and bound to glutathione-agarose beads in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm GDP, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 19 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Bead-bound proteins were loaded with GTP by incubation, 10 min at 30 °C, in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6 μm GTP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP, 1 mm dithiothreitol. MgCl2 was added to 10 mm, and free nucleotide was removed by washing beads three times with the loading buffer minus GTP. Proteins were then eluted by incubating beads with 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2and 20 mm glutathione on ice for 20 min. 0.2 pmol of GTP-bound Ras (determined by scintillation counting) was then incubated for the indicated times with or without 5 ng of p120 Ras GAP (provided by G. Bollag, ONYX Pharmaceuticals) in a 50-μl final reaction volume containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature for the indicated times. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 1 μl of 10% SDS and heating to 68 °C for 5 min. Guanine nucleotides were separated as above. A search of the NCBI expressed sequence tag data base revealed, in addition to multiple copies of known ras superfamily sequences, a unique cDNA present in both mouse and human libraries. Sequencing of clone AA035915 revealed an open reading frame of 208 codons that shared ∼55% identity with Ki-Ras4B and TC21. This cDNA will be referred to here as M-ras in accordance with Matsumoto et al. who recently isolated this sequence from the murine myoblast C2 cell line (28Matsumoto K. Asano T. Endo T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). M-Ras shares many features characteristic of the Ras subfamily of GTPases (see Refs. 28Matsumoto K. Asano T. Endo T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholarand 29Kimmelman A. Tolkacheva T. Lorenzi M.V. Osada M. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In particular, it shares complete identity with the core effector-binding domain sequence of Ha-, Ki-, and N-Ras (residues 32–40; Fig. 1). To address the tissue distribution of M-Ras, an [α–32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe was generated and used to screen a mouse RNA Master Blot (CLONTECH). As shown in Fig. 2, the M-Ras message was most highly expressed in ovary and brain with lower level detection in many additional tissues including uterus, kidney, spleen, prostate, and lung. A constant level of M-Ras message was also detectable at various stages of development in the whole embryo, possibly reflecting transcription in brain. Although the M-ras message is widely expressed, it exhibits a different distribution pattern from that of Ha-ras (which is most abundant in skin, brain, and skeletal muscle), Ki-ras (most prevalent in gut, lung, and thymus), or N-ras (most abundant in thymus and testis) (43Leon J. Guerrero I. Pellicer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To establish whether M-Ras harbors transforming ability similar to the related Ras, TC21, and R-Ras proteins, we introduced an activating mutation, Q71L, equivalent to that found in the highly transforming Ha-Ras(Q61L) (30Der C.J. Finkel T. Cooper G.M. Cell. 1986; 44: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3 A, M-Ras(Q71L) had approximately 10% of the transforming potential of Ha-Ras(Q61L), generating 563 ± 29 compared with 4975 ± 296 foci/μg (mean ± S.E. for three experiments performed in quadruplicate) in NIH 3T3 cell focus forming assays. As seen in Fig.3 B, M-Ras-transformed foci were typically smaller than those induced by Ha-Ras, and the transformed cells were subtly different from those transformed by activated Ha-Ras and TC21, 2L. A. Quilliam, A. F. Castro, and C. Bi, unpublished observation. being less refractile and producing more elongated extensions at the periphery. This morphology was also quite distinguishable from the dense, nonrefractile foci induced by R-Ras (9Cox A.D. Brtva T.R. Lowe D.G. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3281-3288PubMed Google Scholar). Individual colonies were isolated from NIH 3T3 cells that had been transfected with pZIP-Ha-ras (Q61L), pZIP-M-ras (Q71L), or empty vector and stably selected on G418. These cells were then cultured in soft agar to assess anchorage-independent growth. Fig. 3 C shows that M-Ras-transformed cells can grow in soft agar similarly to Ha-Ras-transformed cells, although the colonies from M-Ras-expressing cells were typically smaller. Like Ras-transformed cells, M-Ras-transformed cells could also survive and grow in low serum (0.5%).2 M-Ras was so named due to its isolation from a C2 myoblast cDNA library. Further, it was found that the M-Ras message level decreased upon differentiation of C2 cells into myofibers (28Matsumoto K. Asano T. Endo T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This suggested that M-Ras might be responsible for restraining cellular differentiation. The differentiation of cultured myoblasts into myotubes is normally kept in check by the inhibitory effects of serum mitogens on the transcriptional activity of muscle regulatory factors such as MyoD. However, upon serum deprivation, cells differentiate and then fuse to form myotubes. Oncogenic Ras can inhibit this process and, in the presence of serum, can induce myoblast transformation (44Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.L. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, while C2 myoblasts expressing wild type M-Ras still differentiated and fused into myotubes upon fetal bovine serum withdrawal, cells overexpressing activated Ha- or M-Ras did not. Both Ha-Ras(Q61L) and M-Ras(Q71L) caused morphological transformation of C2 cells in the presence of serum. 3C. B. Martin and C. J. Der, unpublished observation. Since M-Ras could induce similar biological effects to Ha-Ras, we next wished to address whether this was due to M-Ras activating the same downstream effectors utilized by Ha-Ras. Ras family GTPases can induce the activation of several mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Therefore, we compared the ability of Ha- and M-Ras to activate the ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activa"

Biochem. 1995; 229: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The gene codes for a protein of 609 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 67,488 Da. Determination of the crystal structure of this enzyme (11Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) revealed a molecule with an overall cylindrical shape measuring about 80 × 50 Å. The secondary structure is mainly α-helical with two four-helix bundles as main structural motifs of the secondary structure. The active site of the enzyme is located on top of the second four-helix bundle. The vanadium ion, which is present in its highest oxidation state (5+) as hydrogen vanadate (HVO42−), is coordinated to the protein in a trigonal bipyramidal fashion with three oxygen atoms in the equatorial plane (Fig.1). A covalent bond is formed at one apical position with atom Nε2 of His496, and a hydroxide group is present at the other apical position where it forms a hydrogen bond with Nδ1 of His404(14Messerschmidt A. Prade L. Wever R. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The negative charges of the equatorial vanadate oxygens are compensated by hydrogen bonds to surrounding hydrophilic or positively charged protein groups (Lys353, Arg360, Ser402, Gly403, and Arg490). Analysis of the peroxide form of the enzyme reveals a distorted tetragonal coordination geometry (14Messerschmidt A. Prade L. Wever R. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The apical hydroxide group has been released, and His404 is no longer hydrogen-bonded to any oxygen function of the vanadate. The peroxide binds side-on in the equatorial plane. One of the peroxide oxygens is hydrogen-bonded to Lys353 and to the amide nitrogen of Gly403 a residue that also makes a hydrogen bond to the other oxygen of the peroxide. Arg360 and Arg490 remain hydrogen-bonded to the same oxygens as in the native structure. The active site residues are conserved in three short domains in other VHPOs and most interestingly in several families of acid phosphatases that were considered unrelated (11Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 15Hemrika W. Wever R.

Therefore we proposed that these enzymes have structurally very similar active sites. The homologous acid phosphatases contain important enzymes such glucose-6-phosphatase (17Shelly L.L. Lei K.J.

Although spectroscopic and kinetic studies have revealed many details about the metal-binding site and the reaction mechanisms of both the VBPOs and the VCPOs, the precise role of the active site residues has remained elusive. In trying to gain information about such roles we have created heterologous expression systems in which the C. inaequalis VCPO gene is expressed in Escherichia coli (24Barnett P. The Fungal Vanadium Chloroperoxidase: from Primary Structure to Function.Ph.D. thesis. University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam1997Google Scholar) or in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although the bacterial expression system was shown to produce recombinant enzyme (rVCPO) that could be activated by adding vanadate, the amount of enzyme that could be isolated from this system was very low, hampering in depth analysis of the recombinant enzyme (24Barnett P. The Fungal Vanadium Chloroperoxidase: from Primary Structure to Function.Ph.D. thesis. University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam1997Google Scholar). Here we describe a yeast recombinant expression system that enables us to isolate large amounts of recombinant (apo) enzyme. Determination of the kinetic parameters of this recombinant enzyme shows that these are essentially identical to those of the native enzyme. This S. cerevisiae expression system enables us to create site-directed mutants for rVCPO. Binding and coordination of the vanadate cofactor in the VCPO active site are expected to be essential for enzymic activity. As a first approach in the analysis of the roles of the active site residues in catalysis, we have examined the effects of mutating the basic residues His496, Lys353, Arg360, and Arg490 into alanines. We show that His496is essential for VCPO catalysis and that the K353A, R360A, and R490A mutations basically convert the mutant enzymes into VBPOs. Finally the (gradual) effects of the mutations of residues Lys353, Arg360 and Arg490 are discussed in a proposed general mechanism for VHPO catalysis. E. coli strains HB101 and JM109 were used for the propagation of recombinant DNA constructs. Strains ES1301 mutS (Promega) or Epicurian XL1-blue (Stratagene) were used for the propagation and selection of plasmids after site-directed mutagenesis. E. coli transformants were grown in YT medium (1% w/v yeast extract, 1% w/v casein lysate, and 0.5% w/v NaCl) containing 100 μg of ampicillin for normal transformation or 10 μg/ml tetracycline after (Altered sites®) site-directed mutagenesis. S. cerevisiae strain BJ1991 (Matα, leu2, trp1, ura3-251, prb1-1122, pep4-3) was used as the host of the expression plasmids carrying the wild type or the mutant C. inaequalis VCPO genes. Transformation of yeast was performed according to Ref. 25Klebe R.J. Harries J.V. Sharp D. Lacroute F. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 11: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar. Transformants were selected on minimal medium containing 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 2% (w/v) glucose, 2% (w/v) agar supplemented with tryptophan (20 μg/ml) and leucine (50 μg/ml). Inducible expression of rVCPO was checked by growing yeast transformants in rich medium containing 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) casein lysate, 2% (w/v) agar, and either 2% galactose (induction) or 2% glucose (repression). Fig.2 shows a schematic representation of the DNA fragments and the plasmids used to construct the recombinant expression vector. The 0.8-kb Eco RI-Bam HI fragment containing the inducible S. cerevisiae Gal1 promoter (26St. John T.P. Davis R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 27Johnston M. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) was cloned into Bam HI-Eco RI-digested Yeplac195 (a multi-copy yeast shuttle vector) (28Gietz R.D. Sugind A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) giving plasmid pTNT2. The Eco RI site of pTNT2 was removed by digestion with Eco RI, filling the ends with Klenow polymerase and religation, giving pTNT12. The C. inaequalis VCPO gene was present in pUC18 as a 2.5-kb Pst I-Eco RI genomic DNA fragment containing the 1.1-kb 5′-half of the VCPO gene or as a 0.8-kb Eco RI-PvUII genomic DNA fragment containing the 3′-half of the gene, respectively (10Simons L.H. Barnett P. Vollenbroek E.G.M. Dekker H.L. Muijsers A.O. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A Bam HI restriction site was created, at position −44 with respect to the VCPO start codon, by polymerase chain reaction using Tac polymerase (Promega) and as primers the M13/pUC 22-mer reverse sequence primer and primer WH1-Bam, 5′-GAGAGAGGATCCACTCACTACTTACAATCACAC-3′. After polymerase chain reaction amplification this fragment was isolated and digested with Bam HI and Eco RI. The Bam HI site present in pUC18 containing the 3′ end of the VCPO gene was destroyed by Bam HI digestion, filling of the ends, and religation, giving pTNT13. Digestion with Eco RI and Xba I liberated the 3′ VCPO fragment. A three-point ligation was used to ligate the 5′Bam HI-VCPO-Eco RI fragment and the 3′Eco RI-VCPO-Xba I fragment into pTNT12 digested with Bam HI and Xba I. This resulted in pTNT14, the inducible yeast expression vector. Plasmid pTNT14 was transformed to yeast, and transformants were checked for VHPO activity using the o–dianisidine or the phenol red assay. Yeast cells shown to express rVCPO were inoculated into starter cultures containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB-WO Difco), 2% (w/v) glucose, and 20 μg/ml (w/v) uracil and grown until the end of the log phase. Starter cultures were diluted 1:10 in 1% (w/v) yeast extract (Difco), 1% casein hydrolysate (Difco), and 1% (w/v) glucose and grown until the end of the log phase. The cultures were induced by the addition of galactose to a final concentration of 4% (w/v) and allowed to grow for another 2 days. The yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 3000 ×g) and resuspended to 1 g/ml in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1. An equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma) was added, and the yeast cells were broken using an ice water-cooled bead beater (Biospec) for 5 × 2 min. The suspension was collected, and the glass beads were washed with 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1. After centrifugation (15 min at 5000 × g) an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol was added to the supernatant to precipitate nucleic acids. After centrifugation (20 min at 13,000 × g), the clear supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (0.2 ml slurry/ml supernatant) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1. After washing of the column with 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, and 2 volumes of 0.1m NaCl in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, the enzyme was eluted with 0.6 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1. Upon dialysis against 20 mm piperazine HCl, pH 5.4, a final purification step was performed using a Poros 20 HQ anion exchange column (Perspective Biosystems). The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 to 1.0 m NaCl in 20 mmpiperazine HCl, pH 5.4. Finally the pure apoenzyme was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, or against 100 μmorthovanadate in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, followed by 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, to obtain the reconstituted holoenzyme. rVCPO mutants were produced using either the Altered Sites II (Promega) or the Quickchange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). For the H496A and R490A mutants the 0.8-kb 3′ Eco RI-Hin dIII fragment from pTNT14 was ligated into pAlter1 (Promega) digested with the same enzymes. Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using the primers 1-(H496A) 5′-CCTCGGTGTCGCCTGGCGTTTCGAT-3′ and 2-(R490A) 5′-ACGCCATTTCGGCCATCTTCCTCGG-3′, and after mutagenesis the plasmids were sequenced and fragments carrying the desired mutations were ligated back into pTNT14 digested with Eco RI and Hin dIII. Mutants R360A and K353A were made directly in pTNT14 according to the Quickchange protocol using the primers 3-(R360A) 5′-TTCGAATTCTGGGCCCCACTATCTGGT-3′ and the complementary primer 4-(R360Acomp.) 5′-ACCAGATAGTGGGGCCCAGAATTCGAA-3′ or 5-(K353A) 5′-TCCTGGAAGGAGGCCTGGGAGTTCGAA-3′ and 6-(K353Acomp.) 5′-TTCGAACTCCCAGGCCTCCTTCCAGGA-3′. After checking for the desired mutation by manual sequencing using the T7 Sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) the mutated pTNT14 derivatives were transformed to yeast. Mutant enzymes were isolated as described for rVCPO. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using 7% gels according to Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) under either denaturating conditions (boiling of sample for 5 min in the presence of SDS and β-mercaptoethanol) or native conditions (in the presence of SDS but without β-mercaptoethanol and boiling). The presence of SDS in native SDS-PAGE analysis does not affect enzymic activity (10Simons L.H. Barnett P. Vollenbroek E.G.M. Dekker H.L. Muijsers A.O. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Barnett P. Kruidbosch D.L. Hemrika W. Dekker H.L. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and thus the presence of active enzyme in the gel can be assessed by soaking it in 1 mm o-dianisidine, 50 mm KBr, 1 mm H2O2, 100 μm orthovanadate in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5. Denatured samples were observed using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. VHPO activity can be qualitatively tested using the phenol red assay by incubating aliquots of cells or (partly) purified enzyme in 100 mm phenol red, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5, 100 μmorthovanadate, 50 mm KBr, and 10 mmH2O2. VCPO activity was measured quantitatively by following the chlorination/bromination of monochlorodimedone (ε = 20.2 mm−1·cm−1 at 290 nm) to dichlorodimedone (ε = 0.1 mm−1·cm−1 at 290 nm) in 50 mm sodium citrate/citric acid buffer adjusted to the desired pH and using the appropriate concentrations of the substrates chloride or bromide and H2O2 in the presence of 100 μm orthovanadate using Popspec software on an Atari 1040ST computer coupled to a single beam Zeiss spectrophotometer via the Poptronics 4-channel A/D converter. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Published procedures were used for DNA manipulations (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction and other enzymes used in DNA manipulation were purchased from Roche Molecuar Biochemicals and Promega and used as recommended by the manufacturers. Radioactive chemicals were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. Since the VCPO of C. inaequalis and other hyphomycetes can be isolated from the growth media of these fungi (4Vollenbroek E.G.M. Simons L.H. Van Schijndel J.W.P.M. Barnett P. Balzar M. Dekker H.L. Van der Linden C. Wever R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), these enzymes are considered to be secretion proteins. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence and of the crystal structure of the C. inaequalis VCPO, however, did not show the cleavable N-terminal signal sequence that usually directs eukaryotic secretion proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (10Simons L.H. Barnett P. Vollenbroek E.G.M. Dekker H.L. Muijsers A.O. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This feature, together with the absence of post-translational modification steps like the formation of disulfide bridges and N-linked glycosylation, suggested the presence of an alternative secretion route for the fungal VCPOs (10Simons L.H. Barnett P. Vollenbroek E.G.M. Dekker H.L. Muijsers A.O. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To investigate whether such an alternative route would also be taken when the C. inaequalis enzyme was expressed in S. cerevisiae, we decided to clone the VCPO gene into our yeast expression vector without fusing it to a yeast signal sequence, such as that of the yeast mating type α-factor (32Brake A.J. Bio/Technology. 1989; 13: 269-280PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast colonies transformed with the pTNT14 expression vector (Fig. 2), as indicated by their Ura+ phenotype, were streaked on plates containing rich growth medium supplied with either glucose or galactose. After 2 days of growth, cells from the glucose and the galactose plates were separately resuspended in 200 μl of 100 μm orthovanadate in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, spotted on nitrocellulose filters, and incubated in anο-dianisidine assay mixture. After several minutes a clear color formation could be observed on spots derived from galactose-grown cells but not on those derived from glucose-grown cells, indicating the presence of a galactose-inducible expression system for rVCPO in yeast. Subsequently, liquid cultures were grown from yeast cells shown to express the rVCPO. Activity as measured in these cultures, however, proved to be associated with the yeast cells and could only be detected to the full level after disruption of the cells, indicating that the rVCPO is not secreted by yeast but remains internal. In order to obtain a yeast system in which the rVCPO is secreted into the growth medium, we have also made an expression construct in which the VCPO gene is fused in frame to the yeast α-factor secretion signal. Surprisingly, no stable expression of the rVCPO could be obtained with this system. This feature was not further investigated since using the internal expression system under optimized growth and isolation procedures (as described under “Experimental Procedures”), we are now able to isolate approximately 100 mg of pure (apo) rVCPO from 1 liter of yeast culture. Apo-rVCPO as isolated from the yeast expression system can, like the native protein as isolated from C. inaequalis, easily be activated by incubating the apoenzyme with 100 μm orthovanadate in 50 mmTris/SO4, pH 8.1. Furthermore, addition of 100 μm orthovanadate to enzyme activity assay mixtures results in a very rapid activation of the apoenzyme. Fig.3 shows the results of an SDS-PAGE experiments in which 3-μg samples of purified VCPO were run under either denaturing (Fig. 3 A) or native (Fig. 3 B) conditions. Fig. 3 A shows that the native VCPO (lane 1) and the rVCPO (lane 2) both run as a single 67-kDa band. It was shown (10Simons L.H. Barnett P. Vollenbroek E.G.M. Dekker H.L. Muijsers A.O. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that VCPO remains active in SDS-PAGE gels when β-mercaptoethanol is omitted from the sample buffer, and the samples are not boiled prior to loading. Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2, shows that, although the monomeric form of the enzymes is also visible, under these conditions both the native and the recombinant CPO run mainly as higher molecular weight aggregates that can be stained for activity. EPR spectra were taken to characterize further the rVCPO. After reduction of the sample with dithionite, the typical vanadyl spectrum, as already observed for the native VCPO (6Van Schijndel J.W.P.M. Vollenbroek E.G.M. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1161: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and several VBPOs (33De Boer E. Tromp M.G.M. Plat H. Krenn G.E. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 872: 104-115Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34De Boer E. Plat H. Tromp M.G.M. Franssen M.C.R. van der Plas H.C. Meijer E.M. Schoemaker H.E. Wever R. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1987; 30: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), was obtained (results not shown). Determination of the rate of chloride oxidation by rVCPO as a function of pH by spectrophotometrically following the chlorination of monochlorodimedon revealed an optimum around pH 5 and a maximal value of kcat of 26 s−1. Furthermore, at this optimal pH the Km values for H2O2 and Cl− were determined to be 40 μm and 0.9 mm, respectively. The specificity constant calculated from our data for chloride and H2O2 are 2.9·104m−1 s−1 and 6.5·105m−1 s−1, respectively. These kinetic parameters are very similar to those reported for the native VCPO (kcat of 23 s−1, Km H2O2 10 μmand Km Cl− 0.9 mm) (6Van Schijndel J.W.P.M. Vollenbroek E.G.M. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1161: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,8Van Schijndel J.W.P.M. Barnett P. Roelse J. Vollenbroek E.G.M. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of the apo-rVCPO and its reconstituted holo form have been determined very recently (35Macedo-Ribeiro S. Hemrika W. Renirie R. Wever R. Messerschmidt A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is reported that the overall structure of the rVCPO is nearly identical to that of the native VCPO, which holds particularly for the vanadate-binding site (35Macedo-Ribeiro S. Hemrika W. Renirie R. Wever R. Messerschmidt A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These results confirm that the recombinant enzyme is very similar to the native one. We therefore decided to use this rVCPO as the wild type control in the experiments describing the parameters of the mutant enzymes. Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 3–6, shows the purified mutant enzymes run on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for protein identification (Fig. 3 A) or with o-dianisidine to determine activity (Fig. 3 B). It can be seen in Fig. 3 A that all mutant proteins run similarly to the native VCPO and the rVCPO. Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–5, shows that mutants R490A, R360A, and K353A, respectively, retain (bromo) peroxidase activity with that of mutant K353A being very little (lane 5). Mutant H496A (Fig.3 B, lane 6) shows no activity at all. However, when the activity stained gel is subsequently incubated with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, also in lane 6 a protein band is visible running at the same height as those in lanes 1–5 of Fig.3 B (results not shown). The results obtained with the non-denaturing SDS-PAGE analysis indicate that the overall structure of the mutant proteins is similar to that of the native VCPO and the rVCPO. This is confirmed by the crystal structures of the mutants that have very recently been analyzed (35Macedo-Ribeiro S. Hemrika W. Renirie R. Wever R. Messerschmidt A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). From the mutants studied here, x-ray crystal structures are obtained for mutants H496A and R360A. The crystal structure analysis indicates that the vanadate-binding pocket forms a very rigid frame, stabilizing oxyanion binding. Furthermore, the empty spaces left by the replacement of the large side chains by an alanine are usually occupied by new solvent molecules, which partially replace the hydrogen bonding interactions to the vanadate (35Macedo-Ribeiro S. Hemrika W. Renirie R. Wever R. Messerschmidt A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A kinetic analysis of the rVCPO and the mutant enzymes was started to evaluate importance of these active site residues in catalysis. It is conceivable that the mutations also affect the affinity of the apoenzyme for the cofactor. This was not investigated, but to compensate for such potential effects the kinetic experiments were performed in the presence of excess (100 μm) orthovanadate. When the activity of the rVCPO and the mutants was measured with chloride as a substrate it was found that, as expected, mutant H496A was inactive, but also mutants R490A and K353A showed very low chloroperoxidase activity. When the rate of the chlorination reaction was measured as a function of chloride concentra"

The crusts are separated by more than 3000 kilometers but display similar secular variations. Significant fluctuations in hafnium isotopic composition occurred in the Eocene and Oligocene, possibly related to direct advection from the Indian and Atlantic oceans. Hafnium isotopic compositions have remained approximately uniform for the past 20 million years, probably reflecting increased isolation of the central Pacific.

The cDNA cloning and characterization of Dm-dNK will be the basis for studies on the use of this multisubstrate nucleoside kinase as a suicide gene in combined gene/chemotherapy of cancer. herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase thymidine kinase 1 thymidine kinase 2 deoxycytidine kinase deoxyguanosine kinase D. melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid Deoxyribonucleoside kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of 2′-deoxyribonucleosides to 2′-deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates. The human deoxyribonucleoside kinases and the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-1 TK)1have been intensively studied because they catalyze the rate-limiting step in the pharmacological activation of many nucleoside analogs (1Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The nucleoside kinases have distinct, although partially overlapping, substrate specificities. Human mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) is a purine nucleoside kinase that phosphorylates dGuo, dAdo, and dIno (2Wang L. Karlsson A. Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Zhu C. Johansson M. Permert J. Karlsson A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). dGuo and dAdo are also phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) in addition to dCyd, which is the main substrate of this enzyme (4Johansson M. Karlsson A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Bohman C. Eriksson S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4258-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). dCK and dGK are sequence-related to mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and to HSV-1 TK (6Johansson M. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7258-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Johansson M. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The latter two enzymes phosphorylate the pyrimidine nucleosides dThd, dUrd, and dCyd (8Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The S-phase-specific cytosolic thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) phosphorylates dThd and dUrd (8Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but TK1 is not sequence-related to the other mammalian or herpes simplex virus nucleoside kinases. Munch-Petersen et al. (9Munch-Petersen B. Piskur J. Sondergaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) recently reported that Drosophila melanogaster embryonic S-2 cells contain a single major deoxyribonucleoside kinase. The D. melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase (Dm-dNK) is, in contrast to the other enzymes, a multisubstrate nucleoside kinase. Although pyrimidine nucleosides are the preferred substrates of the enzyme, it catalyzes phosphorylation of all the natural pyrimidine and purine deoxyribonucleosides. The enzyme also efficiently phosphorylates several anti-viral and anti-cancer nucleoside analogs. The catalytic rate of deoxyribonucleoside phosphorylation by Dm-dNK is, depending on the substrate, 10- to 100-fold higher than what has been reported for the mammalian enzymes. The broad substrate specificity and the high catalytic rate make Dm-dNK unique among the members of the deoxyribonucleoside kinase enzyme family. In recent years, the use of nucleoside kinases as suicide genes in gene therapy of cancer has been intensively studied. The prototype for combined gene/chemotherapy of malignant tumors is transduction of tumor cells with the gene encoding HSV-1 TK and subsequent systemic chemotherapy with the nucleoside analog ganciclovir (10Culver K.W. Ram Z. Wallbridge S. Ishii H. Oldfield E.H. Blaese R.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1550-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). However, transduction of tumor cells with the cDNAs encoding other nucleoside kinases, such as human dCK and dGK, has also been demonstrated to increase the effects of cytotoxic nucleoside analogs (11Manome Y. Wen P.Y. Dong Y. Tanaka T. Mitchell B.S. Kufe D.W. Fine H.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Hapke D.M. Stegmann A.P.A. Mitchell B.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zhu C. Johansson M. Permert J. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14707-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because the initial activation step is rate-limiting for the phosphorylation of the majority of nucleoside analogs, the properties of the enzyme catalyzing this step are important for the efficiency of gene therapy. In an effort to find better suicide genes for gene therapy, mutants of HSV-1 TK have been genetically engineered with improved kinetic properties for nucleoside analog phosphorylation (14Black M.E. Newcomb T.G. Wilson H-M.P. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3525-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Cancer cells transfected with these mutant nucleoside kinase genes become more sensitive to cytotoxic nucleoside analogs compared with cells transfected with the wild-type enzyme. Accordingly, the kinetic properties of the nucleoside kinases constitute a limiting factor in the efficiency of suicide gene therapy, and there is a need to identify better enzymes for further development of this therapeutic strategy. The unique kinetic properties of Dm-dNK make it a candidate suicide gene for combined gene- and chemotherapy of cancer. We have in the present study cloned the cDNA of Dm-dNK to enable characterization of the enzyme with regard to phosphorylation of nucleoside analogs and compared its properties to those of the sequence-related human and herpes simplex virus nucleoside kinases. The sequence and substrate specificity of Dm-dNK indicated that the enzyme had evolved close to human TK2, but that it also exhibited sequence similarity and overlapping substrate specificity with dCK, dGK, and HSV-1 TK. The identification and cloning of a novel enzyme with broad substrate specificity and high catalytic activity for phosphorylation of nucleoside analogs will be the basis for evaluation of its potential use in combined gene/chemotherapy of cancer. We searched the expressed sequence tag library of the GenBank™ data base at the National Institute for Biotechnology Information with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (15Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70319) Google Scholar) to identify D. melanogaster cDNA clones that encode enzymes similar to human dCK, dGK, and TK2 (6Johansson M. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7258-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Johansson M. Karlsson A. J. Biol.

Harvey (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California). The DNA sequence of the plasmid was determined with the automatic laser fluorescent (A.L.F.) sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We expressed Dm-dNK in E. coli as a fusion protein to glutathione S-transferase. Two oligonucleotide primers that flanked the open reading frame of the cDNA were designed with Eco RI and Sal I restriction enzyme sites (5′-AAGAATTCGGACTGATGGCGGAGGCAGCATCC and 5′-AAGTCGACGTACTAATGGGATAATGGTTATCT). The oligonucleotides were used in a polymerase chain reaction, and the amplified DNA fragment was cloned in the Eco RI-Sal I sites of the pGEX-5X-1 plasmid vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmid was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Stratagene), and the protein was expressed and purified as described (7Johansson M. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The size and purity of the recombinant protein was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Phast system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein concentration was determined with Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), and bovine serum albumin was used as the concentration standard. The phosphoryl transfer assay was performed using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (17Eriksson S. Kierdaszuk B. Munch-Petersen B. Öberg B. Johansson N.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The nucleosides were added to a final concentration of 5 μm in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm unlabeled ATP, 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of recombinant Dm-dNK. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Two μl of the reaction mixtures were spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose F thin layer chromatography sheets (Merck), and the nucleotides were separated in a buffer containing NH4OH:isobuturic acid:distilled H2O (1:66:33). The sheets were autoradiographed using phosphorimaging plates (BAS 1000, Fujix). The radiolabeled substrates [methyl-3H]dThd (70 Ci/mmol), [5-3H] dCyd (21.1 Ci/mmol), [8-3H]dGuo (6.1 Ci/mmol), and [8-3H]dAdo (13 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). The cDNAs of TK1, TK2, dCK, dGK, and HSV-1 TK were inserted in the pGEX-5X-1 vector, expressed as fusion proteins to glutathione S-transferase, and purified as described (7Johansson M. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The activity of the purified recombinant nucleoside kinases were assayed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (22 °C), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm CHAPS, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm ATP, indicated concentrations of [methyl-3H]dThd, [5-3H]dCyd, [8-3H]dGuo, or [8-3H]dAdo, and recombinant Dm-dNK. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of different concentrations of the test compounds. Aliquots of 45 μl of the reaction mixtures were spotted on Whatman DE-81 filter paper disks. The filters were washed 3 times for 5 min in 1 mm ammonium formate, 1 time for 1 min in H2O, and 1 time for 5 min in ethanol. The radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. The Km and Vmax values were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The software package TREECON (18Van de Peer Y. De Wachter R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 569-570PubMed Google Scholar) was used for the phylogenetic analysis. We performed distance calculations with Poisson correction. Insertions and deletions were taken into account, and bootstrap analysis was performed with value 100. The neighbor-joining method with bootstrap was used to interfere the tree topology. The multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase of D. melanogaster purified by Munch-Petersen et al. (9Munch-Petersen B. Piskur J. Sondergaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) has several biochemical features in common with the human deoxyribonucleoside kinases. Therefore, we hypothesized that Dm-dNK may belong to this enzyme family. We used the amino acid sequences of human dCK, dGK, and TK2 to search the expressed sequence tag library of the GenBank™ data base for D. melanogaster cDNA clones that encoded sequence homologues proteins. An expressed sequence tag clone that encoded a protein ≈30% identical to the human nucleoside kinases was identified (LD15983, D. Harvey and co-workers). DNA sequence determination of the 1001-base pair clone showed that it contained an open reading frame encoding a 250-amino acid residue protein with a predicted molecular mass of 29 kDa (Fig. 1). We expressed the cDNA-encoded enzyme to study the activity of this putative nucleoside kinase. Among the natural deoxyribonucleosides, the enzyme phosphorylated the pyrimidine nucleosides dThd, dUrd, and dCyd as well as the purine nucleosides dAdo and dGuo (data not shown). The enzyme did not phosphorylate ribonucleosides, nor did it phosphorylate the nucleoside monophosphate dTMP (data not shown). The enzymatic activity, assayed with 1 μm deoxyribonucleosides, showed relative phosphorylation efficiencies of 100% for dThd, 83% for dCyd, 1.8% for dAdo, and 0.14% for dGuo. The specificity of nucleoside phosphorylation, as well as the molecular mass of the protein, were thus similar to what has been described for Dm-dNK (9Munch-Petersen B. Piskur J. Sondergaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the cloned D. melanogaster cDNA encoded the multisubstrate Dm- dNK. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic properties of recombinant Dm-dNK were determined for the natural substrates dThd, dCyd, dAdo, and dGuo (TableI). The pyrimidine nucleosides dThd and dCyd were the preferred substrates of Dm-dNK, and these nucleosides showed similar affinities and catalytic rates. Although dAdo and dGuo phosphorylation was catalyzed by the enzyme, the affinities for these substrates were ≈100- to 1000-fold lower as compared with the affinity of the pyrimidine nucleosides. However, the maximal catalytic rates of all four deoxyribonucleosides were similar, ranging from 220 to 910 nmol/μg/h. Although we performed the assay at similar conditions as described by Munch-Petersen et al. (9Munch-Petersen B. Piskur J. Sondergaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the absolute Vmax values of native Dm-dNK are reported to be ≈2- to 10-fold higher than those determined for the recombinant enzyme. In spite of the difference in maximal catalytic velocity, the similarities in affinity to the nucleoside substrates support the conclusion that the cloned cDNA encodes Dm-dNK.Table IKinetic properties of recombinant Dm-dNK fused to GST for the natural 2′-deoxyribonucleosidesKmVmaxVmax/Kmμmnmol/μg/hdThd1.6240150dCyd2.6370140dGuo20002200.11dAdo3739102.4 Open table in a new tab To compare the different nucleoside kinases for the phosphorylation of nucleosides and nucleoside analogs, we assayed the inhibitory activity of the natural nucleosides and nucleoside analogs on the phosphorylation of their preferred natural substrates. Recombinant Dm-dNK, HSV-1 TK, and human dCK, dGK, and TK2 were included in this comparative study, and the IC50 values of the phosphorylation of 1 μm substrates were determined. We also included the S-phase specific TK1, although it does not share conserved sequences with the other nucleoside kinases nor exhibit as broad a substrate specificity as the other enzymes. The experiments with natural nucleosides showed that the pyrimidine nucleosides dCyd, dUrd, and dThd were able to efficiently compete with dCyd and dThd for phosphorylation by Dm-dNK and human TK2 (TableII). TK1 showed, as expected, a narrower substrate specificity than the other thymidine kinases, since only dUrd, and not dCyd, competed with dThd phosphorylation. dCyd was not an efficient competitor of HSV-1 TK-catalyzed dThd phosphorylation, but in contrast to the other thymidine kinases, the purine nucleoside dGuo slightly inhibited the phosphorylation of both dThd and dCyd catalyzed by HSV-1 TK. The human nucleoside kinases, dCK and dGK, showed strong preference for dCyd and dGuo, respectively. However, dIno was able to compete with dGuo phosphorylation catalyzed by dGK.Table IIInhibitory activity (IC50) (μm) of natural 2′-deoxyribonucleosides on the phosphorylation of 1 μmradiolabeled dThd, dCyd, dAdo, or dGuo catalyzed by nucleoside kinasesDm-dNKTK1TK2dCKdGKHSV-1 TKdThddCyddThddThddCyddCyddAdodGuodThddCyddAdo>1000888 ± 158>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000dGuo>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000875 ± 63401 ± 188dIno>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>100031.2 ± 5.7>1000>1000dCyd4.12 ± 2.09>1000524 ± 1560.18 ± 0.10>1000>1000dThd3.48 ± 1.0460.4 ± 7.3>1000>1000>10003.72 ± 0.35dUrd30.2 ± 6.825.2 ± 3.585.2 ± 16.0140 ± 53824 ± 3>1000>1000>1000122 ± 825 ± 0.35 Open table in a new tab We further tested 19 nucleoside analogs to determine their ability to compete with natural deoxyribonucleosides (TableIII). The compounds tested have been shown to be active as either anti-viral or anti-cancer agents. Most of the investigated dThd and dUrd analogs inhibited dCyd and dThd phosphorylation catalyzed by Dm-dNK, TK2, and HSV-1 TK. Among the pyrimidine nucleoside analogs, the anti-herpetic compound (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine (BVDU) was the most efficient substrate to compete with dThd for phosphorylation by Dm-dNK as well as for TK2 and HSV-1 TK. Phosphorylation of dThd and dCyd by Dm-dNK was also efficiently inhibited by all tested dCyd analogs. Although TK2 activity was inhibited by a few dCyd analogs, the degree of inhibition was less pronounced. Similarly, none of the dCyd analogs inhibited HSV-1 TK-catalyzed phosphorylation. dCK was the enzyme most efficiently inhibited by dCyd analogs. As expected, dAdo phosphorylation catalyzed by dCK was more efficiently inhibited than dCyd phosphorylation, because dAdo exhibits lower affinity to dCK than dCyd. dCK also phosphorylates several purine nucleosides and purine nucleoside analogs. However, among the investigated purine nucleoside analogs, only 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine was able to efficiently inhibit dCyd and dAdo phosphorylation. Interestingly, 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine was also the only purine nucleoside analog that efficiently inhibited dCyd and dThd phosphorylation catalyzed by Dm-dNK. The human purine nucleoside kinase dGK showed a narrow specificity regarding the inhibition of dGuo phosphorylation, since only the deoxyguanosine analogs araG and dFdG were inhibitors of the reaction. HSV-1 TK is also a purine nucleoside kinase, and it phosphorylates the acyclic guanosine analogs acyclovir and ganciclovir. In the present study, we detected inhibition by ganciclovir, and dFdG of HSV-1 TK catalyzed dThd and dCyd phosphorylation.Table IIIInhibitory activity (IC50) (μm) of nucleoside analogs on the phosphorylation of 1 μm radiolabeled dThd, dCyd, dAdo, or dGuoBaseAnalogDm-dNKTK1TK2dCKdGKHSV-1 TKdThddCyddThddThddCyddCyddAdodGuodThddCydAaraA>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000CdA123 ± 14120 ± 6>1000>1000>1000154 ± 305.75 ± 1.00>1000>1000>1000GaraG>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000466 ± 34>1000>1000dFdG>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000186 ± 6255 ± 196100 ± 27GCV>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000102 ± 6282.3 ± 12.8HxddI>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000CaraC53.4 ± 18.989.0 ± 24.0>1000>1000>1000555 ± 3025.19 ± 1.64>1000>1000>1000ddC760 ± 8838 ± 53>1000>1000661 ± 102>1000124 ± 4>1000>1000>1000dFdC145 ± 1102 ± 30>1000>1000948 ± 73137 ± 766.30 ± 0.18>1000>1000>10003TC740 ± 31868 ± 95>1000>1000>1000150 ± 1512.5 ± 7.9>1000>1000>1000TaraT64.8 ± 27.734.8 ± 5.6>1000285 ± 94>1000>1000>1000>100024.1 ± 3.021.0 ± 0.8AZT41.9 ± 12.929.6 ± 0.86.03 ± 1.145.48 ± 0.97190 ± 14>1000>1000>100018.4 ± 10.711.4 ± 1.9ddT75.0 ± 17.670.3 ± 2.5574 ± 3728.6 ± 5.4526 ± 80>1000>1000>100041.3 ± 18.76.54 ± 1.08d4T>1000805 ± 275>1000183 ± 7>1000>1000>1000>1000860 ± 198300 ± 37UaraU570 ± 66580 ± 49>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000BVaraU27.7 ± 10.015.8 ± 2.8>50043.4 ± 5.8485 ± 21>1000>1000>10003.56 ± 1.503.75 ± 2.39BVDU2.57 ± 0.451.94 ± 0.54>5000.34 ± 0.109.03 ± 6.03>1000>1000>10002.87 ± 1.543.09 ± 1.39FdUrd25.8 ± 0.823.5 ± 5.029.8 ± 0.836.1 ± 5.5845 ± 53>1000>1000>100058.2 ± 32.111.4 ± 3.8FIAU16.3 ± 0.115.4 ± 2.6>50064.6 ± 4.2469 ± 15>200>200>10002.29 ± 1.315.05 ± 2.58araA, 9-β-d-arabionofuranosyladenine; araC, 1-β-d-arabionofuranosylcytosine; araG, 9-β-d-arabinofuranosylguanine; araT, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylthymine; araU, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosyluracil; AZT, 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine; BVaraU, (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-1-β-d-arabinofuranosyluracil; BVDU, (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine; CdA, 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine; ddC, 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine; ddI, 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine; ddT, 2′,3′-dideoxythymidine; dFdC, 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine; dFdG, 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyguanosine; d4T, 2′,3′-didehydro-3′-deoxythymidine; FdUrd, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine; FIAU, 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil; GCV, ganciclovir; 3TC, 2′-deoxy-3′-thiacytidine, Hx, hypoxanthine.

Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of Dm-dNK with the sequences of the human deoxyribonucleoside kinases and HSV-1 TK showed that Dm-dNK was 38% identical to human TK2, 28% identical to dCK and dGK, and 14% identical to HSV-1 TK (Fig. 2).Dm-dNK was of similar length as the human deoxyribonucleoside kinases, whereas HSV-1 TK was larger than the other enzymes due to an extended C-terminal domain. Dm-dNK showed a similar alignment as TK2, because both these enzymes lacked three regions (starting at amino acids 63, 93, and 190) as compared with dCK, dGK, and HSV-1 TK. The crystal structure of HSV-1 TK in complex with nucleosides and nucleoside analogs has been solved, and several regions involved in substrate binding and catalysis have been identified (19Brown D.G.

The ATP binding glycine-rich loop located in the N-terminal domain of the enzyme was highly conserved in Dm-dNK, as well as in the other nucleoside kinases. HSV-1 TK amino acid residues involved in binding of the nucleoside sugar moiety include Glu-83 and Arg-163, which bind to the 5′ OH group, and Tyr-101 and Glu-225, which bind to the 3′ OH group. Except Tyr-101, these residues are absolutely conserved in all the five enzymes. Tyr-101 is located in a part of HSV-1 TK that is not present in Dm-dNK or TK2, and the corresponding regions of dCK and dGK exhibit low levels of sequence conservation. HSV-1 TK amino acid residues involved in binding of the thymine base include Ile-100, Gln-125, Met-128, and Tyr-172. Met-128 binds to the thymine N3 group with support from Ile-100. Gln-125 forms hydrogen bounds with the 4-carbonyl group and with the 3-NH group. Tyr-172 stacks against the thymine base on the opposite side to Ile-100 and Met-128. Gln-125 is absolutely conserved in all kinases, and Tyr-172 is also highly conserved in all enzymes, except in Dm-dNK, where it is replaced by an arginine. A methionine at the position equivalent to HSV-1 TK Met-128 is not present in any of the other enzymes. However, the physical properties at this position are conserved, since all enzymes have an uncharged amino acid residue at this position. Similar to HSV-1 TK Tyr-101, which is involved in binding of the sugar moiety, Ile-100 is located in a region that is not present in Dm-dNK or TK2 and not conserved in dCK and dGK. Other HSV-1 residues located in close association to the substrate or phosphate donor sites are Pro-84, Thr-88, Arg-216, Arg-220, and Arg-222. These residues are conserved in all the five nucleoside kinases. The close sequence relation of the nucleoside kinases suggest an evolutionary relationship. We generated a prediction of their phylogenetic relation, and the analysis suggested that the enzyme family is divided in two separate evolutionary branches (Fig.3). One branch contained TK2, Dm-dNK, and HSV-1 TK, and the second branch dCK and dGK. We have identified, cloned, and recombinantly expressed the cDNA of the multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase of D. melanogaster. Although the pyrimidine nucleosides dCyd, dThd, and dUrd are the preferred substrates of the recombinant enzyme, it also catalyzed the phosphorylation of the purine nucleosides dAdo and dGuo. We thereby provided further evidence that Dm-dNK purified by Munch-Peterson et al. (9Munch-Petersen B. Piskur J. Sondergaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) is a single protein with the ability to phosphorylate all the natural deoxyribonucleosides. The sequence of Dm-dNK showed that the enzyme is closely related to the mammalian deoxyribonucleoside kinase enzyme family and to herpesvirus thymidine kinases. The partially overlapping substrate specificities and sequence similarities of the deoxyribonucleoside kinases suggest a common ancestor for these enzymes. The phylogenetic analysis in our study, comprising the human deoxyribonucleoside kinases and HSV-1 TK, suggests that the enzyme family is divided in two separate evolutionary branches. Dm-dNK showed closest sequence similarity to human TK2, and these two enzymes also exhibited similar patterns of substrate specificity for the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleosides and pyrimidine nucleoside analogs. However, a major difference compared with TK2 is the broader substrate specificity of Dm-dNK with its ability to phosphorylate purine nucleosides and purine nucleoside analogs. The substrate specificity of Dm-dNK for purine nucleosides was most similar to dCK. Taken together, the multisubstrate nucleoside kinase of D. melanogaster combines the activity of the mammalian enzymes TK2 and dCK and, thus, phosphorylates a broad range of substrates. The mammalian dGK showed narrower substrate specificity and accordingly shared less substrates with Dm-dNK, although dGK is as closely sequence-related to the enzyme as dCK. HSV-1 TK also belongs to the same evolutionary branch as Dm-dNK, and this is supported by the similarities in substrate specificity toward dThd and dUrd analogs. Major differences between HSV-1 TK and Dm-dNK were the higher affinity toward dCyd analogs for Dm-dNK and the higher affinity of HSV-1 TK toward the guanosine analogs ganciclovir and 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyguanosine compared with Dm-dNK. A third difference between these enzymes is the dTMP kinase activity of HSV-1 TK, which was not present in the Dm-dNK nor in any of the mammalian deoxyribonucleoside kinases. Mammalian cells contain four major deoxyribonucleoside kinase activities that have been identified as TK1, TK2, dCK, and dGK. Many bacteria, such as E. coli, only have a thymidine kinase that is partly similar to the eukaryotic TK1. It appears that these organisms lack enzymes related to dCK, dGK, TK2, or HSV-1 TK. However, certain bacteria such as Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 contain nucleoside kinases that belong to the family of mammalian and herpesvirus enzymes (21Ma G.T. Hong Y.S. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In D. melanogaster cells a single deoxyribonucleoside kinase activity was detected (9Munch-Petersen B. Piskur J. Sondergaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The lack of other nucleoside kinases in this organism is further supported by the apparent absence of expressed sequence tag cDNAs encoding other D. melanogaster enzymes related to Dm-dNK or to human TK1. Accordingly, it appears that the enzymes involved in the pathways of deoxyribonucleoside salvage are highly organism-specific. A general feature for several nucleoside kinases is their broad substrate specificity, although Dm-dNK is the first enzyme identified that phosphorylates all four natural deoxyribonucleotides. The mammalian enzymes expressed throughout the cell cycle are believed to be important for the supply of dNTP for DNA repair and mitochondrial DNA replication. Together the mammalian enzymes phosphorylate all deoxyribonucleosides required for DNA synthesis although with different affinities for the different deoxyribonucleosides. The kinetic data indicate a single substrate binding site in the nucleoside kinases, including the multisubstrate Dm-dNK. In situ, where all deoxyribonucleosides are present, it is likely that the Dm-dNK would preferentially phosphorylate dThd and dCyd compared with dGuo and dAdo. However, little is known about the pathways of dNTP synthesis and its regulation in Drosophila cells, and further studies have to be done to elucidate any difference compared with mammalian cells. The crystal structure of HSV-1 TK has provided important information on the mechanism of substrate recognition and catalysis (19Brown D.G. Visse R. Sandhu G. Davies A. Rizkallah P.J. Melitz C. Summers W.C. Sanderson M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Champness J.N. Bennett M.S. Wien F. Visse R. Summers W.C. Herdewijn P. De Clercq E.

McLeish P.J. Buchan A. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, there are at the present time no solved crystallographic structure available for any mammalian nucleoside kinase, and thus, the structural basis for their diverse substrate specificities is not known. A comparison of the primary structure alignment and the HSV-1 TK structure shows features that distinguish Dm-dNK from other members of the deoxyribonucleoside kinase family. The HSV-1 TK amino acid residues Ile-100 and Tyr-101 have important roles in substrate recognition by this viral enzyme. However, this region is lacking in both Dm-dNK and TK2, and it is poorly conserved in dCK and dGK. This suggests that the binding of the base may be different compared with the cellular kinases. Another difference is found at HSV-1 TK Tyr-172, which stacks against the thymine base and also contributes to binding of several anti-herpetic nucleoside analogs. In HSV-1 TK, this residue can only be functionally replaced with phenylalanine (23Munir K.M. French D.C. Dube D.K. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6584-6589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In dCK, dGK, and TK2, the corresponding residue is either a tyrosine or a phenylalanine, whereas the corresponding residue in Dm-dNK is an arginine. Studies on the importance of these residues for the substrate specificity of Dm-dNK are currently initiated. However, the crystal structure of Dm-dNK and the mammalian enzymes will be necessary to elucidate mechanisms of substrate recognition and to clarify the basis for the unique broad substrate specificity of Dm-dNK. The role of suicide gene therapy using nucleoside kinases in clinical practice remains to be established. There are a few studies that show promising results, although several technical problems have to be solved. One possibility to enhance the efficiency of nucleoside kinase gene therapy is to use nucleoside kinases with enhanced kinetic properties that generate larger amounts of phosphorylated nucleoside analogs to kill the transfected cells or to induce cell death of neighboring cells via the so-called bystander effect. HSV-1 TK mutants have been engineered using random mutagenesis, and enzymes with enhanced kinetic properties make tumor cells more sensitive to cytotoxic nucleoside analogs (14Black M.E. Newcomb T.G. Wilson H-M.P. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3525-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Recently, Christians et al. (24Christians F.C. Scapozza L. Crameri A. Folkers G. Stemmer W.P.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) used DNA family shuffling to create chimeras between HSV-1 and HSV-2 TK and subsequently selected mutant enzymes with enhanced ability to phosphorylate the anti-HIV nucleoside analog AZT. The broad substrate specificity and high catalytic rate of Dm-dNK makes this enzyme an interesting candidate for suicide gene therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2063423888,"The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) induces acute phase protein expression in HepG2 human hepatoma cells and promotes the growth of mouse B9 hybridoma. The signaling cascades leading to these biological functions are only partially known. We analysed the involvement of MAPK homologues in IL-6 transduction pathways and found that interleukin-6 triggered activation of p38 stress-activated protein kinase (p38) but not of jun kinase. p38 activity was required for biological functions including acute phase protein secretion from HepG2 hepatoma and proliferation of B9 hybridoma cells. Using a reporter gene construct containing a 190 bp promoter fragment of the acute phase protein haptoglobin we found that p38 is involved in transcriptional activation of the haptoglobin promoter by STAT3 but not by NF-IL6. Thus, we present evidence for a role of p38 in IL-6 induced functions and a possible cross-talk between this MAPK homologue and the STAT pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1567081863,"We used the Xenopus oocyte expression system to examine the regulation of rat κ opioid receptor (rKOR) function by G protein receptor kinases (GRKs). κ agonists increased the conductance of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channels in oocytes co-expressing KOR with Kir3.1 and Kir3.4. In the absence of added GRK and β-arrestin 2, desensitization of the κ agonist-induced potassium current was modest. Co-expression of either GRK3 or GRK5 along with β-arrestin 2 significantly increased the rate of desensitization, whereas addition of either β-arrestin 2, GRK3, or GRK5 alone had no effect on the KOR desensitization rate. The desensitization was homologous as co-expressed δ opioid receptor-evoked responses were not affected by KOR desensitization. The rate of GRK3/β-arrestin 2-dependent desensitization was reduced by truncation of the C-terminal 26 amino acids, KOR(Q355Δ). In contrast, substitution of Ala for Ser within the third intracellular loop [KOR(S255A,S260A,S262A)] did not reduce the desensitization rate. Within the C-terminal region, KOR(S369A) substitution significantly attenuated desensitization, whereas the KOR(T363A) and KOR(S356A,T357A) point mutations did not. These results suggest that co-expression of GRK3 or GRK5 and β-arrestin 2 produced homologous, agonist-induced desensitization of the κ opioid receptor by a mechanism requiring the phosphorylation of the serine 369 of rKOR.

The molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance are complex and multifaceted (for review see Ref. 1Nestler E.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because opioid receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor super-family (for review see Ref. 2Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), one component of opioid tolerance is likely to be mediated by a phosphorylation-dependent, receptor desensitization. Following agonist activation, other members of this receptor family are phosphorylated, then inactivated (for review see Ref. 3Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Aber M.J. Giros B. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Receptors Channels. 1997; 5: 193-199PubMed Google Scholar). Results of prior studies have suggested that the κ opioid receptor (KOR)1undergoes a phosphorylation-dependent desensitization as well. Prolonged activation of KOR expressed in normal guinea pig brain slices resulted in receptor phosphorylation, and this increase in KOR phosphorylation correlated with the desensitization of the cellular response to κ agonists in the tissue (4Appleyard S.M. Patterson T.A. Jin W. Chavkin C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2405-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The kinase responsible for regulation of KOR in vivo remains to be elucidated. Based on our understanding of other G protein-coupled receptors (for review see Ref. 5Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar), one potential candidate is the family of G protein receptor kinases (for review see Ref. 6Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, agonist-induced desensitization of the κ opioid-evoked response was blocked by the expression of a dominant negative G protein-coupled receptor kinase in transfected cells (7Raynor K. Kong H. Hines J. Kong G. Benovic J. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 1381-1386PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, over-expression of β-arrestin 1 attenuated the κ opioid receptor-mediated response (8Cheng Z.J., Yu, Q.M. Wu Y.L. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24328-24333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the effects of specific G protein receptor kinases, the contribution of β-arrestins, and the regions of KOR required for agonist-induced desensitization remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used the Xenopus oocyte expression system to further characterize the potential mechanisms underlying agonist-induced desensitization of KOR. A better definition of the desensitization process is critical for a clearer understanding of the mechanisms underlying opioid tolerance. U69,593, U50,488H and naloxone were obtained from Research Biochemicals International. DPDPE was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The following mutations of the rat KOR cDNA in pGEM were made using an adaptation of the Quick Change protocol from Stratagene. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were as follows: GATGCGAATGGAGCGCTAGAGCTCAAACAGAGTTAGAAACACAG (Q355Δ), CGCTTGAAGGCTGTCCGGCTCCTCGCGGGAGCTCGAGAGAAGGAC (S255A, S260A, S262A), GCACAAACAGAGTTAGAAACGCGGTACAAGATCCTGCTTCCATG (T363A), and GAACACAGTTCAAGATCCTGCTGCTATGAGGGATGTGGGTGGG (S369A). Mutant KOR (S356A/T357A) was made using the polymerase chain reaction overlap extension method (9Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) with the oligonucleotide GGAGCGCCAGGCCGCAAACAGAGT. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The rat KOR clone was in pGEM 3 such that the SP6 promoter directed sense transcripts. cDNA for the Kir3.1, Kir3.4, DOR, β-arrestin 2, and GRK3 were as described (10Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Plasmid templates for all constructs including KOR mutants were linearized before cRNA synthesis, and mMESSAGE MACHINE kits (Ambion Corp.) were used to generate capped cRNA. Defolliculated, stage IV oocytes were prepared as described (12Leonard J.P. Snutch T.P. Chad J. Wheal H. Molecular Neurobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 161-182Google Scholar) and were incubated for 3–6 days after injection of the cRNA in normal oocyte saline buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) solution supplemented with sodium pyruvate (2.5 mm) and gentamicin (50 μg/ml). cRNA were injected (50 nl/oocyte) with a Drummond microinjector. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at −80 mV with two electrodes filled with 3 m KCl having resistances of 0.5–2.0 ohms, using a Geneclamp 500 amplifier and pCLAMP 6 software (Axon Instruments). Membrane current traces were recorded using a chart recorder. Data was also digitally recorded (Digidata, Axon Instruments, and Intel 386 PC) and filtered. To facilitate the recording of inward K+ currents through the Kir3 channels, the normal oocyte saline buffer was modified to increase KCl concentration to 16 mm K+. The concentration of NaCl was correspondingly decreased to maintain osmolarity . EC50 values and curve fits were determined using Nfit (Island Products, Galestone, TX). Confidence intervals were used for comparison of the independent means. Statistical significance was determined using the Student's t-test value for either 95 or 99% confidence levels. κ opioid receptors have been shown to couple to inwardly rectifying potassium channels in Xenopus oocytes co-injected with Kir3.1 (GIRK1) and the κ opioid receptor (13Henry D.J. Grandy D.K. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ma G.H. Miller R.J. Kuznetsov A Philipson L.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1035-1040PubMed Google Scholar). As reported previously (11Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), co-expression of Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 and a reduction in the level of cRNA expression effectively minimized the heterologous desensitization of DOR- and MOR-evoked responses. The κ selective agonist U69,593 (2 μm) also activates an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance in Xenopus oocytes co-expressing the cRNA for the KOR, Kir3.1, and Kir3.4 (Fig.1). The current was maximally activated by 2 μm U69,593, and this dose was used in subsequent experiments (EC50 = 240 nm). For oocytes expressing KOR and Kir3 channel, the U69,593-induced response desensitized by about 20% during a 10 min agonist application (Fig. 1, A–C). Additional co-injection of cRNAs for GRK3 and β-arrestin 2 caused a significant increase in the agonist-induced desensitization measured over 10 min (65%, Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, expression of either the cRNA for GRK3 or β-arrestin 2 alone did not increase the agonist-induced desensitization (Fig. 1, B and C). The finding that both GRK3 and β-arrestin 2 were required suggests that the desensitization observed was caused by receptor phosphorylation followed by arrestin binding rather than alternative kinase-independent mechanisms including Gβγ sequestration by GRK3 (15Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The agonist-dependent desensitization of the KOR mediated by GRK3 and β-arr2 was found to be homologous (Fig.2). The response to 1 μmDPDPE, a δ selective opioid agonist, was measured before and after a 10-min treatment with U69,593 in both control oocytes and oocytes co-expressing GRK3 and β-arr2. The difference between the amplitudes of the first and second response to DPDPE was not significantly different between the two groups (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the amplitude of the U69,593 response after 10 min of exposure was significantly decreased in oocytes co-expressing GRK3 and β-arr2 (Fig. 2). The lack of change in the second DPDPE response after U69,593 in oocytes co-expressing GRK3 and β-arr2 indicates that the desensitization of the KOR-mediated response was homologous. The decrease in DPDPE response following κ agonist treatment was about 20–30% in both the presence and absence of GRK3 and β-arr2. This is the same decrease as seen in the U69,593 response in the absence of GRK3 and β-arr2 (Figs. 1 and 2) suggesting that this GRK3 and β-arr2-independent change was heterologous. Homologous desensitization is thought to occur by a change at the receptor (e.g. phosphorylation), whereas heterologous desensitization occurs at common downstream signaling steps (16Sibley D.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Studies with other G protein-coupled receptors have shown that specific serine and threonine residues in either the third intracellular loop or the C-terminal tail are required for regulation by GRKs (for review see Refs. 5Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar and 6Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the third intracellular loop and C-terminal tail of the rat κ, rat μ, and mouse δ opioid receptors. Potential phosphorylation sites for all three receptors are shown in bold. Previous studies with the μ and δ receptor showed that the serine and threonine residues in the C-terminal tail were important for GRK-mediated desensitization (11Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L.

Commun. 1997; 238: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We therefore made a mutation of KOR, which resulted in truncation of the C-terminal tail region containing the serine and threonine residues KOR(Q355Δ). In addition, we made point mutations of potential phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal tail. All the mutants expressed and coupled to the potassium channel with similar dose response curves for U69,593 (Figs.4 A and5 A). The EC50values for both the wild type and mutant receptors are as follows (in nm with 95% confidence intervals): wtKOR, 240 (190–291); KOR(Q355Δ), 173 (140–206); KOR(S255A,S260A,S262A), 110 (31–189); KOR(S356A,T357A), 208 (95–320); KOR(T363A), 165 (6–171); KOR(S369A), 131 (84–178). The EC50 values were not substantially different, suggesting that the mutations did not dramatically alter the coupling of KOR to the channel or agonist potency.Figure 4The C-terminal tail of the κ opioid receptor is required for GRK3/β-arr2-mediated agonist-induced desensitization.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4740-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, these results show that the desensitization rate of a κ opioid receptor mutant KOR(S255A,S260A,S262A) in which all the serines in the third intracellular loop were changed to alanines was not different from wtKOR (Fig. 4 B). To determine which serine or threonine residues in the C-terminal tail of the κ receptor were important for the regulation by GRKs, we made point mutations of the serines and threonines in the C-terminal tail. Substitution of alanine for the most C-terminal serine residue, KOR(S369A), attenuated the GRK3- and β-arrestin 2-mediated desensitization of the κ receptor equivalent to truncation of the C-terminal tail (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, the KOR(T363A) and KOR(S356A,T357A) mutations did not prevent the agonist-induced desensitization (Fig. 5 C). These results suggest that phosphorylation of serine 369 was required for agonist-induced desensitization of KOR mediated by GRK3 and β-arrestin 2. To determine whether the κ opioid receptor desensitization could be mediated by a different GRK, we examined the effect of GRK5 and β-arrestin 2 on agonist-induced desensitization. Co-expression of GRK5 and β-arrestin 2 also increased agonist-induced desensitization of KOR evoked responses, whereas GRK5 expression without β-arrestin 2 had no effect on the desensitization rate (Fig. 6). The desensitization mediated by GRK5 and β-arrestin 2 was also significantly attenuated in the mutant KOR(Q355Δ). The results suggest that phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of KOR is a common mechanism of GRK-mediated desensitization. The principal findings of this study are 4-fold. First, we found that agonist-induced desensitization of the κ opioid receptor can be facilitated by co-expression of GRKs and β-arrestin 2 in the Xenopus oocyte. Second, that this desensitization is homologous. Third, that the C-terminal tail of rKOR, and in particular serine 369 was required for the agonist-induced desensitization observed. Last, that either GRK3 or GRK5 can produce agonist desensitization when co-expressed with β-arrestin 2. These results from oocyte expression studies demonstrate a potential mode of receptor regulation likely to be important in the intact nervous system. G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to activate Kir3 channels through the release of Gβγ dimers (20Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). As has been discussed previously by Kovoor et al. (11Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), heterologous expression of GRK3 alone in the Xenopus oocyte may inhibit the ability of the opioid receptors to couple to Kir3 as both GRK2 and GRK3 have also been shown to bind Gβγ, and a fusion protein of a portion of GRK2 inhibited basal Kir3 activity (21Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 14: 143-146Crossref Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Indeed as can be seen in Fig. 1, co-expression of GRK3 appeared to decrease the peak response produced by κ agonists. However, expression of GRK3 alone did not produce any increase in the agonist-induced desensitization rate. The agonist-induced desensitization required co-expression of β-arrestin 2 suggesting the action of GRK3 was due to catalytic phosphorylation of the opioid receptor and not Gβγ sequestration. The fact that the GRK3 and β-arrestin 2-mediated desensitization was attenuated by a specific point mutation of serine 369 in the C-terminal tail of KOR further supports the conclusion that receptor phosphorylation was required. Last, co-expression of GRK5 and β-arrestin 2 also caused agonist-induced desensitization of KOR. As GRK5 does not bind to and is not recruited to the membrane by Gβγ; this again argues that the desensitization mediated by GRKs is not through Gβγ sequestration. The mutagenesis approach provides indirect evidence that the receptor is phosphorylated at a critical serine residue. A direct test of this hypothesis requires a demonstration of phosphate incorporation at serine 369 following agonist stimulation. Although we tried that experiment, we were unable to get sufficient 32P incorporation into KOR expressed in oocytes to resolve the phosphopeptide fragments derived from immunoprecipitated receptor. Phosphospecific antibodies presently being developed in this laboratory may ultimately be useful in the detection of phosphoserine 369. Nevertheless, the hypothesis is supported by the present demonstration that the agonist- dependent desensitization required GRK and β-arrestin co-expression. The finding that residues in the C-terminal tail are important for regulation of KOR by GRKs parallels the findings that the C-terminal tail of both the DOR and MOR receptors are important for their regulation by GRKs (11Kovoor A.

These results suggest that opioid receptors differ from other Gi/Go-coupled receptors such as the m2 muscarinic and α2adrenergic receptors whose regulation by GRKs requires phosphorylation sites in the third intracellular loop (19Liggett S.B.

Biochem. 1994; 220: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The finding that serine 369 in KOR is essential for regulation by GRKs parallels the finding that threonine 394 appears to be the primary residue required for regulation of the μ opioid receptor (17Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24961-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Burd A.L. El-Kouhen R. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. Law P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34488-34495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both serine 369 and threonine 394 are the most C-terminal Ser/Thr residues in the κ and μ opioid receptors, respectively. Recently threonine 394 was found to be important for determining the rate of internalization and resensitization of the μ opioid receptor, whether this is also true for KOR serine 369 remains to be determined (25Wolf R. Koch T. Schulz S. Klutzny M. Schroder H. Raulf E. Buhling F. Hollt V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similarly, the finding that the C-terminal threonine 353 is critical for δ opioid receptor internalization and desensitization (26Cvejic S. Trapaidze N. Cyr C. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4073-4076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Trapaidze N. Keith D.E. Cvejic S. Evans C.J. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29279-29285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) closely parallels the findings with KOR and MOR. The data shown here suggests that GRK3 and GRK5 along with β-arrestin 2 are capable of regulating agonist-induced desensitization of the κ opioid receptor. This is the first demonstration of GRK3 and GRK5 regulating the rat KOR. Both the MOR and DOR have also been shown to be regulated by both GRK3 and GRK5 (11Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Zhao J. Pei G. Huang Y.L. Zhong F.M. Ma L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results suggest that opioid receptors are again regulated differently than the α2 adrenergic receptor, which was shown to be phosphorylated and desensitized in an agonist-dependent manner by GRK3 but not by GRK5 (28Jewell-Motz E.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18082-18087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This provides further evidence that these kinases may differentially regulate G protein-coupled receptors. As was demonstrated by Rockman et al. (29Rockman H.A. Choi D.J. Rahman N.U. Akhter S.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9954-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), this specificity may also occur in vivo. It remains to be determined whether GRK3 and GRK5 are involved in the agonist-induced phosphorylation of opioid receptors seen in vivo. Localization studies show that GRK3 is expressed in many of the same regions of the brain as the κ opioid receptor supporting a role for this kinase in the in vivo regulation of KOR (30Arriza J.L.

Chavkin C. Milner T. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 370: 377-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis remains to be directly tested. Characterization of the mechanism of desensitization in vitro and the determination of the critical residue for agonist desensitization of the κ receptor in vitro provides us with the knowledge needed to test whether this mechanism occurs in vivo. Interestingly the removal of all the serine and threonine residues in the C-terminal tail of the KOR does not completely block the GRK/β-arrestin-mediated desensitization. The mechanism for this residual slow desensitization is not known. Potential mechanisms include phosphorylation of the remaining intracellular serine or threonine residues present in the putative cytoplasmic domains of the receptor or through the proposed adapter functions of β-arrestin that may bring in other proteins important for desensitization of the κ opioid receptor. In conclusion, the results show that GRKs and β-arrestin 2 are required for homologous agonist-induced desensitization of the κ opioid receptor expressed in the Xenopus oocyte and that the C-terminal tail of the rat κ receptor is required for this regulation. These results taken together with previously published findings support a role for GRKs and β-arrestin in the mechanism underlying the development of tolerance to opioids.

Metabolic labeling of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably overexpressing the hemagluttinin epitope-tagged IP in the presence of [3H]mevalonolactone established that the mouse IP is isoprenylated. Studies involving in vitro assays confirmed that recombinant forms of the human and mouse IP are modified by carbon 15 farnesyl isoprenoids.

Scatchard analysis of the wild type (IP) and mutant (IPSSLC) receptor confirmed that each receptor exhibited high and low affinity binding sites for [3H]iloprost, which were not influenced by receptor isoprenylation. Whereas stable cell lines overexpressing IP generated significant agonist (iloprost and cicaprost)-mediated increases in cAMP relative to nontransfected cells, cAMP generation by IPSSLC cells was not significantly different from the control, nontransfected HEK 293 cells. Moreover, co-expression of the alpha (α) subunit of Gs generated significant augmentations in cAMP by IP but not by IPSSLCcells. Whereas IP also demonstrated significant, dose-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i in response to iloprost or cicaprost compared with the nontransfected HEK 293 cells, mobilization of [Ca2+]i by IPSSLC was significantly impaired.

In addition, inhibition of isoprenylation by lovastatin treatment significantly reduced agonist-mediated cAMP generation by IP in comparison to the nonisoprenylated β2 adrenergic receptor or nontreated cells. Hence, isoprenylation of IP does not influence ligand binding but is required for efficient coupling to the effectors adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C.

The actions of prostacyclin generally counteract those of thromboxane A2, and thus the relative level of these two prostanoids in the circulation are important in the local control of vascular tone and platelet aggregation (2Negishi M.

The main physiologic roles of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin are their contribution to the maintenance of vascular hemostasis: thromboxane A2, synthesized primarily by platelets, induces platelet shape change and aggregation and constriction of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, whereas prostacyclin, mainly synthesized by the vascular endothelium, is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and induces vasodilation (4Hamberg M.

The actions of prostacyclin are mediated via interaction with a specific cell surface receptor, termed the prostacyclin receptor or IP (17Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol.

However, recent evidence indicates that IP agonists may couple to multiple signaling pathways including activation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, via Gs and Gi, respectively, stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism, and changes in [Ca2+]i concentrations (20Schwaner I.

Members of the GPCR superfamily share many structural domains that contribute to or act as determinants of receptor function (29Watson, S., and Arkinstall, S.

The transmembrane domains and/or the extracellular loops provide the sites for specific ligand binding within different receptor families, whereas the intracellular regions, particularly the 3i loop, provide structural determinants for specificity of receptor-G protein interaction. The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail (C-tail) may also contribute to receptor-G protein coupling specificity and contains many of the sequence determinants important for agonist-induced receptor desensitization (29Watson, S., and Arkinstall, S. (eds) (1994) The G protein Linked Receptor Factsbook, Academic Press, LondonGoogle Scholar, 33Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Post-translational modification of GPCRs can also play a primary role in regulating receptor function; receptor phosphorylation on serines and threonines, located predominantly in the C-tail, by specific protein kinases plays a key role in mediating receptor desensitization following agonist stimulation (32Lefkowitz R.J.

In eucaryotic cells, the process of isoprenylation results in the post-translational lipid modification of proteins by either C-15 farnesyl or C-20 geranylgeranyl isoprenoids (37Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). These isoprenoids, derived from the mevalonate/cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, are attached via stable thioether linkages to specific carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues located in distinct “isoprenylation motifs” of proteins. Farnesyl transferase (FTase) attaches farnesyl to proteins that end with the tetrapeptide consensus sequence CAA X, in which C represents cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid except leucine or isoleucine (38Reiss Y.

There are two geranylgeranyl transferases: geranylgeranyl protein transferase I, which transfers geranylgeranyl to proteins containing a CAA X sequence in which X is leucine or isoleucine, and geranylgeranyl protein transferase II, which transfers geranylgeranyl to proteins terminating in -CC or -C X C (40Seabra M.C.

Among those proteins that are isoprenylated are the nuclear lamins A and B, the γ subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins, many members of the Ha-Ras-related low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins, rhodopsin kinase, yeast mating factor a (37Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar), and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase (42De Smedt F. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Vanweyenberg V.

Recently, a novel Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2, cPLA2-γ, which shows homology to Ca2+-dependent cytoplasmic cPLA2has been demonstrated to be isoprenylated (43Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W.

Most isoprenylated proteins are found associated with distinct and specialized intracellular membranes, which in many cases appears to be either directly or partially mediated by the presence of the isoprenoid moiety, which becomes inserted into the lipid bilayer of the targeted intracellular membrane. It has also been proposed that the isoprenoid group may also facilitate specific protein-protein interactions in vivo (37Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar); such interactions may be important in regulating protein subcellular localization and protein function. In the case of Ha-Ras, inhibition of isoprenylation, by use of selective inhibitors of isoprenylation (e.g. in the presence of Statin inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase or FTase inhibitors) or by site-directed mutagenesis of the CAA X motif, not only blocks p21ras membrane association but also completely prevents cell transformation (44Kinsella B.T.

Analysis of the C-tail of the cloned IPs reveals the presence of an identically conserved putative isoprenylation motif with the sequence CSLC. In this study, we investigate whether the IP receptor is isoprenylated and explore the functional significance of this modification. We report that the IP is isoprenylated in mammalian cells; studies involving in vitro assays confirm the nature of the modification to be C-15 farnesyl. This represents the first report of a G protein-coupled receptor to be isoprenylated. Disruption of the isoprenylation motif by site-directed mutagenesis (C414SLC to S414SLC) yielded an IP receptor that displayed ligand binding properties identical to those of the wild type receptor but failed to couple to adenylyl cyclase and exhibited diminished ability to couple to phospholipase C. In view of the central role of prostacyclin in vascular hemostasis and the central yet pleiotropic role of cholesterol and other metabolites of HMG-CoA reductase in metabolism, the finding that the IP is isoprenylated and that this modification is required for its function may have important clinical implications relating to the use of the Statins or other agents that interfere with isoprenylation on IP signaling.

The full-length cDNA encoding the mutant mIPCSLC-SSLC, herein designated mIPSSLC, was subcloned into the Hin dIII site of pcDNA3 to generate the plasmid pcDNA3:mIPSSLC. To facilitate amino-terminal epitope-tagging, the full-length cDNAs encoding mIP and mIPSSLC were subcloned in-frame into the Hin dIII site of the vector pHM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to generate the plasmids pHM6:mIP and pHM6:mIPSSLC, respectively; resulting proteins expressed in mammalian cells contain the 9-amino acid HA tag (48Field J.

The cDNA coding for the C-tail of the mIP (amino acids 326–417) was subcloned in-frame into the Bam HI-Hin dIII sites of the vector pMAL-C (New England Biolabs) to generate the plasmid pMAL-C:mIPT. Site-directed mutagenesis of Cys414-Ser414 of mIP was carried out as described previously using pBluescript SK(−):mIP as template; the cDNA coding for the mutated C-tail (amino acids 322–417) was subcloned into the Bam HI-Hin dIII sites of pMAL-C to generate the plasmid pMAL-C:mIPTSSLC. The sequences of all the plasmids were verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing using Sequenase version 2.0 (USB Corp.). Human erythroleukemia 92.1.3 (HEL) cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection, were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. HEL cells were routinely cultured in RPMI, 10% FBS. HEK 293 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts and 10% FBS. To generate a stable mammalian cell line overexpressing the β2 adrenergic receptor (AR), an Eco RI subfragment encoding the full-length cDNA for the human β2 AR was subcloned from the plasmid pTF3 (American Type Culture Collection) into the Eco RI site of pcDNA3.1(−). The resulting plasmid pcDNA3.1:β2AR was then transfected into HEK 293 cells to generate stable cell lines. Transfection of HEK 293 cells using the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation procedure and construction of stable cell lines overexpressing β2 AR, mIP, HA:mIP, and HA:mIPSSLC were carried out as described previously (49Kinsella B.T.

Aliquots (3.5 μl) of each first strand cDNA were then used as templates in subsequent PCR reactions (25 μl) using primers designed to specifically amplify the mIPSSLCcDNA sequence but not the mIP sequence: Primer A, 5′-TCAGAAGCTTATGAAGATGATGGCCAGC-3′ (sense primer), and Primer B, 5′-CTCAAGCTTTCAGCAGAGGGAGG-3′ (specific antisense primer). Amplification of cDNA from the constitutively expressed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was used as an internal control for each experiment. PCR reactions were carried out under standard amplification conditions, and products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The cDNA coding for the C-tail of the hIP (nucleotides 890–1158 encoding amino acids 297–386) was isolated from total RNA from human thymus (CLONTECH) using RT-PCR from random hexamer primed first strand cDNA and the PCR primers: 5′-dGAGGGGAT CC ATCGAGGGTAGGAAGGCTGTCTTCCAGCG-3′ (sense primer, Bam HI site underlined) and 5′-dGTGGGGATCCAAGCTTTCAGCAGAGGGAGCAGGC-3′ (antisense primer, Hin dIII site underlined).

The corresponding maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions, MBP:Ha-Ras, MBP:Rac2, and MBP nonfusion proteins, were expressed in E. coli TB1. Because the MBP fusion proteins based on IP were vulnerable to proteolytic degradation, the MBP:hIPT, MBP:mIPT, and MBP:mIPTSSLC were expressed in the protease-deficient strain E. coli BL21(DE3). Induction of recombinant protein expression was carried out essentially as described previously (52Kinsella B.T. Maltese W.A. J. Biol.

In vitro isoprenylation assays were carried out using the MBP fusion proteins as substrates and the cytosolic fraction of HEL cell protein as source of prenyl transferases. HEL cells were grown in RPMI, 10% FBS to a density of 4 × 105 cells/ml and then incubated in fresh medium containing 20 μm lovastatin for 16 h at 37 °C to deplete the endogenous pool of mevalonate and its metabolites.

Cells were homogenized and centrifuged (100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C). The resulting soluble fraction (S100) was used as the source of prenyl transferase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2058241971,"The utilization of blood glycerol and glucose as precursors for intramuscular triglyceride synthesis was examined in rats using an intravenous infusion of [2-14C]glycerol and [6-3H]glucose or [6-14C]glucose. In 24-h fasted rats, more glycerol than glucose was incorporated into intramuscular triglyceride glycerol in soleus (69 ± 23 versus 4 ± 1 nmol/μmol triglyceride/h, respectively, p = 0.02 glycerol versus glucose) and in gastrocnemius (25 ± 5 versus 9 ± 2 nmol/μmol triglyceride/h, respectively, p = 0.02). Blood glucose was utilized more than blood glycerol for triglyceride glycerol synthesis in quadriceps. In fed rats, the blood glycerol incorporation rates (4 ± 2, 8 ± 3, and 9 ± 3 nmol/μmol triglyceride/h) were similar (p > 0.3) to those of glucose (5 ± 2, 8 ± 2, and 5 ± 2 nmol/μmol triglyceride/h for quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscle, respectively). Glucose incorporation into intramuscular triglycerides was less with [6-3H]glucose than with [6-14C]glucose, suggesting an indirect pathway for glucose carbon entry into muscle triglyceride. The isotopic equilibrium between plasma and intramuscular free glycerol ([U-13C]glycerol) was complete in quadriceps and gastrocnemius, but not soleus, within 2 h after beginning the tracer infusion.

Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1981: 457-479Google Scholar). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP),1originating from glucose, is reduced to glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) by the action of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. G3P then undergoes sequential acylation steps to incorporate three fatty acids to form a triacylglycerol (TG) (2Mayes P.A. Harper's Biochemistry: A Lange Medical Book. Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT1988: 218-225Google Scholar). DHAP can also take a different path (DHAP pathway) via 1-acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate and then 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphate, but this appears to be a quantitatively minor reaction (3Rognstad R. Clark D.G. Katz J. Biochem. J. 1974; 140: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,4Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 380: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Glycerol can be converted directly to G3P by glycerol kinase, but this is believed to occur primarily, if not solely, in the liver and kidney because the glycerol kinase activity in these tissues is sufficient to permit large quantities of blood glycerol to be used for gluconeogenesis and TG synthesis. The direct conversion of free glycerol to G3P is thought to be negligible in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue because of their low activities of glycerol kinase (5Newsholme E.A. Taylor K. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Seltzer W.K. Angelini C. Khariwal G. Ringel S. McCabe E.R.B.

Lipids. 1977; 12: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A corollary to this supposition is that glycerol generated by the hydrolysis of TG in skeletal muscle quantitatively enters the circulation. These assumptions form the basis for using systemic glycerol appearance rate, measured by isotope dilution techniques, as a quantitative measure of whole body lipolysis (9Kurpad A. Khan K.

Muscle Nerve. 1989; 12: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), raises concerns as to the validity of these assumptions, however. For example, although low in specific activity, skeletal muscle glycerol kinase could be important in the metabolism of circulating glycerol considering the mass of this tissue. Reports of tracer-determined glycerol uptake across human forearm (11Elia M. Khan K. Calder G. Kurpad A. Clin. Sci. 1993; 84: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Samra J.S. Ravell C.L. Giles S.L. Arner P. Frayn K.N. Clin. Sci. 1996; 90: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggest skeletal muscle may utilize glycerol, although it has been argued that this represents isotope disequilibrium rather than true uptake. Whether the glycerol kinase activity that is observed in mammalian skeletal muscle is functionally important has not been addressed, nor has the downstream intracellular fate of the G3P generated from blood glycerol.These studies were designed to test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle utilizes blood glycerol for intracellular TG glycerol synthesis. We also measured the rate of glycerol incorporation into TG by muscle groups of different fiber types and compared glycerol to blood glucose as a substrate for TG glycerol biosynthesis.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and ExperimentsExperiment 1Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight 350 g) were fed ad libitum (n = 5) or fasted for 24 h (n = 5) before the studies. The rats were conditioned in a rat restraint cage with wire floor for 30 min prior to study. [2-14C]Glycerol and [6-3H]glucose (DuPont) were infused for 3 h via a tail vein at ∼0.04 μCi/min (the exact infusion rate in each animal was determined) using a Terumo infusion set with a 25-gauge × 3/4-inch needle (Terumo Medical Corp., Elkton, MD). After 3 h of the tracer infusions, pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) was injected through the infusion line to lightly anesthetize the animal. Arterial blood samples were collected by cardiopuncture, and the plasma was separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min. Immediately after the blood was taken, more pentobarbital was injected (200 mg/kg) to euthanize the rats. Quadriceps, lateral gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles were quickly removed and washed of blood elements in 0.9% saline. The muscle samples were placed in 2-ml polyethylene microcentrifuge tubes, immediately merged in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C for later analysis.Experiment 2To assess the suitability of [6-3H]glucose as a tracer for glycerogenesis, separate experiments were performed in which [6-14C]- and [6-3H]glucose were infused simultaneously without [2-14C]glycerol in three fasted rats and [6-14C]glucose was infused alone in three fed rats. Muscle and blood samples were collected and processed as described for Experiment 1.Experiment 3To evaluate whether glycerol equilibrates between plasma and intramuscular compartments, [U-13C]glycerol was infused intravenously at 0.2 μmol/min for 3 h in five fasted rats using the same protocol, except a base-line blood sample (to measure background enrichment) was collected through a tail vein before beginning the infusion. Additional experiments were conducted to determine the time course of isotopic equilibration between plasma glycerol and intramuscular free glycerol pools. Three rats were infused with [U-13C]glycerol for 1 h and another three rats for 2 h. The 13C enrichment of plasma and muscle free glycerol were measured on samples collected at the end of the tracer infusion.Determination of Plasma Glycerol and Glucose specific Activities (SA)Plasma was deproteinized with 0.3 m BaOH and 0.3m ZnSO4 (1:1:1, v/v/v) and the supernatant loaded on ion-exchange column (AG 1X8, hydroxide form, 200–400-mesh) (Bio-Rad). Glycerol was eluted with 4 ml of deionized water and then glucose with 4 ml of 1 n NaCl. The [14C]glycerol SA was measured by HPLC (13Judd R.L. Nelson R. Klein S. Jensen M.D. Miles J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1106-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by an enzymatic method (14Humphreys S.M. Fisher R.M. Frayn K.N. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1990; 27: 597-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Plasma glycerol concentration was determined using the same enzymatic method. Plasma glucose concentration was determined using a glucose analyzer (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA), and glucose SA was determined by counting the glucose samples on a liquid scintillation counter.Determination of Glycerol and Glucose Incorporation into Muscle TriacylglycerolFrozen muscle samples were pulverized into fine powder (∼50 μm) at −80 °C using a stainless steel mortar and pestle. Muscle lipids were extracted (15Folch J. Lees M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and triglycerides were purified by HPLC (16Christie W.W. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 507-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The triglycerides were saponified using 1 n KOH in 90% methanol at 70 °C for 60 min and acidified with 5 nH2SO4, and fatty acids were extracted with hexane. The aqueous phase containing glycerol was air blow-dried at 40 °C, and 14C and 3H activities determined by liquid scintillation counter. Glycerol concentration was determined enzymatically (14Humphreys S.M. Fisher R.M. Frayn K.N. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1990; 27: 597-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Evaluation of Glycerol Equilibration between Plasma and Muscle CompartmentsPlasma samples from the [U-13C]glycerol infusion experiments were processed chromatographically as described above. Muscle free glycerol was obtained from aqueous phase of a Folch lipid extract. The aqueous phase was air blow-dried and dissolved in water, loaded on ion-exchange column, and glycerol eluted with water. Purified plasma and muscle free glycerol was derivatized to triacetyl glycerol in 200 μl of pyridine and acetyl anhydride (1:1, v/v) at 70 °C for 60 min. The glycerol derivative was analyzed by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry for13C enrichment. The gas chromatograph (GC; Hewlett Packard, model 5890) was equipped with a DB-5 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm inner diameter, 0.25 μm film) (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The GC oven temperature was programmed initially at 80 °C for 0.5 min, and increased to 200 °C at 20 °C/min and then to 300 °C at 35 °C/min and stayed at 300 °C for 3 min. The GC was electronically controlled for constant pressure and humidity. Details of isotope ratio mass spectrometry operation were as described previously (17Guo ZK Jensen M.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 13C enrichment was expressed as atom % excess. The ratio of 13C enrichment of muscle free glycerol to that of plasma glycerol was calculated and used as an index of glycerol equilibration between these two compartments (a ratio of 1 indicates complete equilibration).Calculation of Glycerol and Glucose Appearance RateThe infusion rate (dpm/min) of [2-14C]glycerol and [6-3H]glucose was divided by SA (dpm/μmol) of plasma glycerol and glucose, respectively, to give the appearance rates (μmol/min).Calculation of Blood Glycerol and Glucose Incorporation Rates into Muscle TGIncorporation rates were calculated by dividing the SA of plasma glycerol or glucose (dpm/μmol) by the total radioactivity (dpm) of the intramuscular TG glycerol moiety. In experiment 1, appreciable amounts of [14C]glycerol were converted to [14C]glucose (Table I) via gluconeogenesis, implying that the 14C present in muscle TG glycerol could originate both from glucose and glycerol. We initially planned to use [6-3H]glucose to trace glucose incorporation into TG glycerol; however, this approach was found to be unsatisfactory (see below). The indirect glycerol incorporation into muscle TG glycerol via glucose was therefore calculated by multiplying the plasma glucose14C SA in experiment 1 (Table I) by the glucose incorporation rate determined using [6-14C]glucose (experiment 2; conducted under identical conditions). The results were then subtracted from the apparent glycerol incorporation rates to determine those directly attributable to glycerol. The incorporation rates of blood glycerol are given as those after the correction for indirect contribution via glucose. Glucose incorporation rate is given as that determined using [6-14C]glucose as well as using [6-3H]glucose. Each glucose molecule can potentially contribute 2 molecules of TG glycerol; therefore, to compare glycerol and glucose on a carbon equivalent basis, it is necessary to double the apparent glucose values. Because blood was sampled only at the end of tracer infusion, it was necessary to assume that the SA of plasma glycerol and glucose were at steady state for the duration of infusion. This seems a reasonable assumption, considering the very brief half-life of circulating glycerol (18Beylot M. Martin C. Beaufrere B. Riou J.P. Mornex R. J. Lipid. Res. 1987; 28: 414-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, it is unlikely that the [14C]glucose SA in experiment 1 was at steady state because of the gradual incorporation of [14C]glycerol into [14C]glucose. Therefore, the rates of indirect [14C]glycerol incorporation into intramuscular TG glycerol via glucose in experiment 1 (above) are likely to be overestimates. The incorporation rates are expressed on a per hour basis assuming the incorporation was linear during the 3-h tracer infusion.Table ITracer infusion rates, SA, and rate of appearance of plasma glycerol and glucoseFed (n = 5)Fasted (n = 5)Infusion rate (dpm/rat/min) [2-14C]Glycerol0.76 × 1050.78 × 105 [6-3H]Glucose0.97 × 1051.04 × 105Plasma concentrations (mmol/liter) Glycerol0.11 ± 0.010.16 ± 0.02 Glucose5.3 ± 0.24.8 ± 0.1Plasma SA (dpm × 103/μmol) Glycerol (14C)13.8 ± 3.310.2 ± 0.6 Glucose3H9.1 ± 0.69.4 ± 0.714C4.2 ± 0.37.1 ± 0.5Rate of appearance (μmol/min) Glycerol5.5 ± 1.17.8 ± 0.4 Glucose10.8 ± 1.811.3 ± 1.9The tracer infusions were continuous for 3 h via a tail vein in conscious state.

Analysis of variance was used to detect difference between three muscle groups, and paired, one-tailed Student's t test for comparison between two muscles, if appropriate, to test for differences in a specific direction based upon previous work (17Guo ZK Jensen M.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test was used for comparisons between glycerol and glucose parameters.DISCUSSIONThese studies examined whether blood glycerol is a direct precursor for intramuscular TG glycerol synthesis in a rat model. It has been long thought that triglycerides acquire their glycerol moiety primarily from glucose via DHAP (1Stryer L. Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1981: 457-479Google Scholar, 4Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 380: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although there have been debates over relative contributions of G3P pathway versus DHAP pathway to triglyceride and phospholipid synthesis (3Rognstad R. Clark D.G. Katz J. Biochem. J. 1974; 140: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 4Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 380: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the possibility that glycerol itself is a significant precursor of intramuscular TG glycerol synthesis does not appear to have been explored. Glycerol kinase directly activates glycerol to G3P for acylation, and it seemed reasonable to believe that tissues low in glycerol kinase activity, such as skeletal muscle, rely on glucose for the synthesis of TG glycerol. However, results from the present study suggest this is not the case. Even in fed rats, where glycerol is less available and glucose is more abundant, the glycerol incorporation rate into muscle triglyceride was comparable to that of glucose on a carbon-equivalent basis. In fasted rats, the rate of blood glycerol incorporation into muscle TG glycerol was much greater than that of glucose, especially in soleus, a primarily oxidative muscle. On the other hand, glucose was the predominant precursor for muscle TG glycerol synthesis in quadriceps, consistent with conventional belief as described above. Thus, in fasted rats, a pattern was observed that the preference of blood glycerol over blood glucose for TG glycerol synthesis in skeletal muscle is consistent with the muscles' oxidative capacity (soleus > gastrocnemius > quadriceps).The rat soleus muscle has greater intracellular TG content (17Guo ZK Jensen M.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and oxidative capacity (20Saltin B. Henriksson J. Nygaard E. Andersen P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1977; 301: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) than gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles. We found that soleus can also utilize greater amount of blood glycerol. In contrast, quadriceps, a fast twitch, glycolytic muscle (21Maltin C.A. Delday M.I. Baillie A.G. Grubb D.A. Garlick P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: E823-E827PubMed Google Scholar), has a triglyceride content one-fifth of that of soleus (17Guo ZK Jensen M.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Frayn K.N. Maycock P.F. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 139-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its utilization of blood glycerol for fatty acid esterification appears limited. Since quadriceps relies on glycolysis to a greater extent for ATP production, it seems logical for it to use more blood glucose than glycerol as a precursor for TG glycerol. The rat lateral gastrocnemius contains both glycolytic and oxidative muscle fibers (21Maltin C.A. Delday M.I. Baillie A.G. Grubb D.A. Garlick P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: E823-E827PubMed Google Scholar), and has an intermediate capacity to utilizing blood glycerol for fatty acid esterification. We conclude that utilization of blood glycerol for intramuscular TG glycerol synthesis is related to the ability of muscle to oxidize and store fatty acids. The preference of glycerol over glucose for muscle TG glycerol synthesis in type I fiber-rich muscle suggests that its glycerol kinase activity is higher than in other muscle types (5Newsholme E.A. Taylor K. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Another possible reason for the greater use of blood glycerol for TG synthesis by soleus muscle is a lesser activity of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of DHAP to G3P. This might explain the limited flow of glucose carbons to G3P and hence to TG glycerol we observed in some muscle groups. Indeed, the activity of cytosolic glycerophosphate dehydrogenase in skeletal muscle is at least 2–3 times lower than that of liver in rats (23Holloszy J.O. Oscai L.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 130: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Harding Jr., J.W. Pyeritz E.A. Morris H.P. White III, H.B. Biochem. J. 1975; 148: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, due to oxidative shift of redox status as a result of fasting (25Zahlten R.N. Nejtek M.E. Jacobsen J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 200-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a high NAD+/NADH ratio in fasted rats may have inhibited glucose incorporation into muscle TG glycerol because it favors the equilibrium from G3P to DHAP.Although glycerol kinase activity in skeletal muscle (5Newsholme E.A. Taylor K. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Seltzer W.K. Angelini C. Khariwal G. Ringel S. McCabe E.R.B. Muscle Nerve. 1989; 12: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) is much less than that in the liver, this appears to be only a relative limitation. The mammalian intramuscular TG pool size is generally small, usually up to a few micromoles/g of wet muscle (17Guo ZK Jensen M.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Gorski J. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1992; 70: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity in rat muscle, 7 nmol/g of wet muscle/min (5Newsholme E.A. Taylor K. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), could account for substantial glycerol utilization, i.e. 0.42 μmol/g of wet muscle/h. This rate of utilization is almost the same as the size of the entire pool of intramuscular triglycerides in some predominantly fast twitch, glycolytic muscles such as gastrocnemius and quadriceps. The enzyme activity in human muscle is similar to the rat, or 9 nmol/g/min (6Seltzer W.K. Angelini C. Khariwal G. Ringel S. McCabe E.R.B. Muscle Nerve. 1989; 12: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and thus could provide 15 mmol/h of G3P for TG synthesis (assuming 40% of a 70-kg body mass as skeletal muscle). This value exceeds the glycerol appearance rate in adult humans (∼150 μmol/min). Thus, glycerol kinase could play a greater role in skeletal muscle lipid metabolism than previously realized.In present studies, the rate of incorporation of blood glycerol into intramuscular TG glycerol in fasted rats was ∼0.4 and ∼6 nmol/g of wet muscle/min for gastrocnemius and soleus muscle, respectively. In a previous study using the same experimental conditions (17Guo ZK Jensen M.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we found the synthesis rates of intramuscular TG for gastrocnemius and soleus to be 2.3 and 3.8 nmol/g of wet muscle/min, respectively, using fatty acid tracers. This suggests that, for the soleus muscle, blood glycerol provides the vast majority of the backbone of intramuscular TG. It appears that blood glycerol and glucose make a substantial (∼20% each) contribution to intramuscular TG synthesis in the gastrocnemius. The source of the remaining TG glycerol is not clear, but glycolysis of muscle glycogen-derived glucose may provide TG glycerol carbons. Another possibility is glycerogenesis from other three carbon intermediates. The virtually complete loss of 3H label relative to 14C from blood glucose in muscle TG glycerol implies that glucose had gone through pyruvate carboxylase catalyzed reactions (27Rognstad R. Clark G. Katz J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Guo ZK Lee W.N. Katz J. Bergner A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and therefore gluconeogenic precursors could have made their way to triglyceride glycerol as well.We obtained evidence for indirect glycerogenesis from blood glucose, as indicated by the extensive loss of 3H label from [6-3H]glucose. This suggests that the majority of blood glucose destined for TG glycerol arrived at G3P from steps further down the glycolytic pathways. Presumably, glucose has gone through pyruvate/lactate stage before making its way to G3P via gluconeogenesis, during which hydrogen atoms at the 6th carbon position are lost (19Landau B.R. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 457-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 27Rognstad R. Clark G. Katz J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Guo ZK Lee W.N. Katz J. Bergner A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This is the only explanation for the loss of3H labels from [6-3H]glucose. In the interconversion of pyruvate and alanine, although 6-3H of glucose is lost (19Landau B.R. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 457-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the three-carbon metabolite has to undergo gluconeogenesis via oxaloacetate in order to return to DHAP because phosphoenolpyruvate → pyruvate reaction is irreversible (1Stryer L. Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1981: 457-479Google Scholar). This indirect pathway has been established for glycogen synthesis by the liver (29Kurland I.J. Pilkis S.J. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2277-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) but not in skeletal muscle.We observed a moderate delay in isotopic equilibration between plasma and muscle free glycerol pools. In quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles, the equilibration was complete by 2 h of tracer infusion. In the soleus, on the other hand, a full isotopic equilibrium was not observed even after 3 h of tracer infusion. At 1 and 2 h of infusion, the 13C enrichment of soleus free glycerol was significantly lower than that in other two muscles. The difference in isotopic equilibration between this oxidative muscle and other more glycolytic muscles suggests that TG-fatty acid cycling in soleus is active (30Tagliaferro A.R. Dobbin S. Curi R. Leighton B. Meeker L.D. Newsholme E.A. Int. J. Obes. 1990; 14: 957-971PubMed Google Scholar). Free glycerol generated from such cycling may have diluted incoming [13C]glycerol because TG content (thus the amount of glycerol generated) in soleus is 5 times higher than that in other two muscles (17Guo ZK Jensen M.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Overall, glycerol isotopic equilibration between plasma and intramuscular pools appears slow. For a small molecule like glycerol, this seems unexpected. Nonetheless, this is consistent with the reported direction of the concentration gradient transport of glycerol in skeletal muscle (12Samra J.S. Ravell C.L. Giles S.L. Arner P. Frayn K.N. Clin. Sci. 1996; 90: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 31Rosdahl H. Hamrin K. Ungerstedt U. Henriksson J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E936-E945PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, rat skeletal muscle has a greater capacity for utilizing blood glycerol for intracellular TG synthesis than previously realized. Blood glycerol may be a preferred substrate for TG glycerol synthesis in fasted rats depending on the muscle's oxidative capacity. In fed rats, blood glycerol and glucose contribute similar amounts of carbons to muscle TG glycerol synthesis. The utilization of blood glycerol for this pathway appears to be substrate-regulated, whereas glucose is probably more of a constitutive substrate. It is a biochemistry precept that the glycerol moiety of triacylglycerols and phospholipids in non-hepatic mammalian tissues is primarily derived from glucose via glycolysis (1Stryer L. Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1981: 457-479Google Scholar). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP),1originating from glucose, is reduced to glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) by the action of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. G3P then undergoes sequential acylation steps to incorporate three fatty acids to form a triacylglycerol (TG) (2Mayes P.A. Harper's Biochemistry: A Lange Medical Book. Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT1988: 218-225Google Scholar). DHAP can also take a different path (DHAP pathway) via 1-acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate and then 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphate, but this appears to be a quantitatively minor reaction (3Rognstad R. Clark D.G. Katz J. Biochem. J. 1974; 140: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,4Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Ribonucleotide reductases in mammalian cells, DNA viruses, plants, and some prokaryotes (i.e. Escherichia coli) belong to the same class and are composed of two non-identical subunits, the R1 and R2 proteins. Each subunit is inactive alone, but together they form an active enzyme complex of the type α2β2. The large subunit, the R1 protein, can be considered the business end of the enzyme as it contains the binding site for the ribonucleoside diphosphate substrates (3von Döbeln U. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3616-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The small subunit, the R2 protein, does not bind substrate, and its function during catalysis is to transfer radical properties to the R1 protein toward the activation of the substrate (4Stubbe J.

For this purpose, the R2 protein harbors a tyrosyl free radical generated from a binuclear, non-heme iron center in a reaction that requires oxygen (5Ehrenberg A. Reichard P. J. Biol.

It has not yet been possible to co-crystallize the R1-R2 protein complex, but computer modeling localized the active site of the R1 protein to a deep cleft 25 Å away from the proposed interaction area of the R2 protein (10Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). To explain the involvement of the R2 tyrosyl radical in catalysis, a long-range electron transfer pathway between the two subunits was suggested involving the following conserved residues (mouse numbering): (Fe1), His173,Asp266,Trp103 in the R2 protein and Tyr738,Tyr737, Cys429in the R1 protein (10Uhlin U.

In the following, we will use the mouse numbering system, if not otherwise specified. We have earlier presented strong experimental support for the R2 part of this hydrogen-bonded electron transfer pathway using site-directed mutagenesis to replace the conserved Trp103 in mouse R2 with tyrosine or phenylalanine and the conserved Asp266with alanine (12Rova U.

Recently, we could demonstrate that the hydrogen-bonded pathway in R2 is used not only during catalysis, but also during the generation of the mouse R2 protein iron/tyrosyl free radical center (16Schmidt P.P. Rova U. Katterle B. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21463-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the radical generation reaction, we propose that a reducing equivalent is delivered from ferrous iron in the solution as a coupled electron/proton pair, i.e. a hydrogen radical. Together with two electrons from the binuclear iron center and one electron from Tyr177, this gives the four electrons required to reduce one O2 to water (17Ochiai E.-I. Mann G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15758-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Theoretical calculations support our model of a radical transfer pathway (RTP)1 since it minimizes charge separation and is more energetically favorable than a pure electron transfer between weakly coupled redox centers (18Siegbahn P.E.M. Blomberg M.R.A. Crabtree R.H. Theor. Chem. Acc. 1997; 97: 289-300Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The C-terminal residues 344–375 in the E. coli R2 protein and 354–390 in the mouse R2 protein cannot be visualized in the x-ray crystal structure (8Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H.

Therefore, it has not been possible to determine which residue in the R2 protein links the R2 RTP to the R1 RTP, although a conserved tyrosine (Tyr370) has been suggested (19Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).

They may have a dual function by both interfering with R1-R2 complex formation and the hydrogen radical transfer between the subunits. To identify the linking amino acid residue in the radical transfer pathway between the R1 and R2 subunits, we substituted the conserved Tyr370 in the mouse R2 protein with tryptophan or phenylalanine. Tryptophan has the potential to form a hydrogen-bonded linkage, whereas phenylalanine cannot form such a linkage. We here report data strongly supporting Tyr370 as the connecting link in the intersubunit RTP. The T7 RNA polymerase-responsive vector pET3a (28Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D.-S. Lin S.-W. Dunn J.J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was used as a source for site-directed mutagenesis. The Cla I/Eco RI sites in the original pET3a vector were removed (12Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pETR2-Cla/R1, containing unique Eco RI and Cla I sites. Tyr370 was mutagenized to phenylalanine or tryptophan (Y370F and Y370W) by the polymerase chain reaction technique, using the primers indicated below and pETR2-Cla/R1 as a template. All oligonucleotides used were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Model 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer. The primers were 5′-CTGTCGAATTCGACATGACTCCCATCCTCTG AAA CTCGCC (Y370F) and 5′-CTGTCGAATTCGACATGACTCCCATCCTCTG ACC CTCGCC (Y370W). Boldface letters denote the mutated codon, and the recognition site for Eco RI used in the subcloning is underlined. The same upstream primer was used for both of the mutants: 5′-GGACAAAGAGGCTACGTATGGAGAACGCGT-3′. The underlined nucleotides denote an Mlu I recognition site. A polymerase chain reaction mixture containing 1 ng of pETR2-Cla/R1, 330 ng of each primer, and 0.2 mm dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a buffer recommended for Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was preheated for 5 min at 97 °C before the addition of Pfu polymerase. After 30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min), EDTA was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the two polymerase chain reaction products were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. The mutated fragments were recovered by digestion with Mlu I and Eco RI, resulting in a fragment of 459 base pairs. This fragment was finally cloned into pETR2-Cla/R1 digested with the same enzymes. To amplify the mutated constructs, they were transfected into E. coli strain MC1061 to permit large-scale plasmid preparations. To ensure that no unwanted mismatches had been incorporated during the polymerase chain reaction, both constructs were verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing of the area covering the subcloned fragments. Finally, the constructs pETR2Y370F and pETR2Y370W were transfected into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar), which enables isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced overexpression of the R2 proteins. The native or mutated R2 proteins were overexpressed by induction of logarithmically growing BL21(DE3) pLysS cells containing the native or mutated pETR2 plasmid. Three 6-liter flasks, each with 1.7 liters of LB medium including carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml), were inoculated with 5 ml of an overnight culture of the desired bacterial construct. The cells were then grown and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described earlier (7Mann G. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells, resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), were lysed by freezing at −70 °C and gentle thawing at 25 °C in a water bath. The lysed cells were then centrifuged in a Beckman Ti-70 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The subsequent streptomycin sulfate precipitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column (DE52, Whatman) were carried out according to Mann et al. (7Mann G. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with one exception: no EDTA or protease inhibitor (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was used in the buffer solutions. The purity of the proteins was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 12% gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The concentration of pure protein fractions was determined using the molar extinction coefficient ε280–310 = 62,000m−1 cm−1 (7Mann G. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The recombinant mouse R1 protein was obtained as described previously (30Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy P.B. Lavalleé P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pure R1 protein fractions from the dATP-Sepharose chromatography were precipitated with solid ammonium sulfate (0.523 g/ml, nominally 80%). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the protein precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 0.1m KCl on a Sephadex G-50 column. The interaction of the mutated R2 proteins with the R1 protein was studied at 22 °C by biosensor analysis using the Biacore AB (BIAcore) method as described earlier (12Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Pure fractions of the native R2 protein or mutated proteins were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (31Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Approximately 0.17 nmol of dimeric native R2 protein or mutated R2 protein was injected during the amino coupling procedure. During the immobilization, there was a constant flow (5 μl/min) of HBS running buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Surfactant P20 (Biacore AB) (pH 7.4)). Subunit interaction was studied by allowing the immobilized R2 protein to interact with two different concentrations of R1 protein (200 and 800 nm dimeric protein) in a solution of HBS running buffer supplemented with dithiothreitol and dTTP (2 and 0.1 mmfinal concentrations, respectively). The same buffer was used as eluent during the subunit interaction. After the first R1 injection, the surface was regenerated with 10 μl of 0.5 m KCl in HBS running buffer prior to the next injection. Increasing subunit interaction was monitored as increasing surface plasmon resonance, detected as resonance units (RU). Before use, the native and mutated R2 apoproteins were reactivated with iron. An anaerobic ferrous ammonium sulfate solution was freshly prepared as described previously (16Schmidt P.P. Rova U. Katterle B. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21463-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The aerobic R2 protein was incubated for 30 s at 25 °C with a 3-fold molar excess over the R2 polypeptide of the anaerobic ferrous ammonium sulfate. Excess iron was removed by equilibrating the protein solution with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 100 mm KCl on a Sephadex G-25 column. EPR spectra at 9.3 GHz were measured on a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer using a standard rectangular Bruker EPR cavity (ER4102T) equipped with an Oxford helium flow cryostat or a cold finger Dewar flask for measurements at 77 K. Spin concentrations were determined by comparison of double integrals of EPR spectra with that of the tyrosyl radical in the mouse wild-type R2 protein that had been calibrated with a 1 mm Cu2+ standard. Rapid freeze-quench experiments were performed as described (16Schmidt P.P. Rova U. Katterle B. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21463-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The amount of iron/R2 polypeptide was determined by a colorimetric method (32Atkin C.L. Thelander L. Reichard P. Lang G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Light absorption spectra of the reactivated native R2 protein (20 μm polypeptide) and mutated R2 proteins (44 μm polypeptide) were recorded between 280 and 500 nm using a Perkin-Elmer Lamda 40 UV-visible spectrometer. The ability of the mutated R2 proteins to catalyze reduction of [3H]CDP in the presence of the R1 protein was determined as described previously (33Engström Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), where 1 unit corresponds to the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of dCDP/min at 37 °C. In the assay, the following reagents were incubated in a final volume of 50 μl: 25 nmol of [3H]CDP (specific activity, 20,000 cpm/nmol), 2 μmol of 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinesulfonic acid buffer (pH 7.6), 0.15 μmol of ATP, 0.32 μmol of MgCl2, 0.5 μmol of dithiothreitol, 5 μmol of KCl, 1 nmol of FeCl3, and enzyme as indicated. A mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 50 μm R1 protein, and 25 μm reactivated native or mutated R2 protein was freshly prepared. The reaction was started by the addition of CDP to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The mixture was transferred to an EPR tube and incubated at 27 °C for a certain time and then quenched by immersing the EPR tube into liquid nitrogen (77 K). Formation of transient species and quantification of tyrosyl radical content were made by EPR spectroscopy. The iron chelator desferrioxamine was used to inhibit reconstitution of the tyrosyl free radical during the CDP reduction (34Nyholm S. Mann G.J. Johansson A.G. Bergeron R.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26200-26205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactivated Y370W R2 protein was incubated at 37 °C in the same reaction mixture as described above supplemented with 100 μmdesferrioxamine. Control samples were incubated in the same solution, but in the absence of the R1 protein and CDP. The construction of the pETR2Y370F and pETR2Y370W R2 expression vectors and the expression and purification of the mutated R2 proteins were described under “Experimental Procedures.” The procedures resulted in a yield of 10–15 mg of R2 apoprotein/liter of bacterial culture. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified mutated R2 proteins showed them to be as pure as the native R2 protein (Fig. 1). All preparations showed the presence of full-length R2 protein (45 kDa) as well as variable amounts of N-terminally degraded forms (43.5 and 41 kDa). However, as shown earlier (7Mann G. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), this truncation does not affect the catalytic activity of the R2 protein; indeed, deletion of up to 60 amino acid residues from the N-terminal end does not affect the specific activity of the recombinant mouse R2 protein. 2L. Thelander, unpublished results. It is known that the C-terminal part of the R2 protein is essential for binding to the R1 protein. We therefore investigated if the Y370W and Y370F mutations affected R1 binding, using biosensor analyses as described previously (12Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The native and mutated R2 proteins were immobilized to the sensor chips, yielding 1500–2200 immobilized RU, where 1 RU corresponds to a surface concentration of 1 pg of protein/mm2 of a 100-nm-thick dextran layer (35Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löf†s S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Stenberg E. St†hlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Östlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the sensorgram for the interaction between the R1 protein and the native or mutated R2 protein. The association and dissociation of the R1-R2 complex can be followed as changes in surface plasmon resonance, which are detected as RU in the sensorgram. After injection of the R1 protein in the running buffer, the association phase in Fig. 2 was detected as an increase in RU. The association reached a steady-state equilibrium level, and this occurred faster with increasing concentrations of R1 protein. When the injection of the R1 protein was stopped and only running buffer with dTTP was used, the R1-R2 complex started to dissociate as seen by the decrease in RU. As shown in Fig. 2, there was no significant difference in shape between the response curves for the native and mutated R2 proteins. Control experiments in which the same concentrations of R1 protein were injected on sensor chips without the immobilized R2 proteins gave only an insignificant response of ∼50 RU (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the R2 protein point mutations did not influence R1 protein binding in a significant way. The iron/radical center in the mutated proteins was reconstituted by the addition of a 3-fold molar excess of an anaerobic ferrous iron solution to an aerobic protein solution (see “Experimental Procedures”). EPR spectroscopy of the reactivated proteins, shown in Fig. 3 (traces B and C), displayed a normal EPR signal with the same hyperfine pattern of the tyrosyl radical as for the native R2 protein (Fig. 3, trace A). The comparison of the microwave saturation behavior of the tyrosyl free radical in the two R2 protein mutants with that of the wild-type R2 protein at 20 and 30 K did not show any significant difference in the P50value. Therefore, the mutation did not influence the magnetic interaction of the tyrosyl free radical with the metal site, indicating that the radical structure is not disturbed. Determination of radical and iron content showed that the Y370F and Y370W R2 proteins are similar to what was previously reported for the native R2 protein (7Mann G. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), with 0.6 and 0.8 nmol of radical and 1.8 and 2.2 nmol of iron/nmol of R2 polypeptide, respectively. The diferric iron center and the tyrosyl radical have a very characteristic light absorption spectrum (5Ehrenberg A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3485-3488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Petersson L. Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6706-6712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mann G. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The mouse R2 protein iron center light absorption band is clearly visible at 329 nm, and the absorption of the tyrosyl radical has a sharp peak at 417 nm (Fig.4 A). Fig. 4 shows the spectra of the reactivated native and mutated R2 proteins recorded between 280 and 500 nm. The arrows in Fig. 4 A (the native protein) denote the iron center and radical center absorption bands. Clearly, the spectra of the two mutated proteins (Fig. 4, B and C) show the same characteristics. Together, these results show that the point mutations did not affect the ability to form a normal diferric iron/tyrosyl radical center. The enzyme activity of the reactivated Y370W and Y370F R2 proteins was measured in the presence of the R1 protein using [3H]CDP as a substrate and ATP as a positive effector. In Table I, the results are compared with the activity of the reactivated native R2 protein. No activity was detected for the Y370F R2 protein. In contrast, the Y370W R2 protein showed a low but still significant activity, which increased in a linear way with increasing amounts of added mutated protein. The reaction was linear during the 30-min incubation (data not shown). The reactivated native R2 protein assayed in parallel had a specific activity of 228 units/mg. The specific activity of the Y370W R2 protein was ∼3.9 units/mg. A control experiment in which the highest amount of Y370W protein was assayed in the absence of added mouse R1 protein showed only column background values (0.04–0.05 nmol). We therefore conclude that the Y370W protein has ∼1.7% of normal R2 protein activity, and this activity is not due to any contamination of E. coli ribonucleotide reductase.Table IRibonucleotide reductase activity of the native and mutated R2 proteinsR2 proteinTotal proteinFormation of dCDP/30 min at 37 °C1-aThe activity was measured in the presence of 10 μg of recombinant mouse R1 protein (33).

Open table in a new tab One reason for the low specific activity of the Y370W R2 protein compared with the native R2 protein might be a slower rate of radical transfer. This might allow the detection of transient EPR reaction intermediates. We therefore used EPR spectroscopy to study the kinetics of the CDP reduction catalyzed by the native and mutated R2 proteins in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of the R1 protein, but in the absence of added iron. Under these conditions, where the incubation mixture was incubated at 27 °C in an EPR tube, we were not able to detect any visible transient EPR intermediates. Instead, an unexpected time-dependent decay of the tyrosyl radical was observed with the Y370W R2 protein (Fig.5 A, ▪). Neither the native R2 protein nor the Y370F R2 mutant showed such a decay under similar incubation conditions (Fig. 5 A, • and ○, respectively). Furthermore, control samples with the native or mutated R2 proteins in the presence of the R1 protein, but without the addition of CDP, showed no significant decrease in radical content (data not shown). Therefore, the Y370W-specific tyrosyl radical decay is absolutely dependent on the presence of the CDP substrate. The iron/radical center of the mouse R2 protein is labile under physiological conditions. After 30 min at 37 °C, the protein loses ∼50% of its iron and radical content. Continuous loss of ferric iron in the presence of the reductant dithiothreitol in the assay mixture results in a simultaneous decay and reconstitution of the tyrosyl radical (34Nyholm S. Mann G.J. Johansson A.G. Bergeron R.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26200-26205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may explain the observed rapid initial decay of the radical, followed by a steady-state plateau at ∼60% of the initial value (Fig. 5 A). To support this hypothesis, we repeated the CDP reduction at 37 °C in the presence of the previously characterized iron chelator desferrioxamine (34Nyholm S. Mann G.J. Johansson A.G. Bergeron R.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26200-26205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the reactivated Y370W R2 protein was incubated with desferrioxamine in the absence of the R1 protein and CDP, the same spontaneous loss of the tyrosyl radical was seen as observed earlier (Fig. 5 B, ▴). However, in the presence of the R1 protein and CDP, the decay of the radical was much more pronounced (Fig. 5 B, ▪). This further strengthens our hypothesis that the decay of the tyrosyl radical in the case of the Y370W protein is dependent on ongoing catalysis. To investigate if Tyr370 is involved in the reconstitution of the diferric/tyrosyl free radical center of the R2 protein, we used rapid freeze-quench EPR with 3 nmol of Fe(II)/nmol of R2 polypeptide and a reconstitution temperature of 5 °C. With native R2 apoprotein, we could confirm the earlier reported kform for the tyrosyl radical of 0.14 s−1 (16Schmidt P.P. Rova U. Katterle B. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21463-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The values for the Y370W and Y370F R2 proteins (0.19 and 0.16 s−1, respectively) did not differ significantly from the value of the native protein. Furthermore, the final yield of the tyrosyl free radical was the same for all three proteins (0.5–0.6 nmol of radical/nmol of polypeptide chain). The key to understanding the mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase is a better knowledge of how the radical properties of the R2 protein are transferred to the active site of the R1 protein. After the three-dimensional structures of the R1 and R2 proteins were reported (8Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 10Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), many studies have been made to address this question. Biological electron transfer has been extensively studied for redox reactions involved in the respiratory and photosynthetic chains. The two commonly discussed models for electron transfer over distances of up to 20 Å argue whether or not the intervening protein structure is an important factor for the efficiency of the electron transfer (36Moser C.C. Keske J.M. Warncke K. Farid R.S. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1992; 355: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar,37Beratan D.N. Onuchic J.N. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B Science. 1992; 258: 1740-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In contrast to these models, the electron transfer in ribonucleotide reductase has to propagate quite a long distance of ∼35 Å between the oxidized tyrosine in the R2 protein and a neutral cysteine at the active site of the R1 protein. It is unlikely that the current electron transfer theories can be applied to this system since too much energy would be required to overcome the charge separation arising from a pure electron transfer. Instead, a more recent theoretical model explains this transfer as a coupled electron/proton transfer, i.e. a hydrogen radical transfer (H⋅) (18Siegbahn P.E.M. Blomberg M.R.A. Crabtree R.H. Theor. Chem. Acc. 1997; 97: 289-300Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The advantage of this model is that it minimizes charge separation as an uncharged hydrogen radical is moved along a conserved hydrogen-bonded chain, i.e. an RTP. This model also accounts for the reaction that initially takes place during ribonucleotide reduction, i.e. the abstraction of an H⋅ from the 3′-position of the substrate. We have previously tried to obtain experimental evidence for the proposed RTP of the mouse R2 protein during the catalytic reaction as well as during the reconstitution of the iron/tyrosyl radical center (12Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Schmidt P.P. Rova U. Katterle B. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21463-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our results strongly support the RTP model and stress the importance of a proper hydrogen-bonded chain for the formation of such a pathway, both during catalysis and the generation of the iron/radical center. Similar results were obtained for the E. coli R1 and R2 proteins (14Ekberg M. Sahlin M. Eriksson M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20655-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Ekberg M. Pötsch S. Sandin E. Thunnissen M. Nordlund P. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21003-21008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The connection between the R1 protein RTP with the R2 protein RTP is unknown since no co-crystallization of these proteins has been obtained. In the E. coli R2 protein, the conserved tyrosine 356 has been suggested as the connecting link since substitution of this residue with alanine and phenylalanine inhibits enzyme activity (19Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38Tong W. Burdi D. Riggs-Gelasco P. Edmondson D. Huynh B.H. Stubbe J. Han S. Arvai A. Tainer J.

Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the mouse R2 protein, this residue corresponds to tyrosine 370, which is not involved in the 7-amino acid-long C-terminal region required for R1-R2 complex formation (22Yang F.D. Spanevello R.A. Celiker I. Hirschmann R. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By substituting the mouse R2 protein Tyr370 with either of 2 aromatic residues, tryptophan or phenylalanine, with completely different hydrogen bond-forming properties, we aimed to probe the importance of an intact hydrogen-bonded chain for the RTP. Using the biosensor technique, we could not detect any major difference between the native and mutated R2 proteins regarding their ability to bind to the R1 protein. This was expected since Tyr370 does not belong to the C-terminal amino acids involved in R1 binding. Furthermore, the results argue against any major collapse of the R2 protein structure. The ability to form a normal iron/tyrosyl free radical center in the mutated R2 proteins also indicates that the overall protein conformation was retained. However, the Y370F R2 protein was completely inactive, whereas the Y370W R2 protein had a low but significant activity of ∼1.7% compared with the native R2 protein. Since the R1-R2 complex formation and the iron/tyrosyl radical center are unaffected in these mutated R2 proteins, the results strongly indicate the conserved Tyr370 to be involved in the RTP. According to the model of Siegbahn et al. (18Siegbahn P.E.M. Blomberg M.R.A. Crabtree R.H. Theor. Chem. Acc. 1997; 97: 289-300Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the radical transfer is dependent on a proper hydrogen-bonded chain. Our results are in good agreement with this prediction since interruption of the RTP totally inhibits the catalytic reaction (Y370F), whereas an alternation allows partial catalysis (Y370W). In contrast to the catalytic reaction, Tyr370 appears not to be involved in the reconstitution of the iron/tyrosyl free radical center in the isolated R2 protein. This is different from the conserved Trp103 and Asp266 (16Schmidt P.P. Rova U. Katterle B. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21463-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and may be a consequence of its position in the flexible C-terminal tail of the protein. The importance of proper hydrogen bonds as linkages in the RTP was also addressed in studies in which the conserved aspartic acid 237 in the E. coli R2 protein, proposed to be involved in the radical transfer, was substituted with asparagine or glutamate (15Ekberg M. Pötsch S. Sandin E. Thunnissen M. Nordlund P. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21003-21008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The D237N R2 protein was catalytically inactive, whereas the D237E R2 protein retained ∼7% of the activity of the native R2 protein. The three-dimensional structure of the D237E protein showed that this residue could indeed form the same hydrogen bonds to Trp48and His118 as in the native R2 protein. However, the reduced activity might be explained by the slightly longer distance of the bond to Trp48. One unexpected observation in our study is the time-dependent decay of the tyrosyl free radical when the Y370W R2 protein was incubated with an excess of the R1 protein and CDP under assay conditions, but in the absence of added iron. EPR measurements showed a significant time-dependent loss of the tyrosyl radical. As this loss was detected neither in the native R2 protein nor in the Y370F R2 protein under the same conditions, we propose that this reaction is specific for the Y370W R2 protein. The recorded low formation of dCDP with time excludes a rapid initial reaction resulting in a fast inactivation of the R2 protein. Instead, our results show that the entire catalysis is slowed down in the Y370W mutant, and this slow rate of radical transfer may explain the loss of radical probably as a consequence of structural changes. Together with our earlier results (12Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Schmidt P.P. Rova U. Katterle B. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21463-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), our observations strongly support a radical transfer mechanism along the previously suggested array of conserved residues, where an intact hydrogen-bonded chain is a prerequisite for an efficient transfer. Even if the C-terminal 37 amino acids of the mouse R2 protein are too flexible to be mapped in the crystal structure, they contain at least one catalytically essential residue, Tyr370. Upon R1-R2 complex formation, this residue may be placed in a well defined structural position, bridging the RTP of the R1 protein with the RTP of the R2 protein."

Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 536-556Crossref Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Recent high resolution data on the same dodecamer (2Shui X. McFail-Isom L. Hu G. Williams L.

However, some of the water-water distances are too long to be considered hydrogen bonds, and they correspond rather to Van der Waals contacts. An additional result of the studies mentioned above is that either K+ (3Shui X. Sines C. McFail-Isom L. VanDerveer D. Williams L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16877-16887Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) or Rb+ (5Tereshko V. Minasov G. Egli M. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8341-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) that Na+may also occupy the water sites, but this suggestion has been challenged (4Tereshko V. Minasov G. Egli M. J. Am.

The use of flash cooling and synchrotron radiation allows a much higher resolution in the x-ray diffraction data of oligonucleotides than was possible a few years ago. As a result, a much greater detail on water and ion distribution can be obtained. The detailed study of water and ions around DNA is interesting in itself, but it is also relevant to understand protein-DNA interactions. It has been suggested (7Otwinowski Z. Schevitz W. Zhang R.-G.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1057-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) that water-mediated polar contacts may contribute to the specificity of protein-DNA recognition. A better understanding of water structure around DNA is essential to ascertain the eventual role of ions and hydration waters in DNA interactions. The data obtained from high resolution oligonucleotide structures will be of great value in this sense. Here we report the arrangement of water and divalent cations in the related structures of d(GCGAATTCG) in the presence of Mg2+(resolution = 0.89 Å) and the calcium form of d(CGCGAATTCGCG) (resolution = 1.45 Å). The high resolution achieved with these structures allows us to position with certainty many of the water and ions in the crystal. Thus, the influence of either monovalent (Na+) or divalent (Mg2+, Ca2+) cations can be ascertained. The structure of the water spine is very clear and allows us to determine which water molecules occupy fixed positions. Hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals contacts can be clearly distinguished. The nonamer was crystallized, using a batch method, in sitting drops containing 0.5 mm DNA duplex, 1 mm acridine (Arg4) drug-peptide adduct, 20 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7, 100 mm MgCl2, and 35% MPD.1 Crystals grow in approximately 2 months to a typical size of 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 mm. The dodecamer crystallization is described elsewhere (9Liu J. Malinina L. Subirana J.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Liu J. Subirana J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). For data collection, crystals were mounted in a fiber loop and immediately flash-cooled at 120 K under a nitrogen vapor stream using an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream. Data were collected using synchrotron radiation at EMBL beam line X11 in the DESY (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron) Hamburg Outstation on a 345-mm MAR Research imaging-plate scanner. Three sets of data were collected at resolution cut-offs 0.89, 1.5, and 2.64 Å to avoid saturation of the high intensity reflections. The data were processed and reduced with DENZO and SCALEPACK software packages (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The nonamer structure previously reported (12Vlieghe D. Van Meervelt L. Dautant A. Gallois B. Précigoux G. Kennard O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) at 2.05 Å resolution was used as a starting model. It was refined in XPLOR 3.8 (13Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual , version 3.851. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar) with a least-square target between 30 and 1.1 Å (Rfree = 0.248; Rfactor = 0.222). Simulated annealing protocols were employed. After running some cycles with XPLOR, we switched to SHELXL (14Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar), where anisotropic refinement was carried out with some conjugate gradient cycles using the maximum resolution. The remaining structure was built into 2 Fo −Fc electron density maps generated with SHELXPRO. The refinement converged at Rfactor = 0.145 for all data between 30 and 0.89 Å (F > 4 ς). A very clear Cl− ion was found between two Mg2+ ions. Two poorly ordered sodium ions (Bfactors = 24.1 and 71.6 Å2) near phosphate groups were tentatively assigned on the basis of several short distances (<2.6 Å) to neighbor water molecules. They were located on the major groove in regions where the solvent is not well ordered. They are not shown in the figures. The drug-peptide complex used in the crystallization was not found in the crystal. We expect to decrease the Rfactor by modeling the disordered regions. 2M. Soler-López, L. Malinina, and J. A. Subirana, work in progress. To our surprise only 110 water molecules could be precisely located, compared with 86 that were found in the structure reported (12Vlieghe D. Van Meervelt L. Dautant A. Gallois B. Précigoux G. Kennard O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) at 2.05 Å. An additional 5 molecules had closely spaced (<0.5 Å) alternative positions. Many other sites with partial occupancy appear to be present. No molecule of the MPD used for crystallization could be located. It appears that most of the rather large spaces available for solvent molecules are in a poorly ordered glassy state. However, there are regions that have a highly ordered water network, probably influenced by the presence of Mg2+ ions. Refinement details for the high resolution structure of the dodecamer are reported elsewhere (10Liu J. Subirana J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Crystal data and refinement statistics for both structures are listed in Table I. Stereo views are shown in Fig. 1.

Comparison of the duplex structure of d(GCGAATTCG) with the data obtained at a lower resolution (12Vlieghe D. Van Meervelt L. Dautant A. Gallois B. Précigoux G. Kennard O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) does not show any significant difference (root mean square excluding phosphates between both structures is 0.33 Å). The main difference is that in our study four phosphate groups are disordered and have at least a double conformation. In Fig. 1, only the major conformation is represented. Alternative phosphate positions are available at the reported Nucleic Acid Database file. The strong similarity between the two structures determined at different resolutions gives confidence in the data presently available on oligonucleotide structures that have been obtained mostly at resolutions around 2.5 Å (Ref. 2Shui X. McFail-Isom L. Hu G. Williams L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8341-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This is itself an important conclusion of the work reported here, although the most interesting new data obtained relate to the organization of water and ions around DNA, as we will show below. In Fig. 3 we present the minor groove hydration for the Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ duplexes. All three spines have been superimposed by using waters P2, P3, and P4 in the primary hydration layer and S3 and S4 in the secondary layer. The nomenclature of Shui et al. (3Shui X. Sines C. McFail-Isom L. VanDerveer D. Williams L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16877-16887Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) is used. They distinguish four hydration layers at increasing distances from the bottom of the minor groove. From Fig. 3 it is obvious that the superposition of the five water molecules mentioned above is excellent. Waters at either end of the spine (P1, P5) are no longer so well superimposed. Oligonucleotides of different lengths crystallized with different counterions (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+) in different space groups (P212121, R3) are compared in the figure. It is evident that the central AATT sequence contains a quite rigid spine of hydration, first described by Drew and Dickerson (1Drew H.R. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 536-556Crossref Scopus (810) Google Scholar), which is very stable. The minor groove is also very narrow in all three cases, although in the nonamer case it is about 0.6 Å wider at the center, as already reported (12Vlieghe D. Van Meervelt L. Dautant A. Gallois B. Précigoux G. Kennard O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A tertiary layer of hydration is also clear in all cases. Each water molecule in the secondary layer has an additional hydrogen-bonded water molecule. However, the orientation of water molecules in the tertiary layer with respect to those in the secondary layer is different in all three cases. For example, in the nonamer case the S2 water has two associated waters instead of one in the tertiary layer. The quaternary layer of hydration is quite different in all cases. Many of the waters are not hydrogen bonded with those of the tertiary layer as evident in Fig. 3. In fact, they are associated with chains of waters that interact with the phosphate groups of the same and neighbor duplexes. They should not be considered an integral part of the minor groove water spine because their position depends on the interactions in the crystal. In the nonamer crystal structure, the position of water molecules near the P1 side of the spine is very well defined, whereas they are mainly disordered on the P4/P5 side. Such differences are due to the fact that the two ends of the duplexes lie in different regions of the crystal and have different interactions with neighbor duplexes. The water molecules associated with the P1 end of the minor groove water spine form a system of polygons and solvent chains that interconnect three nonamer molecules and several ions (Mg2+, Cl−) in the crystal. The ends of the water spine (sites P1 and P5) are also very different in the three cases shown in Fig. 3, due in part to the presence of divalent cations in these regions. In the case of the nonamer, for example, instead of a single P1 water molecule there are two water molecules at this level, one interacting with cytosine and the other with guanine. The results presented demonstrate that the GAATTC sequence has a very well defined water spine associated with the narrow minor groove of the AATT central region. This water spine has two very well defined and constant layers, with a somewhat variable third layer. On top of the latter layer, a system of water molecules defines a set of pentagons/hexagons and chains of water molecules. The exact geometry depends on the sequence, the length of the duplex, and the crystallization conditions used in each case. The presence of strongly associated water molecules in the A(A/T)T and AT base steps may contribute to stabilizing the conformational features of these base steps, which are known to vary very little (15El Hassan M.A. Calladine C.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A Math. Phys. Sci. 1997; 355: 43-100Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Subirana J.A Faria T. Biophys J. 1997; 73: 333-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in different oligonucleotides. Thus, to interpret the detailed structural features of different DNA sequences, the roles of water and ions should be taken into account. Finally, we should discuss the role of the divalent cations in the structure of the duplexes. The high resolution structure of d(GCGAATTCG) includes several ions (Table I). Because the d(GCGAATTCG) duplex has 16 negative phosphate charges, some charges remain to be neutralized in each asymmetric unit, probably by additional disordered Mg2+/Na+ ions that have not been detected. In fact, some electron density peaks that have been assigned to water molecules may correspond to such ions because they show some short contacts. The Mg2+ ions are mainly involved in the interaction among different duplexes in the crystal, but none of them are found in the region of the minor groove water spine. Instead, two Mg2+ ions are found at both ends of the minor groove and in fact interact with the ends of the water spine, as shown in Fig. 3. A similar situation is found in the R3 structure, where Ca2+ions are present at similar positions, as shown in Figs. 1 and 3. Although the minor groove is considered to be (17Young M.A. Jayaram B. Beveridge D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 59Crossref Scopus (374) Google Scholar) a very electronegative region, it appears that the geometry of the AATT region with its associated water spine allows neither hydrated Ca2+ nor Mg2+ to penetrate inside the minor groove. However, in oligonucleotides with a different sequence (18Quintana J.R. Grzeskowiak K. Yanagi K. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 379-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Yuan H.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1022-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which have a wider minor groove, hydrated divalent cations do penetrate into the minor groove. The influence of sequence has also been confirmed by NMR experiments showing that hydrated Mn2+ ions do not penetrate the A4T4minor groove but do penetrate into T4A4(21Hud N.V. Feigon J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5756-5757Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The eventual substitution of some of the molecules in the water spine by Na+ ions has been a question of debate (2Shui X. McFail-Isom L. Hu G. Williams L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8341-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 4Tereshko V. Minasov G. Egli M. J. Am. Chem.

Sines C. McFail-Isom L. VanDerveer D. Williams L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16877-16887Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) may indeed replace, in part, some of the water molecules. In fact, the latter ions have a larger ionic radius more suitable than Na+ for the geometry of the minor groove. In summary, high resolution studies allow an improved knowledge of ion and water distribution around oligonucleotides. However, the relationship between water structure after flash-cooling and water structure at room temperature is not clear, and further studies are required in this direction. In fact, we found that only a limited number of solvent molecules occupies well defined sites, and most of the waters appear to be in a disordered, glassy state. Some of the counterions could not be located, because the oligonucleotide negative charges are not fully neutralized. Also no MPD molecule was found to occupy any definite position. In fact no MPD molecule has been found in any oligonucleotide crystal. In the protein crambin, also studied (23Teeter M.M. Roe S.M. Heo N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 292-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) at high resolution (0.83 Å); and only one ethanol molecule could be located, although crystals were obtained around 70% ethanol concentration. The absence of MPD in this and in all the reported oligonucleotide structures may indicate that either MPD is excluded from the crystals or is always disordered. We thank Drs. G. DeTitta and J. Luft for advice on crystallization and Drs. V. Tereshko and L. Williams for sending manuscripts before publication."

Myofibroblastic HSC (mHSC) also participate to the regulation of intrahepatic blood flow, because of their contractile properties. Here, we examined whether human mHSC express natriuretic peptide receptors (NPR). Only NPR-B mRNA was identified, which was functional as demonstrated in binding studies and by increased cGMP levels in response to C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). CNP inhibited mHSC proliferation, an effect blocked by the protein kinase G inhibitor 8-(4 chlorophenylthio)-cGMP and by the NPR antagonist HS-142-1 and reproduced by analogs of cGMP. Growth inhibition was associated with a reduction of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase and with a blockade of AP-1 DNA binding. CNP and cGMP analogs also blunted mHSC contraction elicited by thrombin, by suppressing calcium influx. The relaxing properties of CNP were mediated by a blockade of store-operated calcium channels, as demonstrated using a calcium-free/calcium readdition protocol. These results constitute the first evidence for a hepatic effect of CNP and identify mHSC as a target cell. Activation of NPR-B by CNP in human mHSC leads to inhibition of both growth and contraction. These data suggest that during chronic liver diseases, CNP may counteract both liver fibrogenesis and associated portal hypertension.

CNP inhibited mHSC proliferation, an effect blocked by the protein kinase G inhibitor 8-(4 chlorophenylthio)-cGMP and by the NPR antagonist HS-142-1 and reproduced by analogs of cGMP. Growth inhibition was associated with a reduction of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase and with a blockade of AP-1 DNA binding. CNP and cGMP analogs also blunted mHSC contraction elicited by thrombin, by suppressing calcium influx. The relaxing properties of CNP were mediated by a blockade of store-operated calcium channels, as demonstrated using a calcium-free/calcium readdition protocol. These results constitute the first evidence for a hepatic effect of CNP and identify mHSC as a target cell. Activation of NPR-B by CNP in human mHSC leads to inhibition of both growth and contraction. These data suggest that during chronic liver diseases, CNP may counteract both liver fibrogenesis and associated portal hypertension.

ANP is mainly synthetized in the atrium, whereas brain natriuretic peptide and CNP are more widely produced (1Levin E.R. Gardner D.G. Samson W.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). The three peptides play an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis and exert natriuretic and diuretic effects. In addition, natriuretic peptides exhibit relaxing and growth inhibitory responses in parenchymal and mesenchymal cells of various origins (for a review, see Ref. 1Levin E.R. Gardner D.G. Samson W.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). In keeping with the diversity of natriuretic peptide functions, three classes of receptors have been characterized in different tissues, natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A, which is sensitive to ANP and brain natriuretic peptide (2Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), NPR-B, which is highly specific for CNP (3Koller K.J. Lowe D.G. Bennett G.L. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1991; 252: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), and NPR-C, which binds the three natriuretic peptides with similar affinities (2Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). NPR-A and NPR-B are members of the guanylyl cyclase receptor family and transduce their biological effects via cGMP (2Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), whereas NPR-C lacks the guanylate cyclase domain and signals through inhibition of cAMP (4Anand-Srivastava M.B. Sairam M.R. Cantin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8566-8572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that the mRNAs for NPR-A, NPR-B, and NPR-C are expressed in human liver (5Vollmar A.M. Paumgartner G. Gerbes A.L. Gut. 1997; 40: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) (also known as lipocytes, fat-storing cells, or perisinusoidal cells) are resident cells in the space of Disse that show a pericyte-like orientation, extending long cytoplasmic processes around hepatic sinusoids. Recent studies have advocated their salient role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis and of portal hypertension (6Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Following liver injury, HSC undergo phenotypic activation from a quiescent cell containing large retinoid droplets to an activated myofibroblastic-like cell. This state is characterized by intense proliferation, marked synthesis of extracellular matrix, and production of proinflammatory cytokines, which lead to the development of liver fibrosis (6Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Proliferation and accumulation of myofibroblastic HSC (mHSC) have largely been documented in experimental models and in culture studies (7Mancini R. Jezequel A.M. Benedetti A. Paolucci F. Trozzi L. Orlandi F. J. Hepatol. 1992; 15: 361-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Geerts A. Lazou J.M. De Bleser P. Wisse E. Hepatology. 1993; 13: 1193-1202Google Scholar). Among several mitogenic growth factors, PDGF-BB, which is highly expressed during chronic hepatic injury, is currently considered as the most potent mitogen (9Failli P. Ruocco C. De Franco R. Caligiuri A. Gentilini A. Giotti A. Gentilini P. Pinzani M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1133-C1139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mallat A. Gallois C. Tao J. Habib A. Maclouf J. Mavier P.

Factors that may limit the proliferation of myofibroblastic HSC have also been characterized, such as endothelin-1 (ET-1), cAMP, TNF-α, and prostaglandins (E2 and I2) (11Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Mallat A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23183-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). During phenotypic activation, HSC also acquire smooth muscle features, such as the expression of smooth muscle α-actin (6Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and contract in response to diverse vasoactive mediators (14Sakamoto M. Ueno T. Kin M. Ohira H. Torimura T. Inuzuka S. Sata M. Tanikawa K. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 978-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 15Pinzani M. Failli P. Ruocco C. Casini A. Milani S. Baldi E. Giotti A. Gentilini P. J. Clin.

Invest. 1993; 92: 1795-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Moreover, increasing evidence indicates that enhanced sensitivity of myofibroblastic HSC to contractile peptides elevates intrahepatic resistance and contributes to portal hypertension associated with the development of liver fibrosis (19Mallat A. Digestion. 1998; 59: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide the first evidence for a hepatic effect of CNP. In a model of human myofibroblastic HSC that displays the phenotypic characteristics of mHSC found in situ during hepatic fibrosis (20Win K.M. Charlotte F. Mallat A. Cherqui D. Martin N. Mavier P. Préaux A.M. Dhumeaux D. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we show that activation of NPR-B receptor leads to elevation of cGMP levels and results in inhibition of mHSC proliferation and contraction. Analysis of the signaling pathways indicate that growth inhibition is associated with inhibition of MAP kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)) activations and blunting of AP-1 binding stimulation. Relaxing effects of CNP are consecutive to a blockade of the calcium influx through store-operated calcium channels. Human CNP-(32–53) was from Bachem (Voísins-le-Bretonneux, France), and human α-ANP-(1–28) was from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). PDGF-BB was from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum was from Life Technologies, Inc., and pooled human AB positive serum was supplied by the National Transfusion Center. Hybond N+ membrane, rapid hybrid buffer, [methyl-3H]thymidine (25 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and125I-[Tyr0]CNP-22 ([125I]CNP) (500 Ci/mmol) was from Peninsula (Mersyside, United Kingdom). AP-1 and NF-kB consensus oligonucleotides, Access RT-PCR kit and Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay were from Promega (Charbonnieres, France). The plasmid encoding glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun (1–79) fusion protein was a generous gift of Dr. C. Bradham (Chapel Hill, NC). The phospho-p38 MAP kinase antibody was from New England Biolabs (Ozyme, Montigny le Breteonneux, France), cAMP and cGMP radioimmunoassays were from Immunotech (Marseille, France), and Fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes (Interchim, Montluçon, France). 8-(4-Chlorophenylthio)guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer (Rp-8-pCPT-cGMP) was from Biolog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany). The protein assay kit was from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were from Sigma. HS-142-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Nakanishi (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan). Human mHSC in their activated phenotype were obtained by outgrowth of normal liver explants obtained from surgery of benign or malignant liver tumors. This procedure was performed in accordance with ethical regulations imposed by French legislation. Explants were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum (5% fetal calf serum, 5% pooled human serum), and exhaustive characterization of these cells has already been published (20Win K.M. Charlotte F. Mallat A. Cherqui D. Martin N. Mavier P. Préaux A.M. Dhumeaux D. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cell isolates were routinely characterized by a positive staining for smooth muscle α-actin, a marker of HSC in their myofibroblastic phenotype. Experiments were performed between passages 3 and 7, without any noticeable difference in results observed with cells obtained from various passages or from various livers. All experiments were performed on cells made quiescent by a 3-day incubation in serum-free Waymouth medium. For analysis of NPR, total RNA was extracted in guanidium isothiocyanate from confluent mHSC made quiescent in serum-free Waymouth medium over 3 days, as described previously (11Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Poly(A) RNA from human kidney and total RNA from human liver and heart were kindly provided by Drs. F. Bulle and S. Le Gouvello (INSERM U99, Créteil, France), respectively, and used as positive control. For each condition, cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were performed in the same tube. A cDNA strand was synthetized with reverse transcriptase using a commercialized kit (Promega), from 5 ng of RNA of human mHSC and human heart RNAs and 0.5 ng of kidney poly(A) RNA. The reaction was performed for 45 min at 48 °C, and the cDNA was used as template DNA for the PCR amplification. In all experiments, the presence of possible contamination with genomic DNA was tested by omitting reverse transcriptase from the medium, and the product was then processed in parallel with the other samples. The oligonucleotide primers for the human NPR-A (21Lowe D.G. Chang M.S. Hellmiss R. Chen E. Singh S. Garbers D.L. Goeddel D.V. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1377-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) (sense, 5′-GGAGCGGACCCAGGCATACCTGGAGG-3′; antisense, 5′-AGGTCAGCCTCGGGTGCTACTC-3′) predicted a PCR fragment of 693 bp; the primers for NPR-B (22Chang M.S. Lowe D.G. Lewis M. Hellmiss R. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1989; 341: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) (sense, 5′-GGTGGCACCAGCATATTGGACAAC-3′; antisense, 5′-TACAGGAGTCCAGGAGGTCCTT-3′) predicted a PCR fragment of 767 bp; the primers for NPR-C (23Porter J.G. Arfsten A. Fuller F. Miller J.A. Gregory L.C. Lewicki J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 796-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (sense, 5′-GTGGCCCGGCTTGCATCGCACTGGG-3′; antisense, 5′-TCCGGATGGTGTCACTGCTC-3′) predicted a PCR fragment of 379 bp. The conditions for PCR amplification were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. 35 cycles were performed for NPR-A, NPR-B, and NPR-C. PCR products were size-fractionated in a 2% agarose gel and blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane. After a prehybridization in rapid hybrid buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 42 °C, the membrane was hybridized in the same buffer for 1 h at 42 °C with 10 ng/ml of oligonucleotides complementary to sequences within the cDNAs flanked by the PCR primers, labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (NPR-A probe, 5′-GTACAAGGTGGAGACAATTGGC-3′; NPR-B probe, 5′-CACGCATTGTCAGCAGAGAGCACC-3′; NPR-C probe, 5′-GGGTTTGCACACGTCCATCTA-3′). After washing in 6× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 22 °C and then for 45 min at 42 °C, membranes were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Bondoufle, France). Confluent mHSC in six-well plates were made quiescent by a 3 days incubation in serum-free Waymouth medium and further stimulated for 2 h at 4 °C in Waymouth medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm bacitracin, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, with 10 pm of [125I]CNP and varying concentrations of either unlabeled CNP or ANP. The incubation was stopped by aspirating the medium and rinsing the cells four times with 4 ml of washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 137 mm NaCl and 1% bovine serum albumin). The cells were then solubilized with 0.4n NaOH, and cell-associated radioactivity was measured. Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating with 1 μm CNP, and it usually represented 25% of the total radioactivity. Experiments were performed in duplicate, and the protein content was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit in three separate wells. Confluent mHSC were made quiescent by a 3-day incubation in serum-free Waymouth medium, preincubated with 0.6 mmisobutylmethylxanthine for 15 min, except otherwise indicated, and then stimulated for various periods of time in phosphate-buffered saline containing varying concentrations of natriuretic peptides. cAMP and cGMP were extracted and assayed as described previously (24Serradeil-Le Gal C. Jouneaux C. Sanchez-Bueno A. Raufaste D. Roche B. Preaux A.M. Maffrand J.P. Cobbold P.H. Hanoune J. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), using a commercial radioimmunoassay. DNA synthesis was measured in triplicate wells by incorporation of [3H]thymidine, as described previously (11Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Confluent mHSC were made quiescent by a 3 days incubation in serum-free Waymouth medium and then stimulated for 30 h with the indicated effectors, in the presence of 80 μm ZnCl2, which has been described to enhance the growth inhibitory effects of cGMP analogs (25Suhasini M. Li H. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6983-6994Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). [3H]Thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) was added during the last 6 h of incubation. Cell growth assay was performed using the Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega). Human mHSC were seeded in 96-well plates at low density (5000/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 5/5, allowed to attach overnight, and made quiescent by a 48 h incubation in serum-free medium. Incubation was performed in Waymouth medium containing 80 μm ZnCl2 and either 5% human serum or 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB, in the absence or presence of 100 nm CNP, which was added every day for 3 days. The medium was then removed for phosphate-buffered saline, Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution reagent was added to each well, and absorbance was recorded at 490 nm. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (13Gallois C. Habib A. Tao J. Moulin S. Maclouf J. Mallat A. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23183-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Confluent mHSC were made quiescent by a 3-day incubation in serum-free Waymouth medium and were further incubated for various periods of time with the indicated effectors. After a wash in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in whole cell extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants (whole cell extract) were stored at −80 °C until use. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (13Gallois C. Habib A. Tao J. Moulin S. Maclouf J. Mallat A. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23183-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Confluent quiescent mHSC were incubated for various periods of time with the indicated effectors. Cells were then washed two times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 400 μl of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mmMgCl2,10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, after which 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. The tubes were shaken gently, centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were used as cytoplasmic extracts. The pellet nuclei were resuspended in 40 μl of Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mmMgCl2, 450 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). After 30 min at 4 °C under constant agitation, nuclear debris were centrifuged at 20000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants (nuclear extract) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Equal amounts of extracts (40 μg) were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% skim milk. Detection of IkB-α and phospho-p38 MAP kinase was performed after incubation for 2 h with their respective antibodies diluted 1:1000. Immunodetected proteins were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal loading of proteins in each lane was checked by Ponceau red staining of the membrane. Confluent quiescent mHSC were stimulated with the indicated effectors, and whole cell lysates were obtained as described above. ERK activity was assayed in situ, as described previously (11Mallat A. Fouassier L. Préaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Rosenbaum J. Dhumeaux D. Jouneaux C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), following electrophoresis of equal amounts of cell lysates (40 μg of proteins) on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel co-polymerized with 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein. JNK was assayed in vitro by the phosphorylation of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun (1–79) fusion protein, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel, as described previously (12Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C. Maclouf J. Iourgenko V. Fouassier L. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). ERK and JNK activity were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was analyzed by Western blotting, using an antiserum specific to phospho-p38 MAP kinase. AP-1 double-stranded consensus oligomer (5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′; 3′-GCG AAC TAC TCA GTC GGC CTT-5′, Promega) and an oligomer (Promega) corresponding to the consensus sequence of NF-kB from the k light chain enhancer were radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by filtration though a G50 Fine column. Nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) were incubated in the binding reaction medium (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF) for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by a 15-min incubation at room temperature with 0.5 ng of the32P-labeled probe. The DNA-protein complexes were analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 X Tris Borate EDTA electrophoresis buffer. Gels were run at 150 V for 90 min, dried, autoradiographed, and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Human mHSC were plated at a density of 15,000 cells/ml in 35-mm dishes, the bottoms of which were replaced by glass coverslips, and allowed to attach in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 5/5 for 24 h. Cells were made quiescent in serum-free Waymouth medium for 24 h and washed in 121 mm NaCl, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mmKCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose (Buffer A) containing 1.8% bovine serum albumin. mHSC were then loaded for 30 min at 25 °C with 1 μm Fura-2/AM in 2 ml of Buffer A containing 1.8% bovine serum albumin (Buffer B) to improve Fura-2 dispersion and facilitate cell loading. Unincorporated Fura-2/AM was eliminated by two washes in Buffer A containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin, and cells were allowed to incubate in the same buffer for 10 min at 25 °C to facilitate hydrolysis of intracellular Fura-2/AM. Ca2+ imaging was performed as described previously (26Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12437-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, Fura-2-loaded mHSC were placed on the stage of a Nikon diaphot inverted microscope with epifluorescence. Light from a 100-W xenon lamp was filtered alternately through 360- and 380-nm filters to determine the ratio of fluorescence F360/F380. Fura-2 fluorescence (Nikon UV-fluor × 40 objective) was filtered at 510 nm and recorded by an intensified charged-coupled device Photonic Science camera (27Sauvadet A. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Each fluorescence image was the average of two images, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and one average image was recorded every 3 s. All tracings of fluorescence ratio (F360/F380) are representative of at least 10 cells, and were performed on at least three different cell preparations. Imaging studies were performed on cells in which no spontaneous rise in Ca2+ was observed prior to experimental manipulation. For experiments performed in absence of extracellular Ca2+, 1 mm EGTA was added to Ca2+-free Buffer B (Buffer C). Cell areas and cell lengths were determined from the 360 nm fluorescence images recorded to measure the F360/F380 ratios of Fura-2-loaded human mHSC, using the Morphostar II software developed by IMSTAR Co. (Paris, France), as described previously (26Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12437-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All tracings of cell areas are representative of at least 10 cells and were performed on at least three different cell isolations. For patch-clamp experiments, cells were plated on 15-mm coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well and allowed to attach in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 5/5 for 24 h. Cells were made quiescent in serum-free Waymouth medium for 24 h and the coverslip was mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope. The whole-cell configuration was used to record calcium currents (ICa) with a protocol consisting in a pulse to 0 mV (400-ms duration) preceded by a short pulse of −50 mV (50-ms duration) elicited every 8 s from a holding potential of −100 mV. Time-dependent ICa values were measured as described (28Mery P.F. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Fischmeister R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1197-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The cells were voltage-clamped using a patch-clamp amplifier (Biologic, Grenoble, France), and analyzed as described previously (28Mery P.F. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Fischmeister R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n experiments and were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Identification of the natriuretic peptide receptor subtypes present in human myofibroblastic HSC was performed by RT-PCR analysis. The mRNA was amplified with specific primers complementary either to the human NPR-A or to the NPR-B or NPR-C DNA sequences, and the PCR product was size-fractionated and blotted. The membrane was hybridized with a labeled oligonucleotide complementary to the respective NPR sequences within the cDNA flanked by the PCR primers. A band of 767 bp corresponding to the size of the NPR-B product was identified in human myofibroblastic HSC (Fig.1 A). In contrast, mHSC did not expressed the expected 693-bp product or a 379-bp product corresponding to NPR-A or NPR-C, whereas these amplification products were present in human kidney taken as control (Fig. 1 A). The functionality of NPR-B in myofibroblastic HSC was assessed in binding experiments. Competition experiments indicated that CNP was more potent than ANP in inhibiting [125I]CNP binding, with IC50values of 20 and 800 pm, respectively (Fig. 1 B). This order of potency and these IC50 values are in agreement with those described for NPR-B (3Koller K.J. Lowe D.G. Bennett G.L. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Goeddel D.V.

This accounts for the unique capability of insulin (and possibly insulin-like growth factor-1), but not other growth factors, to stimulate glucose uptake and anabolic metabolism in heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. This selectivity is faithfully recapitulated in the cultured adipocyte line, 3T3-L1, which responds to insulin, but not platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), with increased hexose uptake. The serine/threonine protein kinases Akt1 and Akt2, which have been implicated as mediators of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, as well as glycogen, lipid, and protein synthesis, were shown to mirror this selectivity in this tissue culture system. This was particularly apparent in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing an epitope-tagged form of Akt2 in which insulin activated Akt2 10-fold better than PDGF. Similarly, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, only insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt's endogenous substrate, GSK-3β. Other signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, pp70 S6-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and PHAS-1/4EBP-1, did not demonstrate this selective responsiveness to insulin but were instead activated comparably by both insulin and PDGF. Moreover, concurrent treatment with PDGF and insulin did not diminish activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, or glucose transport, indicating that PDGF did not simultaneously activate an inhibitory mechanism. Interestingly, PDGF and insulin comparably stimulated both Akt isoforms, as well as numerous other signaling molecules, in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.

In these differentiated cells, as well as rat and human adipocytes, insulin accelerates glucose entry by effecting the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)1 from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane (1Birnbaum M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 239-297Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Subsequently, insulin stimulates metabolic pathways to promote storage of the incoming glucose as glycogen or triglyceride. In this capacity, insulin stands apart from other growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which activate remarkably similar signaling cascades yet are incapable of eliciting these metabolic events (2Ricort J.M.

Both insulin and PDGF activate their respective tyrosine kinase receptors to phosphorylate key residues on a “docking protein” or the receptor, respectively, which recruits multiple adaptor proteins. Recruited proteins include the GDP exchange factor Son of Sevenless, or SOS, which activates the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, or the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase, which stimulates signaling pathways ultimately leading to pp70 S6-kinase (10Cheatham B.

We were particularly interested in Akt2, primarily because of two recent reports suggesting a role for this particular isoform in GLUT4 translocation (22Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol.

The relative effectiveness of PDGF and insulin at activating different Akt isoforms in 3T3-L1 adipocytes has been unclear. Two laboratories (24Staubs P.A. Nelson J.G. Reichart D.R. Olefsky J.M. J.

Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). None of these studies distinguished between the relative sensitivity of different Akt isoforms. In the work presented below, we demonstrate that both Akt isoforms are selectively responsive to insulin, and not PDGF, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. PDGF still activated numerous other signaling molecules, including PI3-kinase, pp70 S6-kinase, 4EBP1/PHAS-1, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, effectively in this tissue. PDGF was also a potent stimulator of both forms of Akt in the precursor 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, suggesting that 3T3-L1 differentiation specifically suppresses this signaling pathway. These experiments suggest a mechanism by which redundant signaling pathways functional in precursor cells can be altered to serve specific regulatory functions in differentiated tissues. Polyclonal sheep anti-GLUT4 antibodies were raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encoding the last 31 amino acids of the GLUT4 carboxyl terminus (glutathione S-transferase-ISATFRRTPSLLEQEVKPSTELEYLGPDEND). Polyclonal rabbit anti-Akt antibodies were raised against the carboxyl-terminal sequences CHFPQFSYSASGTA in Akt1 and CDQTHFPQFSYSASIRE in Akt2. Polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-S6 antibodies were raised against the major phosphorylation site in the ribosomal S6 subunit (CRRLpSpSPLRApSTSKpSEEpSQK; where pS represents phosphoserine). Anti-phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase, phospho-Akt, and phospho-GSK antibodies were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkintown, MA), respectively. Phospho-Akt antibodies were directed against the Ser473 or Thr308 phosphorylation sites, while those against phospho-GSK recognize the Ser9phosphorylation site. Monoclonal mouse anti-GSK-3β antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Agarose-bound anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-hemagglutinin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-pp70 S6-kinase antibodies and glutathione S-transferase S6 peptide substrate were generously donated by Margaret Chou (University of Pennsylvania). Anti-PHAS-1 antibodies were kindly provided by John Lawrence (University of Virginia). Wortmannin was purchased from Sigma, and porcine insulin was a gift from Lilly. PDGF-BB was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated into adipocytes 2 days postconfluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μg/ml dexamethasone, and 112 μg/ml isobutylmethylxanthine. After 3 days, cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to analysis, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved as described in the figure legends. Cells were subsequently stimulated with either 100 nm insulin or 50 ng/ml PDGF. The mouse Akt1 and human Akt2 constructs were generously provided by Phillip Tsichlis and Joseph Testa, respectively, of the Fox Chase Cancer Center (Philadelphia, PA). The HA-tagged Akt2 construct was generated by PCR using the cDNA encoding Akt2 as a template and the primers 5′-GCC ATC CGA AAG CTT GCT GCC ACC ATG TAC CCT TAT GAT GTG CCA GAT TAT GCC AAT GAG GTG TCT GTC ATC-3′ (forward) to generate a hemagglutinin epitope tag at the N terminus of the protein and Hin dIII restriction site and 5′-ACA TAA TGC AGA TCT TCA CTC GCG GAT GCT GGC CGA GTA-3′ (reverse) to create a Bgl II site. Akt1, Akt2, and the newly generated HA-Akt2 were then cloned into the murine retroviral vector pLNCX1, which bears a neomycin resistance gene to allow for selection of infected cells. All constructs were sequenced, and no errors were found. The constructs were packaged into replication-incompetent retrovirus following CaPO4transfection into ecotropic Phoenix cells. Supernatants containing the retrovirus encoding HA-Akt2 were used to infect 3T3-L1 fibroblasts using the method of Hudson et al. (1992). Cells infected with the retrovirus were selected with 800 μg/ml G418 (active concentration), and colonies of G418-resistant cells were pooled. Methods for measuring glucose uptake rates and plasma membrane GLUT4 levels (using the plasma membrane “sheet” assay) have been described (21Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Western blots of total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed as described previously (27Summers S.A. Lipfert L. Birnbaum M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Akt kinase assays were conducted as described previously (27Summers S.A. Lipfert L. Birnbaum M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) except that Akt kinase assays were conducted for only 15 min. Phospho-Akt and phospho-GSK antibodies were used at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were immunoprecipitated by solubilizing cells as described for Akt kinase assays and incubating with 20 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Following a 1–3-h incubation at 4 °C, agarose was washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer without protease inhibitors and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. GSK was immunoprecipitated identically with the exception that monoclonal anti-GSK antibodies were coupled to agarose-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. PI3-kinase assays were performed using methods previously described (28Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). For pp70 S6-kinase assays, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (7 mm K2HPO4, 3 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and inhibitors 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.3), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cleared lysates (∼1 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with anti-pp70 antibody (1.5–2 h, 4 °C) followed by the addition of activated staphylococcus (1 h, 4 °C). Immune complexes were washed once with each of the following buffers: buffer A (10 mmTris, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate with inhibitors, pH 7.2), high salt buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with inhibitors, pH 7.2), and ST buffer (100 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl with inhibitors, pH 7.2). Kinase reactions were performed by adding 30 μl of kinase mixture to each immune complex (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, 50 μm ATP, 0.03 μg of protein kinase inhibitor, 1–2 μg of glutathione S-transferase S6 peptide substrate, and 10 μCi of [32P-γ]ATP) and incubating each sample 10 min in a 30 °C water bath. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% gel), and32P incorporation was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). mRNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 cells before and after differentiation using the MicroPoly(A) Pure™ mRNA isolation kit from Ambion. Approximately 50 ng of mRNA was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 48 °C by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase for first strand cDNA synthesis primed by the antisense primer (5′-CTGGCTGAGTAGGAGAACTGGGG-3′) after a brief denaturation of the template and primer for 2 min at 94 °C.Tfl DNA polymerase was used for second strand synthesis and PCR, primed by the antisense primer and the sense primer (5′-CCTGCCCTTCTACAACCAGGACC-3′). Amplification resulted from 40 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension for 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C, respectively. The sense primer corresponds to Akt1 nucleotides 1038–1060 or Akt2 nucleotides 1041–1063. Antisense primer corresponds to Akt1 nucleotides 1408–1430 or Akt2 nucleotides 1411–1433. RT-PCR reagents and protocols are derived from the ACCESS RT-PCR System (Promega). Other RT-PCR systems (Perkin-Elmer) produced the same results. The RT-PCR products were purified by using the QIAquick™ PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and digested overnight with excess units of Bst EII (New England Biolabs) at 60 °C. The digested RT-PCR products were resolved by 1.4% agarose, 1× TBE gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Control for completion of digestion was confirmed by digesting PCR product using cloned mouse Akt1 cDNA. Several groups have found that PDGF is incapable of activating glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (5Huppertz C. Schwartz C. Becker W. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Joost H.-G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3442-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there are two reports in which PDGF does stimulate glucose uptake in wild-type 3T3-L1 adipocytes (29Kamohara S. Hayashi H. Todaka M. Kanai F. Ishii K. Imanaka T. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Ebina Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or rat adipocytes overexpressing PDGF receptors (30Quon M.J. Chen H. Lin C.H. Zhou L. Ing B.L. Zarnowski M.J. Klinghoffer R. Kazlauskas A. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine whether PDGF is capable of activating glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes used in our laboratory, we assayed these events after a 10-min treatment with either insulin (100 nm) or PDGF (50 ng/ml). Insulin, but not PDGF, stimulated both the uptake of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (Fig.1 A) and the appearance of cell surface GLUT4 (Fig. 1 B). In light of the similarities among the known signaling mechanisms for either agonist, one explanation for this difference was that PDGF additionally activated “inhibitory mechanisms” that prevented its enhancement of certain metabolic events. While previous studies have demonstrated the existence of inhibitory “cross-talk” between insulin and PDGF pathways when PDGF is added prior to insulin (24Staubs P.A. Nelson J.G. Reichart D.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25139-25147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19814-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), simultaneous addition of the peptides had not been investigated in detail. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, concomitant addition of insulin and PDGF resulted in stimulation of glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation equivalent to insulin alone. Despite PDGF's inability to activate these metabolic responses, PDGF does signal other events as effectively as insulin in this cell type. In both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes, insulin stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin and/or IGF-1 receptors, while PDGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor (Fig.1 C, upper panel). Moreover, in both cell types, insulin and PDGF stimulated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (Fig. 1 C, lower panel). Since PI3-kinase is critical for activation of anabolic metabolism, as well as signaling molecules such as Akt and pp70 S6-kinase (10Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18528-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), its activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was measured. Insulin and PDGF treatment, respectively, stimulated PI3-kinase 100-fold over basal level, and the precipitated activity roughly doubled when both agonists were added simultaneously (Fig.1 D). These results are consistent with prior reports that PDGF receptors mediate activation of PI3-kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but this is not sufficient for activation of glucose transport (7Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3442-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As described above, prior studies have been contradictory regarding whether Akt is activated by PDGF in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Two reports have shown that insulin is significantly more potent than PDGF in increasing Akt phosphorylation by using phosphospecific antisera directed against the regulatory Ser473 site on Akt1. In contrast, Tanti et al. (26Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that PDGF is quite effective at stimulating Akt activity as measured in the immune complex, achieving a level of activation that is at least 50% that induced by insulin. In addition to being contradictory, these prior studies have not distinguished between activation of each isoform. To resolve these apparent discrepancies, we used four different approaches to evaluate the regulation of Akt isoforms 1 and 2 by insulin and PDGF in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes. First, we used anti-phospho-Ser473 antisera, which, as shown below, specifically recognizes phosphorylated Akt1, but not Akt2, and anti-phospho-Thr308 antisera, which recognizes both Akt1 and Akt2 isoforms. Second, we produced an antibody specific for Akt2 that could detect both an agonist-induced mobility shift when the proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and could immunoprecipitate endogenous Akt2 kinase activity from intact cells. Third, we expressed an epitope-tagged form of Akt2 in 3T3-L1 cells and then measured the shift and kinase activity of this construct using antibodies against the HA epitope. And fourth, we measured the degree of phosphorylation of the Akt substrate GSK-3β in vivo, which serves as a marker of endogenous Akt kinase activity in the intact cell. To characterize the isoform preference for the phosphospecific antibody directed against the regulatory Ser473 phosphorylation site, Akt1 and Akt2 isoforms were expressed in 3T3-L1 cells. Using an antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of Akt1 but that actually recognizes both isoforms, we demonstrated that these proteins were overexpressed severalfold and that Akt2 migrated slightly faster than Akt1 when resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig.2 A). Electrophoresis conditions were not optimized in this experiment to detect an agonist-induced mobility shift, which is generally less pronounced using this antibody as compared with the Akt2-specific antibody described below. When the phospho-Ser473 antibody was used to investigate Akt phosphorylation in these lysates, it detected phosphorylated Akt in Akt1-expressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were stimulated by insulin but not PDGF (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). However, as seen in longer exposures (Fig. 2 B, lower panel), the antibody only detected endogenous Akt and not the overexpressed construct in cells stably expressing Akt2. Prolonged exposure of the blots also indicated that overexpressed Akt1 was recognized by the anti-phospho-Ser473 antibody to some degree under basal conditions, but this was augmented only by insulin and not PDGF. Faint reactivity with the phosphospecific Akt antibody was sometimes observed in the PDGF-stimulated adipocyte lysates, but it was always markedly less than that seen in response to insulin. Collectively, these results indicate that the anti-phospho-Ser473 antibody is specific for the Akt1 isoform and that insulin stimulates Akt1 phosphorylation much more potently than does PDGF in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To investigate whether PDGF affected Akt1 in the adipocyte precursor cells, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, we again investigated PDGF's ability to increase phosphorylation of Akt1 using the phospho-Ser473-specific antibody. As demonstrated in Fig.3, PDGF stimulated Ser473phosphorylation comparably with insulin in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. Insulin was used at a concentration of 1 μm, and under these conditions it is likely to be binding to IGF-1 receptors. Akt1 is also phosphorylated on a second regulatory site, Thr308. Using a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes this second regulatory site (as well as the analogous Thr309 site in Akt2), we found that this residue was phosphorylated in response to both insulin and PDGF in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts but was selectively responsive to insulin in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation of either site was blocked by pretreatment with wortmannin, confirming their PI3-kinase dependence in adipocytes. These studies suggest that differentiation actually suppresses signaling events “downstream” of PI3-kinase, and suggests a more complicated pattern of regulation of Akt1. Because of the isoform specificity of the phospho-Akt antibody, the previously published studies could not address whether the more relevant Akt2 isoform was differentially phosphorylated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. An indication of the importance of investigating Akt2 is its altered expression during the course of 3T3-L1 differentiation. This was demonstrated using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR assay. An oligonucleotide primer pair identical in both isoforms was used for RT-PCR amplification. The regions amplified between the two primers in Akt1 and Akt2 were identical in size and highly similar in sequence; thus, the PCR amplification of both isoforms should occur with virtually the same efficiency in a single reaction mixture. After the RT-PCR, the product was subjected to a restriction digest at a site present in Akt1, but not Akt2, and the products were resolved by gel electrophoresis to determine which isoform amplification was greater relative to the other. Comparison between 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed a marked increase in the level of the undigested versus digested fragment of the PCR product, indicating an increase in the ratio of Akt2 mRNA relative to Akt1 mRNA upon differentiation (Fig. 4). Altomare et al. (33Altomare D.A. Lyons G.E. Mistsuuchi Y. Cheng J.Q. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2407-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) report a similar relationship between Akt1 or Akt2 mRNA levels during the course of 3T3-L1 differentiation using Northern analysis. Due to the likely relevance of Akt2 to metabolic signaling, we conducted an exhaustive series of experiments to detect whether Akt2 was also differentially stimulated by insulin, and not PDGF, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. An Akt2-specific antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain was produced. This antibody preferentially recognized the overexpressed Akt2, but not Akt1 (Fig.5"

PDGF A-chain levels increase in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) exposed to ATII. The molecular mechanisms underlying this induction are not known. We used transient transfection analysis to show that ATII can increase reporter gene activity driven by fragments of the PDGF-A promoter bearing recognition elements for the transcription factor, Egr-1. Nuclear run-off experiments indicate that ATII induces Egr-1 expression at the level of transcription. Gel shift and supershift studies show that Egr-1 protein accumulates in the nuclei of SMCs exposed to ATII and binds to the proximal region of the PDGF-A promoter in a specific, time-dependent manner. ATII induced extracellular-signal regulated kinase (p42/44 ERK) activity as did phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, suppressed both PDGF-A and Egr-1 endogenous and promoter-dependent expression inducible by ATII. The ATII type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist, Losartan, inhibited ATII-induction of p42/44 ERK, as well as Egr-1 and PDGF-A, whereas neither PD123319, an AT2 receptor antagonist, nor wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, had any effect. ATII-induction of Egr-1 and PDGF-A was blocked by SIN-1, a NO donor. In addition, this pathway was blocked by overexpression of NO synthase.

ATII is produced in the vessel wall by the actions of renin, which converts angiotensinogen to ATI, which is then cleaved to ATII by angiotensin-converting enzyme. Two ATII receptor subtypes have been described, AT1 and AT2. Signal transduction through G-protein-coupled AT1 receptors involves phospholipase C, phospholipase A2, phospholipase D, adenylate cyclase, and the release of intracellular calcium (reviewed in Refs. 15Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar and 16Dzau V.J. Mukoyama M. Pratt R.E. J. Hypertens. 1994; 12: S1-S5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

AT2 receptor signaling is less well understood, but evidence suggests that this receptor is involved in growth inhibition (18Goto M. Mukoyama M. Suga S. Matsumoto T. Nakagawa M. Ishibashi R.

Platelets. 1993; 4: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is a potent mitogen and chemoattractant for mesenchymal cells in culture and a vasoconstrictor with activity comparable to that of ATII (24Berk B.C. Alexander R.W. Brock T.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Webb R.C. Science. 1986; 232: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Expression of the PDGF-A gene, which resides on human chromosome 7p21-p22 and spans approximately 24 kilobase pairs (25Bonthron D.T. Morton C.C. Orkin S.H. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), in cultured endothelial cells and SMCs exposed to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (27Khachigian L.M.

This involves the displacement of Sp1, which is required for basal expression of the gene, by Egr-1 from overlapping binding sites in the proximal promoter. Several groups have demonstrated that ATII can increase PDGF-A mRNA expression in SMCs (29Naftilan A.J. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have shown that PDGF-A mRNA and protein expression after arterial balloon injury is blocked by perindropril inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Presently, however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying ATII induction of PDGF-A are not known.Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator, along with prostacyclin, produced by vascular endothelium. NO regulates blood pressure and regional blood flow through its paracrine action on neighboring SMCs. NO activates guanylate cyclase and inhibits a large number of biological processes, such as SMC proliferation and migration, adhesion molecule expression, leukocyte adhesion, and platelet aggregation (reviewed in Refs. 35Taddei S. Virdis A. Ghiadoni L. Salvetti A. Curr. Op. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Ruschitzka F.T. Noll G. Luscher T.F.

NO is produced from l-arginine via the metabolic activity of constitutive endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). It is also produced in cultured SMCs exposed to extracellular stimuli (38Papadaki M. Tilton R.G. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H616-H626PubMed Google Scholar). SMCs exposed to lipopolysaccharide, alone or in combination with interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, or forskolin increase expression of inducible NO synthase (39Koide M.

Interestingly, interleukin-1β stimulation of inducible NOS mRNA and protein is suppressed by ATII (41Nakayama I. Kawahara Y. Tsuda T. Okuda M. Yokoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11628-11633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The opposing effects of NO and ATII/PDGF-A in the regulation of vascular tone indicate that these vasoactive substances may be important determinants in pathologic settings such as atherosclerosis, restenosis, and hypertension.In this paper, we show that ATII-induced PDGF-A expression is mediated by the activation and specific interaction of Egr-1 with the PDGF-A promoter. ATII induces Egr-1 expression at the level of transcription and stimulates reporter gene expression driven by both Egr-1 and PDGF-A promoters as well as the endogenous genes, in a MEK-dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrate that ATII induction of Egr-1 and PDGF-A in SMCs is mediated through the AT1 but not AT2 receptor and that this pathway is modulated by NO.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we demonstrate that ATII-inducible PDGF-A expression in vascular SMCs is regulated through the AT1, but not AT2 receptor, and requires the activation of p42/44 ERK and promoter interaction by Egr-1. Transient transfection analysis determined that ATII increased reporter gene expression driven by segments of the PDGF-A promoter bearing recognition elements for Egr-1. Gel shift and supershift studies demonstrated that Egr-1 protein accumulates in the nuclei of SMCs exposed to ATII and binds to the proximal region of the PDGF-A promoter in a specific, time-dependent manner. ATII activated p42/44 ERK phosphorylation with magnitude comparable to PMA. PD98059, but not wortmannin, blocked ATII-inducible PDGF-A- and Egr-1-promoter-dependent expression and inhibited endogenous expression of both genes. Losartan inhibited ATII-inducible p42/44 ERK activity, Egr-1, and PDGF-A expression. ATII signaling was blocked by SIN-1 and overexpression of eNOS and, conversely, was augmented by l-NAME.This study demonstrates for the first time that ATII induction of PDGF-A is mediated by MEK/ERK activation and transactivation by Egr-1 in vascular SMCs. The MEK/ERK pathway also mediates phosphorylation of certain other transcriptional activators and even the AT1 receptor itself. For example, MEK inhibitors block ATII-induced serine phosphorylation of Stat3 in rat fibroblasts (60Bhat G.J. Baker K.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 170: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), as well as phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of AT1 receptors in rat brain neurons (61Yang H. Lu D. Raizada M.K. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 62Yang H. Lu D. Vinson G.P. Raizada M.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1660-1669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although ATII also activates JNK, possibly via p21-activated kinase in rat vascular SMCs (63Schmitz U. Ishida T. Ishida M. Surapisitchat J. Hasham M.I. Pelech S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), wortmannin, which inhibits JNK activity (64Ishizuka T. Oshiba A. Sakata N. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12762-12766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), had no attenuating effect on ATII induction of Egr-1 or PDGF-A. Specific events mediating ATII induction of Egr-1/PDGF-A upstream of MEK are not precisely known. Recent studies in vascular SMCs (65Ishida M. Ishida T. Thomas S.M. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and cardiac myocytes (66Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Aikawa R. Kudoh S. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33592-33597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) indicate, however, that the non-receptor kinase, c-Src, is required for ATII activation of p42/44 ERK. c-Src is involved in the activation of p21ras, an upstream activator of MEK, in SMCs exposed to ATII (67Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Chai Q. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10329-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). p42/44 ERK activation by ATII also involves protein kinase C-ζ (68Liao D.F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) which also lies upstream of MEK (69Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Frutos S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar).The availability of benzylimidazole-based pharmacologic inhibitors that selectively block AT1 or AT2 receptor activity prompted us to delineate the receptor subtype that mediates ATII induction of Egr-1 and PDGF-A. Inhibitors such as these have been used by other groups to shed light on pathways utilized by ATII in vivo. For example, ATII-induced vascular wall hypertrophy in rats is blocked by both Losartan and PD123319 (72Sabri A. Levy B.I. Poitevan P. Caputo L. Faggin E. Marotte F. Rappaport L. Samuel J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but while Losartan restored normal arterial pressure, PD123319 had no effect (72Sabri A. Levy B.I.

Our demonstration that ATII induction of p42/44 ERK activity, Egr-1, and PDGF-A expression is mediated through the AT1 receptor is supported by observations in vivo. For example, Kim et al. (73Kim S. Kawamura M. Wanibuchi H. Ohta K. Hamaguchi A. Omura T. Yulimura T. Miura K. Iwao H. Circulation. 1995; 92: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) reported that Egr-1 induction and neointima formation after arterial injury is blocked by candesartan cilexetil, an antagonist of the AT1 receptor. This group later showed that p42/44 ERK and JNK activation after injury could be suppressed by the AT1 receptor antagonist, E4177 (74Kim S. Izumi Y. Yano M. Hamaguchi A. Miura K. Yamanaka S. Miyazaki H. Iwao H. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Recent investigations in a number of laboratories have revealed that NO plays a crucial antiproliferative role in vascular cells. Rat vascular SMC replication in culture is inhibited by overexpression of eNOS (75Chen L. Daum G. Forough R. Clowes M. Walter U. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 862-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). When eNOS-SMC transfectants were seeded onto the luminal surface of balloon-injured rat carotid arteries, neointima formation was blocked and vascular diameter increased (75Chen L. Daum G. Forough R. Clowes M. Walter U. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 862-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). NO donors also inhibit SMC proliferation in rat arteries following balloon angioplasty (76Seki J. Nishio M. Kato Y. Motoyama Y. Yoshida K. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 117: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, adenoviral gene transfer of eNOS in injured rat arteries inhibits neointima formation (77Janssens S. Flaherty D. Nong Z. Varenne O. van Pelt N. Haustermans C. Zoldelyi P. Gerard R. Collen D. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1274-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Balloon injury of pig coronary arteries results in decreased constitutive NOS activity (78Myers P.R. Webel R.

Our demonstration that NO blocks ATII-inducible, Egr-1-dependent PDGF-A expression is consistent with the capacity of NO to inhibit activation of transcription factors and their dependent pathophysiologically relevant genes. NO inhibition of vasoconstrictor expression supports the antiatherogenic and antihypertensive properties of this endogenous mediator of homeostasis.

It has been suggested that the cleavage of Bid unmasks the pro-apoptotic potential of Bid by removing the inhibitory N terminus and allowing the C-terminal BH3 domain to interact with receptors on the mitochondria (19Li H.

However, the molecular basis of this autoinhibitory function conferred by the N-terminal region is currently undefined. Here we report the identification of a novel BH3-like domain in the N-terminal region of Bid that is necessary for mediating interaction between the N and C termini of Bid. Furthermore, interaction through the novel BH3-like domain appears to be important for regulating the apoptotic activity of Bid. We propose that the pro-apoptotic potential of Bid is negatively regulated by an autoinhibitory mechanism involving intramolecular interaction.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo investigate the nature of the inhibitory activity conferred by the N-terminal region of Bid, we examined the amino acid sequence of Bid for clues. Interestingly, a stretch of nine amino acids (acids 35–43) highly similar to the core motif of the BH3 domain was identified within the tn-Bid fragment (Fig.1 A). The putative BH3-like motif, referred to as BH3-B, from both mouse and human, was aligned against several established BH3 domains, including the BH3 domain present in tc-Bid (Fig. 1 B). With the exception of the conserved aspartic acid residue, the putative BH3-like motif aligned well with established BH3 domains.Because the BH3 domain is known to function as a protein-protein interaction domain, we tested the ability of the N-terminal region of Bid that contains the novel BH3-like motif to interact with the C-terminal region. GST - tn-Bid was found to associate selectively with in vitro translated tc-Bid , but not Bcl-XL, or Bax (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, tn-Bid failed to associate with in vitro translated full-length Bid (Fig. 2 A), raising the possibility that the region of Bid required for interaction with tn-Bid was masked. The association of tn-Bid with tc-Bid was also demonstrated in vivo in mammalian cells. In transient co-transfection analysis in 293T cells, tn-Bid was readily co-immunoprecipitated with tc-Bid, but not with Bid, Bax, or itself (Fig.2 B). Similar results were obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system, in which tn-Bid was found to strongly interact with tc-Bid, but not Bcl-XL or Bax (Fig.2 C). The strength of tn-Bid/tc-Bid interaction detected in the yeast two-hybrid system was found to be similar to the interaction between Bcl-XL and BimL (Fig.2 C).Figure 2tn-Bid interacts with tc-Bid in vitro and in vivo. A, in vitro binding. Equal amount of GST-tn-Bid fusion proteins were incubated with indicated 35S-labeled proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The same gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to demonstrate the equivalency of the amount of GST-fusion proteins used in each experiment (bottom panel).B, in vivo binding in mammalian cells. Cell lysates from 293T cells transiently expressing the indicated N-terminal HA- and Myc-tagged proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the polyclonal HA-antibody (Y11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Substitution of the Gly94 with Glu (G94E) in Bid (11Wang K. Yin X-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) or tc-Bid was found to be sufficient to abolish interaction of these molecules with Bcl-XL (data not shown). The G94E-tc-Bid (tc-Bid.m1) failed to bind tn-Bid in the yeast two-hybrid and GST-pulldown assays (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting Gly94 in the BH3 domain of tc-Bid is essential for interaction with both tn-Bid and Bcl-XL. Substitution or deletion of several conserved amino acids simultaneously at the core motif of the BH3 domain was found to be effective in abolishing its dimerization function (25Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 28Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Mutating the BH3 domain of tc-Bid by substituting all three amino acid residues at the core region, Gly94-Asp-Glu/Val-Leu-Ala (tc-Bid.m3), diminished the binding of tc-Bid to tn-Bid (Fig. 3, B and C). These data demonstrate the importance of the BH3 domain of tc-Bid in mediating interaction with tn-Bid.Figure 3Mutational analyses of the BH3 and BH3-B domains of mBid.

However, in the BH3-B domain of both human and mouse Bid, the corresponding position is occupied by positively charged amino acids, histidine and arginine, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Mutations of the positively charged arginine to the negatively charged aspartic acid, R40D (tn-Bid.m6) or glutamic acid, R40E (tn-Bid.m7), in tn-Bid had no effect on the strength of interaction between these mutants and tc-Bid (Fig. 3, B and D). Similarly, a mutation of the negatively charged conserved aspartic acid in the BH3 domain of tc-Bid to the positively charged histidine, the D95H (tc-Bid.m2), also failed to weaken the binding of tc-Bid to tn-Bid (Fig. 3, B and C). It seems that the charged amino acid at the position of the conserved aspartic acid has no significant role in tn-Bid/tc-Bid interaction. The functional significance of the conserved aspartate residue of BH3 domains in pro-apoptotic molecules for mediating interaction with Bcl-XL has also not been totally resolved. While NMR studies examining the BH3 domain-containing peptides of Bak documented the importance of the conserved aspartic acid for mediating interaction with Bcl-XL (5Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar), yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analyses examining the role of individual amino acid residues in the BH3 domain of Bax failed to demonstrate a requirement of the conserved aspartate residue for heterodimerization with Bcl-XL (25Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 26Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Merino R. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22764-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is possible that the conserved aspartate residue does not have the same role in all BH3 domain-containing pro-apoptotic molecules. In contrast to the G94E mutation of the BH3 domain in tc-Bid, substitution of the conserved glycine to glutamic acid, G39E, in the BH3-B domain of tn-Bid (tn-Bid.m5) had no effect on the binding of tn-Bid to tc-Bid (Fig. 3, B and D), suggesting that the conserved glycine in the BH3-B domain of tn-Bid is not required for interaction with tc-Bid. Substitution of the conserved Leu151 of the BH3 domain to Ala in Bad is sufficient to abrogate association with Bcl-XL (27Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24101-24104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Substitution of the corresponding conserved Leu35 in tn-Bid to Ala, L35A (tn-Bid.m4), dramatically reduced its ability to associate with tc-Bid (Fig. 3, B and D). While the G39E and the R40D mutations of tn-Bid did not affect the binding of tn-Bid to tc-Bid, substitution of all three amino acids residues constituting the core region of BH3 domain, G39RE to VLA in tn-Bid (tn-Bid.m8), severely diminished its ability to bind tc-Bid (Fig. 3, B and D). These results demonstrate that the various conserved amino acid residues of the novel BH3-like domain (BH3-B) are critical in mediating interaction between the tn-Bid and tc-Bid.tn-Bid associates with tc-Bid, but not full-length Bid, suggesting that intramolecular interaction in Bid may be responsible for preventing it from interacting with tn-Bid. If this is true, mutations such as L35A and G39RE/VLA in tn-Bid that disrupt interaction of tn-Bid with tc-Bid are likely to have a similar effect in Bid, resulting in disruption of the intramolecular interaction of Bid and allow the structurally exposed C terminus to interact with tn-Bid. To test this hypothesis, we introduced L35A and G39RE/VLA mutations into the BH3-B domain of full-length Bid and tested the ability of these mutants to interact with GST-tn-Bid. As shown in Fig.4 A, the L35A and G39RE/VLA Bid mutants, but not the G39E Bid, R40D Bid, or wild-type Bid, were able to associate with tn-Bid effectively. These data, together with the observation that Bid does not form homodimers (11Wang K. Yin X-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), suggest a model in which the N and C termini of Bid interact intramolecularly.Figure 4The novel BH3-B domain in Bid is required for intramolecular interaction and autoinhibition of pro-apoptotic activity of Bid. A, tn-Bid binds to L35A and G39RE/VLA Bid mutants but not Bid. Full-length Bid and mutants were in vitro translated, 35S-labeled, and incubated with GST-tn-Bid. Coomassie Blue-stained gel demonstrating the equivalency of GST-fusion protein used in each binding experiment is shown (bottom panel). B, mutations in the BH3-B domain of Bid enhance its apoptotic activity to that of tc-Bid. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with 1.5 μg of the indicated expression plasmids and 0.25 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase. Apoptosis assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data (mean ± S.D.) shown are percentage of round blue cells as a function of total number of blue cells counted (about 500–800 cells per sample from five randomly chosen fields). A minimum of three independent experiments were performed for each mutant, and similar results were observed.C, Bcl-XL antagonizes the apoptotic activity of tc-Bid more effectively than tn-Bid. tc-Bid expression plasmid (0.1 μg) was co-transfected with the indicated fold excess (μg) of plasmids. Total plasmids transfected were balanced with empty vector to 2 μg/plate. Apoptosis assay was performed as described in panel B.D, Bcl-XL binds to L35A and Gly39-Arg-Glu/Val-Leu-Ala Bid mutants more efficiently than to wild-type Bid. GST-Bcl-XL was incubated with in vitro translated, 35S-labeled Bid and Bid mutants and subjected to GST-pulldown assay as described in panel A.Bottom panel shows the amount of GST-Bcl-XL used in each binding experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then examined the possibility that the intramolecular interaction of Bid acts as an autoinhibitory mechanism to regulate the pro-apoptotic activity of Bid. In transient apoptosis assay, tn-Bid is totally inactive, whereas tc-Bid is much more potent than Bid in inducing cell death as previously reported (Refs. 19Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar, 20Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar; Fig.4 B). Similar to the wild type Bid, the G39E Bid mutant that failed to bind tn-Bid was also mildly apoptotic (Fig.4 B). However, the apoptotic activities of both the L35A and the G39RE/VLA Bid mutants were substantially elevated to a level similar to the tc-Bid (Fig. 4 B). These observations suggest that the intramolecular interaction between the N and C termini of Bid regulates its apoptotic activity. However, in order for tc-Bid to exert its potent apoptotic effect in vivo, mechanism(s) must exist to prevent the free tn-Bid from interfering with tc-Bid to perform its apoptotic function. Indeed, the apoptotic activity of tc-Bid was not very efficiently blocked by tn-Bid, though it was potently blocked by Bcl-XL overexpression (Fig. 4 C). This is not surprising as one would predict that, once cleaved, the N-terminal region of Bid should not be effective in its ability to interfere with the apoptotic function of tc-Bid.Because binding of tc-Bid to Bcl-XL is widely believed to be a key mechanism by which Bid exerts its apoptotic effect upon cleavage by caspase-8, it would be of value to examine the ability of N-terminal region of Bid in preventing Bid from binding to Bcl-XL. We compared the binding of Bid, tc-Bid, and Bid mutants to Bcl-XL. Interestingly, wild-type Bid and the Bid mutants (Bid.mt5 and Bid.mt6) that were predicted to maintain intramolecular interaction associated very weakly with Bcl-XL, whereas the Bid mutants (Bid.mt4 and Bid.mt8) that were predicted to lose the ability to interact intramolecularly were found to interact as strongly as tc-Bid to Bcl-XL (Fig. 4 D). Similar results were obtained with co-immunoprecipitation experiment in transient co-transfection assay (data not shown). These data lend support to a model in which the N-terminal region serves to regulate the apoptotic activity of Bid by inhibiting the association of the C-terminal domain with Bcl-XL.While the manuscript was in preparation, the solution structure of Bid was reported (29Chou J.J.

Cell. 1999; 96: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Bid contains eight alpha helices arranged in such a way that two central hydrophobic helices are surrounded by six amphipathic helices. Two of the amphipathic helices (H1 and H2) are present in tn-Bid. The BH3-B motif described here (Fig.1 A) forms part of the H2 amphipathic helix (29Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Our study thus further defines the function of the H2 helix by demonstrating its role in mediating direct physical contact with the C terminus. The Bcl-2 family of proteins are important regulators of cell death that can be grouped into subfamilies of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic molecules (1Adams J.M. Cory S.

Members of this family are characterized by the presence of several conserved motifs, known as the Bcl-2 homology (BH1–4) domains. Association of a pro-survival with a pro-apoptotic member, such as Bcl-XL with Bak, requires the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains of Bcl-XL and the BH3 domain of Bak (4Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H.

To further delineate the interactions between the crucial C-terminal methionine of substance P and these two binding sites, we have incorporated newly designed constrained methionines, i.e. (2 S, 3 S)- and (2 S,3 R)-prolinomethionines. The potencies of these C terminus-modified SP analogues to bind both sites and to activate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and cAMP formation have been measured, together with those of their corresponding sulfoxides and sulfones. The molecular nature of these two binding sites and their selective coupling to effector signaling pathways are discussed in the light of current models of receptor activation. The less abundant binding site is coupled to Gq/11 proteins, whereas the most abundant one interacts with Gs proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human neurokinin-1 receptors. The specific orientation of the C-terminal methionine side chain imposed by these constraints shows that macroscopically χ1 and χ2 angles of this crucial C-terminal residue are similar in both binding sites. However, slight but significant variations in the rotation around the Cγ–S bond yield different either stabilizing or destabilizing interactions in the two binding sites.

There is evidence to suggest that seven transmembrane domain receptors can adopt two distinct macrostates, i.e. the inactive R and active R* forms, and a large spectrum of different microstates, i.e. conformational states (1Leff P.

Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 413-463PubMed Google Scholar). This observation has led to the proposal that the so-called active R* form of a receptor may in fact hide multiple conformational states, some of them recruiting specific G proteins via a fruitful interaction (1Leff P. Scaramellini C. Law C. McKechnie K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 355-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2Leff P. Scaramellini C. Trends Pharmacol.

We speculate that if a receptor protein is found in different active three-dimensional structures R*n with regard to its interaction with different G proteins, the crucial residues of its ligand (i.e. the so-called pharmacophore) might adopt different orientations when interacting with the different active R*n forms of this receptor. This working hypothesis does not foresee at all the recognition mechanism between the ligand and its receptor, i.e. the processes that lead to the selection or induction of particular conformations of both the ligand and the receptor.

Chem. 1996; 4: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the minor one is specifically labeled by [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) correlates with IP production (7Sagan S. Beaujouan J.-C. Torrens Y. Saffroy M. Chassaing G. Glowinski J. Lavielle S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), this hNK-1 tachykinin receptor is, however, also coupled to the activation of at least two other pathways, i.e. phospholipase A2 (10Garcia M. Sakamoto K. Shigekawa M. Nakanishi S. Ito S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1735-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and D (11Torrens Y. Beaujouan J.-C. Saffroy M. Glowinski J. Tencé M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2091-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Concerning SP, the ligand of the NK-1 receptor, its Phe7and Phe8 side chains, and both the aliphatic side chain and carboxamide group of its C-terminal Met11 residue are crucial for spasmogenic activity (12Fournier A. Couture R. Magnan J. Gendreau M. Regoli D. St.-Pierre S. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and also for the binding and stimulation of second messengers (13Josien H. Lavielle S. Brunissen A. Saffroy M. Torrens Y.

Therefore, to further delineate the molecular interactions of this C-terminal amino acid with both binding sites of the human NK-1 tachykinin receptor, we have designed constrained analogues of methionine, i.e. 3-prolinomethionines (Fig. 1) (16Karoyan P. Chassaing G. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 85-88Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Karoyan P. Chassaing G. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1997; 8: 2025-2032Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We report herein the binding and activity potencies of a highly homogenous family of SP analogues modified in position 11 with these constrained methionines. cis- and trans- 4-Prolinomethionines (Fig.2) have previously been described and incorporated in position 11 of SP(6–11) (18Rubini E. Laufer R. Gilon C. Frey G. Selinger Z. Chorev M. Shiba T. Sakakibara S. Peptide Chemistry 1987. Protein Research Foundation, Osaka, Japan1988: 553-555Google Scholar). The resulting analogues completely lose NK-1 biological activity (18Rubini E. Laufer R. Gilon C. Frey G. Selinger Z. Chorev M. Shiba T. Sakakibara S. Peptide Chemistry 1987. Protein Research Foundation, Osaka, Japan1988: 553-555Google Scholar), a result which may come from the nonaccurate fixed value of the χ2 angle on the pyrrolidine ring (Fig. 2). In contrast, 3-prolinoamino acids (16Karoyan P. Chassaing G. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 85-88Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Karoyan P. Chassaing G. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1997; 8: 2025-2032Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) combine the proline constraint on the peptide backbone (fixed χ1 angle) with the presence in position 3 (or β) on the pyrrolidine ring of the native amino acid side chain with a flexible χ2 angle (Fig. 2). Chimeric 3-prolinomethionine with χ1 values corresponding to either cis (Z) or trans (E) orientation have been synthesized and incorporated by solid phase synthesis in position 11 of SP, leading to [P3ZMet11]SP and [P3EMet11]SP, respectively. Because the sulfoxides and sulfone analogues of SP and propionyl-SP(7–11) have previously led to striking results (7Sagan S. Beaujouan J.-C. Torrens Y. Saffroy M. Chassaing G. Glowinski J. Lavielle S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the oxidized (sulfoxides and sulfone) derivatives of both [P3ZMet11]SP and [P3EMet11]SP have also been used to investigate the orientation(s) of the methionine side chain in both binding sites in CHO cells transfected with the human tachykinin NK-1 receptor. [11-3H][Pro9]SP (65 Ci/mmol) was synthesized at Commissariat á l'Energie Atomique (Saclay, France) according to Chassaing et al. (19Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Julien S. Marquet A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 623-626Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) (95 Ci/mmol) was synthesized as described (7Sagan S. Beaujouan J.-C. Torrens Y. Saffroy M. Chassaing G. Glowinski J. Lavielle S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All peptides were synthesized in the Laboratoire Structure et Fonction de Molécules Bioactives (Unité Mixte de Recherches 7613, Paris, France) except [Nle11]SP, which was obtained from Bachem (Voisins-le-Bretonneux, France). Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-protected 3-prolinomethionines (16Karoyan P. Chassaing G. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 85-88Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Karoyan P. Chassaing G. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1997; 8: 2025-2032Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) are now commercially available from SENN Chemicals (Gentilly, France). Peptide syntheses were carried out on a 0.1 mmol scale (ABI Model 431A synthesizer), starting from an α-p-methylbenzhydrylamine (MBHA) resin (typical substitution, 0.68 mmols/g of resin). All t-butoxycarbonyl amino acids were assembled using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole as coupling reagents. A 10-fold excess of each amino acid was used except for t-butoxycarbonyl-P3EMet-OH, which was coupled manually to the MBHA-resin in a 1/1 ratio, and the residual free amino acid groups on the MBHA-resin were then acetylated (acetic anhydride/dichloromethane, 1:5). All attempts to couple the cis isomer t-butoxycarbonyl-P3ZMet-OH were unsuccessful. Fmoc-P3ZMet-OH was introduced manually in a 1:1 ratio on the MBHA resin after activation as an acid fluoride (20Carpino L.A. Sadat-Aalaee D. Chao H.G. De Selms R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9651-9652Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 21Bertho J.-N. Loffet A. Pinel C. Reuther F. Sennyey G. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 1303-1306Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The residual free amino groups on the MBHA-resin were then acetylated. After removal of the Fmoc by piperidine/dimethylformamide, 1:9, all the other t-butoxycarbonyl-amino acids were coupled by the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-1-hydroxybenzotriazole strategy on the ABI synthesizer. Peptides were cleaved from the resin by anhydrous fluorohydric acid and purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC. The purity of collected fractions was established by analytical HPLC. The sulfoxides were obtained by oxidation of the corresponding crude peptide (2 equivalent NaIO4 in water, 3 days at 4 °C) and purification by preparative HPLC. NMR analysis establishes the presence (1:1 ratio) of both diastereoisomers. The sulfones were prepared by oxidation of the corresponding crude peptide (3 equivalent H2O2, 30% in water, in glacial acetic acid, room temperature for 15 h). The purity of all peptides was over 98.5%. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight analysis was performed by Dr. G. Bolbach (UMR 7613, Université P. & M. Curie, Paris). The calculated mass (MH+) is 1373.75 for [P3Met11]SP, 1389.89 for [P3Met(O)11]SP, and 1405.84 for [P3Met(O2)11]SP. Each family of peptides (i.e. sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone) has been injected in a single run by analytical HPLC for comparison of the elution time (tR). Analytical HPLC, 5-μm Lichrosorb 10 RP-8 column (Merck) in 0.25 mtriethylammonium phosphate, pH 3.0, and acetonitrile (isocratic mode, 21% acetonitrile) is as follows: [P3EMet11]SP, tR = 13.89 min, MH+(found) = 1373.80; [P3EMet(O)11]SP, tR = 4.36 min, MH+(found) = 1389.89; [P3EMet(O2)11]SP, tR = 5.99 min, MH+(found) = 1405.56; [P3ZMet11]SP, tR = 13.66 min, MH+(found) = 1373.89; [P3ZMet(O)11]SP, tR = 4.60 min, MH+(found) = 1389.74; and [P3ZMet(O2)11]SP, tR = 6.68 min, MH+(found) = 1405.84. CHO cells expressing hNK-1 receptors were cultured in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cultures were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Stable transfections were maintained by geneticin periodic selection. Binding assays were carried out at 22 °C on whole cells in Krebs-Ringer phosphate solution consisting of 120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 15.6 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, containing 0.04% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 0.6% glucose (w/v), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor as described (7Sagan S. Beaujouan J.-C. Torrens Y. Saffroy M. Chassaing G. Glowinski J. Lavielle S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Binding studies were analyzed with the LIGAND program (22Munson P.J. Rodbar D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar). Except when mentioned in the text, PI hydrolysis and cAMP accumulation were determined as described previously (23Sagan S. Chassaing G. Pradier L. Lavielle S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar). Curves were fitted using SIGMA PLOT software (Jandel Scientific, Erkrath, Germany). Eleven SP analogues modified on the C-terminal position have been tested in binding and second messenger formation studies: SP, [Nle11]SP, [Pro11]SP, [Met(O)11]SP, [Met(O2)11]SP, [P3EMet11]SP, [P3EMet(O)11]SP, [P3EMet(O2)11]SP, [P3ZMet11]SP, [P3ZMet(O)11]SP, and [P3ZMet(O2)11]SP.

Assays are described under “Experimental Procedures.” All experiments have been done in triplicate in at least three independent experiments. Values presented are the mean ± S.E. Open table in a new tab Affinities of SP peptide analogues for both [3H][Pro9]SP (Ki1) and [3H]propionyl[Met(O2]11]SP(7–11) (Ki2) binding sites and their related potencies to stimulate cAMP accumulation (EC50(1)) and PI hydrolysis (EC50(2)). Assays are described under “Experimental Procedures.” All experiments have been done in triplicate in at least three independent experiments. Values presented are the mean ± S.E. Examining first the binding studies, the behavior of [Nle11]SP is identical to SP with 1 nmaffinity for [3H][Pro9]SP binding sites and 0.13 nm affinity for [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) binding sites. In contrast to SP and [Nle11]SP, [Pro11]SP has almost no affinity for [3H][Pro9]SP binding sites (Ki = 1150 nm) and a low affinity for [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) binding sites (Ki, 63 nm). Therefore, we further examined the contribution of the methionine side chain with the cis- and trans-[3-prolinomethionine11]SP analogues. Both [P3EMet11]SP and [P3ZMet11]SP fully recover the binding potency of SP on both binding sites (in competition with [3H][Pro9]SP, Ki values are 3.0 and 2.1 nm, respectively, and with [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11), Ki values are 0.1 and 0.08 nm, respectively) (Table I). Although [Nle11]SP retains the activity of SP for NK-1 receptors, as already demonstrated (12Fournier A. Couture R. Magnan J. Gendreau M. Regoli D. St.-Pierre S. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that the sulphur atom has no role in SP/receptor recognition, we had previously shown that the sulfoxides and sulfone analogues of SP or propionyl-SP(7–11) peptides were not recognized in the same way by NK-1 receptors (7Sagan S. Beaujouan J.-C. Torrens Y. Saffroy M. Chassaing G. Glowinski J. Lavielle S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, [Met(O)11]SP, [P3EMet(O)11]SP, and [P3ZMet(O)11]SP are 30–110-fold weaker competitors than SP at [3H][Pro9]SP binding sites. In contrast with the sulfoxide derivatives, further oxidation of the peptides ([Met(O2)11]SP and [P3EMet(O2)11]SP) restores full affinity for [3H][Pro9]SP binding sites, whereas [P3ZMet(O2)11]SP is still a 5-fold less potent competitor at these binding sites. The results obtained with these oxidized analogues are slightly different at [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) binding sites. The sulfoxide analogues, [Met(O)11]SP, [P3EMet(O)11]SP, and [P3ZMet(O)11]SP have 4-, 7-, and 60-fold weaker affinity, respectively, than SP for these binding sites. In contrast, the sulfone analogues fully recover SP affinity for [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) binding sites. With regard to the second messenger assays, it is now well established that NK-1 receptors expressed in CHO cells are positively coupled both to phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase (20Carpino L.A. Sadat-Aalaee D. Chao H.G. De Selms R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9651-9652Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 21Bertho J.-N. Loffet A. Pinel C. Reuther F. Sennyey G. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 1303-1306Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). [Nle11]SP stimulates with potencies similar to SP both IP formation and cAMP accumulation (EC50 values of 0.8 and 15 nm, respectively) (Table I). However, for cAMP formation, [Nle11]SP was less efficient with its maximal response only reaching 45% of SP maximal response. As expected from binding studies, [Pro11]SP was much less potent to stimulate IP formation (EC50, 56 nm) and was devoid of any ability to stimulate cAMP formation (EC50 > 10,000 nm). As in binding studies, reintroduction of the methionine side chain on the pyrrolidine ring of proline leads to [P3EMet11]SP and [P3ZMet11]SP, both being able to stimulate IP formation (EC50 values of 1.3 and 0.8 nm, respectively) and cAMP accumulation (EC50values of 25 and 35 nm, respectively) with potencies similar to SP. As with [Nle11]SP, [P3ZMet11]SP maximal response for cAMP formation only reaches 70% of that obtained with SP. The sulfoxide analogues [Met(O)11]SP, [P3EMet(O)11]SP, and [P3ZMet(O)11]SP are 5-, 3-, and 28-fold less potent than SP to stimulate IP formation, and 30-, 68-, and 375-fold less potent than SP to stimulate cAMP accumulation. Finally, data obtained with the sulfone analogues are also parallel with their binding potencies; [Met(O2)11]SP and [P3EMet(O2)11]SP are as potent as SP when stimulating IP formation and cAMP accumulation. [P3ZMet(O2)11]SP is equipotent to SP to stimulate PI hydrolysis but 15-fold less potent than SP to stimulate cAMP accumulation. Altogether these results show a strong parallelism between the affinity and activity potencies of these analogues. Except for [Pro11]SP and [P3ZMet(O)11]SP, which have low affinity, all these peptides present high to moderate affinity (from 1 to 40 nm) for [3H][Pro9]SP binding sites. In contrast with [3H][Pro9]SP binding sites, all these analogues retain high affinity for [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) binding sites (from 0.08 to 8 nm), [Pro11]SP being the weaker competitor with an affinity of 63 nm. Previously described correlations between affinity and activity (7Sagan S. Beaujouan J.-C. Torrens Y. Saffroy M. Chassaing G. Glowinski J. Lavielle S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Sagan S. Josien H. Karoyan P. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996; 4: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have now been extended to a larger population of substance P analogues (n = 53), including those described in this study. No strong correlation can be found either between their affinities for [3H][Pro9]SP and [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) binding sites (Fig. 3 A, r= 0.808) or between their potencies to stimulate PI hydrolysis and cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3 B, r = 0.657, inactive analogues with EC50 values >5000 nm were discarded for the correlation analysis). It is also further established that affinity for [3H][Pro9]SP binding sites correlates better with cAMP formation (Fig. 3 C, r= 0.922) than with IP formation (Fig. 3 D, r = 0.790), as previously quoted (6Hastrup H. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 264-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Among these 53 analogues, 22 analogues have been screened for their affinity for [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) binding sites. As opposed to [3H][Pro9]SP, the affinity of these 22 analogues for [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) binding sites highly correlates with their potency to stimulate PI hydrolysis (Fig. 3 E, r = 0.975) but not cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3 F, r = 0.774). Further analysis of the results obtained in this study with these eleven SP analogues modified on the C-terminal residue leads to another striking feature. The ratios EC50(1)/Ki1, which are EC50(1) (cAMP accumulation) over Ki1 ([3H][Pro9]SP binding sites), are quite homogenous; values varying among themselves only from 1- to 3.5-fold (Table I). In contrast, the ratios EC50(2)/Ki2, which are EC50(2) (IP formation) over Ki2 ([3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) binding sites) are not constant, variations between values spread out from 1- to 25-fold (Table I). With the exception of [P3EMet(O2)11]SP, these EC50(2)/Ki2 ratios are close to unity for analogues that have low affinity (≥40 nm) for [3H][Pro9]SP binding sites ([Met(O)11]SP, [P3EMet(O)11]SP, and [P3ZMet(O)11]SP) but still have high affinity for [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) binding sites. The most extreme case is [Pro11]SP. Although this analogue has no longer affinity (Ki1 = 1150 nm) for [3H][Pro9]SP binding sites and a low affinity (Ki2 = 63 nm) for [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) binding sites, its EC50(2)/Ki2 ratio value is 0.9, suggesting a strict relationship between binding and activity parameters. We suspected that the EC50(2) of compounds with high affinity for [3H][Pro9]SP binding sites may be underestimated, if this more abundant site is not (or weakly) coupled to IP production. It was therefore of interest to investigate whether the potency to stimulate IP formation could be modulated according to the relative amounts of both binding sites (7Sagan S. Beaujouan J.-C. Torrens Y. Saffroy M. Chassaing G. Glowinski J. Lavielle S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the agonist tested. Thus, we tested, in PI hydrolysis and cAMP accumulation measurements, the influence of the cell number variation, that is the ratio between the relative site numbers and the amount of agonist on the concentration-response curves. For that purpose [Pro11]SP with an EC50 value for IP formation identical to its Ki value against [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) and [P3EMet11]SP with an EC50 value for IP formation being 14-fold greater than its Ki value for [3H]propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP(7–11) binding sites were chosen. The number of cells/well was increased by a factor 15 in four sets of experiments. Results presented in Fig.4 indicate that a significant shift in EC50 value for PI hydrolysis but not cAMP accumulation response is obtained for [P3EMet11]SP depending on the number of cells and thus on the rati"

The PtdSer synthesis in a CHO cell mutant, PSA-3, which lacks PSS I but has normal PSS II activity, was almost completely inhibited by the addition of PtdSer to the culture medium, like that in the wild-type CHO-K1 cells. In contrast, the PtdSer synthesis in a PSS II-overproducing stable transformant of CHO-K1, K1/wt-pssB, was reduced by only 35% upon addition of PtdSer. The serine exchange activity in a membrane fraction of K1/wt-pssB cells was not inhibited by PtdSer at all, whereas those of PSA-3 and CHO-K1 cells were inhibited by >95%. These results indicated that PSS II activity in PSA-3 and CHO-K1 cells is inhibited by exogenous PtdSer and that overproduction of PSS II leads to the loss of normal control of PSS II activity by exogenous PtdSer. Although overproduced PSS II in K1/wt-pssB cells was not normally controlled by exogenous PtdSer, K1/wt-pssB cells cultivated without exogenous PtdSer exhibited a normal PtdSer biosynthetic rate similar to that in CHO-K1 cells. In contrast to K1/wt-pssB cells, another stable transformant of CHO-K1, K1/R97K-pssB, which overproduces R97K mutant PSS II, exhibited a ∼4-fold higher PtdSer biosynthetic rate compared with that in CHO-K1 cells. These results suggested that for maintenance of a normal PtdSer biosynthetic rate, the activity of overproduced wild-type PSS II in K1/wt-pssB cells is depressed by an as yet unknown post-translational mechanisms other than those for the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition and that Arg-97 of PSS II is critical for this depression of overproduced PSS II activity. When the cDNA-directed wild-type and R97K mutant PSS II activities were expressed at nonoverproduction levels in a PSS I- and PSS II-defective mutant of CHO-K1 cells, expression of the mutant PSS II activity but not that of the wild-type PSS II activity induced the PtdSer-resistant PtdSer biosynthesis. This suggested that Arg-97 of PSS II is critical also for the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition of PSS II.

These results suggested that for maintenance of a normal PtdSer biosynthetic rate, the activity of overproduced wild-type PSS II in K1/wt-pssB cells is depressed by an as yet unknown post-translational mechanisms other than those for the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition and that Arg-97 of PSS II is critical for this depression of overproduced PSS II activity. When the cDNA-directed wild-type and R97K mutant PSS II activities were expressed at nonoverproduction levels in a PSS I- and PSS II-defective mutant of CHO-K1 cells, expression of the mutant PSS II activity but not that of the wild-type PSS II activity induced the PtdSer-resistant PtdSer biosynthesis. This suggested that Arg-97 of PSS II is critical also for the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition of PSS II. phosphatidylserine phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine Chinese hamster ovary phosphatidylserine synthase polymerase chain reaction Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer)1 is an essential phospholipid for the growth of mammalian cells (1Kuge O.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17199-17205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The PtdSer biosynthesis in CHO-K1 cells is remarkably inhibited upon addition of PtdSer to the culture medium (9Nishijima M. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5784-5789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that feedback control is involved in the regulation of PtdSer biosynthesis. Because the serine base exchange activities in homogenates of CHO-K1 cells grown with and without exogenous PtdSer are essentially the same (9Nishijima M. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5784-5789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the cellular levels of PSS I and PSS II appear to remain unchanged upon addition of PtdSer. In addition, it has been shown that PtdSer inhibits the serine base exchange activity in a membrane fraction prepared from a homogenate of CHO-K1 cells (10Hasegawa K. Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19887-19892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations imply that the inhibition of serine base exchange activity by PtdSer is involved in the regulation of PtdSer biosynthesis.A CHO cell mutant, named 29, whose PtdSer biosynthesis is highly resistant to inhibition by exogenous PtdSer, has been isolated from CHO-K1 cells (10Hasegawa K. Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19887-19892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a medium without exogenous PtdSer, mutant 29 cells synthesize PtdSer at a 2–3-fold higher rate and exhibit a ∼2-fold higher cellular PtdSer level compared with those in CHO-K1 cells (10Hasegawa K. Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19887-19892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, mutant 29 was shown to carry a missense mutation in the pssA gene, which results in the replacement of Arg-95 of the gene product, PSS I, by Lys (11Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The introduction of the mutant pssA cDNA isolated from mutant 29 cells into CHO-K1 cells induces ∼5-fold elevation of the PtdSer biosynthetic rate and ∼2-fold elevation of the cellular PtdSer level upon cultivation in a medium without exogenous PtdSer, whereas the wild-type pssA cDNA is incapable of inducing such significant elevations (11Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that the R95K mutation in pssA renders the product, PSS I, resistant to the inhibition by exogenous PtdSer (11Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, Arg-95 of PSS I is a critical residue for the control of PSS I activity.Although information on the control of the PSS I activity has increased as described above, little is known concerning the control of activity of PSS II encoded by the pssB gene. PSS I and PSS II are similar in sequence to each other: there is 38% amino acid sequence identity between the two synthases (8Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PSS II has an arginine residue at position 97, which corresponds to Arg-95 of PSS I identified as a critical residue for the control of PSS I activity. In this study, we constructed a mutant pssB cDNA, in which codon 97 was changed from Arg to Lys. Using the wild-type and resultant R97K mutant pssB cDNA clones, we obtained the data suggesting that the PSS II activity in CHO-K1 cells is controlled by at least two different post-translational mechanisms including PtdSer-mediated inhibition and that Arg-97 of PSS II is a critical residue for the control of PSS II activity.DISCUSSIONPtdSer in CHO cells is synthesized through the action of PSS I and II, which catalyze the exchange of l-serine with the base moiety of PtdCho and PtdEtn, respectively (2Saito K. Nishijima M. Kuge O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17199-17205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 3Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol.

The cDNAs of both the PSS I and PSS II genes named pssA and pssB, respectively, have been isolated (6Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the pssA cDNA has been successfully utilized for studying the control of PSS I activity in CHO-K1 cells (11Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The present study focused upon the control of PSS II activity. The conversion of exogenous PtdEtn to PtdSer, which is catalyzed by PSS II, in CHO-K1 cells is reduced by >90% upon addition of PtdSer to the culture medium. The PtdSer formation in the PSS I-defective PSA-3 mutant, as well as that in CHO-K1 cells, is depressed by >95% upon addition of PtdSer to the culture medium. Furthermore, PtdSer inhibits almost completely the serine base exchange activity for PtdSer synthesis in membrane fractions of PSA-3 mutant and CHO-K1 cells. These results indicate that the PtdSer biosynthesis through the action of PSS II is inhibited by exogenous PtdSer.The PtdSer biosynthesis in a PSS II-overproducing stable transformant of CHO-K1 cells, K1/wt-pssB, is reduced by only ∼35% upon addition of PtdSer to the culture medium, whereas the PtdSer biosynthesis in CHO-K1 cells is reduced by >95% upon addition of PtdSer. When cultivated in the medium supplemented with exogenous PtdSer, K1/wt-pssB cells exhibit significant (1.6-fold) elevation of the cellular PtdSer level. Furthermore, the serine base exchange activity in the membrane fraction of K1/wt-pssB cells is not inhibited by PtdSer at all, in contrast to the complete inhibition of the exchange activity in the CHO-K1 membrane. Therefore, the elevation of the PSS II level in CHO-K1 cells leads to the loss of normal control of PSS II activity by exogenous PtdSer. Why does the elevation of the PSS II level affect the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition of PSS II? One feasible explanation is that the inhibition of PSS II by exogenous PtdSer requires an unknown factor that mediates this inhibition, and then the elevation of the PSS II level results in a deficiency of this factor. Confirmation of this speculation awaits the purification or cloning of such a putative inhibition-mediating factor.Although the serine base exchange activity in the membrane of PSS II-overproducing K1/wt-pssB cells is not inhibited by exogenous PtdSer, the exchange activity in a membrane fraction of a PSS I-overproducing stable transformant of CHO-K1 cells, K1/wt-pssA, is inhibited by exogenous PtdSer (11Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The PtdSer biosynthesis in K1/wt-pssA cells is inhibited by >90% upon addition of PtdSer to the culture medium (11Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas the biosynthesis in K1/wt-pssB cells is highly resistant to this inhibition by exogenous PtdSer. Therefore, in contrast to overproduced PSS II, overproduced PSS I appears to be inhibited by exogenous PtdSer. One possible explanation for these observations is that the inhibition of PSS I occurs through the direct binding of exogenous PtdSer to PSS I, whereas the inhibition of PSS II by exogenous PtdSer requires the putative inhibition-mediating factor saturable with overproduced PSS II. Given that the inhibition of both PSS I and PSS II by exogenous PtdSer requires the putative inhibition-mediating factor, the inhibition of PSS I by exogenous PtdSer might be mediated by a relatively abundant factor that is different from the putative inhibition-mediating factor for PSS II.The elevation of the wild-type PSS II level leads to the loss of normal control of PSS II by exogenous PtdSer, as described above; nevertheless, in the medium without exogenous PtdSer, K1/wt-pssB cells with elevated PSS II activity exhibit a normal PtdSer biosynthetic rate and cellular PtdSer level, similar to those in CHO-K1 cells. The maintenance of a normal PtdSer biosynthetic rate in K1/wt-pssB cells is probably not due to limitation of precursor molecules of PtdSer, because, in contrast to K1/wt-pssB cells, another stable transformant, K1/R97K-pssB, which appears to express R97K mutant PSS II at a level similar to that of wild-type PSS II in K1/wt-pssB cells, exhibits a ∼4-fold higher PtdSer biosynthetic rate and a 1.6-fold higher cellular PtdSer level, relative to those in CHO-K1 cells, in the medium without exogenous PtdSer. These results suggest that for maintenance of the normal PtdSer biosynthetic rate, the activity of overproduced PSS II in K1/wt-pssB cells is depressed through post-translational mechanisms other than those for the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, the results indicated that Arg-97 of PSS II is a critical residue for this depression of overproduced PSS II activity.Arg-97 of PSS II appears to be a critical residue also for the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition of PSS II, as judged from the following results: 1) the PtdSer biosynthesis in K1/R97K-pssB cells was not inhibited by the addition of PtdSer to the medium at all, whereas the PtdSer biosynthesis in K1/wt-pssB cells was not completely but was significantly inhibited upon addition of PtdSer; 2) when the cDNA-directed R97K mutant and wild-type PSS II activities were expressed at nonoverproduction levels in a PSS I- and PSS II-defective PSB-2 mutant, the serine base exchange activity in a membrane fraction of the mutant PSS II-expressing PSB-2 mutant, PSB2/R97K-pssB, was not significantly affected by the addition of PtdSer to the assay mixture, whereas that of the wild-type PSS II-expressing PSB-2 mutant, PSB-2/pssB, was inhibited by ∼90% upon addition of PtdSer; and 3) although the PtdSer formation in PSB-2/pssB cells is almost completely inhibited upon addition of PtdSer to the culture medium, the PtdSer formation in PSB-2/R97K-pssB cells is reduced by only ∼15% upon addition of PtdSer.In summary, the results presented in this report indicated that PSS II in CHO-K1 cells is inhibited by exogenous PtdSer and that the activity of overproduced PSS II in CHO-K1 cells is depressed for maintenance of the normal PtdSer biosynthetic rate, probably through molecular mechanisms different from those for the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, the Arg-97 of PSS II was shown to be a critical residue for both the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition of PSS II and the depression of overproduced PSS II activity.

Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The PtdSer biosynthesis in K1/wt-pssA cells is inhibited by >90% upon addition of PtdSer to the culture medium (11Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas the biosynthesis in K1/wt-pssB cells is highly resistant to this inhibition by exogenous PtdSer. Therefore, in contrast to overproduced PSS II, overproduced PSS I appears to be inhibited by exogenous PtdSer. One possible explanation for these observations is that the inhibition of PSS I occurs through the direct binding of exogenous PtdSer to PSS I, whereas the inhibition of PSS II by exogenous PtdSer requires the putative inhibition-mediating factor saturable with overproduced PSS II. Given that the inhibition of both PSS I and PSS II by exogenous PtdSer requires the putative inhibition-mediating factor, the inhibition of PSS I by exogenous PtdSer might be mediated by a relatively abundant factor that is different from the putative inhibition-mediating factor for PSS II.The elevation of the wild-type PSS II level leads to the loss of normal control of PSS II by exogenous PtdSer, as described above; nevertheless, in the medium without exogenous PtdSer, K1/wt-pssB cells with elevated PSS II activity exhibit a normal PtdSer biosynthetic rate and cellular PtdSer level, similar to those in CHO-K1 cells. The maintenance of a normal PtdSer biosynthetic rate in K1/wt-pssB cells is probably not due to limitation of precursor molecules of PtdSer, because, in contrast to K1/wt-pssB cells, another stable transformant, K1/R97K-pssB, which appears to express R97K mutant PSS II at a level similar to that of wild-type PSS II in K1/wt-pssB cells, exhibits a ∼4-fold higher PtdSer biosynthetic rate and a 1.6-fold higher cellular PtdSer level, relative to those in CHO-K1 cells, in the medium without exogenous PtdSer. These results suggest that for maintenance of the normal PtdSer biosynthetic rate, the activity of overproduced PSS II in K1/wt-pssB cells is depressed through post-translational mechanisms other than those for the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, the results indicated that Arg-97 of PSS II is a critical residue for this depression of overproduced PSS II activity.Arg-97 of PSS II appears to be a critical residue also for the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition of PSS II, as judged from the following results: 1) the PtdSer biosynthesis in K1/R97K-pssB cells was not inhibited by the addition of PtdSer to the medium at all, whereas the PtdSer biosynthesis in K1/wt-pssB cells was not completely but was significantly inhibited upon addition of PtdSer; 2) when the cDNA-directed R97K mutant and wild-type PSS II activities were expressed at nonoverproduction levels in a PSS I- and PSS II-defective PSB-2 mutant, the serine base exchange activity in a membrane fraction of the mutant PSS II-expressing PSB-2 mutant, PSB2/R97K-pssB, was not significantly affected by the addition of PtdSer to the assay mixture, whereas that of the wild-type PSS II-expressing PSB-2 mutant, PSB-2/pssB, was inhibited by ∼90% upon addition of PtdSer; and 3) although the PtdSer formation in PSB-2/pssB cells is almost completely inhibited upon addition of PtdSer to the culture medium, the PtdSer formation in PSB-2/R97K-pssB cells is reduced by only ∼15% upon addition of PtdSer.In summary, the results presented in this report indicated that PSS II in CHO-K1 cells is inhibited by exogenous PtdSer and that the activity of overproduced PSS II in CHO-K1 cells is depressed for maintenance of the normal PtdSer biosynthetic rate, probably through molecular mechanisms different from those for the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, the Arg-97 of PSS II was shown to be a critical residue for both the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition of PSS II and the depression of overproduced PSS II activity. PtdSer in CHO cells is synthesized through the action of PSS I and II, which catalyze the exchange of l-serine with the base moiety of PtdCho and PtdEtn, respectively (2Saito K. Nishijima M. Kuge O.

The cDNAs of both the PSS I and PSS II genes named pssA and pssB, respectively, have been isolated (6Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol.

Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the pssA cDNA has been successfully utilized for studying the control of PSS I activity in CHO-K1 cells (11Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The present study focused upon the control of PSS II activity. The conversion of exogenous PtdEtn to PtdSer, which is catalyzed by PSS II, in CHO-K1 cells is reduced by >90% upon addition of PtdSer to the culture medium. The PtdSer formation in the PSS I-defective PSA-3 mutant, as well as that in CHO-K1 cells, is depressed by >95% upon addition of PtdSer to the culture medium. Furthermore, PtdSer inhibits almost completely the serine base exchange activity for PtdSer synthesis in membrane fractions of PSA-3 mutant and CHO-K1 cells. These results indicate that the PtdSer biosynthesis through the action of PSS II is inhibited by exogenous PtdSer. The PtdSer biosynthesis in a PSS II-overproducing stable transformant of CHO-K1 cells, K1/wt-pssB, is reduced by only ∼35% upon addition of PtdSer to the culture medium, whereas the PtdSer biosynthesis in CHO-K1 cells is reduced by >95% upon addition of PtdSer. When cultivated in the medium supplemented with exogenous PtdSer, K1/wt-pssB cells exhibit significant (1.6-fold) elevation of the cellular PtdSer level. Furthermore, the serine base exchange activity in the membrane fraction of K1/wt-pssB cells is not inhibited by PtdSer at all, in contrast to the complete inhibition of the exchange activity in the CHO-K1 membrane. Therefore, the elevation of the PSS II level in CHO-K1 cells leads to the loss of normal control of PSS II activity by exogenous PtdSer. Why does the elevation of the PSS II level affect the exogenous PtdSer-mediated inhibition of PSS II? One feasible explanation is that the inhibition of PSS II by exogenous PtdSer requires an unknown factor that mediates this inhibition, and then the elevation of the PSS II level results in a deficiency of this factor. Confirmation of this speculation awaits the purification or cloning of such a putative inhibition-mediating factor.

https://openalex.org/W2049035444,"Detailed deletion mapping of chromosome 6q sequences in invasive ovarian tumors have implicated several broad regions involving 6q14-16, 6q21-23, 6q25-26, and the telomeric portion in band 6q27 as regions of frequent loss in this malignancy. In order to define regions of loss involved in the development of ovarian cancer, we used 23 polymorphic markers on 6q to examine allelic loss in 25 high-grade, late stage ovarian tumors. Four non-overlapping deletion regions were observed: (1) at 6q21-22.3 (D6S301-D6S292); (2) within a 1 cM region at 23.2-23.3 between markers D6S978-D6S1637 (at D6S311); (3) at 6q26 (between markers D6S411-D6S1277) and (4) at 6q27 with the markers D6S297 and D6S193. The highest region of loss was observed with marker D6S311 (lost in 17 of 19 informative cases, 89%) in 6q23.3, followed by D6S977 and D6S1637 (71 and 55%, respectively). The average fractional allele loss in the high-grade tumors was around 35%. Previous reports have shown 6q27 as the region of most frequent loss in invasive ovarian cancer. However, our results indicate a novel region in 6q23.3 (spanning less than 500 Kb distance between the markers) with the highest loss, implicating this region of chromosome 6q to harbor a putative tumor suppressor gene involved in the development of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2005492271,"In trypanosomatid protozoa, all mRNAs obtain identical 5′-ends by trans-splicing of the 5′-terminal 39 nucleotides of a small spliced leader RNA to appropriate acceptor sites in pre-mRNA. Although this process involves spliceosomal small nuclear (sn) RNAs, it is thought that trypanosomatids do not contain a homolog of the cis-spliceosomal U1 snRNA. We show here that a trypanosomatid protozoon, Crithidia fasciculata, contains a novel small RNA that displays several features characteristic of a U1 snRNA, including (i) a methylguanosine cap and additional 5′-terminal modifications, (ii) a potential binding site for common core proteins that are present in other trans-spliceosomal ribonucleoproteins, (iii) a U1-like 5′-terminal sequence, and (iv) a U1-like stem/loop I structure. Because trypanosomatid pre-mRNAs do not appear to contain cis-spliced introns, we argue that this previously unrecognized RNA species is a good candidate to be a trans-spliceosomal U1 snRNA.

A 39-nucleotide (nt)1 spliced leader (SL) sequence is transferred from the 5′-end of a small SL RNA to the pre-mRNA in a process known as trans-splicing, which is very similar to the spliceosomal cis-splicing found in other eukaryotes (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, it is thought that trypanosomes and their relatives contain neither cis-spliced introns (1Agabian N.

Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The SL RNA is considered to be a trans-spliceosome-specific snRNA because it is found in a ribonucleoprotein particle that contains the same core proteins that are associated with other trans-spliceosomal snRNAs (4Cross M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20159-20163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that during trans-splicing, sequences within the SL RNA are able to substitute for the function that U1 snRNA normally supplies in cis-splicing (3Mottram J. Perry K.L.

Our discovery of a U1 snRNA homolog in Euglena gracilis (8Breckenridge D.G. Watanabe Y. Greenwood S.J. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), an organism that is specifically related to trypanosomatid protozoa (9Sogin M.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1991; 1: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), prompted us to re-evaluate a possible role for U1 snRNA in trypanosomatids.In cis-splicing, during early stages of spliceosome assembly, the 5′-terminal region of U1 snRNA base pairs across the 5′-splice site (10Ares Jr., M. Weiser B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 131-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the case of trans-splicing, it is commonly held that base pairing between U1 snRNA and the 5′-splice site may not be required for splicing of SL RNA sequences (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell.

Steitz J.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 889-899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This view is supported by a study in which a trypanosomatid (Leptomonas collosoma) SL RNA sequence was placed upstream of a 3′-splice site, with the resulting chimeric substrate being efficiently spliced in a HeLa cell nuclear extract even after the 5′-end of >99% of the endogenous U1 snRNA had been removed by oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage (7Bruzik J.P. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 889-899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This result provided support for an earlier proposal that U1 snRNA-like base pairing could be supplied by a region of the SL RNA upstream of the 5′-splice site (6Bruzik J.P. Van Doren K. Hirsh D. Steitz J.A. Nature. 1988; 335: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, it was subsequently shown that U1 snRNP is, in fact, required for cis-splicing of the chimeric substrate, and that base pairing between the 5′-end of U1 snRNA and the SL RNA 5′-splice site does occur in these extracts when the 5′-end of U1 snRNA is intact (11Seiwert S.D. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3135-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated recently that the proposed internal SL RNA base pairing across the 5′-splice site is not essential for trans-splicing in Leishmania tarentolae (12Sturm N.R. Fleishmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In sum, the proposal that trypanosomatid SL RNA substitutes for U1 snRNA in trans-splicing has not gained experimental support, and the data do not definitively rule out the possibility that a U1 snRNA homolog is present in trypanosomatid protozoa but has not yet been identified. Here we show that a representative trypanosomatid, Crithidia fasciculata, contains a novel small RNA that displays several characteristic features expected of a U1 snRNA homolog.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAntibodies specific for m32,2,7G have been used to enrich for capped snRNAs in Trypanosoma brucei (3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although no U1 snRNA homolog was found among the four largest m32,2,7G-capped RNAs, the experiments did detect other, smaller capped RNAs that were not further characterized (3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Additional snRNAs have also been detected by immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed against core proteins common to T. brucei spliceosomal snRNPs (5Palfi Z. Bindereif A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20159-20163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows an electrophoretic profile of C. fasciculata RNAs that were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-m32,2,7G antibody. The antibody reacted efficiently with homologs of the m32,2,7G-capped RNAs identified previously in T. brucei. It also reacted efficiently with the 7-monomethylguanosine (m7G)-capped SL RNA (20Bangs J.D. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. McCloskey J.A. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9805-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with an intermediate of the trans-splicing reaction, the 39-nt free SL RNA exon. In addition, the antibody enriched for a subset of tRNAs that appear to have internal m7G in their variable loops, as judged by chemical reactivity during sequencing. When the amount of antibody relative to RNA was reduced in immunoprecipitation experiments, the RNA yield decreased but the intensity of individual bands relative to each other remained unchanged (data not shown). Although the monoclonal antibody did not distinguish between m7G and m32,2,7G caps, this procedure did allow us to identify a previously unrecognized methylguanosine (mG)-capped RNA that was present at approximately the same concentration as the known trans-spliceosomal snRNAs (U1 snRNA? in Fig.1).When the preliminary sequence of this candidate U1 snRNA was used as a query in a GenBankTM search, we detected a similar sequence in a tRNA gene cluster from L. tarentolae (23Shi X. Chen D.-H.T. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), located on the opposite strand between upstream tRNAArg and downstream tRNALeu genes. PCR experiments (primer combination CfU1A and 3′ARG, see “Experimental Procedures”) confirmed that in C. fasciculata there is also a tRNAArg gene on the opposite strand ∼100 base pairs upstream of the candidate U1 snRNA sequence. Attempts to amplify the region in C. fasciculata DNA between this new sequence and a possible downstream tRNALeu gene (primer combination CfU1 and 5′LEU, see “Experimental Procedures”) were unsuccessful, indicating that this particular gene linkage may not be conserved between L. tarentolae and C. fasciculata.The first two residues of the novel RNA were identified as A by DNA sequencing (Fig. 2 A) but were resistant to cleavage by RNases and alkali during enzymatic sequencing (not shown), indicating that they are O 2′-methylated. The first residue was also resistant to cleavage in the A reaction during chemical sequencing (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that it contains additional modifications. No other post-transcriptional modifications were encountered during sequencing, but we did detect a single site of heterogeneity, A/C at position 60 (Fig. 2, C and D).Figure 2Sequence analysis of a potential U1 snRNA from C. fasciculata.

Gel-purified RNA was digested with snake venom phosphodiesterase, and the resulting radioactive mononucleotide was analyzed by thin layer chromatography. This experiment (Fig. 3, A and B) demonstrates that the candidate U1 snRNA has the same hypermodified 5′-terminal nucleoside, (N 6, N 6 ,O 2′-trimethyladenosine (m26Am)) that is known to be present at the 5′-end of SL RNAs from C. fasciculata and T. brucei (20Bangs J.D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9805-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in contrast, the U2 (Fig. 3 A) and U4 (not shown) snRNAs have 5′-terminal O 2′-methyladenosine (Am) residues. The similarity in methylation patterns observed between this new RNA and the SL RNA may be explained by the fact that six of the seven 5′-terminal nucleotides are identical in the two RNA species (Fig.3 C).Figure 35′-Terminal modified nucleotide analysis. Thin layer chromatography was carried out using unlabeled pN and pAm as markers. Co-migration of the SL and U1? products was verified by eluting them from the original plate (A) and re-chromatographing them (B) using less of the SL RNA sample with the same solvent system (95% ethanol:H2O, 4:1, Ref. 18MacKay R.M.

Notably, the highly conserved 5′-terminal region contains the ACCU sequence (residues 6–9, overlined in Fig. 4) that has the potential to interact with conserved splice site sequences (10Ares Jr., M. Weiser B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 131-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The C. fasciculata candidate U1 snRNA also contains a stem/loop I sequence that, in mammalian systems, is the binding site for U1-70K, a U1 snRNP-specific protein (30Lührmann R. Kastner B. Bach M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 265-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).In view of the unusually small size of the C. fasciculata candidate U1 snRNA (69 nt), it is also not surprising that it lacks some of the characteristic features of a U1 snRNA (Fig. 4, A versus B). The highly conserved stem/loop II, which serves as the binding site for the U1-A protein in other eukaryotes (30Lührmann R. Kastner B. Bach M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 265-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), is the most notable structural element that is missing. One could argue that stem/loop II functions are either unnecessary for trans-splicing or are supplied by another component of the spliceosome (RNA and/or protein). Other trypanosomatid snRNAs show a similar pattern of reduced size and sequence divergence compared with their homologs from other systems (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell.

A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The presence of structurally divergent snRNAs in trypanosomatid protozoa may indicate that the highly accurate splice site selection required for cis-splicing systems may not be as important in a “trans-splicing only” system (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). For example, the demands on 5′-splice site selection machinery (including U1 snRNA) are considerably reduced in trans-splicing, where the 5′-splice site is already present in the spliceosome as part of the spliceosomal SL RNA. Similarly, reduced accuracy of branch point and 3′-splice site selection (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) in SL RNA trans-splicing (which occurs upstream of coding sequences) is likely to be tolerated, because errors would not disrupt the reading frame in the spliced product (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). On the other hand, with the discovery of an apparent U1 snRNA homolog, trypanosomatid protozoa may possess a complete set of spliceosomal snRNAs, raising the possibility that the mechanisms of trans- and cis-splicing are not as different as was previously thought. In this regard, in the absence of a complete genomic sequence, we cannot rule out the possibility that a least a few cis-spliced introns may eventually be found in the trypanosomatid group of protozoa. In trypanosomatid protozoa, all mRNAs have identical 5′-terminal sequences. A 39-nucleotide (nt)1 spliced leader (SL) sequence is transferred from the 5′-end of a small SL RNA to the pre-mRNA in a process known as trans-splicing, which is very similar to the spliceosomal cis-splicing found in other eukaryotes (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, it is thought that trypanosomes and their relatives contain neither cis-spliced introns (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 2Logsdon Jr., J.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) nor an equivalent of the U1 small nuclear (sn) RNA required for spliceosomal cis-splicing (3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The SL RNA is considered to be a trans-spliceosome-specific snRNA because it is found in a ribonucleoprotein particle that contains the same core proteins that are associated with other trans-spliceosomal snRNAs (4Cross M. Günzl A. Palfi Z. Bindereif A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Palfi Z. Bindereif A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20159-20163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that during trans-splicing, sequences within the SL RNA are able to substitute for the function that U1 snRNA normally supplies in cis-splicing (3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Bruzik J.P. Van Doren K. Hirsh D. Steitz J.A.

Our discovery of a U1 snRNA homolog in Euglena gracilis (8Breckenridge D.G. Watanabe Y. Greenwood S.J. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), an organism that is specifically related to trypanosomatid protozoa (9Sogin M.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1991; 1: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), prompted us to re-evaluate a possible role for U1 snRNA in trypanosomatids. In cis-splicing, during early stages of spliceosome assembly, the 5′-terminal region of U1 snRNA base pairs across the 5′-splice site (10Ares Jr., M. Weiser B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 131-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the case of trans-splicing, it is commonly held that base pairing between U1 snRNA and the 5′-splice site may not be required for splicing of SL RNA sequences (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell.

Steitz J.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 889-899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This view is supported by a study in which a trypanosomatid (Leptomonas collosoma) SL RNA sequence was placed upstream of a 3′-splice site, with the resulting chimeric substrate being efficiently spliced in a HeLa cell nuclear extract even after the 5′-end of >99% of the endogenous U1 snRNA had been removed by oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage (7Bruzik J.P. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 889-899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This result provided support for an earlier proposal that U1 snRNA-like base pairing could be supplied by a region of the SL RNA upstream of the 5′-splice site (6Bruzik J.P. Van Doren K. Hirsh D. Steitz J.A. Nature. 1988; 335: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, it was subsequently shown that U1 snRNP is, in fact, required for cis-splicing of the chimeric substrate, and that base pairing between the 5′-end of U1 snRNA and the SL RNA 5′-splice site does occur in these extracts when the 5′-end of U1 snRNA is intact (11Seiwert S.D. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3135-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated recently that the proposed internal SL RNA base pairing across the 5′-splice site is not essential for trans-splicing in Leishmania tarentolae (12Sturm N.R. Fleishmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In sum, the proposal that trypanosomatid SL RNA substitutes for U1 snRNA in trans-splicing has not gained experimental support, and the data do not definitively rule out the possibility that a U1 snRNA homolog is present in trypanosomatid protozoa but has not yet been identified. Here we show that a representative trypanosomatid, Crithidia fasciculata, contains a novel small RNA that displays several characteristic features expected of a U1 snRNA homolog. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAntibodies specific for m32,2,7G have been used to enrich for capped snRNAs in Trypanosoma brucei (3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although no U1 snRNA homolog was found among the four largest m32,2,7G-capped RNAs, the experiments did detect other, smaller capped RNAs that were not further characterized (3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Additional snRNAs have also been detected by immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed against core proteins common to T. brucei spliceosomal snRNPs (5Palfi Z. Bindereif A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20159-20163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows an electrophoretic profile of C. fasciculata RNAs that were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-m32,2,7G antibody. The antibody reacted efficiently with homologs of the m32,2,7G-capped RNAs identified previously in T. brucei. It also reacted efficiently with the 7-monomethylguanosine (m7G)-capped SL RNA (20Bangs J.D. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. McCloskey J.A. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9805-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with an intermediate of the trans-splicing reaction, the 39-nt free SL RNA exon. In addition, the antibody enriched for a subset of tRNAs that appear to have internal m7G in their variable loops, as judged by chemical reactivity during sequencing. When the amount of antibody relative to RNA was reduced in immunoprecipitation experiments, the RNA yield decreased but the intensity of individual bands relative to each other remained unchanged (data not shown). Although the monoclonal antibody did not distinguish between m7G and m32,2,7G caps, this procedure did allow us to identify a previously unrecognized methylguanosine (mG)-capped RNA that was present at approximately the same concentration as the known trans-spliceosomal snRNAs (U1 snRNA? in Fig.1).When the preliminary sequence of this candidate U1 snRNA was used as a query in a GenBankTM search, we detected a similar sequence in a tRNA gene cluster from L. tarentolae (23Shi X. Chen D.-H.T. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), located on the opposite strand between upstream tRNAArg and downstream tRNALeu genes. PCR experiments (primer combination CfU1A and 3′ARG, see “Experimental Procedures”) confirmed that in C. fasciculata there is also a tRNAArg gene on the opposite strand ∼100 base pairs upstream of the candidate U1 snRNA sequence. Attempts to amplify the region in C. fasciculata DNA between this new sequence and a possible downstream tRNALeu gene (primer combination CfU1 and 5′LEU, see “Experimental Procedures”) were unsuccessful, indicating that this particular gene linkage may not be conserved between L. tarentolae and C. fasciculata.The first two residues of the novel RNA were identified as A by DNA sequencing (Fig. 2 A) but were resistant to cleavage by RNases and alkali during enzymatic sequencing (not shown), indicating that they are O 2′-methylated. The first residue was also resistant to cleavage in the A reaction during chemical sequencing (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that it contains additional modifications. No other post-transcriptional modifications were encountered during sequencing, but we did detect a single site of heterogeneity, A/C at position 60 (Fig. 2, C and D).In order to further characterize the modified A at the 5′-end of the molecule, the RNA was 5′-end-labeled after removal of the mG cap structure by tobacco acid pyrophosphatase treatment. Gel-purified RNA was digested with snake venom phosphodiesterase, and the resulting radioactive mononucleotide was analyzed by thin layer chromatography. This experiment (Fig. 3, A and B) demonstrates that the candidate U1 snRNA has the same hypermodified 5′-terminal nucleoside, (N 6, N 6 ,O 2′-trimethyladenosine (m26Am)) that is known to be present at the 5′-end of SL RNAs from C. fasciculata and T. brucei (20Bangs J.D. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. McCloskey J.A. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9805-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in contrast, the U2 (Fig. 3 A) and U4 (not shown) snRNAs have 5′-terminal O 2′-methyladenosine (Am) residues. The similarity in methylation patterns observed between this new RNA and the SL RNA may be explained by the fact that six of the seven 5′-terminal nucleotides are identical in the two RNA species (Fig.3 C).Figure 35′-Terminal modified nucleotide analysis. Thin layer chromatography was carried out using unlabeled pN and pAm as markers. Co-migration of the SL and U1? products was verified by eluting them from the original plate (A) and re-chromatographing them (B) using less of the SL RNA sample with the same solvent system (95% ethanol:H2O, 4:1, Ref. 18MacKay R.M.

Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). For example, the demands on 5′-splice site selection machinery (including U1 snRNA) are considerably reduced in trans-splicing, where the 5′-splice site is already present in the spliceosome as part of the spliceosomal SL RNA. Similarly, reduced accuracy of branch point and 3′-splice site selection (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) in SL RNA trans-splicing (which occurs upstream of coding sequences) is likely to be tolerated, because errors would not disrupt the reading frame in the spliced product (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). On the other hand, with the discovery of an apparent U1 snRNA homolog, trypanosomatid protozoa may possess a complete set of spliceosomal snRNAs, raising the possibility that the mechanisms of trans- and cis-splicing are not as different as was previously thought. In this regard, in the absence of a complete genomic sequence, we cannot rule out the possibility that a least a few cis-spliced introns may eventually be found in the trypanosomatid group of protozoa. Antibodies specific for m32,2,7G have been used to enrich for capped snRNAs in Trypanosoma brucei (3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although no U1 snRNA homolog was found among the four largest m32,2,7G-capped RNAs, the experiments did detect other, smaller capped RNAs that were not further characterized (3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Additional snRNAs have also been detected by immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed against core proteins common to T. brucei spliceosomal snRNPs (5Palfi Z. Bindereif A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20159-20163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows an electrophoretic profile of C. fasciculata RNAs that were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-m32,2,7G antibody. The antibody reacted efficiently with homologs of the m32,2,7G-capped RNAs identified previously in T. brucei. It also reacted efficiently with the 7-monomethylguanosine (m7G)-capped SL RNA (20Bangs J.D. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. McCloskey J.A. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9805-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with an intermediate of the trans-splicing reaction, the 39-nt free SL RNA exon. In addition, the antibody enriched for a subset of tRNAs that appear to have internal m7G in their variable loops, as judged by chemical reactivity during sequencing. When the amount of antibody relative to RNA was reduced in immunoprecipitation experiments, the RNA yield decreased but the intensity of individual bands relative to each other remained unchanged (data not shown). Although the monoclonal antibody did not distinguish between m7G and m32,2,7G caps, this procedure did allow us to identify a previously unrecognized methylguanosine (mG)-capped RNA that was present at approximately the same concentration as the known trans-spliceosomal snRNAs (U1 snRNA? in Fig.1). When the preliminary sequence of this candidate U1 snRNA was used as a query in a GenBankTM search, we detected a similar sequence in a tRNA gene cluster from L. tarentolae (23Shi X. Chen D.-H.T. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), located on the opposite strand between upstream tRNAArg and downstream tRNALeu genes. PCR experiments (primer combination CfU1A and 3′ARG, see “Experimental Procedures”) confirmed that in C. fasciculata there is also a tRNAArg gene on the opposite strand ∼100 base pairs upstream of the candidate U1 snRNA sequence. Attempts to amplify the region in C. fasciculata DNA between this new sequence and a possible downstream tRNALeu gene (primer combination CfU1 and 5′LEU, see “Experimental Procedures”) were unsuccessful, indicating that this particular gene linkage may not be conserved between L. tarentolae and C. fasciculata. The first two residues of the novel RNA were identified as A by DNA sequencing (Fig. 2 A) but were resistant to cleavage by RNases and alkali during enzymatic sequencing (not shown), indicating that they are O 2′-methylated. The first residue was also resistant to cleavage in the A reaction during chemical sequencing (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that it contains additional modifications. No other post-transcriptional modifications were encountered during sequencing, but we did detect a single site of heterogeneity, A/C at position 60 (Fig. 2, C and D). In order to further characterize the modified A at the 5′-end of the molecule, the RNA was 5′-end-labeled after removal of the mG cap structure by tobacco acid pyrophosphatase treatment. Gel-purified RNA was digested with snake venom phosphodiesterase, and the resulting radioactive mononucleotide was analyzed by thin layer chromatography. This experiment (Fig. 3, A and B) demonstrates that the candidate U1 snRNA has the same hypermodified 5′-terminal nucleoside, (N 6, N 6 ,O 2′-trimethyladenosine (m26Am)) that is known to be present at the 5′-end of SL RNAs from C. fasciculata and T. brucei (20Bangs J.D. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. McCloskey J.A. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9805-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in contrast, the U2 (Fig. 3 A) and U4 (not shown) snRNAs have 5′-terminal O 2′-methyladenosine (Am) residues. The similarity in methylation patterns observed between this new RNA and the SL RNA may be explained by the fact that six of the seven 5′-terminal nucleotides are identical in the two RNA species (Fig.3 C). Trypanosomatid snRNAs contain sequences that bind spliceosomal core proteins (4Cross M. Günzl A. Palfi Z. Bindereif A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Palfi Z. Bindereif A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20159-20163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bruzik J.P.

A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The C. fasciculata SL RNA core-protein binding site, which is capable of interacting with mammalian Sm proteins (6Bruzik J.P. Van Doren K. Hirsh D. Steitz J.A. Nature. 1988; 335: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) as well as with T. brucei core proteins (4Cross M. Günzl A. Palfi Z. Bindereif A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), appears to consist of an AAAUUUUGA sequence followed by a short G + C-rich hairpin. The novel RNA reported here has an almost identical sequence, AUAUUUUGA (residues 44–52), followed by a 3′-terminal hairpin structure that is supported by compensating base changes in the L. tarentolae sequence (Fig.4 B). The presence of a core-protein binding site and a modified 5′ terminus, both of which are specifically related to their trans-spliceosomal SL RNA counterparts, provides strong evidence that this new capped RNA is also a component of the trans-spliceosome. Given that U1 snRNA is the only typical spliceosomal snRNA that has not yet been discovered in trypanosomatid protozoa (3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Dungan J.M. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4016-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Xu Y. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that we also found primary sequence conservation between this C. fasciculata candidate U1 snRNA and known U1 snRNAs from other organisms (Fig. 4 C; compare Fig. 4, A and B). Notably, the highly conserved 5′-terminal region contains the ACCU sequence (residues 6–9, overlined in Fig. 4) that has the potential to interact with conserved splice site sequences (10Ares Jr., M. Weiser B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 131-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The C. fasciculata candidate U1 snRNA also contains a stem/loop I sequence that, in mammalian systems, is the binding site for U1-70K, a U1 snRNP-specific protein (30Lührmann R. Kastner B. Bach M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 265-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In view of the unusually small size of the C. fasciculata candidate U1 snRNA (69 nt), it is also not surprising that it lacks some of the characteristic features of a U1 snRNA (Fig. 4, A versus B). The highly conserved stem/loop II, which serves as the binding site for the U1-A protein in other eukaryotes (30Lührmann R. Kastner B. Bach M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 265-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), is the most notable structural element that is missing. One could argue that stem/loop II functions are either unnecessary for trans-splicing or are supplied by another component of the spliceosome (RNA and/or protein). Other trypanosomatid snRNAs show a similar pattern of reduced size and sequence divergence compared with their homologs from other systems (1Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 3Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell.

The ability of the yeast Candida glabrata to survive copper insult requires rapid transcriptional autoactivation of the AMT1 copper-metalloregulatory transcription factor gene. The kinetics of AMT1 autoactivation is greatly enhanced by homopolymeric (dA-dT) element (A16)-mediated nucleosomal accessibility for Amt1p to a metal response element in this promoter. Analysis of the nucleosomal positional requirements for the A16 element reveal an impaired ability of the A16 element to stimulate AMT1 autoregulation when positioned downstream of the metal response element within the nucleosome, implicating an inherent asymmetry to the nucleosome positioned within the AMT1 promoter. Importantly, we demonstrate that the A16 element functions to enhance nucleosomal access and hormone-stimulated transcriptional activation for the mammalian glucocorticoid receptor, in a rotational phase-dependent manner. These data provide compelling evidence that nucleosomal homopolymeric (dA-dT) elements provide enhanced DNA access to diverse classes of transcription factors and suggest that these elements may function in this manner to elicit rapid transcriptional responses in higher eukaryotic organisms.

The proximal mediators of these signaling pathways are the transcriptional activators, which must physically interact with cis-acting DNA elements within the promoters of their target genes. The organization of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin poses a unique paradox for the cell to maintain its genetic material in a compact arrangement and yet have the capacity to respond quickly to extracellular stimuli to activate gene expression. In contrast to the very high affinity that transcription factors typically have for a given target DNA sequence on free DNA, the same DNA sequence within chromatin can have >1000-fold lower affinity (1Owen Hughes T. Workman J.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 403-441PubMed Google Scholar). This poses a large thermodynamic barrier to surpass in order to achieve a rapid transcriptional response for inducibly bound transcription factors. Furthermore, the magnitude of the thermodynamic barrier created by chromatin for each specific transcription factor can vary significantly and is often related to the position of the DNA-responsive element relative to the ends of the nucleosomal DNA (translational phase) and the direction the responsive element faces in relation to the histone core (rotational phase). Given that occupancy of the responsive elements by transcription factors is directly correlated with transcriptional activation, the thermodynamic barrier created by chromatin also plays an integral role in modulating the kinetics of target gene activation. Classically, eukaryotic promoters have been categorized into two general types, preset and remodeled, based on their chromatin architecture and the need for nucleosome remodeling on the promoter to establish accessible DNA. The Drosophila heat shock-responsive genes hsp26 and hsp70 provide examples of a preset chromatin arrangement whereby the target DNA sequences recognized by the heat shock transcription factor within each of their respective promoters are maintained free of stably positioned nucleosomes. The regions of the heat shock elements within each of these promoters are hypersensitive to nuclease digestion, consistent with the lack of stably positioned nucleosomes (2Wallrath L.L. Lu Q. Granok H. Elgin S.C.R. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). An alternative to maintaining a preset promoter chromatin configuration is the use of stimulus-initiated nucleosome remodeling that is orchestrated by the signal-responsive transcription factors. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a signal transduction pathway is activated in response to low environmental phosphate levels, which leads to the activation of the PHO5 gene through the Pho2p and Pho4p transcription factors. The PHO5 gene harbors six uniquely positioned nucleosomes within its promoter, of which four are effectively remodeled during phosphate starvation (3Almer A. Horz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 4Straka C. Horz W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Nucleosome remodeling on the PHO5 promoter is dependent on the binding of Pho4p to a target DNA sequence known as UASp1, which is located between two positioned nucleosomes. Importantly, the primary Pho4p binding site is nonnucleosomal, and it is only after Pho4p-mediated nucleosome remodeling that the adjacent nucleosomal Pho4p and Pho2p binding sites become available and PHO5 transcription is potentiated. Another example of stimulus-initiated nucleosome remodeling is orchestrated by the activated glucocorticoid receptor (GR)1 upon binding to a nucleosomal glucocorticoid response element (GRE) located on the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat (MMTV-LTR). In response to glucocorticoid hormone, the activated GR binds to the GREs located within a positioned nucleosome in the MMTV-LTR to facilitate the remodeling of this nucleosome, thereby providing binding site access to the NF-1 transcription factor (5Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 6Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 7Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 8Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Hache R.J. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The affinity of the NF-1 transcription factor for DNA is severely reduced for target DNA sequences that are within a nucleosome, unlike the steroid receptors, the DNA binding of which is only modestly affected by chromatin (9Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 10Blomquist P. Li Q. Wrange O. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 88: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The stimulation of nucleosome remodeling from a nonnucleosomal site in the case of PHO5, and a nucleosomal site in the case of the MMTV-LTR, suggests that the exact mechanism of nucleosome remodeling used on any given promoter will be intimately associated with the nature of the transcription factor promoting the response and its ability to interact with nucleosomal DNA. A third generally applicable mechanism for achieving accessible chromatin is through DNA structural element-facilitated nucleosome destabilization and/or the distortion of a stably positioned nucleosome to provide localized accessible DNA. This mechanism for attaining accessible chromatin was discovered by Struhl and colleagues using the HIS3 promoter in S. cerevisiae (12Iyer V. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 13Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8419-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae HIS3 gene product functions in the histidine biosynthetic pathway and is activated by the transcription factor Gcn4p in response to amino acid starvation. The Gcn4p binding site on the HIS3 promoter is located at −92 relative to the transcriptional start site with an imperfect 17-bp poly(dA-dT) element containing the sequence T4CAT11 located 12 bp upstream of the binding site. Deletion of a 344-bp HIS3 upstream promoter region containing this poly(dA-dT) element resulted in a severe decrease in the magnitude of Gcn4p-dependent gene activation, implicating the poly(dA-dT) element in fostering HIS3 transcriptional activation (13Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8419-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Substitution of the native imperfect poly(dA-dT) element with homopolymeric (dA-dT) elements 17, 29, or 42 bp in length restored Gcn4p-dependent transcriptional activation (12Iyer V. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Probing the accessibility of this region using in vivo Hin fI cleavage and DNA methylation studies indicated a modest poly(dA-dT)-dependent enhancement of accessibility (1.9-fold increase in Hin fI cleavage of the Gcn4p binding site and a 10% difference in DNA methylation by Escherichia coli dam methylase expressed in vivo). Iyer and Struhl (12Iyer V. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) concluded that the 42-bp homopolymeric (dA-dT) element functions by improving the accessibility of the HIS3 promoter region containing the Gcn4p binding site either by a local decrease in nucleosome occupancy and/or an altered nucleosome conformation. Several studies have provided evidence that the region containing the Gcn4p binding site and the poly(dA-dT) element in the native HIS3 promoter is in a region that lacks stably positioned nucleosomes. Using micrococcal nuclease to probe the chromatin structure of the wild-type HIS3 promoter, Losa et al. (14Losa R. Omari S. Thoma F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3495-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) identified two strong nuclease hypersensitive sites in the region of the poly(dA-dT) element that were separated by 110 bp. They concluded that the separation between these nuclease sensitive sites was insufficient to represent the boundaries of a stably positioned nucleosome, which would be ∼146 bp apart, and likely represents a nuclease sensitive region lacking stably positioned nucleosomes. Studies by Filetici et al. (15Filetici P. Aranda C. Gonzalez A. Ballario P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) further support the contention that this region of the wild-type HIS3 promoter lacks stably positioned nucleosomes. Using radiolabeled HIS3 gene fragments from different regions of the gene to probe a Southern blot of mononucleosomal DNA, they demonstrated that the region containing the poly(dA-dT) element and Gcn4p binding site is specifically devoid of stably positioned nucleosomes. Furthermore, in the studies by Iyer and Struhl (12Iyer V. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), it is clear that the region of the Gcn4p binding site is ∼7-fold more sensitive to Hin fI cleavage than an adjacent site 65 bp upstream in the absence of the poly(dA-dT) element, which is highly suggestive that the poly(dA-dT) region does not contain stably positioned nucleosomes. The 42-bp homopolymeric (dA-dT) used in the studies mentioned above may therefore be acting to further promote the unstable chromatin architecture in this region of the his3 promoter to promote Gcn4p accessibility, or perhaps by a combination of this mechanism and altering the conformation of nucleosomes that may be transiently positioned in this region to allow nucleosomal access to Gcn4p. Recently, we have described a distinct system that utilizes a nucleosomal homopolymeric (dA-dT) element to mediate accessibility to the copper-dependent transcription factor, Amt1p, in the yeast Candida glabrata (16Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Amt1p transcription factor in the yeast C. glabrata sits atop a hierarchy of genes that are activated by the presence of high levels of copper in the environment (17Zhou P. Szczypka M.S. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3766-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Acting as both the sensor and transcriptional activator, Amt1p binds Cu(I) and activates its own transcription followed by the transcriptional activation of the MTI, MTIIa, and MTIIb metallothionein genes, which encode critical components of the copper ion detoxification pathway (18Zhou P. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1824-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The rapid and robust transcriptional autoactivation of the AMT1 gene is a critical step in this signaling pathway and occurs through a single metal-responsive element (MRE) within the AMT1 promoter (18Zhou P. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1824-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This MRE is located at the pseudodyad axis of symmetry of a stably positioned AMT1 promoter nucleosome encompassing DNA from −113 to −260 relative to the transcription start site, along with a homopolymeric (dA-dT) element containing 16 contiguous adenosine residues (A16) that resides just upstream of the MRE (16Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). DNase I analysis and restriction enzyme access experiments with yeast chromatin suggest that the A16 element locally distorts the DNA at both ends, creating increased accessibility to neighboring DNA sequences (16Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Homopolymeric (dA-dT) elements have been shown to have unique structural characteristics that make them rigid and less flexible than standard B-form DNA. In addition to having a shorter helical repeat (10.0 bp/turn as opposed to 10.5 bp/turn) and a narrow minor groove (∼9 Å as compared with ∼15 Å for B-form DNA), homopolymeric (dA-dT) elements have additional bifurcated hydrogen bonds that provide added structural stability (19Nelson H.C. Finch J.T. Luisi B.F. Klug A. Nature. 1987; 330: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). These characteristics of homopolymeric (dA-dT) elements, and our previous data, suggest that nucleosomal homopolymeric (dA-dT) elements can resist conforming tightly to the histone protein face of the nucleosome and create localized DNA distortions on either end of the element that provide “access windows” for transcription factors. Analysis of the crystal structure of a reconstituted nucleosome reveals that there is an inherent asymmetry with respect to the number of histone-DNA contacts made on either side of the dyad axis of symmetry (20Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Recent studies investigating triple helix formation at nucleosomal poly(dA-dT) elements experimentally identified functional differences between the ability of a triple helix to form on one side of the nucleosome dyad axis as compared with its counterpart on the other side of the dyad axis (21Brown P.M. Fox K.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In its natural context, the A16 element resides just upstream of the AMT1 promoter MRE. Here we present the results of studies that address whether the positioning of the A16 element on the nucleosome alters the ability of the homopolymeric (dA-dT) element to stimulate AMT1 autoregulation by placing the A16 element downstream of the MRE. Additionally, we investigate the length requirements for the nucleosomal homopolymeric (dA-dT) element to function in AMT1 autoregulation. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the function of the A16 element is conserved in the baker's yeast S. cerevisiae and does not depend on the Dat1 poly(dA-dT) binding protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the A16 element to foster nucleosomal access to the rat glucocorticoid receptor expressed in yeast, in a rotational phase-dependent manner. Given the high frequency of occurrence of homopolymeric (dA-dT) tracts in promoter regions in yeast and mammalian genes, these elements may be of widespread use in facilitating rapid transcriptional responses to physiological and environmental stimuli. The C. glabrata uracil auxotrophic strain (D) was used as the recipient for episomal plasmids bearing wild-type or mutant AMT1-lacZ reporter genes. The AMT1 disruption strain (amt1–1) (17Zhou P. Szczypka M.S. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3766-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used for the integration of full-length wild-type or mutant AMT1 genes in single copy at the ura3 locus. The S. cerevisiae strain CY342 (MATa ade2–101 his3–200 leu2-Δ1 lys2–801 ura3-Δ99) was used for the glucocorticoid receptor experiments. S. cerevisiae strain KKY17 (CY342 + ace1Δ225) was used to test the ability of AMT1 to autoregulate in baker's yeast, and S. cerevisiae strain KKY20 (KKY17 +dat1Δ::kanMX2) was used to test the role of the Dat1 protein in AMT1 gene autoregulation. The E. coli strain DH5αF′ was used for the construction and maintenance of plasmids by standard techniques (22Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar), except in the case of plasmids that were used with the Chameleon double-stranded mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), in which the manufacturer's strains were utilized. The plasmids pAXHA3, pAX-S16, and pAX-A16Δ were produced in order to facilitate the construction of mutant AMT1-lacZ reporter plasmids. pAXHA3 contains the 635-bp Xba I-Hae III fragment of the wild-type AMT1 gene from pBZ-12 (23Koch K.A Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) cloned into the Xba I and Sma I sites of pBluescript SK+. pAX-A16Δ is the corresponding plasmid produced from the Xba I-Hae III fragment lacking the A16 derived from pBZ12-A16Δ (16Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and pAX-S16 is the corresponding plasmid derived from pRSS16 (16Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The 645-bp Xba I-Eco RI fragments from pAXHA3 and pAX-S16 were used to replace the equivalent fragment in pKTP-8T (13Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8419-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) to produce pA16-lacZ and pS16-lacZ, respectively. The oligonucleotides 5′-CTCATCACGCCCACCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTACTACTTTTAAGTCAGC-3′ and 5′-CTCATCACGCCCACCAGCATGCGGATCCTGAACTACTTTTAAGTCAGC-3′ were used in conjunction with pAX-A16Δ and the Chameleon mutagenesis kit to produce plasmids pAX-3′A16 and pAX-3′S16, respectively. The oligonucleotides 5′-GCCAAATTAGCTTATCATGATTTTTTTTTTGGATCCCAGAATGTTAGTCTCCG-3′ and 5′-GCCAAATTAGCTTATCATGATTTTTCCATGGGATCCCAGAATGTTAGTCTCCG-3′ were used with plasmid pAX-HA3 and the above mutagenesis kit to produce plasmids pAX-A10 and pAX-A5, respectively. The DNA sequence of the Xba I-Eco RI fragment from each respective plasmid was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing, and these fragments were then used to replace the equivalent fragment from plasmid pA16-lacZ to produce the following mutant plasmids: p3′A16-lacZ, p3′S16-lacZ, pA10-lacZ, and pA5-lacZ. Plasmids pA16/3′A16-lacZ and pA16/3′S16-lacZ were constructed via three-piece ligation by simultaneously introducing the Xba I-Bsp HI fragment of pAXHA3 and the Bsp HI-Eco RI fragment from pAX-3′A16 and pAX-3′S16, respectively, into the Xba I-Eco RI cut pA16-lacZ vector. Plasmid pS16/3′A16-lacZ was also produced by three-piece ligation using the Xba I-Bsp HI fragment of pAX-S16 and the Bsp HI-Eco RI fragment from pAX-3′A16. The integrative plasmids pU1b-3′A16 and pU1b-3′S16 were produced by combining the Xba I-Sty I AMT1 promoter fragment harboring their respective mutations with the remainder of the AMT1 gene in the pU1b plasmid backbone (24Zhou P. Szczypka M.S. Young R. Thiele D.J. Gene. 1994; 142: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were then used to integrate, in single copy, the mutant AMT1 genes at the ura3 locus of the amt1–1 strain as described previously (18Zhou P. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1824-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The new strains designated 3′A16::URA3 and 3′S16::URA3 were tested for copper resistance, along with strains A16::URA3 and S16::URA3 made previously (16Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Plasmids pAX-S16GREin and pAX-S16GREout were constructed using the plasmid pAX-S16 with the Chameleon mutagenesis kit and the oligonucleotides 5′-CCTGATCATGATAAGCTCTGCTGTACAGGATGTTCTAGCTACTGGGCGTGATGAGCC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTGATCATGACTCTGCTGTACAGGATGTTCTAGCTACGTGGTGGGC-3′, respectively. To generate pS16GREinZ and pS16GREoutZ, the Xba I-Eco RI fragments of pAX-S16GREin and pAX-S16GREout, respectively, were used to replace the corresponding fragments in pA16-lacZ. The plasmids pA16GREinZ and pA16GREoutZ were generated via the three-piece ligation approach described above. The plasmid p413GPD-rGR was developed to constituitively express the rat glucocorticoid receptor cDNA from the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) promoter in S. cerevisiae. p413GPD-rGR contains the 2.8-kilobase Xba I fragment encompassing the rat glucocorticoid receptor open reading frame from CMV5rGRx subcloned into the Xba I site of p413-GPD (25Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides 5′-CTTGTGAATCTACAAACTGTCCTAAAGTATATTGGAGCAGGACATTGGGTGGAAGCTTCGTACGCTGCA-3′ and 5′-CTAGTTATTATGTGGCATATACGAATGTTTTAGTGGTATGCTGGAAATGAAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTGA3′, containing 50 bp of homology to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the S. cerevisiae DAT1 gene, respectively, were used to amplify by polymerase chain reaction the kanMX2 cassette from the plasmid pFA-kanMX2 as described previously (26Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 μg of the resulting polymerase chain reaction product was used to transform S. cerevisiae strain KKY17. The strain KKY20 was identified that exhibited G418 resistance and displayed the correct chromosomal disruption of the DAT1 gene (dat1Δ::kanMX2), as ascertained by polymerase chain reaction. The C. glabrata strain D was independently transformed with pA16-lacZ, pS16-lacZ, p3′A16-lacZ, p3′-S16-lacZ, pA16/3′S16-lacZ, pA16/3′A16-lacZ, pS16/3′A16-lacZ, pA10-lacZ, and pA5-lacZ using the protocol of Ito et al. (27Ito H. Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and plated onto SC-ura agar plates. Growth conditions, CuSO4 induction of Amt1p-dependent transcription, and analysis of AMT1-lacZ mRNA levels by RNase protection were carried out as described previously (23Koch K.A Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For the analysis of AMT1 mRNA levels in S. cerevisiae, ACT1 mRNA levels were used as the internal control as described elsewhere (28Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). RNase protection analysis was performed on at least two independent time courses of reporter gene induction for each experiment. Nuclei were isolated from 1 liter of cells grown to an absorbance at 600 nm of ∼1.4 in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil, using the method of Almer and Horz (3Almer A. Horz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Micrococcal nuclease treatments were as described by Almer and Horz (3Almer A. Horz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), with the concentration of micrococcal nuclease used indicated in the figure legends. After purification of the micrococcal nuclease treated DNA, the DNA was subjected to secondary digestion with Sty I to completion. Control samples that were used for marker lanes were left on ice without micrococcal nuclease during the initial digestion, with subsequent purification and digestion of the DNA by Bsp HI and Sty I. Digested samples were resolved on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with a random prime radiolabeled 700-bp Xba I-Sty I AMT1 fragment derived from plasmid pAXHA3. The S. cerevisiae strain CY342 was cotransformed with the rat glucocorticoid receptor expression plasmid p413GPD-rGR and one of the following reporter plasmids: pA16GREinZ, pA16GREoutZ, pS16GREinZ, or pS16GREoutZ. Induction of glucocorticoid-responsive gene expression was initiated by the addition of 10 μm deoxycorticosterone (DOC) to log phase (A650 = 1.0–1.5) cells in SC-ura-his medium. At the time points indicated in the figure legends, cells were harvested, RNA was prepared, and steady-state lacZ and ACT1 mRNA levels were analyzed by RNase protection. The levels of rGR expressed in each strain were determined by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody to GR and standard techniques (22Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Previous in vivo footprinting analysis identified DNase I hypersensitive sites at both ends of the 16-bp homopolymeric (dA-dT) element (A16) in the AMT1 promoter (16Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Replacement of the A16 with a T16 revealed that, like the homopolymeric (dA-dT) element used in the HIS3 promoter (12Iyer V. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), the nucleosomal AMT1 homopolymeric (dA-dT) element functions in an orientation-independent manner (16Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the AMT1 promoter revealed that these regions of hypersensitivity represent localized areas of accessible DNA within the nucleosome that may provide nucleosomal access for Cu-Amt1p to the MRE located downstream of the A16 element. To test whether the inherent asymmetry of the nucleosome would influence A16 element function, AMT1 promoter derivatives containing either A16 or a defined nonhomopolymeric sequence (S16) positioned 3′ to the MRE were fused to the E. coli lacZ gene and introduced into C. glabrata strain D (TableI and Fig.1 A). The distance between the MRE and the 3′A16 was maintained the same as for the wild-type AMT1 gene. Fig. 1 B shows the results of indirect end-labeling experiments of micrococcal nuclease treated nuclei derived from C. glabrata cells harboring either the wild-type or 3′A16 reporter plasmids. These results clearly show that both the wild-type AMT1-lacZ fusion and 3′A16-lacZ fusion genes contain a stably positioned nucleosome over the region of the homopolymeric (dA-dT) element and the MRE. Furthermore, these results also clearly identify three additional positioned nucleosomes present on both promoters, with two nucleosomes upstream of the MRE-containing nucleosome and one nucleosome downstream downstream encompassing the TATA box and transcription initiation site. Fig.2, B and C, shows the results and quantitation of RNase protection analysis of steady state mRNA levels expressed from wild-type and mutant AMT1-lacZ fusion genes during a time course of exposure to copper ions. URA3 mRNA levels were analyzed as the internal control. The wild-type AMT1 promoter exhibits the characteristic rapid and robust transcriptional response to copper ions, peaking at 30 min after copper addition to the cells, whereas the S16-containing promoter displays both a weaker transcriptional response and delayed kinetics of activation observed previously (16Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 3′A16-lacZ promoter derivative also drives maximum levels of mRNA accumulation 30 min after copper addition, but with an overall pe"

During adenovirus infection, levels of p53 protein also increase. It has been shown that this increase is due not only to increased stability of the p53 protein but to the transcriptional activation of the p53 gene during infection. We demonstrate here that the E1a proteins of adenovirus are responsible for activating the mouse p53 gene and that both major E1a proteins, 243R and 289R, are required for complete activation. E1a brings about the binding of two cellular transcription factors to the mouse p53 promoter. One of these, ETF, binds to three upstream sites in the p53 promoter and one downstream site, whereas E2F binds to one upstream site in the presence of E1a. Our studies indicate that E2F binding is not essential for activation of the p53 promoter but that ETF is. Our data indicate the ETF site located downstream of the start site of transcription is the key site in conferring E1a responsiveness on the p53 promoter.

Following exposure of a normal cell to genotoxic stress, with agents such as DNA-damaging drugs (1Hall P.A. McKee P.H. Menage H.D. Dover R. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 203-207PubMed Google Scholar) and radiation (2Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), levels of p53 protein increase. As the p53 protein is a sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor (reviewed in Ref. 3Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar), this increase in p53 protein results in an increase in p53-dependent gene transcription, which in turn leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 4Levine A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 623-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 5Gottlieb M.T. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 6Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Cell cycle arrest is thought to be predominantly due to p53 transcriptionally activating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/WAF1 (7El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7888) Google Scholar), which inhibits the protein kinase activities of G1 cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes, preventing phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (8Slobos R.J.C. Lee M.H. Plunkett B.S. Kessi T.D. Williams B.O. Jacks T. Hedrick L. Kastan M.B. Cho K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5320-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), thereby blocking cell cycle progression. It is less clear how p53 induces apoptosis, although several genes that play a role in regulating apoptotic pathways are transcriptionally regulated by p53 (9Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 10Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For example, p53 activates the bax gene (10Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), the product of which binds to and prevents the ability of Bcl-2 to block apoptosis (11Oltvai Z.N. Milman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5836) Google Scholar). It appears that, in part, the level of p53 determines whether a cell enters a cell cycle arrest or apoptotic pathway (12Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), although transcription-independent apoptosis induced by p53 has been reported (13Caelles C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 14Wagner A.J. Kokontis J.M. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar).The increase in p53 levels is due in part to increased stabilization of the protein (1Hall P.A. McKee P.H. Menage H.D. Dover R. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 203-207PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which the p53 protein is stabilized is still unclear (15Lane D. Nature. 1998; 394: 616-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of p53 by the DNA-dependent protein kinase (16Woo R.A. McLure K.G. Lees-Miller S.P. Rancourt D.E. Lee P.W.K. Nature. 1998; 394: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) or ATM kinase (17Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar) may be responsible for activating the p53 protein. This phosphorylation may reduce the ability of p53 to interact with MDM2 (18Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar) a negative regulator of p53 function (19Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar), thereby preventing ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p53 (20Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3654) Google Scholar). This in turn would enhance the ability of p53 to act as a transcriptional regulator (21Blaydes J.P. Gire V. Rowson J.M. Wynford-Thomas D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to bring about growth arrest or apoptosis.However, two reports have raised the possibility that the p53 response to genotoxic stress may also be regulated at the transcriptional level (22Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K.-I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Hellin A.-C. Calmant P. Gielen J. Bours V. Merville M.-P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These reports show an increase in transcription from the p53 gene in cells exposed to DNA-damaging drugs.During adenovirus infection, the adenovirus early 1a (E1a) region expresses two major proteins, 243R and 289R, that differ by 46 amino acids that are present in 289R. Comparison of the primary amino acid sequences of 243R and 289R between serotypes suggests the presence of three conserved domains 1, 2, and 3 (CD1, CD2, and CD3)1 (reviewed in Ref. 24Braithwaite A.W. Nelson C.C. Bellett A.J.D. New Biol. 1991; 3: 18-26PubMed Google Scholar). These E1a proteins interact with numerous cellular proteins to drive cells through their cell cycle, thereby facilitating virus production (reviewed in Ref. 25Moran E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Expression of E1a has been shown to cause an increase in the level of p53 protein and induce p53-dependent apoptosis (26Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 27Teodoro J.G. Shore G.C. Branton P.E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 467-474PubMed Google Scholar, 28Querido E. Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3526-3533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stabilization of p53 requires the amino terminus or CD1 of E1a and occurs through modification of a ubiquitin-protease pathway (29Nakajima T. Morita K. Tsunoda H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Oda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20036-20045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Like DNA-damaging agents (22Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K.-I. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it has been shown that adenovirus E1a products not only stabilize p53 protein but also transcriptionally activate p53 expression. Early studies performed in normal rat kidney (NRK) cells using nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that stimulation of endogenous p53 expression by adenovirus was at the level of transcriptional initiation and that the E1a proteins were most likely responsible (30Braithwaite A. Nelson C. Skulimowski A. McGovern J. Pigott D. Jenkins J. Virology. 1990; 177: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The adenovirus E1a proteins represent an extensively studied set of viral transactivators (31Flint J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev.

J. Oncology. 1994; 5: 425-444PubMed Google Scholar) that have been widely used in the study of regulatory systems that control cellular transcription. Neither of the major E1a proteins, 243R and 289R, is capable of binding to double stranded DNA in a sequence-specific manner (34Ferguson B. Krippl B. Andrisani O. Jones N. Westphal H. Rosenberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); therefore, E1a must act through preexisting cellular transcription factors that interact with E1a-inducible promoters. Several sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors, such as E2F (35Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Nevins J.R.

Virol. 1995; 69: 7917-7924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In comparison to the studies on the stabilization of the p53 protein, relatively little is known about the signal transduction pathways and transcription factors that regulate transcription from the p53 gene. The mouse p53 gene has a TATA-less promoter (47Bienz-Tadmor B. Zakut-Houri R. Givol D. Oren M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that contains a region extending from −2 to +5 (all numbering is relative to the start site of transcription), which has homology to an initiator (Inr) element (48Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Inr elements have been shown to position the start site of transcription in TATA-less promoters (49O'Shea-Greenfield A. Smale S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1391-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adjacent to the Inr (Fig. 1 a), located between +5 and +17, is a NF1-like site (50Ginsberg D. Oren M. Yaniv M. Piette J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1285-1290PubMed Google Scholar, 51Hale T.K. Braithwaite A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Further downstream of the Inr is a helix-loop-helix (HLH) consensus binding motif (Fig.1 a). Several members of the HLH family, including USF, have been shown to bind to this site and enhance promoter activity (52Reisman D. Elkind N.B. Roy B. Beamon J. Rotter V. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 57-65PubMed Google Scholar, 53Reisman D. Rotter V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Wu and Lozano (54Wu H. Lozano G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20067-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that NF-κB also binds downstream of the Inr to a site located between +55 and +64 (Fig. 1 a). Binding of NF-κB in response to TNF-α, an inducer of NF-κB activity, was shown to activate the mouse p53 promoter (54Wu H. Lozano G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20067-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse p53 promoter also contains a consensus TRE-like AP1 binding site between −64 and −57 (Fig. 1 a) that binds an unidentified factor designated p53 factor 1 (PF1) (50Ginsberg D. Oren M. Yaniv M. Piette J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1285-1290PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the transcription factor ETF binds to a downstream region in the p53 promoter, and another unidentified factor PF2 binds to a site upstream (Fig. 1 a) and appears to be essential for promoter activity (51Hale T.K. Braithwaite A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).From the literature, it appears that DNA-damaging drugs and expression of E1a during adenovirus infection result in both the transcriptional activation of the p53 gene and stabilization of the protein (1Hall P.A. McKee P.H. Menage H.D. Dover R. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 203-207PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K.-I. Mol. Cell.

Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), understanding the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate p53 expression is of importance. This study utilizes the ability of the viral transactivator E1a to activate p53 expression to identify several cellular factors that are involved in transcriptionally activating the p53 promoter, which may have relevance to the activation of p53 expression during the cellular response to genotoxic stress.DISCUSSIONSeveral reports have shown that the p53 gene is transcriptionally activated in response to a number of different agents. These include the DNA tumor viruses SV40 (81Duthu A. Ehrhart J.-C. Benchimol S. Chandrasekaran K. May P. Virology. 1985; 147: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and adenovirus (30Braithwaite A. Nelson C. Skulimowski A. McGovern J. Pigott D. Jenkins J. Virology. 1990; 177: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 71Liu H.T. Baserga R. Mercer W.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2936-2942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), serum and phorbol esters (50Ginsberg D. Oren M. Yaniv M. Piette J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1285-1290PubMed Google Scholar), and, more recently, DNA-damaging drugs (22Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K.-I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Hellin A.-C. Calmant P. Gielen J. Bours V. Merville M.-P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Despite this, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the p53 gene by any of these agents.In this paper, we have studied the transcriptional control of the mouse p53 promoter after infection with human Ad5. As the adenovirus E1a proteins induce a p53-dependent apoptosis (26Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), transcriptional activation by E1a may contribute to the process of virus-induced cell death.Initial experiments showed that Ad5 stimulated activity of the p53 promoter/CAT construct pAACAT 8-fold in REFs (Fig. 1) and in mouse L929 cells (data not shown). This level of induction with the p53 promoter/CAT construct is similar to that observed for induction of the endogenous p53 gene by Ad5 (30Braithwaite A. Nelson C. Skulimowski A. McGovern J. Pigott D. Jenkins J. Virology. 1990; 177: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Further studies in which REFs were infected with Ad5 mutants confirmed a requirement for the E1a proteins (Figs. 1 d and2 a), and cotransfection experiments with E1a expression plasmids in HeLa cells demonstrated that the E1a products alone are responsible for transactivation of the p53 promoter (Fig.2 b).To identify the regions of the p53 promoter that are responsive to E1a, a series of overlapping double-stranded oligonucleotides (oligomers 1–7) were synthesized that span the minimum region of the mouse p53 promoter (−224 to +101) required for transactivation by E1a (Fig. 1). EMSAs carried out with these oligomers using nuclear extracts of NRK cells either infected with wild-type Ad5 or the E1a-deficient virus, dl 312, showed that whereas some oligomers bound proteins irrespective of the presence of E1a, others showed binding only in the presence of E1a (Fig. 3). These results suggested that transactivation of the p53 promoter occurs by E1a facilitating binding of (new) transcription factors to the promoter.To determine whether the above hypothesis is correct, competition EMSAs were first carried out to determine which factors bound to the various oligomers (summarized in Fig. 7). This was then followed by site-directed mutagenesis of certain key factor binding sites within the promoter. The binding studies demonstrated that transcription factors E2F and ETF bound to the oligomers (or showed increased binding as for oligomer 7) in the presence of E1a proteins (Figs. 3 and 4). Further studies using an adenovirus mutant (dl 348), which expresses only the largest E1a protein, 289R, indicated that although E2F did not bind after infection with this mutant adenovirus (Fig. 5), dl 348 could nonetheless transactivate the p53 promoter (Fig. 2 a). Therefore, binding of E2F is not likely to be essential for transactivation of p53 expression by E1a. Thus, given the other binding data, the transcription factor ETF seems to be the most likely candidate to transactivate the p53 promoter in response to E1a expression.Figure 7Summary of factors binding to the p53 promoter. A diagrammatic representation of the transcription factors, and their relative positions, that bind to the mouse p53 promoter between −224 and +101 in dl 312-infected (−E1a) and Ad5-infected (+E1a) NRK cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ETF is a GC-rich DNA-binding protein known to activate TATA-less promoters (69Kageyama R. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15508-15514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that has not previously been implicated in E1a-mediated activation. To determine whether ETF binding is critical to E1a transactivation of the mouse p53 promoter, mutagenesis of three of the four ETF sites was carried out. The mutated sites are shown in Fig. 6 a. The fourth site within oligomer 5 (from −55 to −1) could not be mapped, presumably due to a very high GC content in this region. Mutagenesis of the individual ETF sites had relatively little effect on promoter activity in the absence of E1a. Mutation of site 2 (−148 to −143) and site 4 (−73 to −69) also had only a small effect on activity upon adenovirus infection (Fig.6 b) or in the presence of E1a (Fig. 6 c). However, mutation of the ETF site in oligomer 7 located between +63 and +70 (site 7) had a marked effect on the ability of E1a to transactivate the p53 promoter. For example, pAACAT was transactivated 5-fold by Ad5, and the ETF site 2 mutant (pETF2CAT) was transactivated 4-fold; however, the site 7 mutant (pETF7CAT) was not transactivated at all (Fig. 6 b). Likewise, in transfected HeLa cells, mutation of site 7 reduced transactivation by E1a from 10-fold to around 3-fold (Fig. 6 c). Thus, for both adenovirus and E1a alone (expressed from a plasmid), transactivation of the p53 promoter would appear to be dependent primarily on increased binding of ETF to its downstream site located between +63 and +70.The studies herein have shown that Ad5 E1a can transactivate the p53 tumor suppressor gene promoter in different cells types (Figs. 1, 2 and 6), consistent with previous reports of stimulation of endogenous p53 gene expression after adenovirus infection in several cell lines (30Braithwaite A. Nelson C. Skulimowski A. McGovern J. Pigott D. Jenkins J. Virology. 1990; 177: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 71Liu H.T. Baserga R. Mercer W.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2936-2942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding studies also showed that upon adenovirus infection, ETF and E2F were stimulated to bind the p53 promoter in the presence of E1a (Figs. 3 and 4). However, the nuclear extracts used for these binding studies came from cells (NRK cells) that are different from those used in the transactivation studies that were performed in REFs and HeLa cells. In the transactivation studies, site-directed mutagenesis of the ETF sites (resulting in a loss of ETF binding to the p53 promoter) showed that the ETF site downstream of the transcription start site was critical to transactivation of the p53 promoter by E1a (Fig.6). These results, taken together with the binding studies, indicate that the ability of ETF to bind to its downstream site in the p53 promoter is required for transactivation of p53 expression by E1a, even in different cell types. One might reasonably conclude then that E1a transactivates the p53 promoter by activating ETF in some way to bind to its downstream site within the promoter. At present, this activation process is unknown; however, it does appear to require the presence of the E1a proteins 243R and 289R for full activation of p53 expression (Fig. 2).Of particular interest here is the fact that the downstream ETF site between +63 and +70 is the most important region for mediating transactivation by E1a. In the mouse p53 promoter, two other transcription factor binding motifs overlap this ETF site (Fig.1 a). An NF-κB site is located between +55 and +64 (54Wu H. Lozano G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20067-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas an HLH motif is located between +70 and +75 (52Reisman D. Elkind N.B. Roy B. Beamon J. Rotter V. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 57-65PubMed Google Scholar, 53Reisman D. Rotter V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These data suggest this downstream region of the p53 promoter, which is bound by several transcription factors, is a critical control region in the p53 promoter in response to different transactivating agents. Binding of NF-κB to its site appears to play a role in transcriptionally activating the p53 promoter in response to DNA damage induced by the drug daunomycin (23Hellin A.-C. Calmant P. Gielen J. Bours V. Merville M.-P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas USF and the immediate early protein Myc have been shown to regulate p53 expression through the HLH motif (52Reisman D. Elkind N.B. Roy B. Beamon J. Rotter V. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 57-65PubMed Google Scholar, 53Reisman D. Rotter V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Members of the HLH family of DNA-binding proteins are often involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation (82Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In addition, Myc, like E1a, can induce apoptosis (83Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar). Therefore, this downstream region in the p53 promoter appears to play an important role in controlling the levels of p53 protein and hence in determining the cellular response to several environmental cues, whether it be growth arrest or apoptosis. The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays an important role in maintaining the genomic integrity of a cell. Following exposure of a normal cell to genotoxic stress, with agents such as DNA-damaging drugs (1Hall P.A. McKee P.H. Menage H.D. Dover R. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 203-207PubMed Google Scholar) and radiation (2Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), levels of p53 protein increase. As the p53 protein is a sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor (reviewed in Ref. 3Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar), this increase in p53 protein results in an increase in p53-dependent gene transcription, which in turn leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 4Levine A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 623-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 5Gottlieb M.T. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 6Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Cell cycle arrest is thought to be predominantly due to p53 transcriptionally activating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/WAF1 (7El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7888) Google Scholar), which inhibits the protein kinase activities of G1 cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes, preventing phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (8Slobos R.J.C. Lee M.H. Plunkett B.S. Kessi T.D. Williams B.O. Jacks T. Hedrick L. Kastan M.B. Cho K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5320-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), thereby blocking cell cycle progression. It is less clear how p53 induces apoptosis, although several genes that play a role in regulating apoptotic pathways are transcriptionally regulated by p53 (9Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 10Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For example, p53 activates the bax gene (10Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), the product of which binds to and prevents the ability of Bcl-2 to block apoptosis (11Oltvai Z.N. Milman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5836) Google Scholar). It appears that, in part, the level of p53 determines whether a cell enters a cell cycle arrest or apoptotic pathway (12Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), although transcription-independent apoptosis induced by p53 has been reported (13Caelles C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 14Wagner A.J. Kokontis J.M. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The increase in p53 levels is due in part to increased stabilization of the protein (1Hall P.A. McKee P.H. Menage H.D. Dover R. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 203-207PubMed Google Scholar). Althou"

Wolfenden R. Science. 1995; 267: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). At the active site of OMP decarboxylase (ODCase, EC 4.1.1.23), this reaction proceeds with a half-time of 18 ms, producing UMP, the biosynthetic precursor of pyrimidine nucleotides (Fig. 1) (2Bell J.B. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12662-12667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the biological importance of this reaction, the unusual magnitude of the rate enhancement (>1017-fold), and the absence of cofactors such as those used in the enzymatic decarboxylation of α-amino and 2-keto acids, the mechanism of action of this enzyme has attracted unusual interest. Recently, yeast ODCase was found to contain zinc and to be inactivated by several zinc-complexing agents (3Miller B.G. Traut T.W. Wolfenden R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 104: 6434-6435Google Scholar). Earlier, ODCase had been shown to be susceptible to very strong reversible inhibition by 6-CSNH2-UMP (6-thiocarboxamidouridine 5′-phosphate), shown in Fig. 1, but not by 6-CONH2-UMP (6-carboxamidouridine 5′-phosphate), consistent with the possible involvement of a metal ion in enzyme-substrate interaction (4Kalman T. Kalman T. Drug Action and Design: Mechanism-based Enzyme Inhibitors. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1979: 285-287Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of zinc in the action of ODCase, we used a bacterial system to express the ura3 gene that encodes yeast ODCase. We find this gene product to be fully active but devoid of metal atoms, invalidating the hypothesis that zinc is involved in catalysis. OMP, MOPS, HEPES, 2-mercaptoethanol, 1,4-dithiothreitol, zinc chloride, leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Sigma and used without further purification. [7-14C]OMP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products and was diluted with unlabeled OMP to a specific activity of 2000 cpm/nmol. Enzyme concentrations were estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 28,830m−1 cm−1, estimated from the protein sequence by the method of Edelhoch (5Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was routinely measured using a continuous assay based on the decrease in absorbance at 285 nm, where Δεm = −1650 cm−1 (6Livingstone L.R. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15726-15733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in MOPS buffer (10 mm, pH 7.2) containing substrate OMP (0.1 mm). Because the Km value for OMP is very low, determination of kcat and Km values (Table I) required the use of radioisotopically labeled substrate following the release of 14CO2 at 25 °C (7Jones M.E. Kavipurapu P.R. Traut T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); reaction mixtures contained MOPS (10 mm, pH 7.2) and varying concentrations of [7-14C]OMP (0.5–8 μm). Yeast ODCase was dialyzed extensively against HEPES buffer (2 mm, pH 7.0) that had been freed of metal ions by treatment with Chelex 100. The specific activity, measured before and after dialysis, showed that no significant loss of enzyme activity occurred during dialysis.Table IZinc content, specific activity, and catalytic constants of various forms of yeast ODCase determined at 22 °CEnzymeZn/subunitkcatKmSpecific activitymol/mols−1μmμmol min−1 mg−1Native ODCase expressed in yeast0.89 ± 0.1613 ± 1.20.71-aValue from Ref. 2.27.2 ± 2.5ODCase expressed in bacteria0.06 ± 0.0119 ± 1.20.6 ± 0.0439.3 ± 2.51-a Value from Ref. 2Bell J.B.

Open table in a new tab ODCase was expressed in yeast using strain BJ5424 containing plasmid pGU2, which contains the ura3 gene under control by a galactose-inducible promoter (2Bell J.B. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12662-12667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the enzyme made by the yeast expression system was performed as described earlier (2Bell J.B. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12662-12667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except for the addition of an anion exchange chromatography step to increase the purity of the product. For expression of ODCase in Escherichia coli, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ura3 gene of plasmid pRS306 (8Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the Eco RV site of Stratagene vector pBCSK+ following polymerase chain reaction amplification. This procedure yielded a ura3 gene with a unique Nde I site at the 5′-end and a Bam HI site 3′ to the ura3 termination codon that are compatible with unique expression vector endonuclease cleavage sites. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified ura3 gene was determined for both DNA strands using overlapping primers. To express yeast ODCase in E. coli, the Nde I, Bam HI-ended ura3 coding sequence was isolated from a preparative agarose gel, purified using Jetsorb gel extraction reagents (Genomed), and inserted 3′ to the cdd promoter of cytidine deaminase expression plasmid pCDA6022. This construction resulted in replacement of the pCDA6022 cdd gene by the ura3 gene and yielded plasmid pBGM88. ODCase expression vector pBGM88 was then introduced into E. coli SS6130 (cytR, Δcdd) by electroporation. In this strain, transcription of the plasmid-borne ura3 gene is completely derepressed (9Smith A.A. Carlow D.C. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6468-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). ODCase was purified from E. coli SS6130(pBGM88) that had been grown at 27 °C for 16–18 h in 2× YT medium (10Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar) supplemented with Vogel and Bonner salts (11Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol.

The bacteria were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) and suspended to 1 g of cells, wet weight/4.8 ml of buffer containing potassium phosphate (50 mm, pH 6.0), glycerol (20%), and β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm). Cell extracts were prepared by passage of the suspension through a French press at 10,000 p.s.i. Intact cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and applied to an anion exchange column (Poros II Q, Perspective Biosystems) equilibrated with Buffer A (Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.0), glycerol (5%, w/v), and β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm)). Those fractions in the column flow-through with ODCase activity were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A for 16 h at 4 °C. The dialyzed protein solution was applied to a second anion exchange column (HR 10/10 Mono Q, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with Buffer A. ODCase was recovered from the Mono Q resin by elution with a linear gradient (0–0.3 m) of NaCl. The protein obtained from the Mono Q resin was at least 95% homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 2). Before analysis of heat inactivation, enzymes were dialyzed against Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.0) containing glycerol (15% w/v) and β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm) at 4 °C. Enzymes were then incubated for 5 min in a Lauda RC-6 circulating water bath, an aliquot was removed, and the decarboxylase activity was measured using the spectrophotometric assay described above. In attempts to add zinc to metal-free enzyme made in bacteria, ODCase (9.1 μm in subunits) was treated on ice with urea, guanidine HCl, or guanidine thiocyanate. Incubation with the latter two chaotropic agents resulted in an irreversible loss of activity. Following incubation of enzyme for 1 min in 2 m urea containing ZnS04 (2–24 μm), the enzyme was diluted 50-fold into MOPS (10 mm, pH 7.2) containing equivalent concentrations of ZnS04 and dialyzed for 18 h at 4 °C against Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 7.0) containing glycerol (5% w/v). On average, 50% of the initial ODCase activity was recovered after dialysis. The urea/ZnSO4-treated enzyme was analyzed for its thermal stability and metal content by atomic absorption spectroscopy following metal-free dialysis. To allow expression of yeast ODCase in E. coli, two residues of the native yeast enzyme were replaced; the penultimate N-terminal serine was changed to histidine, and the C-terminal asparagine was changed to aspartate. These replacements showed no significant effect on the activity of the bacterially produced enzyme, compared with the values obtained for the enzyme isolated from yeast (Table I). Expression of the yeast ura3 gene in bacteria yielded 75–100 mg of highly purified ODCase per liter of culture and produced a fully active enzyme that contained less than 0.1 molar eq of zinc, as indicated by atomic absorption spectroscopy. In contrast, ODCase purified from yeast contained 0.89 mol of zinc/subunit (Table I). Analysis of concentrated samples of the bacterially produced enzyme by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (Garratt-Callahan Co., Millbrae, CA) revealed the presence of less than 0.12 molar eq of a variety of other metals including cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, and lead. These results appear to invalidate the hypothesis that metals directly participate in the mechanism of OMP decarboxylation. Amino acid sequencing of the native yeast ODCase revealed that the N terminus is blocked, presumably as a result of posttranslational modification. As expected from our previous experience with bacterial expression systems, the enzyme purified from E. coli was found to be devoid of posttranslational modifications, as judged by amino acid sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the yeast and bacterially generated enzymes showed that these proteins have similar electrophoretic mobilities. On the basis of this present evidence, we do not understand why the enzymes from E. coli and from yeast, prepared by the same purification procedure, resemble each other in catalytic activity but differ in their metal content. The two-residue difference between yeast and bacterially expressed ODCase seems unlikely to be the source of the difference in metal content, because the introduced amino acids, histidine and aspartate, might be expected to assist rather than interfere with the coordination of zinc. That source of difference cannot be excluded, however, in view of the possibility that other interactions might be affected by these replacements in such a way as to reduce the enzyme's affinity for zinc. To determine whether there might be other observable differences between enzymes obtained from the two expression systems, we determined the susceptibilities of the yeast-expressed and bacterially expressed enzymes to thermal inactivation. Fig. 3 shows that the extent of inactivation of both enzymes exhibited a sigmoidal dependence on temperature. When the inflection points were compared, the zinc-containing enzyme isolated from yeast showed a Tinact of 58.0 °C, whereas the zinc-deficient enzyme expressed in bacteria was markedly less stable, with a Tinact of 46.2 °C. The extent to which these differences might arise from differences in posttranslational modification remains to be determined. Experiments designed to interconvert these species were not successful. Removal of zinc from the enzyme expressed in yeast by dialysis in the presence of EDTA (0.01m) resulted in loss of activity as described (3Miller B.G. Traut T.W. Wolfenden R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 104: 6434-6435Google Scholar). Attempts to add ZnSO4 to bacterially expressed ODCase, both in the absence and presence of 2 m urea, failed to produce a zinc-liganded enzyme. Consistent with the lack of zinc in the bacterially produced enzyme, expression of the yeast ura3 gene in E. coli yielded an enzyme that, unlike the enzyme expressed in yeast, was insensitive to inactivation by 1,3-dimercaptopropanol and EDTA. However, the enzyme expressed in bacteria remained highly sensitive to reversible competitive inhibition by 6-CSNH2-UMP (Ki = 3.5 × 10−9m), like the enzyme expressed in yeast. That seems surprising because the design of 6-CSNH2-UMP was predicated on the possibility that zinc, with its high affinity for sulfur ligands, might be present at the active site (7Jones M.E. Kavipurapu P.R. Traut T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The basis of this inhibitor's remarkable binding affinity and of the catalytic process itself remains to be determined by structural studies that are now in progress. We thank Jennifer Neugebauer for conducting electrospray mass spectrometric analysis, Will Burkhart and Mary Moyer for amino acid sequence analysis, and Dr. Thomas Kalman for the generous gift of 6-CSNH2-UMP."

Biochem. 1991; 60: 101-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The translocation reaction across the cytoplasmic membrane is mediated by an enzyme complex termed the translocase. The translocase holoenzyme is an assembly of integral membrane proteins, termed SecY (or PrlA) and SecE (PrlG), together with a peripheral ATPase termed SecA (PrlD). The SecYE complex is homologues to the eukaryotic Sec61p complex of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (4Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Görlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and both complexes appear to constitute a transmembrane protein conducting channel (5Hanein D. Matlack K.E.S. Jungnickel B.

Hartmann E. Beckwith J. Cell. 1997; 91: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). During cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis SecA supports a stepwise translocation reaction (9Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), coupled to cycles of membrane insertion and deinsertion at SecYE (11Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). An additional source of energy for the translocation reaction is the proton-motive force. The proton-motive force positively affects the unidirectionality of the translocation reaction (12Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), possibly by directly driving the translocation of preproteins in the absence of SecA (9Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) as well as by stimulating the SecA reaction cycle (13Nishiyama K.-i. Fukuda A. Morita K. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Other proteinaceous factors involved in the translocation reaction are SecG (PrlH) (14Nishiyama K.-i. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3409-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and a trimeric complex consisting of the SecD, SecF, and YajC proteins (15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). SecG inverts its membrane topology concomitantly with the membrane cycling of SecA (16Nishiyama K.-i. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), whereas SecDFYajC stabilizes the membrane inserted state of SecA (17Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 18Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2756-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Both SecG and the SecDFYajC complex interact with the SecYE complex and stimulate translocation (15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For the efficient in vitro reconstitution of preprotein translocation, SecYEG is used as it is readily purified as a detergent-solubilized complex (19Brundage L.A. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 20van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the translocation reaction by SecG has been demonstrated using the purified and reconstituted translocase (14Nishiyama K.-i. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3409-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Hanada M. Nishiyama K.-i. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23625-23631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstituted SecYEG allows multiple rounds of translocation (22Bassilana M. Wickner W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2626-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) as well as the integration of transmembrane segments into the lipid bilayer (23Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have identified mutations in translocase components that allow the correct cellular localization of preproteins carrying a defective signal sequence (24Emr S.D. Hanley-Way S. Silhavy T.J. Cell. 1980; 23: 79-88Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 25Bieker K.L. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4087-4093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). How these prl mutations (for protein localization) suppress defective signal sequence recognition is yet unclear, but a direct restoration of the interaction between translocase and the signal sequence is unlikely. First, the number of prl alleles is too large to account for a single recognition event. Second, even (pre)proteins that lack the complete signal sequence are transported in strains carrying prlA (secY) or prlG (secE) suppressor mutations (29Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 30Flower A.M. Doebele R.C. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5607-5614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, prl suppressor mutations may alter important enzymological events underlying the translocation reaction. Allele-specific synthetic lethality caused by combinations of prlA and prlG suppressor mutations suggest that they affect subunit interactions between SecY and SecE (31Flower A.M. Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the prlA4 suppressor mutation supports increased binding of SecA to translocation sites in the cytoplasmic membrane (32van der Wolk J.P.W. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This increased affinity for SecA leads to a decreased rejection of SecA or SecA-precursor complexes during translocation. Finally, prlA suppressors alter the translocation reaction less dependent on the proton-motive force (33Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the nature and the dynamics of subunit interactions within the translocase, we employed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis to regions of SecY and SecE that contain, or are proximal to, clusters of prl suppressor mutations. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis has been used as a powerful technique to study structure-function relationships in membrane proteins, including the E. coli lactose permease LacY (34Wu J. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14498-14502Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the eukaryotic multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (35Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 36Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). SecY contains prlA suppressor mutations that cluster mainly in transmembrane segment (TMS)12, TMS 7, and TMS 10, and in periplasmic loop 1 (P1) (37Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Synthetic lethality between prlG and prlA suppressor mutations suggests interactions of SecE TMS 3 with SecY TMS 7 and 10, and between SecY P1 and SecE P2 (31Flower A.M. Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The replacement of consecutive residues by cysteines in SecY TMS 2 and SecE TMS 3 identified contacts at specific helical interfaces between these two protein regions and between neighboring SecE molecules (38Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The latter interaction is dynamic and is modulated by conformational changes in the SecA protein. We now report on the cysteine mutagenesis of SecY TMS 7, which yielded a SecY molecule that supports increased translocation ATPase activity. This mutant possesses a unique cysteine at the position of isoleucine 278, a residue that is altered by several prlA suppressor mutations. Inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) or proteoliposomes containing SecY(I278C)EG not only supported increased translocation of normal preproteins, but also allowed translocation of a preprotein carrying a defective signal sequence. Binding studies further demonstrated that, like the PrlA4 suppressor, SecY(I278C) has a higher affinity for SecA than normal SecY. The latter permits efficient co-immunoprecipitation of translocase-preprotein complexes even without prior stabilization by a preprotein translocation intermediate. The data suggest an important role for SecY TMS 7 in SecA binding and support a model in which stabilization of the SecA-SecY interaction leads to increased translocation of normal preproteins concomitant with a reduced rejection of preproteins with a defective signal sequence. Monoclonal antibodies against OmpA were raised and selected by Prof. Dr. L. de Leij, Academic Hospital Groningen. Polyclonal antisera against purified SecY or SecA were obtained as described (20van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Western blots were developed as films using chemiluminescence (Tropix, Bedford, MA). For densitometry a Dextra DF-2400T scanner (Dextra Technology Corp., Taipei, Taiwan) and SigmaScan/Image Software (Jandel Corp., San Rafael, CA) were used. DNA sequence analysis was performed on a Vistra DNA sequencer 725 using the automated Δtaq sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Protein A-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden), n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (octyl glucoside) from Sigma, and E. coli phospholipids from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). All plasmids used for this study are described in Table I. The construction of plasmids that allow the overexpression of SecYEG, (His)6-tagged SecYEG (20van der Does C. Manting E.H.

Cysteines were introduced in SecY TMS 7 by a two-step polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. To facilitate the screening for correct mutants, cysteine mutagenesis was accompanied by the GGT → GGA (G350G) mutation, leading to the insertion of a Bsp EI restriction site. An amino-terminal (His)6-tag on SecY(I278C) was obtained by cloning the Nco I/Bam HI fragment from pET615 (Table I) into Nco I/Bam HI-digested pET302 (20van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A.

To cover at least two turns of the putative α-helical structure, 8 residues in TMS 7 (Val274-Ser281) were mutagenized to cysteine residues (Fig.1). Substitutions of two of these residues that face the same side of the helix, Val274 and Ile278, have been reported to give rise to suppressor phenotypes (37Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The mutant secY genes were cloned in pET602, a vector that allows overexpression of cysteine-less SecYEG, which is functionally indistinguishable from normal SecYEG (38Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although the expression of SecYEG was similar with all TMS 7 mutants (Fig. 2 A), there was a pronounced increase in SecA ATPase activity with SecY(I278C)EG IMVs (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, this resulted in increased translocation of the preprotein proOmpA (Fig. 2 C). To test whether the increased activity of the SecY(I278C)EG complex affected its specificity, we examined the translocation of Δ8proOmpA, a variant precursor carrying a defective signal sequence due to the deletion of Ile8 (41Tanji Y. Gennity J. Pollitt S. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that is efficiently translocated by PrlA4 IMVs (32van der Wolk J.P.W. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This precursor was transported only into the SecY(I278C)EG IMVs (Fig. 2 D), demonstrating that the I278C mutation causes a loss of specificity for the signal sequence. Apparently, the introduction of cysteines at the other positions of SecY TMS 7, including Val274, did not alter the activity or specificity of translocase.Figure 2Overexpression and activity of the SecY TMS 7 cysteine mutants. A, isolated IMVs containing overexpressed normal SecYEG (lane 1), cysteine-less SecYEG (lane 2), or SecYEG with unique cysteines at positions 274–281 of SecY TMS 7 (lanes 3–10) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. B, SecA ATPase activity in the presence of urea-treated IMVs was measured in the absence (open bars) and presence (black bars) of proOmpA, as described previously (20van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Data represent the average of two experiments, IMVs are numbered as in A. C, translocation of [35S]methionine-labeled proOmpA with urea-treated IMVs (20 μg/ml) in the presence of SecA (10 μg/ml) and ATP (2 mm). Reactions (50 μl) were stopped after 20 min by chilling on ice and protease K treatment, yielding protease-protected proOmpA which is partially processed to OmpA by endogenous leader peptidase. D, translocation of [35S]methionine-labeled Δ8proOmpA, carrying a defective signal sequence using the conditions described under C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With the PrlA4 suppressor, which contains the F286Y substitution in TMS 7 and I408N in TMS 10, an increased affinity for SecA was observed as compared with normal PrlA (SecY). The difference in SecA binding is even larger upon the addition of ATP, which lowers the affinity, but to a much lesser extent with PrlA4 (32van der Wolk J.P.W. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since SecY(I278C) allows translocation of Δ8proOmpA, we compared the binding of SecA to IMVs containing overproduced SecYEG, cysteine-less SecYEG or SecY(I278C)EG (Fig.3). As expected from their similar activity (Fig. 2), the binding of SecA to SecYEG or cysteine-less SecYEG was nearly identical (Fig. 3 A, closed bars) and was reduced to the same level in the presence of ATP (open bars). In contrast, the binding of SecA to SecY(I278C)EG IMVs was significantly higher and was only slightly reduced in the presence of ATP. Using a concentration range of SecA, we determined the affinity of SecA binding to the IMVs containing cysteine-less SecYEG (Fig.3 B) or SecY(I278C)EG (Fig. 3 C) by Scatchard analysis (42Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17803) Google Scholar). IMVs contained 2.1–2.4 μm/mg high affinity SecA-binding sites, a 25–30-fold increase as compared with IMVs harboring endogenous levels of SecYEG (80 nm/mg; Ref.32van der Wolk J.P.W. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). SecA binds to overproduced cysteine-less SecYEG with a Kd of 4 nm in the absence and a Kd of 16 nm in the presence of ATP. These affinities are somewhat higher, but comparable, to those observed with endogenous SecYEG, i.e. 7 nm without and 24 nm with ATP (32van der Wolk J.P.W. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and confirm that SecYEG is functionally overexpressed. Compared with cysteine-less SecYEG, the affinity of SecA binding to SecY(I278C)EG was 2.5-fold higher in the absence of ATP (Kd = 1.6 nm) and 5.7-fold higher in the presence of ATP (Kd = 2.8 nm). These data demonstrate that the SecY(I278C) mutation results in an increased affinity of the SecYEG complex for SecA, especially in the presence of ATP. With PrlA4, SecA binding occurs with a Kd of 1.4 nm in the absence and a Kd of 3.6 in the presence of ATP. The increased affinity leads to a decreased rejection of SecA-precursor complexes, and less dissociation of SecA during translocation (32van der Wolk J.P.W. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We propose that the same phenomenon is responsible for the increased translocation activity and lowered specificity of SecY(I278C). To study the translocation activity of the purified SecY(I278C)EG complex, a (His)6-tag was positioned at the amino terminus of SecY. The complex was then overexpressed, purified, and reconstituted as described previously (20van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). (His)6SecY(I278C)EG proteoliposomes were compared with those reconstituted with the same amount of normal (His)6SecYEG. As observed with IMVs, the proOmpA-stimulated ATPase activity was highest with SecY(I278C)EG proteoliposomes (Fig. 4 A, closed bars). However, when Δ8proOmpA was used in the translocation reaction, hardly any stimulation of the SecA translocation ATPase activity was observed (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, the amounts of translocated precursor were visualized by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against OmpA. Quantitative analysis of these blots demonstrated that after 20 min only a minor fraction (<0.5%) of the Δ8proOmpA was translocated in SecY(I278)EG proteoliposomes, as compared with normal proOmpA (about 25%) (Fig. 4, B and C, closed symbols). To demonstrate that the translocated protein was truly Δ8proOmpA, and not the result of an impurity with endogenous proOmpA from the host strain used for purification, we repeated the experiment with in vitro synthesized and purified [35S]methionine-labeled Δ8proOmpA (Fig. 4 D). This clearly showed that purified SecY(I278C)EG allows the translocation of this defective precursor. The sensitivity of the autoradiograms (Fig. 4 D) was somewhat higher than that obtained by Western blots (Fig. 4 C) and revealed a minimal level of Δ8proOmpA translocation with normal SecYEG, confirming in vivo data (41Tanji Y. Gennity J. Pollitt S. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the absence of reducing agents, proOmpA is blocked for further translocation at the position of a disulfide-bond between two unique cysteine residues (Cys290 and Cys302) in its carboxyl terminus (9Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 43Tani K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17341-17347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In proteoliposomes, this results in the accumulation of a 31-kDa translocation intermediate (I31) (Fig. 4 E). This intermediate occupies the translocation sites and blocks them for a second round of translocation (Ref. 22Bassilana M. Wickner W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2626-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and data not shown). With the normal proteoliposomes, maximal I31 translocation was reached after 10 min, whereas proteoliposomes with SecY(I278C) accumulated maximal amounts within the first 5 min of the translocation reaction (Fig. 4 E). SecY(I278C) did not allow the full-length translocation of oxidized proOmpA and thus differs in this respect from PrlA4 (33Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The fast kinetics of the translocation reaction with SecY(I278C), as compared with normal SecY, is apparent from the initial rate of translocation (Fig. 4 B) and the shorter time required to saturate the translocation sites with I31 (Fig.4 E). The experiments with proteoliposomes demonstrate that the SecY(I278C) mutation stimulates SecA- and ATP-driven translocation, and that this effect does not require proteinaceous factors other than the SecYEG complex. In addition, SecY(I278C) enforces the translocation of Δ8proOmpA with purified translocase. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to assay the stability of translocase-precursor complexes formed during ongoing translocation or at halted stages of the translocation reaction. Proteoliposomes were incubated with SecA and proOmpA in the absence of ATP (targeting of SecA and the precursor), the presence of ATP (ongoing translocation), or with ATP under oxidizing conditions (blocked translocation, yielding I31). The proteoliposomes were then harvested by centrifugation and solubilized in the detergent octyl glucoside. Samples were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antiserum against SecA or SecY, and co-precipitation of proOmpA was visualized by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody against OmpA (Fig.5 A). No, or only very little, interaction between proOmpA and either SecY or SecA was observed with normal translocase after incubation in the absence of ATP (lanes 1 and 7). After translocation under reducing conditions, a fraction of proOmpA was associated with SecY but not with SecA (lanes 2 and 8). Apparently, SecA has dissociated from these SecYEG-precursor complexes. Only after translocation of I31, fully stable translocase-precursor complexes were formed (lanes 3 and 9). In contrast, SecY(I278C) translocase-precursor complexes were precipitated independent of the preincubation (lanes 4–6 and 10–12). Only immunoprecipitation with anti-SecYE serum yielded a significantly lowered amount of proOmpA after incubation in the absence of ATP (lane 4). Antibodies against SecY interfere with SecA binding (44Watanabe M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1895-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 45Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and therefore may destabilize translocase. In conclusion, SecY(I278C) translocase-precursor complexes are more stable than their counterparts containing normal SecY. Wild-type translocase is, however, stabilized by the I31translocation intermediate. This is consistent with experiments in IMVs that suggest a stable association of this intermediate with SecA at translocation sites (9Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The E. coli translocase is composed of the SecA ATPase bound to a transmembrane protein conducting channel with SecY and SecE as core components (19Brundage L.A. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and with SecG as an additional subunit (14Nishiyama K.-i. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3409-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,21Hanada M. Nishiyama K.-i. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23625-23631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identification and reconstitution of its minimal constituents (19Brundage L.A. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23625-23631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have made translocase an intriguing model to study subunit dynamics in a membrane protein complex. To allow site-directed labeling of functionally important regions in translocase and to detect specific intermolecular contacts, we have employed cysteine mutagenesis of regions in SecY and SecE that contain clusters of prlA or prlG suppressor mutations, respectively (31Flower A.M. Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 37Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 38Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). From the single cysteine mutants at positions 274–281 of SecY TMS 7, the I278C substitution resulted in an increased translocation activity and gave rise to in vitro defective signal sequence suppression, as measured by the translocation of Δ8proOmpA. Previously, prlA suppressor mutations have been identified that lead to substitutions of I278 for Ser (prlA202, 203, 204, and 207), Asn (prlA208), or Thr (prlA303) residues (37Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It thus seems that Ile278 is a hot spot for such suppressor mutations. SecY(V274C) did not alter the activity and specificity of translocase, although prlA suppressor mutations have been identified that result in a V274G substitution (prlA1, 2, 5 and 201; Ref.37Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Apparently, the amino acid substitutions that give rise to prl suppression depend not only on the position but also on the nature of the substituted amino acid. We have also constructed plasmids that allowed co-overexpression of the SecY mutants with cysteines at positions 105–109 of SecE TMS 3. Although synthetic lethality was observed between prlA208 (I278N) and prlG1 (L108R) (31Flower A.M. Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), none of the combined mutants yielded cross-links between SecY and SecE upon oxidation (data not shown). This implies that synthetic lethality does not necessarily result from a direct interaction between two amino acids. One of the earliest identified prlA suppressor mutations is prlA4 (24Emr S.D. Hanley-Way S. Silhavy T.J. Cell. 1980; 23: 79-88Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Its suppressor phenotype is caused by the I408N substitution in SecY TMS 10, but this mutation is generally accompanied by the F286Y substitution in TMS 7 or, with prlA6, S188L in TMS 5 (37Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 46Stader J. Benson S.A. Silhavy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15075-15080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Sako T. Iino T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5389-5391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apparently unavoidable occurrence of secondary mutations may reflect a detrimental effect of the I408N substitution on the E. coli cell. SecA binds to PrlA4 with an increased affinity, and this results in a decreased rejection of SecA and the preprotein at the onset of translocation (32van der Wolk J.P.W. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We now report on a similar phenomenon with SecY carrying the I278C amino acid substitution in TMS 7 in a cysteine-less background. This mutant supports an increased translocase activity and translocates Δ8proOmpA, carrying a defective signal sequence. As the activity of cysteine-less SecYEG is indistinguishable from normal SecYEG (this study and Ref. 38Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the I278C mutation appears solely responsible for the observed phenotype (see Fig. 2 D). Using affinity blotting, the amino-terminal half of SecY was detected as a binding site for SecA (48Snyders S. Ramamurhty V. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11302-11306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The increased affinity for SecA caused by this I278C substitution, however, indicates that SecY TMS 7 also serves as a site of interaction with SecA. Alternatively, this mutation affects binding of SecA to the amino-terminal half of SecY. Our data support a model in which prlA suppression is the result of improved binding between SecA and SecY. This will optimize the translocation of normal preproteins due to a better targeting of SecA to SecYEG and less dissociation of the translocase components during ATP-driven translocation. At the same time, it lowers the proofreading activity of translocase as SecA carrying a defective preprotein is less easily rejected from translocation sites at the onset of translocation, likely upon the binding of ATP. Since proton-motive force-driven translocation is prevented by the presence of SecA (9Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), an increased affinity for SecA may explain why PrlA suppressors render the translocation reaction proton-motive force-independent (33Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The stabilization of translocase-precursor complexes by SecY(I278C) during translocation was directly demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. With normal SecY, a soluble translocase-precursor complex required the presence of a stable translocation intermediate I31. No complexes between SecA or SecY with the precursor were observed after incubation in the absence of ATP, and SecA readily dissociated from the complex during an ongoing translocation reaction. With SecY(I278), translocase-preprotein complexes were completely stable after incubation under translocating conditions, as compared with complexes with trapped I31. Incubation in the absence of ATP yielded complexes that were susceptible for dissociation by an antibody against SecY. This suggests that the SecYEG channel alters its conformation during translocation, rendering the interaction with SecA and the preprotein more stable. This conformational change may involve subunit rearrangements, or channel “opening,” as has been observed with the Sec61p complex during translocation (49Hamman B.D. Chen J.-C. Johnson E.E. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1997; 89: 535-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 50Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Whereas increased SecA binding is a clear phenotype of both PrlA4 and SecY(I278C), they are functionally different in two aspects. First, PrlA4 allows translocation of a disulfide bonded loop of 10 amino acids in the mature region of proOmpA (33Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas SecY(I278C) does not (Fig. 4 E). Second, PrlA4 supports increased translocation with a lowered SecA ATPase activity (32van der Wolk J.P.W. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereas with SecY(I278C), the increased translocation is accompanied by a concomitant increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis by SecA. The affinity of PrlA4 and SecY(I278C) for SecA is hardly different and we therefore hypothesize that PrlA4 and SecY(I278C) differ mechanistically. Suppressor mutations in SecY TMS 10 appear to strongly affect the interaction with SecE TMS 3 (31Flower A.M. Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,37Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As conformational changes in SecE TMS 3 and SecA membrane cycling are interrelated (38Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the I408N mutation in PrlA4 may slow the SecA reaction cycle due to an altered interaction with SecE. A slowed ATPase activity has been proposed as a mechanism for prlD (secA) suppression by increasing the lifetime of SecA-preprotein complexes during translocation (27Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3518-3526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With PrlA4, improved SecA binding to the SecYEG complex at the same time makes translocation highly efficient. We propose that SecY(I278C) is a milder suppressor than PrlA4 because it does not affect the SecA reaction cycle. Extensive biochemical analysis of other Prl suppressors will unravel more of the mechanistic aspects underlying signal sequence recognition and the activity of translocase."

In contrast, eukaryotes possess two specific enzymes providing carbamoyl phosphate; one for aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase, EC 2.1.3.2) in the pyrimidine pathway, and the other for ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTCase, EC 2.1.3.3) in the arginine pathway or urea cycle. Although in prokaryotes these enzymes are independent monofunctional proteins (4Trotta P.P. Burt M.E. Haschemeyer R.H. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2599-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), some of them are consolidated into multifunctional proteins in eukaryotes (5Stark G.R. Trends Biol. Sci. 1977; 2: 64-66Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The best known example of such an organization is the mammalian CAD protein that catalyzes the first three reactions of the pyrimidine pathway, thus carrying the CPSase, ATCase, and the dihydroorotase (DHOase, EC 3.5.2.3) activities (6Shoaf W.T.

These enzymatic activities correspond to different protein domains that can be dissociated through mild proteolysis without loss of catalytic activity (9Davidson J.N. Rumsby P.C. Tamaren J. J. Biol.

The complex reaction catalyzed by CPSases proceeds through three steps (12Anderson P.M. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Meister A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

This classical scheme has recently been challenged (14Kothe M. Eroglu B. Mazza H. Samudera H. Powers-Lee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12348-12353Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) by a novel “nucleotide switch” mechanism in which the second ATP triggers a conformational change that allows the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate to occur at a single site. CPSase can either use ammonia provided exogenously or endogenous ammonia produced by glutamine hydrolysis (13Meister A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 315-374PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of glutamine requires the presence of a glutamine amidotransferase domain, which is either part of the same polypeptide (eukaryotes) (6Shoaf W.T. Jones M.E.

Chem. 1983; 258: 14466-14477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two domains corresponding to the two halves of the synthetase domain are called CPS.A and CPS.B. Unexpectedly, it was recently discovered (23Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 13762-13769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that each of these two domains of CAD CPSase are able to independently catalyze the formation of carbamoyl phosphate. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the multifunctional protein that catalyzes the first steps of the pyrimidine pathway, possesses only the CPSase and the ATCase domains (15Souciet J.-L. Nagy M. Legouar M. Lacroute F. Potier S. Gene. 1989; 79: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Lue P. Kaplan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Trans. 1993; 21: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, it also contains an inactive domain (pDHO) homologous (15Souciet J.-L. Nagy M. Legouar M. Lacroute F. Potier S. Gene. 1989; 79: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (50Williams N.K. O'Donoghue S. Christopherson R.I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 370: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) to functional DHOases. The three domains of this protein are linked in the same order as in CAD, that is CPSase, pDHOase, and ATCase (Fig.1). In terms of allosteric regulation, the yeast complex also shows properties that are intermediary between those of bacteria and mammals (Fig. 1). In the yeast complex, both CPSase and ATCase are sensitive to feedback inhibition by UTP (26Kaplan J. Denis-Duphil M. Lacroute F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 119: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Aitken D. Bhatti A. Kaplan J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 309: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whereas in CAD only the CPSase activity responds to this allosteric effector (28Levine R.L. Hoogenraad N.J. Kretchmer N. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, the CPSase activity of CAD is activated by 5′-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (29Tatibana M. Shigesada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a metabolite that has no influence on the yeast enzyme. Both multifunctional proteins exhibit channeling of carbamoyl phosphate from the CPSase catalytic site where it is synthesized to that of ATCase where it is used as a substrate (30Christopherson R.I. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11381-11395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Belkaid M. Penverne B. Herve G. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for the formation of carbamoyl aspartate. In this study, a recombinant plasmid encoding a truncated yeast multifunctional protein (CBApD) lacking the glutamine amidotransferase and CPS.A domains was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. Unlike the mammalian constructs thus far studied, the yeast CPS.B domain in this protein remains fused through the pDHO to the ATCase domain. The analysis of its functional properties showed that, indeed the CPS.B domain is enzymatically active and that many of the interdomain interactions responsible for regulation and channeling persist in the construct. The yeast pDHO and ATCase coding sequences were inserted into a vector derived from pEK81 (35Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insert is located immediately downstream of the pyr BI promoter, which controls the expression of E. coli ATCase. The plasmid pC4 (4.0-kb) is a derivative of pRS315 (36Sikorski R. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the ura 2 gene (37Jaquet L. Serre V. Lollier M. Penverne B. Herve G. Souciet J.L. Potier S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 639-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The E. coli mutant L673 strain (38Guillou F. Rubino S.D. Markovitz R.S. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8304-8308Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), defective in car A and car B, as well as the Lon-protease, was a gift from Dr. Carol Lusty (Public Health Research Institute of the City of New York). The genes car A and car B encode the small and large subunits of E. coli carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, respectively. The yeast strain MD171-1C (a, cpa2, ura3, fur4), isolated by M. Dennis-Duphil (University of Toulouse, France) was derived from the wild-type strains FL-100 and from FL-233-3C (39Lacroute F. Pierard A. Grenson M. Wiame J.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1965; 40: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and lacks the arginine-specific CPSase. Transformation and preparation of competent E. coli cells was carried out by the Hanahan procedure (40Hanahan D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 1. IRL Press, New York1985Google Scholar). DNA fragments were gel-purified following electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose by extraction onto glass beads (Gene Clean kit). Restriction digests, ligations, and other DNA methods were carried out using standard protocols (41Maniatis T. Fritsch E.R. Sambrook I. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Cells harboring the recombinant plasmid were routinely grown from a single colony in 2 × YT medium supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin. For induction of recombinant proteins under control of the pyr BI promoter, the transformed L673 cells were grown in a minimal medium consisting of 6 g/liter Na2HPO4, 3 g/liter KH2PO4, 1 g/liter NH4Cl, 5 g/liter casamino acids (DIFCO 0230), 4 g/liter glucose, 0.5 mg/liter ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.5 mg/ml FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 1 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 10 mg/liter tryptophan, supplemented with 12 mg/liter uracil and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Under these conditions, there is sufficient uracil to sustain growth for about 19–21 h, after which time, growth is slowed and the recombinant protein is expressed. Growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. The cells were harvested in late exponential phase or early stationary phase by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 30 min in a Centrikon T-124 centrifuge. The cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and disrupted by sonication three times for 1 min on ice, using a Biosonik III sonifier set at 20,000 kHz. The sonicate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. These extracts were dialyzed to eliminate all the metabolites, including nucleotides, which might interfere with enzyme determinations. The yeast strain MD171-1C was grown (32Penverne B. Belkaid M. Herve G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as described previously. The 5.6-kb plasmid pHL-Y12, which encodes the pDHO and ATCase domains of yeast, is expressed under control of the pyr BI promoter (34Serre V. Guy H.I. Liu X. Penverne B. Herve G. Evans D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The 14.0-kb plasmid pC4-URA2 contains the yeast ura 2 gene encoding the bifunctional CPSase-ATCase complex. The cDNA encoding the CPS.B and part of the pDHO domains was amplified by PCR using pC4-URA2 as a template. The 5′ primer incorporated a Nde I site, whereas the 3′ primer contained a Hpa I site. The primers were designed so that when cleaved with the restriction enzymes, the PCR product could be ligated in frame to the large fragment of pHL-Y12 plasmid cleaved with the same restriction enzymes, resulting in the 7.1-kb recombinant pSV-CBApD. The PCR insert and junctions were sequenced at the Wayne State University Core Facility by the Sanger dideoxy method using 4 complimentary synthetic oligonucleotides and a double-stranded DNA template. The CBApD protein was partially purified by chromatography of 5 ml of dialyzed cell free extracts on a Q-Sepharose fast-flow column equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol (resuspension buffer). The recombinant CBApD was eluted with a linear 0–0.5 m sodium chloride gradient. The ATCase and CPSase activities coeluted and the active fractions were pooled and precipitated with 3.6 m ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in 500 μl of the resuspension buffer, and directly applied to a Sephacryl S-300HR column equilibrated with the same buffer. The active fractions were pooled and stored at −20 °C. The protein was estimated by scanning stained SDS gels to be 30% pure. This preparation was then used to perform all enzymatic assays. Protein concentrations were assayed by the Lowry method (42Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-gel electrophoresis was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gels using the Laemmli procedure (43Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). For analytical gel filtration, the partially purified protein was chromatographed on a 45 × 2-cm calibrated Sephacryl S-300 column equilibrated with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The elution volume was determined by assaying CPSase activity. The ATCase activity was assayed as described by Denis-Duphil et al. (44Denis-Duphil M. Mathien-Shire Y. Herve G. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The standard conditions used were 30 mm [14C]aspartate (0.03 μCi/μmol), 10 mm carbamoyl phosphate, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The assays were conducted at 30 °C for 10 min. The CPSase activity of the CBApD complex was assayed in the presence of 5 μg of E. coli ATCase catalytic subunits to efficiently trap all the unstable carbamoyl phosphate formed. The standard conditions used were 50 mmTris-Ac, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 100 mmNH4Cl, 150 mm [14C]sodium bicarbonate (0.168 μCi/μmol), 20 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm ATP, and 50 mm aspartate. The assays were conducted at 30 °C for 30 min. It was verified that the E. coli ATCase activity present in the extracts of L673 cells was negligible compared with the activity resulting from the expression of the recombinant. For some experiments, the carbamoyl phosphate formation was measured directly by converting the product to urea (78Shaw S.M. Carrey E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity and the utilization of ATP in the overall reactions were assayed by measuring the time-dependent accumulation of ADP using a coupled enzymatic assay described previously (45Guy H.I. Schmitt B. Herve G. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14172-14178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 69Post L.E. Post D.J. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7742-7747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall CPSase-ATCase activity of CBApD complex was assayed using the standard conditions described above but without the addition of E. coli ATCase catalytic subunits. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of protein that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of carbamoyl aspartate in 1 h. The sensitivity of CPSase and ATCase to the feedback inhibitor UTP was assayed under the standard conditions described above in the presence of varying concentrations of this effector. The channeling of carbamoyl phosphate from the catalytic site of CPSase to that of ATCase was examined in two ways (31Belkaid M. Penverne B. Herve G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Penverne B. Belkaid M. Herve G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the overall CPSase-ATCase reaction of the truncated yeast protein was measured in the presence of saturating concentrations of CPSase substrates and aspartate as described above. These experiments were designed to determine the transient time (τ), a measure of the time necessary to reach the steady state phase of the coupled reaction (32Penverne B. Belkaid M. Herve G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 46Easterby J. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Isotopic dilution by exogenously added unlabeled carbamoyl phosphate of the [14C]carbamoyl phosphate synthesized by CPSase was measured as described previously (32Penverne B. Belkaid M. Herve G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The coupled assays were conducted under the same conditions that were used for assaying CPSase activity. For comparison, channeling was also measured in permeabilized yeast cells, strain MD171-1C, in the presence of saturating ornithine, so that carbamoyl phosphate must diffuse through the aqueous phase to OTCase. Partially purified proteins or E. coli cell extracts would have been ideal controls but the yeast complex has not been expressed in E. coli. The region of the ura 2 cDNA sequence extending from nucleotides 3776 to 5763, which encodes the CPS.B domain and part of the pDHO, was amplified by PCR using the plasmid pC4 as a template. The 5′ primer incorporated a Nde I site, whereas the 3′ primer had a Hpa I site. The PCR product was purified and then cleaved with these two restriction enzymes. The 5.6-kb plasmid pHL-Y12 (34Serre V. Guy H.I. Liu X. Penverne B. Herve G. Evans D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which encodes the yeast pDHO and ATCase domains, was cleaved with Nde I and Hpa I, and the linear fragment was gel-purified and ligated to the PCR product. The fidelity of the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the insert and all of the junctions. The resulting 7.1-kb pSV-CBApD plasmid was transformed into the E. coli strain L673, a uridine auxotroph that lacks the carA and carB genes encoding the small and large subunits of E. coli CPSase, respectively. The pSV-CBApD recombinant plasmid encodes a protein, CBApD, that possesses the C-terminal half of CPSase (CB), beginning at methionine 962 (ura 2 numbering), linked to the pDHO (pD) and the ATCase (A) domains.E. coli L673 cells were transformed with pSV-CBApD and grown under various conditions including the presence and absence of uracil and arginine. Remarkably, transformants were able to grow in the absence of these two metabolites, a result which indicated that the cells were able to synthesize carbamoyl phosphate. The strict requirement for these metabolites for the growth of the untransformed L673 strain was verified. These results indicate that CB, the C-terminal half of the CPSase synthetase domain is able to produce carbamoyl phosphate. Indeed, the cell-free extract of the transformed strain exhibits appreciable carbamoyl phosphate synthesizing activity (0.085 μmol·mg−1h−1). The CBApD protein, purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” had a specific enzymatic activity of CPSase and ATCase of 0.34 μmol·mg−1 h−1and 3 μmol·mg−1 h−1, respectively. The molecular mass of the protein determined under denaturing conditions by electrophoresis on calibrated SDS gels was 136 kDa. The size of the oligomer was estimated by gel filtration to be 814 kDa indicating that the protein is probably a hexamer. Initial analysis of cell extracts of the L673 transformants, demonstrated that CBApD requires (TableI) all of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase substrates. Because the protein lacks the glutamine amidotransferase domain, the CPSase activity is dependent on the presence of NH4Cl as a nitrogen donating substrate. The residual activity, which is observed in the presence of glutamine, probably results from hydrolysis by endogenous glutaminases, which are present in the extract as previously observed (31Belkaid M. Penverne B. Herve G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 47Robin J.P. Penverne B. Herve G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because the CPSase activity is measured using the CPSase-ATCase coupled assay in this experiment, aspartate is also required.Table IRequirements for the carbamoyl phosphate synthesizing activity present in L673 (pSV-CB ApD)Incubation mediumCarbamoyl phosphate synthesized%Complete100ATP-Mg0NH4Cl2.9NH4Cl + glutamine11.4Aspartate0The production of carbamoyl phosphate was assayed using the coupled assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” The complete incubation medium contained 50 mm Tris-Ac, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 100 mm NH4Cl, 150 mm [14C]sodium bicarbonate, 10 mmATP, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm aspartate, and 5 μg of E. coli catalytic subunits (to efficiently trap all the unstable carbamoyl phosphate formed). The control in the absence of bicarbonate was not performed since the enzymatic assay requires the addition of [14C]sodium bicarbonate. Open table in a new tab The production of carbamoyl phosphate was assayed using the coupled assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” The complete incubation medium contained 50 mm Tris-Ac, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 100 mm NH4Cl, 150 mm [14C]sodium bicarbonate, 10 mmATP, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm aspartate, and 5 μg of E. coli catalytic subunits (to efficiently trap all the unstable carbamoyl phosphate formed). The control in the absence of bicarbonate was not performed since the enzymatic assay requires the addition of [14C]sodium bicarbonate. The CPSase saturation curves of the partially purified CBApD recombinant enzyme for all three substrates are shown in Fig. 2. These curves are hyperbolic in the case of NH4Cl and bicarbonate. The ATP-Mg saturation curve is sigmoidal, as observed for CPSases from other organisms (47Robin J.P. Penverne B. Herve G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 48Anderson P.M. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3164-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 49Tatibana M. Shigesada K. J. Biochem. 1972; 72: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cooperative ATP binding has interesting implications discussed below. The S0.5 for ATP-Mg is 0.31 ± 0.01 mm, a value that is significantly lower than those determined under comparable conditions for the entire CPSase-ATCase yeast complex of 7.5 ± 2 mm (31Belkaid M. Penverne B. Herve G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A significant decrease in this parameter was also observed in the case of the isolated GLN-CPS.B domain of the mammalian CAD protein (23Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 13762-13769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, the apparent Km for the other two substrates are either similar or somewhat higher than the corresponding value obtained for the native molecule. The CBApD protein has apparent Km values of 9.9 ± 1.1 mm and 95 ± 12 mm for bicarbonate and NH4Cl, respectively, as compared with 8 ± 1.7 mm and 30 ± 2 mm for the wild-type yeast complex (31Belkaid M. Penverne B. Herve G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the wild-type yeast bifunctional protein, both CPSase and ATCase activities are feedback inhibited by the end product UTP. The influence of this allosteric effector on the activities of CBApD was investigated, and the results are shown in Fig.3. The effect of UTP on the CPSa"
https://openalex.org/W2312505933,"A germline sequence alteration at codon 1307 of the APC gene (I1307K) has been reported in 6-7% of the Ashkenazi Jewish population in the United States. This alteration is believed to predispose the APC gene to a secondary mutation at the same locus, resulting in an increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. There is an increased risk of colorectal carcinoma in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a relatively large proportion of whom are Ashkenazi Jews. We therefore sought to determine whether the I1307K sequence variant occurred in the germline DNA of IBD patients. To our surprise, we found this sequence in only two of 267 patients with IBD (0.7%), occurring in only 1.5% of Jewish IBD patients. The I1307K sequence variant was not found in 67 patients with esophageal cancer, 53 patients with gastric carcinoma (13 MSI-H and 44 MSI-negative), or ten patients with sporadic MSI-H colon cancer. These findings suggest that the I1307K sequence is relatively rare in the germline of Jewish as well as non-Jewish IBD patients. It does not appear to contribute to the increased colorectal cancer risk present in these patients."
