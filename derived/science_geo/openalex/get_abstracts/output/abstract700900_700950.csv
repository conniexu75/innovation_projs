https://openalex.org/W4296293070,"Abstract Oncogene amplification on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a common event, driving aggressive tumor growth, drug resistance and shorter survival. Currently, the impact of nonchromosomal oncogene inheritance—random identity by descent—is poorly understood. Also unclear is the impact of ecDNA on somatic variation and selection. Here integrating theoretical models of random segregation, unbiased image analysis, CRISPR-based ecDNA tagging with live-cell imaging and CRISPR-C, we demonstrate that random ecDNA inheritance results in extensive intratumoral ecDNA copy number heterogeneity and rapid adaptation to metabolic stress and targeted treatment. Observed ecDNAs benefit host cell survival or growth and can change within a single cell cycle. ecDNA inheritance can predict, a priori, some of the aggressive features of ecDNA-containing cancers. These properties are facilitated by the ability of ecDNA to rapidly adapt genomes in a way that is not possible through chromosomal oncogene amplification. These results show how the nonchromosomal random inheritance pattern of ecDNA contributes to poor outcomes for patients with cancer."

Since 2016, the EV71 vaccine has been promoted in Zhejiang Province. This study aimed to investigate the trend and seasonal variation characteristics of HFMD from 2010 to 2021 and estimate the reduction in enterovirus 71 infection after vaccine use.The data on HFMD cases in Zhejiang Province from January 2010 to December 2021 were obtained from this network system. Individual information on cases and deaths was imported, and surveillance information, including demographic characteristics and temporal distributions, was computed by the system. The Joinpoint regression model was used to describe continuous changes in the incidence trend. The BSTS (Bayesian structural time-series models) model was used to estimate the monthly number of cases from 2017 to 2021 based on the observed monthly incidence during 2010-2016 by accounting for seasonality and long-term trends. The seasonal variation characteristics of HFMD pathogens were detected by wavelet analysis.From 2010 to 2021, the annual incidence rate fluctuated between 98.81 cases per 100,000 in 2020 and 435.63 cases per 100,000 in 2018, and 1711 severe HFMD cases and 106 fatal cases were reported in Zhejiang Province, China. The annual percent change (APC) in EV71 cases was -30.72% (95% CI: -45.10 to -12.50) from 2016 to 2021. The wavelet transform of total incidence and number of cases of the three pathogens all showed significant periodicity on the 1-year scale. The average 2-year scale periodicity was significant for the total incidence, EV71 cases and Cox A16 cases, but the other enterovirus cases showed significant periodicity on the 30-month scale. The 6-month scale periodicity was significant for the total incidence, EV71 case and Cox A16 case but not for the other enteroviruses case. The relative error percentage of the performance of the BSTS model was 0.3%. The estimated number of cases from 2017 to 2021 after the EV-A71 vaccines were used was 9422, and the reduction in the number of cases infected with the EV71 virus was 73.43% compared to 70.80% when the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 was excluded.Since 2010, the incidence of EV71 infections has shown an obvious downward trend. All types of viruses showed significant periodicity on the 1-year scale. The periodicity of the biennial peak is mainly related to EV71 and Cox A16 before 2017 and other enteroviruses since 2018. The half-year peak cycle of HFMD was mainly caused by EV71 and Cox A6 infection. The expected incidence will be 2.76 times(include the cases of 2020) and 2.43 times(exclude the cases of 2020) higher than the actual value assuming that the measures of vaccination are not taken. EV71 vaccines are very effective and should be administered in the age window between 5 months and 5 years."
https://openalex.org/W4296800340,"The reemergence of monkeypoxvirus (MPXV) in 2017 after about 39 years of no reported cases in Nigeria, and the recent incidence in countries such as the United States of America, United Kingdom, Singapore, and Israel which have been reportedly linked with travelers from Africa, have heightened concern that MPXV may have emerged to occupy the vacant ecological and immunological niche created by the extinct smallpox virus. This study was carried out to identify environmental conditions and areas that are environmentally suitable (risky areas) for MPXV in southern Nigeria. One hundred and sixteen (116) spatially unique MPXV occurrence data from 2017-2021 and corresponding environmental variables were spatially modeled by a maximum entropy algorithm to evaluate the contribution of the variables to the distribution of the viral disease. A variance inflation analysis was adopted to limit the number of environmental variables and minimize multicollinearity. The five variables that contributed to the suitability model for MPXV disease are precipitation of driest quarter (47%), elevation (26%), human population density (17%), minimum temperature in December (7%), and maximum temperature in March (3%). For validation, our model had a high AUC value of 0.92 and standard deviation of 0.009 indicating that it had excellent ability to predict the suitable areas for monkeypox disease. Categorized risk classes across southern states was also identified. A total of eight states were predicted to be at high risk of monkeypox outbreak occurrence. These findings can guide policymakers in resources allocation and distribution to effectively implement targeted control measures for MPXV outbreaks in southern Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W4296328405,"Background Medical undergraduates are at high risk of COVID-19 infection. Thus, conformance to healthy practices is advised to reduce disease transmission and control the current epidemic. The present study aimed to explore the relationship of knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) related to COVID-19 precautionary measures with the frequency of infection among medical students at an Egyptian University. Methods A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted on 404 undergraduate medical students from different grades using a web-based self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Results More than one-third of medical students (37.4%) were previously infected with COVID-19, where the majority (60.5%) were diagnosed with relevant signs and symptoms. Medical students with low levels of KAP experienced higher frequencies of infection than did other students. A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between the number of previous COVID-19 infections among medical students and their knowledge and attitude scores toward COVID-19. In addition, a statistically significant positive correlation was noted among KAP scores ( P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion Improving the knowledge, attitude, and conformance of medical students to precautionary measures toward COVID-19 may substantially reduce the risk and frequency of infection and, hence, reduce community transmission."

The present study aimed to estimate the change in osteoarthritis prevalence among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.This repeated cross-sectional study was conducted through telephone interviews among older adults aged 60 years and above on two successive occasions (October 2020 and September 2021) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The prevalence of osteoarthritis was measured by asking the participants if they had osteoarthritis or joint pain problems.A total of 2077 participants (1032 in 2020-survey and 1045 in 2021-survey) participated in the study. The prevalence of self-reported joint pains or osteoarthritis significantly increased from 45.3% in 2020 to 54.7% in 2021 (P = 0.006), with an increasing odd in the adjusted analysis (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04-1.54). We also found that osteoarthritis prevalence significantly increased among the participants from the Chattogram and Mymensingh divisions, aged 60-69 years, males, married, rural residents, and living with a family. A significant increase was also documented among those who received formal schooling, had a family income of 5000-10000 BDT, resided with a large family, were unemployed or retired, and lived away from a health facility.Our study reported a significant increased prevalence of osteoarthritis among older adults from 2020 to 2021 during this pandemic in Bangladesh. This study highlights the need for the development and implementation of initiatives for the screening and management of osteoarthritis through a primary health care approach during any public health emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W4296179733,"1-Octen-3-ol is a volatile oxylipin found ubiquitously in Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. The biosynthetic pathway forming 1-octen-3-ol from linoleic acid via the linoleic acid 10(S)-hydroperoxide was characterized 40 years ago in mushrooms, yet the enzymes involved are not identified. The dioxygenase 1 and 2 genes (Ccdox1 and Ccdox2) in the mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea contain an N-terminal cyclooxygenase-like heme peroxidase domain and a C-terminal cytochrome P450-related domain. Herein, we show that recombinant CcDOX1 is responsible for dioxygenation of linoleic acid to form the 10(S)-hydroperoxide, the first step in 1-octen-3-ol synthesis, whereas CcDOX2 conceivably forms linoleic acid 8-hydroperoxide. We demonstrate that KO of the Ccdox1 gene suppressed 1-octen-3-ol synthesis, although added linoleic acid 10(S)-hydroperoxide was still efficiently converted. The P450-related domain of CcDOX1 lacks the characteristic Cys heme ligand and the evidence indicates that a second uncharacterized enzyme converts the 10(S)-hydroperoxide to 1-octen-3-ol. Additionally, we determined the gene KO strain (ΔCcdox1) was less attractive to fruit fly larvae, while the feeding behavior of fungus gnats on ΔCcdox1 mycelia showed little difference from that on the mycelia of the WT strain. The proliferation of fungivorous nematodes on ΔCcdox1 mycelia was similar to or slightly worse than that on WT mycelia. Thus, 1-octen-3-ol seems to be an attractive compound involved in emitter–receiver ecological communication in mushrooms. 1-Octen-3-ol is a volatile oxylipin found ubiquitously in Basidiomycota and Ascomycota.

The proliferation of fungivorous nematodes on ΔCcdox1 mycelia was similar to or slightly worse than that on WT mycelia. Thus, 1-octen-3-ol seems to be an attractive compound involved in emitter–receiver ecological communication in mushrooms. 1-Octen-3-ol is a volatile compound with an earthy and mushroom-like organoleptic property that commonly occurs in nature, such as in mushrooms, molds, and moist air in a laurel forest. It is also found in human breath and sweat. It attracts biting insects, such as mosquitoes (1Potter C.J.H. Stop the biting: targeting a mosquito’s sense of smell.Cell. 2014; 156: 878-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An olfactory receptor specific to 1-octen-3-ol has been isolated from malaria-causing mosquitoes (2Takke W. Knols B.G.J. Odor-mediated behavior of afrotropical malaria mosquitoes.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1999; 44: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Despite its familiarity, the details of the biosynthesis of 1-octen-3-ol, as well as its ecological and physiological significance, are not fully understood. The biosynthetic pathway for 1-octen-3-ol formation in common mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) has been elucidated by Wurzenberger and Grosch (3Wurzenberger M. Grosch W. The enzymic oxidative breakdown of linoleic acid in mushrooms (Psalliota bispora).Z. Lebensm. Unters. Forsch. 1982; 175: 168-190Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Wurzenberger M. Grosch W.

Acta. 1984; 795: 163-165Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Linoleic acid is the substrate, and its stereospecific oxygenation yields the 10(S)-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid (10(S)HPODE) and subsequent cleavage yields (R)-(-)-1-octen-3-ol and 10-oxo-(E)-9-decenoic acid (Fig. 1). The involvement of the 10(S)-isomer as an intermediate to form 1-octen-3-ol from linoleic acid was also confirmed in Lentinula edodes (Shiitake mushroom) and Tricholoma matsutake (Matsutake mushroom) (6Akakabe Y. Matsui K. Kajiwara T. Stereochemical correlation between 10-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid and 1-octen-3-ol in Lentinula edodes and Tricholoma Matsutake mushrooms.Biosci. Biotechnol.

Biochem. 2007; 367: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, despite the efforts of many researchers, the enzymes involved in this biosynthetic pathway have not been identified for 40 years. Filamentous Ascomycota produce an array of oxylipin metabolites called precocious sexual inducer (psi) factors, which function as hormone-like signals. Psi-producing oxygenases (Ppos) are responsible for the biosynthesis of psi factors (8Tsitsigiannis D.I. Kowieski T.M. Zarnowski R. Keller N.P.

Fatty acid dioxygenase-cytochrome P450 fusion enzymes of filamentous fungal pathogens.Fungal. Genet. Biol. 2021; 157: 103623Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Each Ppo is a fusion protein consisting of a cyclooxygenase (COX)-like domain at its N terminus and cytochrome P450-like domain at the C terminus. The COX domain catalyzes a dioxygenase (DOX) reaction with unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid and oleic acid, and the P450-like domain catalyzes a rearrangement reaction with the fatty acid hydroperoxide formed by the COX domain (10Brodhun F. Feussner I. Oxylipins in fungi.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 1047-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 11Oliw E.H. Fatty acid dioxygenase-cytochrome P450 fusion enzymes of filamentous fungal pathogens.Fungal. Genet. Biol. 2021; 157: 103623Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The filamentous Ascomycota have several subtypes of Ppos, such as PpoA, B, C, or D, which show diversity in the position of oxygenation on fatty acid substrates, catalyzed by the COX domain and the mode of the rearrangement of hydroperoxides thus formed, which is catalyzed by the P450 domain (10Brodhun F. Feussner I. Oxylipins in fungi.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 1047-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 11Oliw E.H. Fatty acid dioxygenase-cytochrome P450 fusion enzymes of filamentous fungal pathogens.Fungal. Genet. Biol. 2021; 157: 103623Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For example, PpoA, also called linoleate diol synthase, converts linoleic acid to its 8-hydroperoxide, which subsequently isomerizes to form 5,8-dihydroxy or 7,8-dihydroxy linoleic acid (12Brodowsky I.D. Hamberg M. Oliw E.H. A linoleic acid (8R)-dioxygenase and hydroperoxide isomerase of the fungus Gaeumannnomyces graminis.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PpoC from Aspergilli also consists of an N-terminal COX domain and C-terminal P450-like domain. The COX domain accounts for the formation of the 10-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid but the P450-like domain does not rearrange hydroperoxide; thus, PpoC almost exclusively forms the 10-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid (13Brodhun F. Schneider S. Göbel C. Hornung E. Feussner I. PpoC from Aspergillus nidulans is a fusion protein with only one active haem.Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 553-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because of the same position of the hydroperoxide group in linoleic acid, PpoC-like enzymes are expected to be involved in the production of 1-octen-3-ol in filamentous Ascomycota. Disruption of ppoC-like genes in Podospora anserina and Aspergillus luchuensis diminishes their ability to produce 1-octen-3-ol (14Ferrari R. Lacaze I. Le Faouder P. Bertrand-Michel J. Oger C. Galano J.M. et al.Cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase are used by the fungus Podospora anserina to repel nematodes.Biochim. Biophys.

Bioeng. 2020; 129: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, it has not been confirmed whether the ppoC-like genes of P. anserina and A. luchuensis are directly involved in the formation of 1-octen-3-ol because the catalytic properties of these gene products have not been studied. Furthermore, the configuration of the PpoC reaction products from filamentous ascomycetes analyzed to date was 10(R)-hydroperoxide (7Garscha U. Oliw E.H. Steric analysis of 8-hydroxy- and 10-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids and dihydroxyoctadecadienoic acids formed from 8R-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid by hydroperoxide isomerases.Anal. Biochem. 2007; 367: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which was not cleaved to form 1-octen-3-ol by the crude extract prepared from common mushrooms (5Wurzenberger M. Grosch W.

Acta. 1984; 795: 163-165Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To date, four genes with substantial similarities with ascomycete ppos have been reported in Basidiomycota, such as Ustilago maydis and Rhizoctonia solani (16Huber S.M.F.E. Lottspeich F. Kämper J. A gene that encodes a product with similarity to dioxygenases is highly expressed in teliospores of Ustilago maydis.Mol. Genet.

Biosynthesis of oxylipins by Rhizoctonia solani with allene oxide and oleate 8S,9S-diol synthase activities.Lipids. 2018; 53: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar); however, the properties and functions of the enzymes encoded by these basidiomycete genes have never been studied. In this study, we identified two genes, Ccdox1 and Ccdox2, in the genome of the model basidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea, which shares homology with ppos from filamentous ascomycetes. C. cinerea, commonly known as the gray shag, is a model multicellular basidiomycete that completes its entire life cycle through a sexual cycle within 2 weeks in the laboratory (18Kües U. Life history and developmental processes in the basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 316-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A rich genetic resource, with genome sequences, morphological and developmental mutants, and DNA markers, is available for the mushroom. C. cinerea is relatively easy to genetically transform, and a procedure for targeted gene disruption has been established (19Stajich J.E. Wilke S.K. Ahrén D. Pukkila P.J. Insights into evolution of multicellular fungi from the assembled chromosomes of the mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea (Coprinus cinereus).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 11889-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We characterized the enzymatic properties of recombinant CcDOX1 and CcDOX2 expressed in insect cells. Ccdox1 gene was disrupted through homologous recombination to confirm its involvement in 1-octen-3-ol formation. The ecophysiological role of 1-octen-3-ol may confer the benefit of sporophyte dispersal by attracting mosquitoes and flies. 1-Octen-3-ol has also been reported to have behavioral suppression and repellent effects on several arthropods and nematodes (20Inamdar A.A. Morath S. Bennett J.W. Fungal volatile organic compounds: more than just a funky smell?.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 74: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), indicating its potential involvement in the defense against fungivores. However, there is no clear evidence confirming the contribution of 1-octen-3-ol to Basidiomycota. In this study, a C. cinerea strain deficient in the ability to form 1-octen-3-ol was used to examine the ecological and/or physiological significance of 1-octen-3-ol. 1-Octen-3-ol was barely detected in the intact mycelia of C. cinerea (strain ku3-24) grown on yeast extract-malt extract-glucose (YMG) agar plates, but the formation of considerable amounts of 1-octen-3-ol along with 3-octanone, 1-octanol, and 3-methylbutanal was observed within 30 min of damaging the mycelia with freeze-thaw treatment (Fig. 2A). The rapid formation of 1-octen-3-ol was effectively suppressed in the absence of molecular oxygen (Fig. 2B), indicating de novo biosynthesis of 1-octen-3-ol from linoleic acid. Rapid formation of 1-octen-3-ol was also observed when the mycelia were disrupted with a bead crusher, and the formation was suppressed by the addition of Ca2+ chelating reagents, such as BAPTA or EGTA (Fig. 2C). Acetylsalicylic acid, a typical cyclooxygenase inhibitor, also suppressed 1-octen-3-ol formation; however, only minimal suppression was observed with the cyclooxygenase inhibitors ibuprofen and mefenamic acid (Fig. 2D). Because Ppo and lipoxygenase (LOX) have been reported in fungi as enzymes catalyzing the dioxygenation of fatty acids to yield the hydroperoxide derivative (10Brodhun F. Feussner I. Oxylipins in fungi.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 1047-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we assumed that an enzyme similar to Ppo or LOX participated in the first fatty acid oxygenation step in the biosynthetic pathway to form 1-octen-3-ol. When manganese LOX in the filamentous ascomycete Gaeumannomyces graminis var. avenae (oat-take-all root rot fungus) (GenBank, AAK81882.2) (21Hörnsten L. Su C. Osbourn A.E. Hellman U. Oliw E.H. Cloning of the manganese lipoxygenase gene reveals homology with the lipoxygenase gene family.Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2690-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was used as a query for BLASTP search with the C. cinerea genome database (Coprinopsis cinerea AmutBmut pab1-1 v1.0 in MycoCosm) (22Grigoriev I.V. Nikitin R. Haridas S. Kuo A. Ohm R. Otillar R. et al.MycoCosm portal: gearing up for 1000 fungal genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: D699-D704Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), no protein with a substantial similarity was detected. When the same BLASTP search was performed with Aspergillus nidulans PpoC protein (AAT36614) as the query, two proteins with protein IDs 423716 and 398037 (GenBank: EAU90460.2 and EAU86789.2, respectively) were found, with E-values smaller than 1.0e−100. They were tentatively named CcDOX1 and CcDOX2. CcDOX1 and CcDOX2 are 1066 and 1118 amino acids long, respectively, and share 38% identity and 54% homology. TargetP-2.0 analyses (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/) showed that both proteins contained neither a signal peptide nor a mitochondrial transit peptide. InterProScan (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/) with CcDOX1 indicated that it consists of an N-terminal domain belonging to the animal heme peroxidase family (IPR037120) and a C-terminal domain that was classified as a sequence homologous to the cytochrome P450 superfamily (IPR036396), although the sequence was not classified as a member of any protein family specified in InterPro (Fig. 3A). This was mostly the case with CcDOX2, but a short segment of its C-terminal domain was classified as a member of the cytochrome P450 family (IPR001128) (Fig. 3A). The catalytic Tyr (Tyr-395 and Tyr-407 in CcDOX1 and CcDOX2, respectively) and distal and proximal His (His-217/His-398 and His-227/His-410 in CcDOX1 and CcDOX2, respectively) essential for binding heme are highly conserved as found with animal COXs (23Marnett L.J. Rowlinson S.W. Goodwin D.C. Kalgutkar A.S. Lanzo C.A. Arachidonic acid oxygenation by COX-1 and COX-2.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22903-22906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). They are conserved at the apparently suitable positions in the protein sequences in the N-terminal domains of CcDOX1/2. The Arg residue critical for binding fatty acid substrates (Arg-106 in mouse COX2) was not found, and Ser, which is the target of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Ser-516 in mouse COX2) (23Marnett L.J. Rowlinson S.W. Goodwin D.C. Kalgutkar A.S. Lanzo C.A. Arachidonic acid oxygenation by COX-1 and COX-2.J. Biol.

The signature of the C-terminal domain of P450 is not distinct. The ExxR motif (24Brodhun F. Göbel C. Hornung E. Feussner I. Identification of PpoA from Aspergillus nidulans as a fusion protein of a fatty acid heme dioxygenase/peroxidase and a cytochrome P450.J. Biol.

For example, the His residue, which has been shown to be essential for hydroperoxide isomerase activity in A. nidulans PpoA (His1004) (24Brodhun F. Göbel C. Hornung E. Feussner I.

Rev. 2005; 105: 2253-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar), are replaced by Phe/Thr and Tyr/Leu in CcDOX1/2, respectively (Fig. S2). Substitution of these amino acid residues, which are essential for P450 catalysis, is also evident in A. nidulans PpoC, which has no ability to rearrange the fatty acid hydroperoxide depending on P450 catalysis (13Brodhun F.

Hereafter, the C-terminal domain of CcDOX1/2 is referred to as a P450-related domain. The CcDOX1 sequence was used as a query for BLASTP analyses in MycoCosm (22Grigoriev I.V. Nikitin R. Haridas S.

Proteins with a significant similarity (<1.0e−5) were chosen and a phylogenetic tree was constructed along with the protein sequences of representative DOX-P450 fusion proteins (Ppos) from Ascomycota (26Oliw E.H.

The proteins were divided into four major clades (clade I to IV), three of which (clade I, II, and III) consisted of proteins in Ascomycota, and the other one (clade IV) consisted of those in Basidiomycota. The proteins found in Basidiomycota were further divided into three major clades (subclades a, b, and c), where CcDOX1 and CcDOX2 were located in subclades a and b, respectively. The proteins in subclades a and b had the N-terminal DOX domain and the C-terminal P450-related domain. The heme signature motifs (FxxGx(H/R)xCxG) of almost all of the proteins in subclades a and b were not conserved (Fig. S3). The C-terminal domains of those in subclade c consisted of proteins that harbored an apparently complete heme signature motif. Ssp1 protein is highly expressed in the teliospores of U. maydis (Ustilaginomycotina) (AAL38020.1) (16Huber S.M.F.E. Lottspeich F. Kämper J.

It has been reported that recombinant A. nidulans PpoC (AnPpoC) is unstable when the enzyme is expressed in Escherichia coli (13Brodhun F. Schneider S. Göbel C. Hornung E. Feussner I. PpoC from Aspergillus nidulans is a fusion protein with only one active haem.Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 553-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that recombinant G. graminis linoleate diol synthase (GgLDS) expressed with Pichia pastoris showed a product specificity different from that observed for the enzyme prepared from the mycelia of G. graminis (27Garscha U. Oliw E. Pichia expression and mutagenesis of 7,8-linoleate diol synthase change the dioxygenase and hydroperoxide isomerase.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), while recombinant GgLDS expressed with insect cells (Sf9) showed the same product specificity (28Garscha U. Oliw E. Critical amino acids for the 8(R)-dioxygenase activity of linoleate diol synthase. A comparison with cyclooxygenases.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3547-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in this study, we chose insect cells as the host for expression of recombinant CcDOXs. Recombinant proteins encoded by Ccdox1 and 2 were transiently expressed in BmN4 cells derived from the silkworm Bombyx mori with or without enhanced GFP (EGFP) fused at their C-terminals. To evaluate the enzymatic activity of the recombinant proteins, the cell lysate expressing the respective proteins was reacted with linoleic acid, and the products were analyzed in the negative-enhanced mass spectrum mode of LC-MS/MS. Chromatograms were drawn by extracting the molecular ions or fragment ions associated with the oxygenated products of linoleic acid, such as hydroperoxides, hydroxides, diols, or epoxyalcohols, which were expected based on the reaction of the Ascomycota Ppo enzymes (10Brodhun F. Feussner I. Oxylipins in fungi.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 1047-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the formation of the hydroperoxide derivative of linoleic acid (m/z 293, [C18H32O4-H3O+]−) and the hydroxide of linoleic acid (m/z 295, [C18H32O3-H+]−) was evident in the crude lysate prepared from the insect cells expressing all four recombinant CcDOXs (CcDOX1 or CcDOX2, with/without EGFP) (Fig. S4). No sign suggestive of compounds other than hydroperoxide and hydroxide of linoleic acid was detected. Peaks 3 and 6 apparent with m/z 295 were tentatively assigned as 10-hydroperoxide and 8-hydroperoxide of oleic acid ([C18H34O4-H3O+]−), respectively (Fig. S5). They were not detected when purified CcDOX1/2 was reacted with linoleic acid. They were most likely formed from oleic acid endogenous to insect cells. Interestingly, the hydroperoxides of oleic acid were not found in the insect cells before disruption. This suggests that either the recombinant CcDOXs in the insect cells were in latent states and were activated upon cell disruption or that the hydrolysis of membrane lipids facilitated by cell disruption supplied free oleic acid as a substrate for the recombinant CcDOXs. Based on the chromatograms, fusion of the EGFP sequence to the C terminus of either CcDOX1 or CcDOX2 had little effect on the activity and product specificity of the reaction. The hydroxides were likely formed by unknown components derived from the cell lysates because the reduction was not observed when purified CcDOX1/2 was used for product analysis. Recombinant CcDOX1 and CcDOX2 proteins were purified by immunoprecipitation with an anti-GFP antibody (Fig. S6). Linoleic acid was added to the purified recombinant CcDOX1 and CcDOX2, and the products were extracted, reduced with triphenylphosphine, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS in the negative enhanced product ion mode (Fig. S7). With this analysis, a peak tentatively assigned as 10-hydroxides or 8-hydroxides of linoleic acid based on the fragment ion diagnostic to the position of the hydroxide group (7Garscha U. Oliw E.H. Steric analysis of 8-hydroxy- and 10-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids and dihydroxyoctadecadienoic acids formed from 8R-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid by hydroperoxide isomerases.Anal. Biochem. 2007; 367: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was detected as the product formed by CcDOX1 or CcDOX2, respectively. To examine the expression of Ccdox genes, C. cinerea was grown in liquid YMG medium in a static culture. The mycelia grew rapidly under the growth conditions used, and the growth reached a plateau at 4 days after inoculation (Fig. 4A). The amount of 1-octen-3-ol produced by freeze-thaw treatment gradually increased from day 4, it reached a peak on day 12, and then decreased thereafter (Fig. 4B). The transcript level of Ccdox1 mostly followed the amount of 1-octen-3-ol but remained high even on day 16 (Fig. 4C). The developmental time course of Ccdox2 expression was distinct from those of Ccdox1 and of the 1-octen-3-ol formation ability. The expression level of Ccdox2 reached a peak at 8 days after transplanting. Thereafter, levels decreased to almost undetectable levels on day 16. As the expression profile of Ccdox1 gene and the result that the main product of the recombinant CcDOX1 from linoleic acid was tentatively assigned as 10HPODE, which was reported to be the intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway to form 1-octen-3-ol in basidiomycetes, CcDOX1 was chosen for further extensive analysis. We used tandem MS analysis in the presence of sodium ions, and each isomer of the fatty acid hydroperoxide was identified and quantified using the corresponding authentic specimen (29Ito J. Mizuochi S. Nakagawa K. Kato S. Miyazawa T. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid hydroperoxides via promotion of alkali metal adduct formation.Anal.

The main product formed from linoleic acid by immunopurified recombinant CcDOX1-EGFP was confirmed to be 10HPODE (Fig. 5A). Other isomers, such as 9, 12, and 13HPODE, were barely detected. The positional specificity in terms of the oxygen insertion was strict, and 10-hydroperoxides were the major product, even with oleic acid or α-linolenic acid. Using chiral phase chromatography (31Ito J. Shimizu N. Kobayashi E. Hanzawa Y. Otoki Y.

Ecological niche models are the most common method used to estimate potential distributions of species; however, they traditionally omit knowledge of intraspecific variation that can allow populations to respond uniquely to change. Here, we aim to test how population X environment relationships influence predicted suitable geographic distributions by comparing aggregated population-level models with species-level model predictions of suitable habitat within population ranges and across the species’ range. We also test the effect of two variable selection methods on these predictions–both addressing the possibility of local adaptation: Models were built with (a) a common set, and number, of predictors and, (b) a unique combination and number of predictors specific to each group’s training extent. Our study addresses the overarching hypothesis that populations have unique environmental niches, and specifically that (1) species-level models predict more suitable habitat within the ranges of genetic populations than individual models built from those groups, particularly when compared models are built with the same set of environmental predictors; and (2) aggregated genetic population models predict more suitable habitat across the species’ range than the species-level model, an = d this difference will increase when models are trained with individualized predictors. We found the species models predicted more habitat within population ranges for two of three genetic groups regardless of variable selection, and that aggregated population models predicted more habitat than species’ models, but that individualized predictors increased this difference. Our study emphasizes the extent to which changes to model predictions depend on the inclusion of genetic information and on the type and selection of predictors. Results from these modeling decisions can have broad implications for predicting population-level ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change."

The Cox LASSO survival model produced an internally validated Harrel's C index of 0.60. A Kaplan-Meier curve indicated that the hazard of developing TRS remained constant over the observation period. Predictors of TRS were: having more inpatient days in the three months before and after the first antipsychotic, more community face-to-face clinical contact in the three months before the first antipsychotic, minor cognitive problems, and younger age at the time of the first antipsychotic.Routinely collected information, readily available at the start of treatment, gives some indication of TRS but is unlikely to be adequate alone. These results provide further evidence that earlier onset is a risk factor for TRS."

Africa seems less impacted with lower number of cases and deaths than other continents. Senegal recorded its first case on March 2, 2020. We present here data collected from March 2 to October 31, 2020 in Senegal.Socio-demographic, epidemiological, clinical and virological information were collected on suspected cases. To determine factors associated with diagnosed infection, symptomatic disease and death, multivariable binary logistic regression and log binomial models were used. Epidemiological parameters such as the reproduction number and growth rate were estimated.67,608 suspected cases were tested by the IPD laboratories (13,031 positive and 54,577 negative). All age categories were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also patients having diabetes or hypertension or other cardiovascular diseases. With diagnosed infection, patients over 65 years and those with hypertension and cardiovascular disease and diabetes were highly associated with death. Patients with co-morbidities were associated with symptomatic disease, but only the under 15 years were not associated with. Among infected, 27.67% were asymptomatic (40.9% when contacts were systematically tested; 12.11% when only symptomatic or high-risk contacts were tested). Less than 15 years-old were mostly asymptomatic (63.2%). Dakar accounted for 81.4% of confirmed cases. The estimated mean serial interval was 5.57 (± 5.14) days. The average reproduction number was estimated at 1.161 (95%CI: 1.159-1.162), the growth rate was 0.031 (95%CI: 0.028-0.034) per day.Our findings indicated that factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 and death are advanced age (over 65 years-old) and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension and cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W4296492379,"Background Several ecologic studies have suggested that the bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine may be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection including a highly-cited published pre-print by Miller et al ., finding that middle/high- and high-income countries that never had a universal BCG policy experienced higher COVID-19 burden compared to countries that currently have universal BCG vaccination policies. We provide a case study of the limitations of ecologic analyses by evaluating whether these early ecologic findings persisted as the pandemic progressed. Methods Similar to Miller et al ., we employed Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests to compare population medians in COVID-19 mortality, incidence, and mortality-to-incidence ratio between countries with universal BCG policies compared to those that never had such policies. We then computed Pearson’s r correlations to evaluate the association between year of BCG vaccination policy implementation and COVID-19 outcomes. We repeated these analyses for every month in 2020 subsequent to Miller et al .’s March 2020 analysis. Results We found that the differences in COVID-19 burden associated with BCG vaccination policies in March 2020 generally diminished in magnitude and usually lost statistical significance as the pandemic progressed. While six of nine analyses were statistically significant in March, only two were significant by the end of 2020. Discussion These results underscore the need for caution in interpreting ecologic studies, given their inherent methodological limitations, which can be magnified in the context of a rapidly evolving pandemic in which there is measurement error of both exposure and outcome status."
https://openalex.org/W4296794149,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are the most common lymphoproliferative diseases in dogs. DLBCL diagnosis to date has relied on histopathological analysis; however liquid biopsies have gained attention in recent years as a source of diagnostic and prognostic information. Liquid biopsies can be a source of circulating DNA, miRNA, circulating tumour cells or extracellular vesicles (EVs). In this study EVs were isolated from the plasma of healthy dogs, and dogs with lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma by iodixanol density gradient centrifugation. These EVs were positive for the EV markers CD63 and TSG101 and the pan-B cell markers CD79a, CD21, CD45, CD20. NTA analysis revealed that the DLBCL and adenocarcinoma dogs had elevated plasma EVs relative to the healthy dogs. Furthermore, the modal size of lymphoma EVs had decreased relative to healthy dogs while adenocarcinoma EVs were unchanged. This study demonstrates that the plasma EV population is altered in canine lymphoma patients in a manner similar to previous studies on human lymphomas. The similar changes to the EV population in dogs, together with the similar pathological features and treatment protocols in canine and human non-Hodgkin lymphomas would make dogs a good comparative model for studying the role of EVs in DLBCL development and progression."

The objective of this study is to understand the adaptation of an Arctic diatom to its environment by studying its ability to acclimate to changes in light and temperature. We acclimated the polar diatom Chaetoceros neogracilis to various light levels at two different temperatures and studied its growth and photosynthetic properties using semi-continuous cultures. Rubisco content was high, to compensate for low catalytic rates, but did not change detectably with growth temperature. Contrary to what is observed in temperate species, in C. neogracilis, carbon fixation rate (20 min 14C incorporation) equaled net growth rate (μ) suggesting very low or very rapid (<20 min) re-oxidation of the newly fixed carbon. The comparison of saturation irradiances for electron transport, oxygen net production and carbon fixation revealed alternative electron pathways that could provide energy and reducing power to the cell without consuming organic carbon which is a very limiting product at low temperatures. High protein contents, low re-oxidation of newly fixed carbon and the use of electron pathways alternative to carbon fixation may be important characteristics allowing efficient growth under those extreme environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4296778352,"Although α-synuclein (SNCA) is a well-known pathological molecule involved in synucleinopathy in neurons, its physiological roles remain largely unknown. We reported that serum SNCA levels have a close inverse correlation with blood pressure and age, which indicates the involvement of SNCA in age-related endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the molecular functions of SNCA in the endothelium. We confirmed that SNCA was expressed in and secreted from endothelial cells (ECs). Exogenous treatment with recombinant SNCA (rSNCA) activated the Akt–eNOS axis and increased nitric oxide production in ECs. Treatment with rSNCA also suppressed TNF-α- and palmitic acid-induced NF-κB activation, leading to the suppression of VCAM-1 upregulation and restoration of eNOS downregulation in ECs. As for endogenous SNCA expression, replicative senescence resulted in the attenuation of SNCA expression in cultured ECs, similar to the effects of physiological aging on mice aortas. The siRNA-mediated silencing of SNCA consistently resulted in senescent phenotypes, such as eNOS downregulation, increased β-gal activity, decreased Sirt1 expression, and increased p53 expression, in ECs. Ex vivo assessment of endothelial functions using aortic rings revealed impaired endothelium-dependent acetylcholine-induced relaxation in SNCA knockout (KO) mice. Furthermore, SNCA KO mice, especially those on a high-fat diet, displayed elevated blood pressure compared with wild-type mice; this could be eNOS dysfunction-dependent because of the lower difference caused by L-NAME administration. These results indicate that exogenous and endogenous SNCA in ECs might physiologically maintain vascular integrity, and age-related endothelial dysfunction might be partially ascribed to loss-of-function of SNCA in ECs."
https://openalex.org/W4296782676,"Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) is a β-barrel pore-forming toxin (β-PFT). It exhibits potent hemolytic activity against erythrocytes that appears to be a direct outcome of its pore-forming functionality. However, VCC-mediated cell-killing mechanism is more complicated in the case of nucleated mammalian cells. It induces apoptosis in the target nucleated cells, mechanistic details of which are still unclear. Furthermore, it has never been explored whether the ability of VCC to trigger programmed cell death is stringently dependent on its pore-forming activity. Here, we show that VCC can evoke hallmark features of the caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death even in the absence of the pore-forming ability. Our study demonstrates that VCC mutants with abortive pore-forming hemolytic activity can trigger apoptotic cell death responses and cytotoxicity, similar to those elicited by the wild-type toxin. VCC as well as its pore formation-deficient mutants display prominent propensity to translocate to the target cell mitochondria and cause mitochondrial membrane damage. Therefore, our results for the first time reveal that VCC, despite being an archetypical β-PFT, can kill target nucleated cells independent of its pore-forming functionality. These findings are intriguing for a β-PFT, whose destination is generally expected to remain limited on the target cell membranes, and whose mode of action is commonly attributed to the membrane-damaging pore-forming ability. Taken together, our study provides critical new insights regarding distinct implications of the two important virulence functionalities of VCC for the V. cholerae pathogenesis process: hemolytic activity for iron acquisition and cytotoxicity for tissue damage by the bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4296785793,"The policymakers need research studies indicating the role of different pollutants with morbidity for polluted cities to install a strategic air quality management system. This study critically assessed the air pollution of Delhi for 2016-18 to found out the role of air pollutants in respiratory morbidity under the ICD-10, J00-J99. The critical assessment of Delhi air pollution was done using various approaches. The mean PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations during the measurement period exceeded both national and international standards by a wide margin. Time series charts indicated the interdependence of PM2.5 and PM10 and connection with hospital visits due to respiratory diseases. Violin plots showed that daily respiratory disease hospital visits increased during the winter and autumn seasons. The winter season was the worst from the city's air pollution point of view, as revealed by frequency analyses. The single and multi-pollutant GAM models indicated that short-term exposure to PM10 and SO2 led to increased hospital visits due to respiratory diseases. Per 10 units increase in concentrations of PM10 brought the highest increase in hospital visits of 0.21% (RR: 1.00, 95% CI: 1.001, 1.002) at lag0-6 days. This study found the robust effect of SO2 persisted in Delhi from lag0 to lag4 days and lag01 to lag06 days for single and cumulative lag day effects, respectively. While every 10 μg m-3 increase of SO2 concentrations on the same day (lag0) led to 32.59% (RR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.61) rise of hospital visits, the cumulative concentration of lag0-1 led to 37.21% (RR: 1.37, 95% CI:1.11, 1.70) rise in hospital visits which further increased to even 83.33% (RR: 1.83, 95% CI:1.35, 2.49) rise at a lag0-6 cumulative concentration in Delhi. The role of SO2 in inducing respiratory diseases is worrying as India is now the largest anthropogenic SO2 emitter in the world."
https://openalex.org/W4296794623,"Background This prospective, multisite, blinded, randomized, non-inferiority clinical study aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety of enflicoxib in the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with canine osteoarthritis. A total of 180 dogs were randomized to receive enflicoxib (n = 78), mavacoxib (n = 80) or placebo (n = 22). Dogs underwent veterinary assessments from day 0 to day 42 using a clinical sum score (CSS). Efficacy was also assessed by the owners using the Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI). The primary efficacy endpoint was the overall CSS from day 0 to day 42. Results The overall CSS expressed as area under the curve demonstrated non-inferiority of enflicoxib compared to mavacoxib, and both showed superiority over placebo. At the end of the study, average CSS, and the percentage of CSS responders for enflicoxib (3.64 and 74%) and mavacoxib (4.49 and 68%), was superior to placebo (7.15 and 29%). A faster onset of action was observed for enflicoxib as superiority over placebo was evidenced from the first efficacy assessment (day 7) onwards for both parameters, whereas mavacoxib was only significantly different from day 14 onwards. According to the owner assessment, the percentage of CBPI responders was 90%, 79%, and 43% for dogs treated with enflicoxib, mavacoxib and placebo, respectively, and superiority over placebo was demonstrated for both active treatments. In all secondary parameters, non-inferiority of enflicoxib versus mavacoxib was confirmed. The dog’s quality of life improved in all groups, but only enflicoxib showed superiority versus placebo. When assessing severely affected dogs only, results were similar, thus confirming the efficacy of enflicoxib in all stages of canine OA. There were no differences between groups in the frequency of adverse events, which were most frequently mild affecting the gastrointestinal tract and recovered without treatment. Conclusions Enflicoxib is efficacious and safe for the treatment of pain and inflammation in any stage of canine osteoarthritis with a faster onset of action compared to mavacoxib."
https://openalex.org/W4296804468,"Understanding of ecological interactions is necessary for the application of biological control. Banana is the second most produced fruit worldwide and the banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) is the most important pest of banana and plantain. Its biological control remains challenging because of the robustness and cryptic behaviour of the adult and the hidden development of larval stages. Researchers therefore tend to favour conservation biological control of this pest. The commonly used methods for measuring the effects of natural enemies on the regulation of this pest focus on invertebrates and may underestimate the role of vertebrates on biological control. Using cameras, we recorded the predation of sentinel adult weevils in banana plots in La Réunion island that differed in weevil infestation levels and in animal biodiversity. To facilitate image analysis, we used background subtraction to isolate moving parts of image sequences and thus detect predators and predation events. Our cameras recorded only vertebrates as predators of adult banana weevils. The most important predator appeared to be the Asian shrew (Suncus murinus), which was responsible for 67% of the predation events. Other predators included the house mouse (Mus musculus), the oriental garden lizard (Calotes versicolor), and the guttural toad (Sclerophrys gutturalis). The exact time of predation events were determined from the images metadata. It was thus possible to identify predator foraging periods that coincided with activity of adult weevils. Our results confirm that images provide useful information for biological and ecological studies. Along with other recent studies, our results suggest that the role of vertebrates in biological control may be underestimated. Based on these results, we advocate for several management implications such as the installation of hedges, grasslands, and ponds to favour these vertebrate predators of the banana weevil, possibly also favouring other vertebrate and invertebrate natural enemies."
https://openalex.org/W4296809780,"Dengue infection is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral infection globally. Concurrently, there has also been an upsurge of non-communicable comorbidities. We aimed to investigate the association between these comorbidities and the development of severe dengue.We performed a retrospective, case-control study involving 117 cases with severe dengue and 351 controls with non-severe dengue; matched according to gender, age (+/- 5 years old), and admission date (+/- 2 weeks). We analyzed the data using conditional odds ratio (cOR) and adjusted conditional odds ratio (AcOR) using univariate and multivariable conditional logistic regression respectively.Six main comorbidities namely obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic pulmonary disease, and ischemic heart disease were observed among cases and controls. Multivariable conditional logistic regression model found only hypertension to be independently associated with the development of severe dengue (ACOR 2.46; 95% CI:1.09-5.53). Among symptoms at presentation, lethargy, vomiting, bleeding manifestations, and abdominal pain were associated with increased odds of severe dengue, although the associations were not statistically significant. Headache (ACOR: 0:32; 95% CI: 0.21-0.51) and skin rash (ACOR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.22-0.81) were associated with significantly lower odds of severe dengue. Severe dengue patients were also found to have significantly higher white cell count, urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase on admission, while platelet and albumin were significantly lower compared to non-severe dengue patients.Our study found a significant association between hypertension and the development of severe dengue in adult patients. For clinical practice, this finding suggests that dengue patients with underlying hypertension warrant closer clinical monitoring for deterioration. The association between significant derangement in various laboratory parameters and severe dengue as shown in this study is in keeping with previous reports. While further substantiation by larger prospective studies will be desirable, this association may serve to inform the dengue triaging process."

We studied the effect of Aspergillus niger inoculation on in-field lettuce (Lactuca sativa) growth in soils with limiting and non-limiting P concentrations. Lettuce plants originating from inoculated seeds showed increased plant diameter (6.9%), number of leaves (8.1%), fresh weight (23.9%), and chlorophyll content (3.8%) as compared to non-inoculated ones. Inoculation of the seedling substrate just before transplanting was equally efficient to seed inoculation, while application of a granular formulation at transplanting did not perform well. Plant response to P addition was observed only up to 150 kg P2O5 ha-1, but A. niger inoculation allowed further increments in all vegetative parameters. We also employed a high-throughput phenotyping method based on aerial images, which allowed us to detect changes in plants due to A. niger inoculation. The visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) produced an accurate prediction model for chlorophyll content, suggesting this method might be used to large-scale surveys of croplands inoculated with beneficial microorganisms. Our findings demonstrate that A. niger inoculation surpasses the yield obtained with conventional chemical inputs, allowing productivity gains not reached by just increasing P doses."
https://openalex.org/W4296492856,"Heavy metals often are used in different textile processes, like dyeing and printing. When the toxic elements are present in more than recommended in textile materials they may impose potential risk to human health by absorption through the skin. In this study concentrations of some heavy metals (Co, Cu, Cr, Cd, and Pb) were analyzed in skin contact fading T-shirts printed for a special program at Mettu town using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy with a microwave digestion method technique for sample preparation. High levels of Cu were found in black, green, blue, and red-colored T-shirts ranging from 26.726–179.315mg/kg. Cr exceeded the recommended limits in most samples of T-shirts and was mostly in yellow, black, and blue colors. Cd levels were found to be within normal ranges. However, all T-shirt samples had low levels of cobalt, ranging from 1.33±2.13 to3.94±0.21. Maximum lead concentrations were found to be 3.40 ± 0.19 mg/kg for red-colored samples and 2.71 ± 0.13 mg/kg for blue colored samples. The metal concentrations in the T-shirts investigated were also compared to the OEKO Tex standard 100 limits. In this investigation, the concentrations of Pb, Cu, and Cr in red and green colored T-shirt samples were above the OEKO Tex suggested standard value. Therefore a strict local and international regulation and measures need to be taken to avoid toxicity of the studied metals."
https://openalex.org/W4296493125,"The historical relevance of the Thera (Santorini) volcanic eruption is unclear because of major dating uncertainty. Long placed ~1500 BCE and during the Egyptian New Kingdom (starts ~1565-1540 BCE) by archaeologists, 14C pointed to dates ≥50-100 years earlier during the preceding Second Intermediate Period. Several decades of debate have followed with no clear resolution of the problem-despite wide recognition that this uncertainty undermines an ability to synchronize the civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean in the mid-second millennium BCE and write wider history. Recent work permits substantial progress. Volcanic CO2 was often blamed for the discrepancy. However, comparison of 14C dates directly associated with the eruption from contemporary Aegean contexts-both on and remote from Thera-can now remove this caveat. In turn, using Bayesian analysis, a revised and substantially refined date range for the Thera eruption can be determined, both through the integration of the large 14C dataset relevant to the Thera eruption with the local stratigraphic sequence on Thera immediately prior to the eruption, and in conjunction with the wider stratigraphically-defined Aegean archaeological sequence from before to after the eruption. This enables a robust high-resolution dating for the eruption ~1606-1589 BCE (68.3% probability), ~1609-1560 BCE (95.4% probability). This dating clarifies long-disputed synchronizations between Aegean and East Mediterranean cultures, placing the eruption during the earlier and very different Second Intermediate Period with its Canaanite-Levantine dominated world-system. This gives an importantly altered cultural and historical context for the New Palace Period on Crete and the contemporary Shaft Grave era in southern Greece. In addition, the revised dating, and a current absence of southern Aegean chronological data placed soon afterwards, highlights a period of likely devastating regional eruption impact in the earlier-mid 16th century BCE southern Aegean."
https://openalex.org/W4296493510,"Pathological low birth weight due to fetal growth restriction (FGR) is an important predictor of adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. It is more common amongst native lowlanders when gestating in the hypoxic environment of high altitude, whilst populations who have resided at high altitude for many generations are relatively protected. Genetic study of pregnant populations at high altitude permits exploration of the role of hypoxia in FGR pathogenesis, and perhaps of FGR pathogenesis more broadly. We studied the umbilical cord blood DNA of 316 neonates born to pregnant women managed at the Sonam Norboo Memorial Hospital, Ladakh (altitude 3540m) between February 2017 and January 2019. Principal component, admixture and genome wide association studies (GWAS) were applied to dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic data, to explore ancestry and genetic predictors of low birth weight. Our findings support Tibetan ancestry in the Ladakhi population, with subsequent admixture with neighboring Indo-Aryan populations. Fetal growth protection was evident in Ladakhi neonates. Although no variants achieved genome wide significance, we observed nominal association of seven variants across genes (ZBTB38, ZFP36L2, HMGA2, CDKAL1, PLCG1) previously associated with birthweight."
https://openalex.org/W4296793914,"Stingless bees are effective pollinators of native tropical flora. Their environmental service maintains flow of pollen through pollination, increase reproductive success and influence genetic structure in plants. The management of stingless bees “meliponiculture”, is an activity limited to the countryside in Ecuador. The lack of knowledge of their managers about pollen resources can affect the correct maintenance/production of nests. The objective is to identify botanical families and genera of pollen grains collected by stingless bees by morphological features and differentiate potential species using geometric morphometry. Thirty-six pot pollen samples were collected from three Ecuadorian provinces located in two climatically different zones. Pollen type identification was based on the Number, Position, Character system. Using morphological features, the families and genera were established. Morphometry landmarks were used to show variation for species differentiation. Abundance, diversity, similarity and dominance indices were established by counting pollen grains, as well as spatial distribution relationships by means of Poisson regression. Forty-six pollen types were determined in two study areas, classified into 27 families and 18 genera. In addition, it was possible to identify more than one species, classified within the same family and genus, thanks to morphometric analysis. 1148 ± 799 (max 4211; min 29) pollen grains were counting in average. The diversity showed a high richness, low dominance and similarity between pollen resources. Families Melastomataceae and Asteraceae, genera Miconia and Bidens , were found as the main pollen resources. The stingless bee of this study are mostly generalist as shown the interaction network. The results of the present survey showed that stingless bees do not collect pollen from a single species, although there is evidence of a predilection for certain plant families. The diversity indexes showed high richness but low uniformity in the abundance of each family identified. The results of the study are also meaningful to the meliponiculture sector as there is a need to improve management practices to preserve the biodiversity and the environment."
https://openalex.org/W4296794143,"Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is an inborn error of metabolism mostly caused by mutations in the mitochondrial methylmalonyl-CoA mutase gene (MMUT). MMA patients suffer from frequent episodes of metabolic decompensation, which can be life threatening. To mimic both the dietary restrictions and metabolic decompensation seen in MMA patients, we developed a novel protein-controlled diet regimen in a Mmut deficient mouse model of MMA and demonstrated the therapeutic benefit of mLB-001, a nuclease-free, promoterless recombinant AAV GeneRideTM vector designed to insert the mouse Mmut into the endogenous albumin locus via homologous recombination. A single intravenous administration of mLB-001 to neonatal or adult MMA mice prevented body weight loss and mortality when challenged with a high protein diet. The edited hepatocytes expressed functional MMUT protein and expanded over time in the Mmut deficient mice, suggesting a selective growth advantage over the diseased cells. In mice with a humanized liver, treatment with a human homolog of mLB-001 resulted in site-specific genome editing and transgene expression in the transplanted human hepatocytes. Taken together, these findings support the development of hLB-001 that is currently in clinical trials in pediatric patients with severe forms of MMA."
https://openalex.org/W4296794172,"Increased fluid-flow shear stress (FFSS) contributes to hyperfiltration-induced podocyte and glomerular injury resulting in progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We reported that increased FFSS in vitro and in vivo upregulates PGE2 receptor EP2 (but not EP4 expression), COX2-PGE2 -EP2 axis, and EP2-linked Akt-GSK3β-β-catenin signaling pathway in podocytes. To understand and use the disparities between PGE2 receptors, specific agonists, and antagonists of EP2 and EP4 were used to assess phosphorylation of Akt, GSK3β and β-catenin in podocytes using Western blotting, glomerular filtration barrier function using in vitro albumin permeability (Palb ) assay, and mitigation of hyperfiltration-induced injury in unilaterally nephrectomized (UNX) mice at 1 and 6 months. Results show an increase in Palb by PGE2 , EP2 agonist (EP2AGO ) and EP4 antagonist (EP4ANT ), but not by EP2 antagonist (EP2ANT ) or EP4 agonist (EP4AGO ). Pretreatment with EP2ANT blocked the effect of PGE2 or EP2AGO on Palb . Modulation of EP2 and EP4 also induced opposite effects on phosphorylation of Akt and β-Catenin. Individual agonists or antagonists of EP2 or EP4 did not induce significant improvement in albuminuria in UNX mice. However, treatment with a combination EP2ANT + EP4AGO for 1 or 6 months caused a robust decrease in albuminuria. EP2ANT + EP4AGO combination did not impact adaptive hypertrophy or increased serum creatinine. Observed differences between expression of EP2 and EP4 on the glomerular barrier highlight these receptors as potential targets for intervention. Safe and effective mitigating effect of EP2ANT + EP4AGO presents a novel opportunity to delay the progression of hyperfiltration-associated CKD as seen in transplant donors."

However, little is known about the role of miR-1 and HCN2 in thyroid stimulation hormone (TSH)-induced cardiac dysfunction. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms of TSH induced cardiac dysfunction and the role of miR-1/HCN2 in that process, we evaluated the expression of miR-1a/HCN2 in the ventricular myocardium of hypothyroid mice and in TSH-stimulated H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Our data revealed that hypothyroidism mice had smaller hearts, ventricular muscle atrophy, and cardiac contractile dysfunction compared with euthyroid controls. The upregulation of miR-1a and downregulation of HCN2 were found in ventricular myocardium of hypothyroid mice and TSH-stimulated H9c2 cardiomyocytes, indicating that miR-1a and HCN2 may be involved in TSH-induced cardiac dysfunction. We also found that the regulation of miR-1a and HCN2 expression and HCN2 channel activity by TSH requires TSHR, while the regulation of HCN2 expression and HCN2 channel function by TSH requires miR-1a. Thus, our data revealed the potential mechanism of TSH-induced cardiac dysfunction and might shed new light on the pathological role of miR-1a/HCN2 in hypothyroid heart disease."

In this study, we demonstrated that M344, an HDAC inhibitor, is efficacious against pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo , alone or with gemcitabine. By 24 hours post-treatment, M344 augments the population of pancreatic cancer cells in G 1 , and at a later time point (48 hours) it increases apoptosis. M344 inhibits histone H3 deacetylation and slows pancreatic cancer cell proliferation better than vorinostat, and it does not decrease the viability of a non-malignant cell line more than vorinostat. M344 also elevates pancreatic cancer cell major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule expression, potentially increasing the susceptibility of pancreatic cancer cells to T cell lysis. Taken together, our findings support further investigation of M344 as a pancreatic cancer treatment."

CAMCCO also includes a common repository to i) share algorithms and case definitions based on diagnostic and procedural codes for research/training purpose, and ii) download aggregate data relevant to primary care providers, researchers, and decision makers. For this study, data from Quebec (1998-2015), Manitoba (1995-2019), Saskatchewan (1996-2020), and Alberta (2005-2018) are compared (Chi-square tests, p-values), and trends are calculated using Cochran-Armitage trend tests.Almost two-thirds (61%) of women took medications during pregnancy, mostly antibiotics (26%), asthma drugs (8%), and antidepressants (4%). Differences in the prevalence of prematurity (5.9-6.8%), LBW (4.0-5.2%), and multiplicity (1.0-2.5%) were statistically significant between provinces (p<0.001). Frequency of major malformations increased over time in Quebec (7-11%; p<0.001), Saskatchewan (5-11%; p<0.001), and Alberta (from 7-8%; p<0.001), and decreased in Manitoba (5-3%; p<0.001).

Although bilateral trade in all goods is tariff-free, regulatory requirements make exports more costly and burdensome. We used a partial equilibrium model to analyze the implications of Brexit for agricultural exports from Visegrad countries (Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia). We assess trade creation and trade diversion effects resulting from an increase in non-tariff measures and border costs for 4-digit agricultural products identified as sensitive in each of the Visegrad countries. The simulations reveal that exports of sensitive products from Visegrad countries to the UK could decrease by up to 20%. While the macroeconomic importance of this change is not significant, for the producers of the sensitive goods such export losses are substantial."
https://openalex.org/W4296322420,"Spontaneous synaptic activity is a hallmark of biological neural networks. A thorough description of these synaptic signals is essential for understanding neurotransmitter release and the generation of a postsynaptic response. However, the complexity of synaptic current trajectories has either precluded an in-depth analysis or it has forced human observers to resort to manual or semi-automated approaches based on subjective amplitude and area threshold settings. Both procedures are time-consuming, error-prone and likely affected by human bias. Here, we present three complimentary methods for a fully automated analysis of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents measured in major cell types of the mouse retina and in a primary culture of mouse auditory cortex. Two approaches rely on classical threshold methods, while the third represents a novel machine learning-based algorithm. Comparison with frequently used existing methods demonstrates the suitability of our algorithms for an unbiased and efficient analysis of synaptic signals in the central nervous system."

However, several fundamental unresolved problems persist, including a suitable definition of creativity and the ability of psychometric tests to measure divergent thinking-an important component of creativity-in a way that aligns with theory. It is this latter point that this registered report is designed to address. We administered two divergent thinking tests (the verbal and figural versions of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking; TTCT) with an intelligence test (the International Cognitive Ability Resource test; ICAR). We then subjected the subscores from these tests to confirmatory factor analysis to examine which of nine theoretically plausible models best fits the data. Results show that none of the pre-registered models fit the data well, an ambiguous result that leaves unanswered the question of whether intelligence and divergent thinking tests measure the same construct. Exploratory (i.e., not pre-registered) measurement models of each test separately shows that the TTCT-F may not measure a coherent, unitary construct-leading to model misspecification when TTCT-F subtests were included in larger models. This study was conducted in accordance with all open science practices, including pre-registration, open data and syntax, and open materials (with the exception of copyrighted and confidential test stimuli).

We then calculated the urban green space score (UGSS) by assessing the amount of street greenery and park greenery and then juxtaposing the score with the population distribution of the region. The results show inequities in the spatial distribution of UGSS values within the Guangzhou Beltway region. The benefit score of street greenery is low. The service area of parks can't cover the whole study area. The comprehensive benefit score of UGS is composed of two parts, the park greenery score and the street greenery score, but the spatial distribution of UGSS values remains uneven. The UGS benefits enjoyed by one-half of the population of the study area are low, and the UGSS values of the more densely populated areas are not high."
https://openalex.org/W4296324881,"The Indian Autism Screening Questionnaire (IASQ), derived from the Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism ISAA (the mandated tool for autism in India), is an autism screening instrument for use in the general population by minimally trained workers. While ISAA has 40 items with four anchor points, the IASQ is a 10-item questionnaire with yes/no answers. It was initially validated using the ISAA. During its development the ISAA was itself compared to the Childhood Autism Rating Scale version 1 (ISAA Manual). In the present study, we evaluated both the ISAA and the IASQ in relation to the Childhood Autism Rating Scale version 2 (CARS-2). Methods: Participants were recruited from three settings: a referral clinic for neurodevelopmental conditions run by the Department of Paediatrics of a tertiary care teaching hospital (NDC OPD), the outpatient department of an institute for disability and rehabilitation (NIEPID), and from the community (CGOC). Persons between ages 3–18 were recruited following consent or assent (parent and child/adolescent). The IASQ was administered by a minimally trained administrator. It was followed by ISAA and the CARS-2 (in alternating order, by different evaluators blind to each other) (CARS2 SV (Standard Version) and CARS2 HF (High Functioning) as applicable). Sensitivity, specificity and area under the Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) curve were calculated for IASQ and CARS2, as well as for ISAA and CARS2. Concordance between CARS2 and ISAA was calculated using kappa coefficient. Results: A total of 285 participants (NIEPD n = 124; NDC OPD, n = 4; CGOC n = 157) (a total of 70 with autism and 215 controls) participated. IASQ and CARS2 were administered on 285 participants, while IASQ and ISAA were administered on 264 participants. When IASQ was compared to CARS2, sensitivity was 97%, specificity 81%, PPV 63%, NPV 99% at cut off 1 while these values were 97%, 92%, 79% and 99% respectively at cut off 2. There was high concordance between CARS2 and ISAA (Kappa 0.907, p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: IASQ has satisfactory sensitivity, specificity and concordance when compared with CARS2; it can be used for screening children with autism in community. The ISAA also showed a high concordance with CARS2, as it had with the older version of CARS."

ROH with a minimum length of 1 Mb and a minimum of 10 SNPs were included in the analysis. One heterozygous SNP marker and five missing genotypes per ROH were allowed. A total of 425,098 ROH were found in the studied population (71.83 ± 10.73 ROH per animal), with an average length and coverage of 4.80 ± 0.77 Mb, and 276.89 Mb, respectively. The average chromosome length covered by ROH was 10.40 ± 3.70 Mb. ROH between 1 and 2 Mb were the most frequent in the population (51.33%) while those between 14 and 16 Mb were the least frequent (1.20%). Long chromosomes showed a larger number of ROH. Chromosomes 10 and 20, had a greater percentage of their length covered by ROH because they presented a largest number of long ROH (>8 Mb). From the total ROH, 17 were detected in 1,847 animals and distributed among different chromosomes, and were associated with milk, fat and protein yield and percentage, and conformation final score. Of the ROH with effects on production traits, the majority were found with a length between 1 and 4 Mb.

https://openalex.org/W4296330591,"Zinc deficiency is common among children with Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and contributes to growth failure, increased morbidity and mortality. Diarrhoea and poor dietary practices are the main causes of zinc deficiency. Corn-soy Blend (CSB), the standard product in management of children with MAM has a limitation of poor micronutrient bioavailability. Micronutrient powders (MNPs) which are added at the point of consumption have a potential in improving micronutrient status however, scientific evidence on efficacy on improving the zinc status is scarce. A cluster-randomized clinical trial was designed to establish bioequivalence of MNPs to CSB on serum zinc status among children (6-36 months) with MAM in Thika informal settlements, Kenya. Sample size was calculated to show bioequivalence within ±20% limit. Twelve villages were randomized to four study groups. Three experimental groups received different formulations of MNPs added to unfortified CSB porridge as; multiple micronutrients containing zinc (CSB-MNP-A n = 84), multiple micronutrients without zinc (CSB-MNP-B n = 88) and zinc only (CSB-MNP-C n = 94). Control group (n = 80) received standard CSB fortified with multiple micronutrients. Standard amount of CSB was consumed in feeding centres for six months. Serum zinc concentration was assessed pre- and post-intervention. Data was analyzed based on treatment assignment regardless of adherence and drop-out status. Mixed effects linear regression was used to model pre-post change in serum zinc concentration, adjusting for clustering effect and baseline differences. Bioequivalence was assessed using two one-sided t-tests. At baseline, 84.4% were zinc deficient (serum zinc <65μg/dL) and zinc intake was sub-optimal (<3 mg/day) for 95.7% of children. Mean change in serum zinc concentration was significantly higher (p = 0.024) in CSB-MNP-A (18.7 ± 2.1) μg/dL compared to control group (11.8 ± 2.6 μg/dL). MNPs are not bioequivalent to CSB within the ±20% bioequivalence limit. MNPs are more effective in improving serum zinc status compared to CSB. Trials with larger sample sizes are recommended to validate the current findings. Trial registration: Pan African Clinical Trials Registry: PACTR201907492232376."
https://openalex.org/W4296330865,"As a measure of the brain's temporal fine-tuning capacity, temporal resolution power (TRP) explained repeatedly a substantial amount of variance in psychometric intelligence. Recently, spatial suppression, referred to as the increasing difficulty in quickly perceiving motion direction as the size of the moving stimulus increases, has attracted particular attention, when it was found to be positively related to psychometric intelligence. Due to the conceptual similarities of TRP and spatial suppression, the present study investigated their mutual interplay in the relation to psychometric intelligence in 273 young adults to better understand the reasons for these relationships. As in previous studies, psychometric intelligence was positively related to a latent variable representing TRP but, in contrast to previous reports, negatively to latent and manifest measures of spatial suppression. In a combined structural equation model, TRP still explained a substantial amount of variance in psychometric intelligence while the negative relation between spatial suppression and intelligence was completely explained by TRP. Thus, our findings confirmed TRP to be a robust predictor of psychometric intelligence but challenged the assumption of spatial suppression as a representation of general information processing efficiency as reflected in psychometric intelligence. Possible reasons for the contradictory findings on the relation between spatial suppression and psychometric intelligence are discussed."

However, challenges exist which hinder inter-organisational knowledge transfer, particularly across continents. The ACoRD project aimed to transfer knowledge on digital learning development from UK/EU (provider) to Malaysian (receiver) higher education institutions (HEIs). This study explores the challenges encountered during the knowledge transfer process and lessons learned. Methods This is a qualitative study involving both the knowledge providers and receivers in focus group discussions (n = 25). Four focus group discussions were conducted in the early (n = 2) and mid-phase (n = 2) of the project by trained qualitative researchers using a topic guide designed to explore experiences and activities representing knowledge transfer in multi-institutional and multi-cultural settings. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and checked. The transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Five main themes emerged from this qualitative study: mismatched expectations between providers and receivers; acquiring new knowledge beyond the professional ""comfort zone""; challenges in cascading newly acquired knowledge to colleagues and management; individual and organisational cultural differences; and disruption of knowledge transfer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion This study highlights the need to create a conducive platform to facilitate continuous, timely and bi-directional needs assessment and feedback; this should be done in the early phase of the knowledge transfer process. The challenges and strategies identified in this study could guide more effective knowledge transfer between organisations and countries."
https://openalex.org/W4296493129,"All issuers in China’s local government bond market, which is nascent but growing rapidly, have the same AAA ratings. However, we provide evidence that the credit rating agency’s reputation can certify differences in ratings’ reliability and further impact bond pricing. On the basis of a sample of 7941 local government bonds issued from 2015 to 2021, results show that risk premium is significantly low for bonds rated by prestigious credit rating agencies, which means that issuers can save borrowing costs. Moreover, local governments regarded as less transparent in fiscal information disclosure enjoy more cost savings for their bonds by hiring more reputable agencies. Regression results are affirmed with the Heckman two-stage model, difference-in-differences regression, and machine learning method to solve the potential endogeneity issue. This paper’s findings contribute to the debate on the credit rating agency’s reputation hypothesis and present three implications. First, investors can rely on the credit rating agency’s reputation to complement credit risk analysis. Second, local government policymakers should implement appropriate policies to reduce debt costs and improve public finance sustainability. Lastly, regulators should considerably focus on the supervision of credit rating agencies, given their substantial impact on bond pricing and the market’s information asymmetry."

Although these patients have relatively favorable prognoses, substantial numbers of them would relapse after conventional therapy. Here, we explored whether reinforcing the endogenous differentiation potential of t(8;21) AML cells would diminish the associated malignancy. In doing so, we noticed an expansion of immature erythroid blasts featured in both AML1-ETO9a (AE9a) and AE plus c-KIT (N822K) (AK) murine leukemic models. Interestingly, in the AE9a murine model, a spontaneous step-wise erythroid differentiation path, as characterized by the differential expression of CD43/c-Kit and the upregulation of several key erythroid transcription factors (TFs), accompanied the decline or loss of leukemia-initiating potential. Notably, overexpression of one of the key erythroid TFs, Ldb1, potently disrupted the repopulation of AE9a leukemic cells in vivo, suggesting a new promising intervention strategy of t(8;21) AML through enforcing their erythroid differentiation."

A national survey was conducted between February 9 and March 30, 2021, targeting office-based physicians working in the United States to assess their perceptions on drug utilization management in their practice. Of the 742 physicians that participated in the study, over 80% reported deciding against prescribing certain treatments in anticipation of drug utilization management at least sometimes (&gt;50% of the time). Despite utilization management having an impact on prescribing decisions, about half of physicians said that the utilization management policies they encounter rarely or never (0–25% of the time) align with clinical evidence."

Involvement in nature-based activities can reduce these difficulties and improve wellbeing, but there are limited resources for supporting children with this diagnosis to access these approaches and no nature-based interventions designed with and for this group. This protocol describes a co-production study in which children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder aged 5–11 years old, their parents/guardians, and professionals will attend a series of workshops to share their knowledge to co-produce a new nature-based intervention for this population of children. We aim to understand how the children’s’ experiences of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder may affect their interactions with nature, identify how activity in and with nature may help with symptom reduction and general wellbeing, and co-produce an intervention for families which applies our learning. The result of this study will be the designed intervention and insights into how children and young people with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder interact with nature. The prototype intervention will then undergo feasibility testing in a future study. Trail registration: NIHR203043 ; ISRCTN11763460 ."
https://openalex.org/W4296794158,"This manuscript presents a technique for solving a multiple-objective probabilistic fractional programming problem with discrete random variables. A multiple-objective probabilistic mathematical model is constructed with fractional objectives. In the model, some parameters of coefficients and right hand side parameters of restrictions are assumed as random variables having Pascal and Hyper geometric distributions. The feasibility of probabilistic constraints is checked by means of stochastic simulation. Genetic algorithm approach method is used to obtain the Pareto optimal solution of the proposed model without finding the deterministic model. Genetic algorithm parameters are fixed in all generation. The proposed method is coded by C++ programming language. To illustrate the method, a numerical example and practical example on the case of supply chain management are presented. The result shows that the values of the objective functions are conflicting each other."
https://openalex.org/W4296794305,"The scale-up of access to antiretroviral therapy has transformed HIV from an acute, terminal disease to a manageable chronic illness. Yet, sustaining high levels of antiretroviral therapy adherence remain a challenge, especially in the sub-Saharan Africa region which is disproportionately affected by HIV. This protocol proposes a scoping review to explore literature reporting on the antiretroviral therapy adherence levels among people who experience substance abuse and violence (SAVA) syndemics, as well as mood disorders such as anxiety and depression among people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.This proposed scoping review will follow Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews as refined by Levac et al. The review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute's manual for conducting scoping reviews. Literature searches will be conducted using six databases: Academic search complete; APA PsycArticles; CINAHL; MEDLINE; SocINDEX and Web of science. Title screening will see the ""Participant, Concept, Context"" framework applied to identify relevant literature and will not include the appraisal of search results. Data charting will follow an adapted version of Trico and colleagues' PRISMA-ScR and results will be mapped descriptively and in tabular format. Furthermore, results will be discussed within the syndemics model of health, and summarised as a biosocial conceptual model.The study will make use of secondary data that are readily available to the public and will not require ethical approval. We intend to publish our results in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminate our findings at relevant conferences and seminars."
https://openalex.org/W4296795921,"This study proposes a land–sea convergenomics model based on analyses of marine and terrestrial economies. A viscosity-based system of indices was constructed to evaluate the land–sea convergenomics of Bohai Economic Rim (BER) cities and was applied to analyse the viscosities of BER cities from 2009 to 2019. BER cities’ viscosities trended upward, although with significant disparities. The developmental fundamentals were high at the system level and grew steadily during the study period. Resource development was low with a slow growth rate. Industrial linkages grew significantly but exhibited minor fluctuations. Outcome creation began at a low level but grew steadily. Cluster analyses revealed that, overall, the development of land–sea convergenomics in the BER occurred in clusters, with viscosity distribution centred around three core cities: Tianjin, Qingdao, and Dalian. Due to regional disparities, the effects of labour productivity, science and technology investment, economic fundamentals, and energy efficiency on land–sea convergenomics were significantly differentiated."
https://openalex.org/W4296801167,"Obesity is highly polygenic disease where several genetic variants have been reportedly associated with obesity in different ethnicities of the world. In the current study, we identified the obesity risk or protective association and BMI raising effect of the minor allele of adiponectin, C1Q and collagen domain containing (ADIPOQ), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CEPT), FTO alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase (FTO), leptin (LEP), and leptin receptor (LEPR) genes in a large cohort stratified into four BMI-based body weight categories i.e., normal weight, lean, over-weight, and obese. Based on selected candidate genetic markers, the genotyping of all study subjects was performed by PCR assays, and genotypes and allele frequencies were calculated. The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of all genetic markers were computed for total and BMI-based body weight categories and compared with MAFs of global and South Asian (SAS) populations. Genetic associations of variants with obesity risk were calculated and BMI raising effect per copy of the minor allele were estimated. The genetic variants with higher MAFs in obese BMI group were; rs2241766 (G = 0.43), rs17817449 (G = 0.54), rs9939609 (A = 0.51), rs1421085 (C = 0.53), rs1558902 (A = 0.63), and rs1137101 (G = 0.64) respectively. All these variants were significantly associated with obesity (OR = 1.03-4.42) and showed a high BMI raising effect (β = 0.239-0.31 Kg/m2) per copy of the risk allele. In contrast, the MAFs of three variants were higher in lean-normal BMI groups; rs3764261 A = 0.38, rs9941349 T = 0.43, and rs7799039 G = 0.40-0.43). These variants showed obesity protective associations (OR = 0.68-0.76), and a BMI lowering effect per copy of the protective allele (β = -0.103-0.155 Kg/m2). The rs3764261 variant also showed significant and positive association with lean body mass (OR = 2.38, CI = 1.30-4.34). Overall, we report six genetic variants of ADIPOQ, FTO and LEPR genes as obesity-risk markers and a CETP gene variant as lean mass/obesity protective marker in studied Pakistani cohort."

Although web programs integrating cognitive-behavioral therapy with diabetes education have shown good results, no similar approach has been performed as yet in Spain. The objective is to develop an Internet-based program for the treatment of mild-moderate depressive symptomatology in individuals with type 1 diabetes (WEB_TDDI1 study) based on Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and assess its results.A 2-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Adults with type 1 diabetes and mild-moderate depressive symptoms will be screened to participate in the study and randomly assigned to either the treatment group (TG) that will use a Web-based application for a specific 9-week intervention in depression and type 1 diabetes or the control group (CG) that will be on the waiting list during that time.Data on the primary variable (depressive symptoms) and secondary variables (treatment-related distress, anxiety, fear of hypoglycemia, quality of life, treatment adherence, coping strategies and glycemic control) will be collected from the TG at the beginning/baseline, at the end of treatment and at 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. The CG will be assessed at the beginning and at the end of the TG intervention. On completion of the program by the TG, the treatment will then be carried out in the CG.The new web application developed is expected to be effective for the treatment of mild-moderate depressive symptoms in adults with type 1 diabetes, reducing depressive symptoms and improving the rest of the analyzed variables.Registry: NCT03473704 (March 21, 2018); ClinicalTrials.gov."
https://openalex.org/W4296802447,"This cross-sectional study assessed geospatial patterns of early-onset hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (eHDP) in primiparous mothers and exposure to industrial emissions using geocoded residential information from Kentucky live (N = 210,804) and still (N = 1,247) birth records (2008–2017) and census block group estimates of aerosol concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zi) from the Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) model. A latent class analysis allowed for the identification of four district exposure classes—As, Cd, and Pb (12.6%); Se and Zi (21.4%); Pb and Cr (8%); and low or no exposures (57.9%). Women classified as having a high probability of exposure to both Pb and Cr had a statistically significantly greater prevalence of eHDP after adjusting for demographic factors (aPR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.44) relative to those with low or no exposure. Our findings contribute to the emerging literature on the association of metal exposures with pregnancy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4296805248,"Although rare, hybrids are more common in broadly sympatric waterfowl than in any other avian family; yet, the behavioral ecology explaining their generation has remained controversial. Leading hypotheses are forced interspecific copulations, mis-imprinting caused by mixed broods, and scarcity of conspecific mates. Using a large sample of hybrid ducks solicited from North American hunters we evaluated these hypotheses by genetically determining the mother and father species of F1 hybrids. Based on abundances in areas where their breeding ranges overlap, the frequency of hybrids varied greatly from expectations, with hybrids between species within recently derived clades being much more frequent than those between more divergent clades. Forced copulations, as measured by large phallus-length asymmetries between parentals, strongly predicted the father species of most F1 hybrids. Thus, most Anas acuta x A. platyrhynchos (Northern Pintail x Mallard) F1s were sired by A. acuta, and most A. platyrhynchos x Mareca strepera (Mallard x Gadwall) F1s were sired by A. platyrhynchos. Siring asymmetries were consistent with phallus length asymmetries in five additional parental combinations, but none had samples large enough to be individually statistically significant. The exception to this trend was our sample of nine A. platyrhynchos x Mareca americana (Mallard x Gadwall) F1s, for which a large phallus asymmetry failed to predict the father species. Hybrids were rare in brood parasitic species, suggesting mis-imprinting to be an unlikely cause of most hybrids; however, our samples of hybrids from regular brood parasites were inadequate to strongly address this hypothesis. We could test the scarcity of mates hypothesis for only a single hybrid combination and it contradicted our prediction: most F1 M. Penelope x M. americana (Eurasian x American Wigeon) were sired by M. penelope, strongly contradicting our prediction that female M. penelope wintering in enormous flocks of M. americana (American Wigeon) on the west coast of North America would have difficulty finding conspecific mates. In general, our results support interspecific forced copulations as the predominant behavioral mechanism generating hybrids in North temperate waterfowl."
