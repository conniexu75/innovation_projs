https://openalex.org/W2063807916,"By genetically targeting tumorigenesis to specific hypothalamic neurons in transgenic mice using the promoter region of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) gene to express the SV40 T-antigen oncogene, we have produced neuronal tumors and developed clonal, differentiated, neurosecretory cell lines. These cells extend neurites, express the endogenous mouse GnRH mRNA, release GnRH in response to depolarization, have regulatable fast Na+ channels found in neurons, and express neuronal, but not glial, cell markers. These immortalized cells will provide an invaluable model system for study of hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons that regulate reproduction. Significantly, their derivation demonstrates the feasibility of immortalizing differentiated neurons by targeting tumorigenesis in transgenic mice to specific neurons of the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2098806204,"We report the identification, purification, and characterization of a farnesyl:protein transferase that transfers the farnesyl moiety from farnesyl pyrophosphate to a cysteine in p21ras proteins. The enzyme was purified approximately 60,000-fold from rat brain cytosol through use of a chromatography step based on the enzyme's ability to bind to a hexapeptide containing the consensus sequence (Cys-AAX) for farnesylation. The purified enzyme migrated on gel filtration chromatography with an apparent molecular weight of 70,000-100,000. High resolution SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed two closely spaced approximately 50 kd protein bands in the final preparation. The enzyme was inhibited competitively by peptides as short as 4 residues that contained the Cys-AAX motif. These peptides acted as alternative substrates that competed with p21H-ras for farnesylation. Effective peptides included the COOH-terminal sequences of all known p21ras proteins as well as those of lamin A and B."

https://openalex.org/W2075734600,"We have recently discovered that the mipA gene of A. nidulans encodes gamma-tubulin, a new member of the tubulin superfamily. To determine the function of gamma-tubulin in vivo, we have created a mutation in the mipA gene by integrative transformation, maintained the mutation in a heterokaryon, and determined the phenotype of the mutation in spores produced by the heterokaryon. The mutation is lethal and recessive. It strongly inhibits nuclear division, less strongly inhibits nuclear migration, and, as judged by immunofluorescence microscopy, causes a reduction in the number and length of cytoplasmic microtubules and virtually a complete absence of mitotic apparatus. We conclude that gamma-tubulin is essential for microtubule function in general and nuclear division in particular. Immunofluorescence microscopy of wild-type hyphae with affinity-purified, gamma-tubulin-specific antibodies reveals that gamma-tubulin is a component of interphase and mitotic spindle pole bodies. We propose that gamma-tubulin attaches microtubules to the spindle pole body, nucleates microtubule assembly, and establishes microtubule polarity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2095429868,"Resident proteins of the ER lumen carry a specific tetrapeptide signal (KDEL or HDEL) that prevents their secretion. We have previously described the isolation of yeast mutants that fail to retain such resident proteins within the cell. Here we describe ERD2, a gene required for retention. It encodes a 26 kd integral membrane protein whose abundance determines the efficiency and capacity of the retention system. Reduced expression of ERD2 leads to secretion of proteins bearing the HDEL signal, whereas overexpression of ERD2 improves retention both in wild-type cells and in other mutants. These results are consistent with other evidence that ERD2 encodes the HDEL receptor (see accompanying paper). The gene is also required, perhaps indirectly, for normal protein transport through the Golgi, and hence for growth. We discuss possible roles for ERD2 in the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1996567630,"Recent evidence suggests that peptide ligands take part in the assembly of class I molecules in living cells. We now describe a simple system for studying class I assembly in vitro. Detergent extracts of the mutant cells RMA-S and .174, in which class I assembly does not occur spontaneously, will support assembly in vitro when specific peptides are added. Peptides stabilize a conformational change in the class I heavy chain and association with beta 2-microglobulin, at concentrations approximately 100-fold lower than required in ""peptide feeding"" experiments with whole cells. We show that peptides bind class I molecules during assembly and demonstrate that the conformational change induced in the heavy chain is influenced by the concentrations of both peptide and beta 2-microglobulin."
https://openalex.org/W2080229333,"Probes derived from cDNAs encoding isozymes of rat protein kinase C (PKC) were used to screen the genome of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. A single gene (PKC1) was isolated that encodes a putative protein kinase closely related to the alpha, beta, and gamma subspecies of mammalian PKC. Deletion of PKC1 resulted in recessive lethality. Cells depleted of the PKC1 gene product displayed a uniform phenotype, a characteristic of cell division cycle (cdc) mutants, and arrested cell division at a point subsequent to DNA replication, but prior to mitosis. Unlike most cdc mutants, which continue to grow in the absence of cell division, PKC1-depleted cells arrested growth with small buds. PKC1 may regulate a previously unrecognized checkpoint in the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2012015834,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tat protein (Tat) is a positive regulator of virus gene expression and replication. Biotinylated Tat was used as a probe to screen a Î»gt11 fusion protein library, and a complementary DNA encoding a protein that interacts with Tat was cloned. Expression of this protein, designated TBP-1 (for Tat binding protein-1), was observed in a variety of cell lines, with expression being highest in human cells. TBP-1 was localized predominantly in the nucleus, which is consistent with the nuclear localization of Tat. In cotransfection experiments, expression of TBP-1 was able to specifically suppress Tat-mediated transactivation. The strategy described may be useful for direct identification and cloning of genes encoding proteins that associate with other proteins to modulate their activity in a positive or negative fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1817917871,"The ATP-dependent Clp protease of Escherichia coli contains two dissimilar components: the Clp A regulatory polypeptide, with two ATP binding sites and intrinsic ATPase activity, and the Clp P subunit, which contains the proteolytic active site. The DNA sequence of the clpP gene predicts a protein of 207 amino acids (Mr 21,679), which is in close agreement with the size determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of purified Clp P. Clp P has a native Mr of approximately 240,000, and electron micrographs of the protein show superimposed disk-like structures with a central cavity, similar in appearance to purified proteasomes from eukaryotic cells. Clp P is synthesized with a 14-amino acid leader which is rapidly cleaved in vivo to yield the 193-amino acid protein which has activity in vitro. The clpP gene is at 10 min on the E. coli map, close to that for the ATP-dependent Lon protease of E. coli and far from the gene for clpA. Primer extension experiments indicate that transcription initiates immediately upstream of the coding region for Clp P, with a major transcription start at 120 bases in front of the start of translation. Insertion mutations in clpP have been isolated and transferred to the chromosome; strains devoid of Clp P are viable in the presence or absence of Lon protease. Mutations in clpP stabilize the same Clp A-beta-galactosidase fusion protein specifically stabilized by clpA mutations, providing the first genetic evidence that Clp A and Clp P act together in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1647933556,"Red blood cells (RBC) are thought to be well protected against oxidative stress by the antioxidant, cu-pro-zinc enzyme superoxide dismutase (CuZn SOD) which dismutates O2- to H2O2. CuZn SOD, however, is irreversibly inactivated by its product H2O2. Exposure of intact RBC to H2O2 resulted in the inactivation (up to 50%) of endogenous SOD in a concentration-dependent manner. When RBC were exposed to O2- and H2O2, generated by xanthine + xanthine oxidase, an even greater loss of SOD activity (approximately 75%) was observed. Intracellular proteolysis was markedly increased by exposure to these same oxidants; up to a 12-fold increase with H2O2 and a 50-fold increase with xanthine oxidase plus xanthine. When purified SOD was treated with H2O2, inactivation of the enzyme also occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. Accompanying the loss of SOD activity, the binding of the copper ligand to the active site of the enzyme diminished with H2O2 exposure, as evidenced by an increase in accessible copper. Significant direct fragmentation of SOD was evident only under conditions of prolonged exposure (20 h) to relatively high concentrations of H2O2. Gel electrophoresis studies indicated that under most experimental conditions (i.e. 1-h incubation) H2O2, O2-, and H2O2 + O2- treated SOD experienced charge changes and partial denaturation, rather than fragmentation. The proteolytic susceptibility of H2O2-modified SOD, during subsequent incubation with (rabbit, bovine or human) red cell extracts also increased as a function of pretreatment with H2O2. Both enzyme inactivation and altered copper binding appeared to precede the increase in proteolytic susceptibility (whether measured as an effect of H2O2 concentration or as a function of the duration of H2O2 exposure). These results suggest that SOD inactivation and modification of copper binding are prerequisites for increased protein degradation. Proteolytic susceptibility was further enhanced by H2O2 exposure under alkaline conditions, suggesting that the hydroperoxide anion is the damaging species rather than H2O2 itself. In RBC extracts, the proteolysis of H2O2-modified SOD was inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, serine reagents, transition metal chelators, and ATP; suggesting the existence of an ATP-independent proteolytic pathway of sulfhydryl, serine, and metalloproteases, and peptidases. The proteolytic activity was conserved in a Fraction II of both human and rabbit RBC, and was purified from rabbit reticulocytes and erythrocytes to a 670-kDa proteinase complex, for which we have suggested the trivial name macroxyproteinase. In erythrocytes macroxyproteinase may prevent the accumulation of H2O2-modified SOD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2067256176,"Protozoan parasite T. cruzi invades cells within acidic vacuoles, but shortly afterward escapes into the cytosol. Exit from the phagosome is blocked by raising the pH of acidic compartments, suggesting that a previously described acid-active hemolysin secreted by T. cruzi might be involved in the membrane disruption process. Here we show that T. cruzi supernatants are cytotoxic for nucleated cells at pH 5.5 and contain a protein reactive with antibodies against reduced and alkylated human C9 (the ninth component of complement). The C9 cross-reactive protein (TC-TOX) copurified with the cytolytic activity, and the active fractions induced conductance steps characteristic of transmembrane ion channels in planar phospholipid bilayers. Immunocytochemical studies using antibodies against purified TC-TOX showed that the protein was localized to the luminal space of parasite-containing phagosomes. We postulate that TC-TOX, when secreted into the acidic environment of the phagosome, forms pores in the membrane, which contribute to its disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2015990519,"Antibodies directed against nuclear envelope lamin proteins have been used in conjunction with three-dimensional light and electron microscope methodologies to determine the spatial organization of lamins in diploid interphase nuclei and to relate this organization to the positions of chromatin in the nuclear periphery. Using Drosophila early embryos, Drosophila Kc cells, and human HeLa cells, it is qualitatively and quantitatively observed that lamins are organized as a highly discontinuous, apparently fibrillar network that leaves large voids in the nuclear periphery containing little or no lamin. Using fluorescence microscopy to compare and quantitate the relationship between chromatin and the lamin network, it is found that although there is a strong tendancy for the most peripheral chromatin to be positioned directly underneath a lamin fiber, only a small fraction of the chromatin in the nuclear periphery is sufficiently close to a lamin fiber to possibly be in direct contact."
https://openalex.org/W2014806360,"Oligonucleotides equipped with EDTA-Fe can bind specifically to duplex DNA by triple-helix formation and produce double-strand cleavage at binding sites greater than 12 base pairs in size. To demonstrate that oligonucleotide-directed triple-helix formation is a viable chemical approach for the site-specific cleavage of large genomic DNA, an oligonucleotide with EDTA-Fe at the 5' and 3' ends was targeted to a 20-base pair sequence in the 340-kilobase pair chromosome III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Double-strand cleavage products of the correct size and location were observed, indicating that the oligonucleotide bound and cleaved the target site among almost 14 megabase pairs of DNA. Because oligonucleotide-directed triple-helix formation has the potential to be a general solution for DNA recognition, this result has implications for physical mapping of chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2050717638,"We have generated transgenic mice that express the intracellular anti-influenza virus protein Mx1 under control of an interferon-responsive regulatory element. Upon infection with influenza virus, mice of a high responder line produce Mx1 protein locally at the sites of initial viral replication, exhibit little viral spread, and survive infection. Mice of a low responder line show more extensive viral spread and survive infection only when virus is given at high doses. To survive low dose infections, these mice require injection of interferon along with virus. The results show that influenza viral pathogenesis is determined by a subtle balance between the dose of the infecting virus and the levels of the antiviral host factor Mx1 and that mice can be rendered resistant to a virulent infection by âintracellular immunizationâ achieved through germline transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1501842015,"We have used cassette and deletion mutagenesis to analyze the structural features of fragment B-related sequences in the fusion toxin DAB486-IL-2 (where IL-2 represents interleukin-2) that are necessary for the efficient delivery of fragment A to the cytosol of target cells. We demonstrate that whereas an intact disulfide bond between Cys461 and Cys471 may be required for the cytotoxic action of native diphtheria toxin, this bond is not required for the cytotoxic action of DAB486-IL-2. The in-frame deletion of the 97 amino acids from Thr387 to His485 of DAB486-IL-2 increases both the potency and the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of the resulting fusion toxin for high affinity interleukin-2 receptor-bearing target cells. In contrast, the inframe deletion of either the 191 amino acids between Asp291 and Gly483 or the 85 amino acids between Asn204 and Ile290 results in a 1000-fold loss in potency. These regions contain the putative membrane-spanning regions and the amphipathic membrane surface-associating regions of fragment B, respectively. These results indicate that the efficient delivery of the ADP-ribosyltransferase from DAB486-IL-2 to the cytosol requires the membrane-associating domains of fragment B. This function has been postulated to play a role in the diphtherial intoxication of eukaryotic cells. However, unlike native diphtheria toxin, fragment B sequences distal to Thr387 do not enhance the potency of DAB486-IL-2."
https://openalex.org/W1552027202,"Light induces an irreversible modification of the photosystem II reaction center (RCII) affecting specifically one of its major components, the D1 protein (Ohad, I., Adir, N., Koike, H., Kyle, D. J., and Inoue, Y. I. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1972-1979) which is degraded and replaced continuously (turnover). The turnover rate of D1 is related to light intensity. Evidence is presented showing that RCII translocates from the site of damage in the grana (appressed) domain of the chloroplast membranes to unappressed membrane domains where the D1 precursor protein (pD1) is translated and becomes integrated into RCII. Several forms of RCII (a, a*, and b) were identified on the basis of their electrophoretic mobility. pD1 was found only in the a and b forms in the unappressed membranes. Processing of pD1 occurs after its integration into RCII. Mature D1 appeared mostly in the a form of RCII and following its translocation to the appressed membrane domains also in the a* form. Thus the light intensity-dependent synthesis of D1 protein is related to the availability of modified RCII which serves as an acceptor for pD1. The shuttling of RCII between the two membrane domains may represent a control mechanism of thylakoid membrane protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1582927527,"A hybrid precursor protein constructed by fusing the mitochondrial matrix-targeting signal of rat preornithine carbamyl transferase to murine cytosolic dihydrofolate reductase (designated pO-DHFR) was expressed in Escherichia coli. Following purification under denaturing conditions, pO-DHFR was capable of membrane translocation when diluted directly into import medium containing purified mitochondria but lacking cytosolic extracts. This import competence was lost with time, however, when the precursor was diluted and preincubated in medium lacking mitochondria, unless cytosolic proteins (provided by rabbit reticulocyte lysate) were present. Identical results were obtained for purified precursor made by in vitro translation. The ability of the cytosolic proteins to maintain the purified precursor in an import-competent state was sensitive to protease, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and was heat labile. Further, this activity appeared to be signal sequence dependent. ATP was not required for the maintenance of pO-DHFR competence, nor did purified 70-kDa heat shock protein (the constitutive form of Hsp70) substitute for this activity. Interestingly, however, purified Hsp70 prevented aggregation of the precursor in an ATP-dependent manner and, as well, retarded the apparent rate and extent of pO-DHFR folding. Partial purification of reticulocyte lysate proteins indicated that competence activity resides within a large mass protein fraction (200-250 kDa) that contains Hsp70. Sucrose density gradient analysis revealed that pO-DHFR reversibly interacts with components of this fraction. Pretreatment of the fraction with NEM, however, significantly stabilized the subsequent formation of a complex with the precursor. The results indicate that Hsp70 can retard precursor polypeptide folding and prevent precursor aggregation; however, by itself, Hsp70 cannot confer import competence to pO-DHFR. Maintenance of import competence correlates with interactions between the precursor and an NEM-sensitive cytosolic protein fraction. Efficient dissociation of the precursor from this complex appears to require a reactive thiol moiety on the cytosolic protein(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1506671658,"Insulin was found to stimulate the serine/threonine kinase activity of the proto-oncogene product Raf-1. This stimulation was observed in HeLa, NIH 3T3, and Chinese hamster ovary cells, all overexpressing the human insulin receptor. In the HeLa cells, 100 pM insulin gave a significant increase in Raf-1 kinase activity, and 100 nM insulin caused a maximal 2-5-fold increase in activity. The increase in activity was detected after 2 min of insulin treatment and peaked after 5 min. In addition to stimulating Raf-1 kinase activity, insulin caused a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the Raf-1 protein and an increase in the amount of serine phosphorylation of Raf-1. Moreover, a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase, phosphatase 1, but not two tyrosine-specific phosphatases, was found to deactivate the insulin-activated Raf-1 kinase activity. These findings indicate that insulin activates the serine/threonine kinase activity of the Raf-1 proto-oncogene by increasing its content of phosphoserine."
https://openalex.org/W1547854436,"The herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) UL42 protein, one of seven herpes-encoded polypeptides that are required for the replication of the HSV-1 genome, is found in a 1:1 complex with the HSV-1 DNA polymerase (Crute, J. J., and Lehman, I. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19266-19270). To obtain herpes DNA polymerase free of UL42 protein, we have cloned and overexpressed the Pol gene in a recombinant baculovirus vector and purified the recombinant DNA polymerase to near homogeneity. Replication of singly primed M13mp18 single-stranded DNA by the recombinant enzyme in the presence of the herpes encoded single-stranded DNA-binding protein ICP8 yields in addition to some full-length product a distribution of intermediate length products by a quasi-processive mode of deoxynucleotide polymerization. Addition of the purified UL42 protein results in completely processive polymerization and the generation of full-length products. Similar processivity is observed with the HSV-1 DNA polymerase purified from herpes-infected Vero cells. Processive DNA replication by the DNA polymerase isolated from HSV-1-infected Vero cells or the recombinant DNA polymerase-UL42 protein complex requires that the single-stranded DNA be coated with saturating levels of ICP8. ICP8 which binds single-stranded DNA in a highly cooperative manner is presumably required to melt out regions of secondary structure in the single-stranded DNA template, thereby potentiating the processivity enhancing action of the UL42 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2058349538,"A systematic series of N-terminal, C-terminal, and internal deletion mutants of S. cerevisiae TFIID were expressed in vitro and tested for TATA box binding and basal level transcription activities using, respectively, DNA mobility shift and in vitro transcription assays. The domains responsible for these activities were colocalized to a surprisingly large region containing C-terminal residues 63-240. This region was noted previously to contain potentially interesting structural motifs (central basic core, direct repeats, and sigma factor homology) and, more recently, to be highly conserved among TFIID from different species. Deletion mutant cotranslation studies revealed that TFIID binds DNA as a monomer. The implications of these results for TFIID structure and function are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1569096762,"Detailed in vitro comparisons of the biochemical characteristics of three protein kinase C isozymes were performed. As an alternative to earlier uncertain separation methods and expression schemes, highly purified and genetically distinct protein kinase C enzymes were produced using the baculovirus expression system. The baculovirus expression system yielded approximately 200-300 micrograms of the purified isozyme from 3 x 10(8) (100 ml of culture medium) baculovirus-infected insect cells. Biochemical characterization of the expressed isozymes indicated that the three isozymes had virtually indistinguishable Ca2+, Mg2+, and ATP dependencies. However, in certain critical functional characteristics such as phosphatidylserine dependencies, phospholipid and substrate preferences, and arachidonic acid activation, the gamma isozyme exhibited distinctive properties when compared with both the alpha and beta II subtypes. In addition, the activity of the beta II subtype was more dependent upon diacylglycerol or phorbol esters for activation than either the alpha or gamma isoforms. The alpha isozyme, unlike the beta II and gamma forms, was totally dependent on Ca2+ for activation in the presence of free arachidonic acid. These studies provide definitive characterizations of the pure isoforms; many of the findings were consistent with earlier enzymatic observations using hydroxyapatite-purified isoforms. Thus, the distinctive biochemical properties of the protein kinase C isozymes are consistent with the hypothesis that each isoform may have distinct roles in signal transduction processes."
https://openalex.org/W1595260871,"The ways in which the carbohydrate moieties of laminin affect its cellular interactions have been examined by two different experimental approaches. In one approach, we used lectins in order to block specific carbohydrates on laminin which previously had been dried onto a plastic surface. We found that wheat germ agglutinin and Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin I blocked the binding of the neuron-like rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12. However, when concanavalin A was used cell binding was unaffected but neurite outgrowth was prevented, compared to controls, over a 24-h period. In the second approach we used unglycosylated laminin as a substratum on the plastic surface. We have developed a method for the purification of unglycosylated laminin from tunicamycin treated cultures of a mouse embryonal carcinoma derived cell line, M1536 B3, and have partially characterized the purified material. A mixture of unglycosylated and glycosylated laminin was selectively purified from the M1536 B3 cell lysate by an anti-EHS laminin monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity column. The unglycosylated laminin was separated from glycosylated laminin using G. simplicifolia lectin affinity chromatography. The lectins, wheat germ agglutinin, G. simplicifolia agglutinin I, and concanavalin A, did not bind to any of the subunits of unglycosylated laminin in Western blots. The unglycosylated laminin migrated as a single band in agarose-gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions indicating that it is a fully assembled and disulfide bonded molecule. Circular dichroism studies showed no differences between glycosylated and unglycosylated laminin, indicating similar molecular conformations. Western blots using antibodies specific for the A, B1, and B2 chains of laminin showed that unglycosylated laminin contained each of these subunits. We then performed cell binding and spreading or neurite outgrowth assays using unglycosylated laminin. A mouse melanoma cell line, B16 F1, bound to this laminin in the same numbers as to the control glycosylated laminin, but cell spreading was minimal. When this unglycosylated laminin was used as a substrate for PC12 cells neurite outgrowth was impaired; no effect was noted on the number of cells bound, compared to glycosylated laminin. We conclude from these results that once cells become bound to laminin the carbohydrate residues of that glycoprotein must be available to enable the cells to spread or to extend neurite processes."
https://openalex.org/W1522031293,"Several growth factors and mitogens have been shown to activate the proto-oncogene product Raf-1 protein kinase in murine fibroblasts, apparently through a direct agonist-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the Raf-1 protein. We investigated the possibility that insulin could also activate the Raf-1 kinase, since its receptor also contains an intrinsic insulin-activated protein tyrosine kinase activity. In several cell lines expressing relatively large numbers of insulin receptors, insulin rapidly stimulated the phosphorylation of immunoreactive Raf-1 protein. In H35 cells, a line of well differentiated rat hepatoma cells, the effect of insulin was maximal by 6 min and at 7 nM insulin and occurred normally in cells virtually completely depleted of protein kinase C activity. The insulin-stimulated increase in Raf-1 protein phosphorylation occurred concurrently with a 3-fold increase in Raf-1 protein kinase activity. However, phosphoamino acid analysis showed that only phosphoserine and a trace of phosphothreonine were present in the Raf-1 protein after insulin stimulation of the cells. This was true even when investigated at shorter times (4 min) after insulin stimulation and despite the use of phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. We conclude that insulin can rapidly activate the Raf-1 kinase in some insulin-sensitive cell types but that this activation probably occurs through a mechanism distinct from direct phosphorylation of the Raf-1 protein by the insulin receptor protein tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2034297526,"A mammalian transcription factor, which, along with other factors, is essential for accurate initiation of transcription from promoters by RNA polymerase II, has been found to regulate the interaction of polymerase and DNA. This factor, designated beta gamma, drastically reduces the affinity of RNA polymerase II for free DNA containing either promoter or nonpromoter sequences. In this respect, beta gamma functions as does the bacterial transcription initiation factor sigma 70, which expedites the binding of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase to promoters in part by accelerating dissociation of the polymerase from nonpromoter sites in DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2054862233,"The normal function of vertebrate photoreceptor cells depends on multiple interactions and transfer of substances between the photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), but the mechanisms of these interactions are poorly understood. Many are thought to be mediated by the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), a complex extracellular matrix that surrounds the photoreceptors and lies between them and the RPE. Histochemical, immunocytochemical, and lectin probes for several IPM constituents revealed that components of the IPM in the rat undergo a major shift in distribution or molecular conformation after the transition between light and dark. In the light, various IPM constituents concentrated in bands at the apical and basal regions of the outer segment zone; in the dark, they distributed much more uniformly throughout the zone. The change in IPM distribution was triggered by the light-dark transition; it was not a circadian event, and it was not driven by a systemic factor. The light-evoked change in IPM distribution may facilitate the transfer of substances between the photoreceptors and the RPE."
https://openalex.org/W2083314533,"A 25 residue peptide, Dk-(61â85), derived from the Î±1 domain of a murine MHC class I molecule (H-2Kk), enhances cellular glucose uptake, prolongs the effect of insulin, and inhibits insulin receptor internalization without affecting insulin binding or dissociation. Full effect of the peptide is obtained at 10â100 Î¼M. The magnitude of the peptide-mediated enhancement of glucose uptake is insulin dependent and is at maximum â¼50% above that of full insulin stimulation, excluding a merely insulinomimetic action of the peptide. Dk-(61â85) does not interact directly with the glucose transporter molecule. Furthermore, the peptide-mediated inhibition of insulin receptor internalization results in 2â3 times more receptors in the plasma membrane. The peptide also causes hypoglycemia in rats. The biological activity of Dk-(61â85) suggests that an important nonimmunological role of MHC class I molecules is to affect some of the key functions of ligand-activated receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1521631264,"Mammalian DNA ligase I is presumed to act in DNA replication. Rabbit antibodies against the homogeneous enzyme from calf thymus inhibited DNA ligase I activity and consistently recognized a single polypeptide of 125 kDa when cells from an established bovine kidney cell line (MDBK) were lysed rapidly by a variety of procedures and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. After biosynthetic labeling of MDBK cells with [35S]methionine, immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a polypeptide of 125 kDa that did not appear when purified calf thymus DNA ligase I was used in competition. A 125-kDa polypeptide was adenylated when immunoprecipitated protein from MDBK cells was incubated with [alpha-32P]ATP. Thus, the apparent molecular mass of the initial translation product is identical or nearly so to that of the purified enzyme. The half-life of the protein is 7 h as determined by pulse-chase experiments in asynchronous MDBK cells. Immunocytochemistry and indirect immunofluorescence experiments showed that DNA ligase I is localized to cell nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W1557606069,"We have characterized the minimal functioning unit of UhpT, the secondary carrier that mediates exchange of phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate in Escherichia coli. Membranes of a UhpT overproducing strain were solubilized with 1.25% octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside, in the presence of 0.1% E. coli phospholipid and with 20% glycerol as the osmolyte stabilant. That soluble UhpT could bind its natural substrates was indicated by the protections afforded by sugar phosphates against thermal inactivation or chemical modification with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Moreover, the degree of protection correlated with the strength of interaction between UhpT and the test substrate (2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate = glucose 6-phosphate greater than galactose 6-phosphate = glucose 1-phosphate much greater than glucose 6-sulfate). Other experiments demonstrated that soluble UhpT existed as a monomer. For example, during both high performance liquid chromatography and conventional gel permeation chromatography, the elution pattern of UhpT activity was measured directly by a rapid reconstitution technique. In both cases, and in the presence and absence of substrate, UhpT activity traveled as a single component of Mr 53,000, corresponding closely to the sequence prediction of 50,600. Finally, reconstitution was studied at protein to lipid ratios low enough to achieve between 0.075 and 1.5 UhpT monomers/proteoliposome. Specific activity was constant throughout this range, a finding consistent with the idea of a functional monomer. Mitochondria and chloroplasts provide the only other anion exchange carriers described at this level of biochemical resolution, and these organelle antiporters function as dimers. By contrast, work summarized here places their bacterial counterpart, UhpT, in the same class as the lactose carrier of E. coli and the glucose carrier of the human erythrocyte, both of which function as monomers. Consideration of this pattern in conjunction with the known hydropathy profiles of these proteins suggests a novel scheme for the classification of all secondary carriers, with implications for both the structure and origin of these transport proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1569285132,The protein composition of inclusion bodies produced in recombinant Escherichia coli overproducing Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) was analyzed by one-dimensional and two-dimensional electrophoresis techniques. Results indicate the presence of two types of cytoplasmic aggregates of differing morphology in single bacterial cells. These aggregates also differ in their relative content of VHb and pre-beta-lactamase and are separable by differential centrifugation. Results further suggest that the cytoplasmic protein elongation factor Tu is integrated into VHb inclusion bodies. The presence of the outer membrane proteins OmpA and OmpF in inclusion body preparations is attributed to cell envelope contamination rather than specific involvement in inclusion bodies. The specificity of in vivo protein aggregation is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1493542669,"Fractionation of a yeast nuclear extract reveals at least four factors required in addition to RNA polymerase II for accurate initiation of transcription. One of these factors can be replaced by HeLa transcription factor IID or by its yeast counterpart expressed in Escherichia coli. Each of the remaining three factors can be replaced by a fraction from yeast whole cell extract, facilitating further purification of the factors."

https://openalex.org/W1494964391,"We have constructed a total deletion of the regulatory gene LEU3. Comparing the deletion mutant with a leu3 spontaneous mutant, we find that both types of mutants have lost the ability to regulate a LEU2'-lacZ translational fusion by the LEU3-alpha-isopropylmalate-dependent mechanism, which we confirm to be the major regulatory mechanism for LEU2. Surprisingly, cells containing the total leu3 deletion are more leaky (i.e. grow better in the absence of extraneous leucine) than cells containing a spontaneous leu3 mutation. Accompanying the growth rate difference is a difference in the expression of the LEU2-lacZ fusion: the specific activity of beta-galactosidase amounts to about 8% of a wild type control in a leu3 total deletion mutant, but drops to about 2% in a leu3 spontaneous mutant. The spontaneous mutant differs from the total deletion mutant in that it produces an inactive protein which is still able to bind to the LEU2 upstream activating sequence. We conclude that a basal level control of LEU2 becomes manifest in the absence of LEU3 and is interfered with when LEU3 protein binds to the LEU2 promoter. This conclusion is supported by the finding that a mutant which contains an intact LEU3 gene but is unable to generate alpha-isopropylmalate also interferes with basal level expression of LEU2. Basal level expression depends upon the GCN4 protein, even though LEU2 is not subject to derepression by the general amino acid control system. Changes in the steady-state concentration of LEU2 mRNA show the same trend as changes in the specific activity of the LEU2-lacZ fusion protein, suggesting that regulation of LEU2 expression at both the basal and nonbasal levels is largely transcriptional. The role of alpha-isopropylmalate in the regulation of LEU2 expression appears to be that of a co-activator. Employing mobility shift assays, we show that specific interaction between the LEU3 protein and a 30-base pair DNA fragment carrying the upstream activating sequence of LEU2 takes place irrespective of the presence or absence of alpha-isopropylmalate."
https://openalex.org/W1575390278,"Gene 32 protein (g32P), the replication accessory protein from bacteriophage T4, is a zinc metalloprotein which binds with high cooperativity to single-stranded (ss) nucleic acids. The basic N-terminal 21 amino acids (termed the domain) is required for highly cooperative (omega approximately 500) binding of g32P monomers to ss nucleic acids. As part of our studies to systematically evaluate the structural features of the B domain important for cooperative binding, a homogeneous source of g32P which binds noncooperatively to nucleic acids (omega = 1) and is devoid of contamination by native g32P is needed. Herein, we describe large-scale overexpression and purification of recombinant g32P lacking the tryptic N-terminal B domain (residues 1-21), designated g32P-B, as well as its physiochemical and nucleic acid binding properties. G32P-B is readily purified from the soluble fraction of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with the plasmid pT7g32-B.wt which contains the g32P-B coding sequences under inducible transcriptional control of T7 RNA polymerase. Anion exchange, ssDNA-cellulose and phenyl-Sepharose chromatographies give rise to highly homogeneous g32P-B, free of contaminating nucleic acid. Recombinant g32P-B has the expected N-terminal primary structure and contains stoichiometric Zn(II). It also has the expected globular structure as shown by 1H NMR spectroscopy, hydrodynamic measurements, and the ability to selectively remove the carboxyl-terminal A domain to form the trypsin-resistant g32P-(A + B) DNA-binding core fragment. Quantitative ss nucleic acid binding experiments of g32P-B to poly(dT) (0.05 M NaCl, pH 8.1, 20 degrees C) show that all equilibrium binding isotherms can be fit with omega = 1 and Kobs = 5.2 (+/- 1.6) x 10(5) M-1, with a moderate electrostatic component to the binding free energy, delta log Kobs/delta log[NaCl] = -3.0 +/- 0.2. Under identical solution conditions, g32P-(A + B) derived from g32P-B binds to poly(dT) noncooperatively as expected, but with an approximately 80-fold higher apparent affinity, Kobs = 4.0 (+/- 2.0) x 10(7) M-1, and detectable enhanced salt sensitivity, delta log Kobs/delta log[NaCl] = -3.9 +/- 0.3. As the salt concentration is raised, the relative difference in Kobs between the g32P-(A + B) and g32P-B is gradually reduced such that extrapolation of the log-log plots to 1 M Na+ standard state gives similar Kobs within experimental error. Qualitatively similar observations are also found upon binding to the ribohomopolymer, poly(U).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1496438535,"Genetic complementation of an Escherichia coli double mutant was used to isolate and express the gene coding for Plasmodium falciparum glucose phosphate isomerase. The gene contains a 1773-base pair open reading frame, has no introns, and maps to P. falciparum chromosome 14. 34% of the deduced amino acid sequence is identical to human glucose phosphate isomerase, with highest similarity in regions of the proposed active sites. The putative initiation site of translation was determined by deletional and oligonucleotide mediated, site-specific mutageneses. Our data suggest that key metabolic enzymes of Plasmodia can be cloned and expressed in E. coli without prior knowledge of the primary amino acid or nucleic acid structure."
https://openalex.org/W1596908664,"A cDNA clone encoding the entire transacylase (E2b) precursor of the bovine branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (Griffin, T. A., Lau, K. S., and Chuang, D. T. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14008-14014) was used to construct a prokaryotic expression vector for recombinant mature E2b. The overexpression in Escherichia coli correlates with the presence near the 5'-terminus of the mature E2b coding region (nucleotides 20 to 28) of the sequence 5'-TCAAACT-CT-3'. It has been proposed that this sequence is involved in secondary mRNA recognition through interaction with the 5'-terminus of the bacterial 16 S rRNA. The mature E2b protein has transacylase activity when assayed with exogenous dihydrolipoamide and [1-14C] isovaleryl-CoA as substrates. However, the recombinant protein has no attached lipoic acid. This was established by the absence of radiolabel incorporation when transformed E. coli cells were grown in a medium containing DL-[2-3H]lipoic acid. The recombinant mature E2b protein was purified to greater than 95% purity in one step using Sepharose 4B column chromatography. The purified recombinant protein was shown to have a cubic 24-mer structure by electron microscopy and to possess a specific activity similar to that of the purified natural bovine E2b. The purified recombinant mature E2b was lipoylated in vitro in the presence of 2 mM ATP using a mitochondrial extract prepared from bovine liver. The above results provide the first evidence that the proper folding and assembly of mature bovine E2b is independent of the attachment of lipoyl moieties and that mammalian lipoylation activity is present in mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1491610149,"Studies of limited proteolysis on purified ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase with various proteases were performed in the presence and absence of the flavoprotein ligands. Both the diaphorase and the ferredoxin-dependent activities of the enzyme were followed as well as the proteolytic pattern in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with further characterization of the polypeptides produced. These experiments revealed that only two regions of the flavoprotein are susceptible to the attack of the proteases used: (a) the N-terminal chain which can be cleaved only up to Lys35 and (b) the sequence segment 235-250. It can be inferred that these regions are on the surface of the protein molecule and presumably have a very flexible conformation adaptable to the protease active site. The deletion of the N-terminal region up to Thr36 of the native reductase (Mr 35,000) produced a truncated form (Mr about 31,000) which had full diaphorase activity but lost the capacity to catalyze the ferredoxin-dependent reaction. Proteolytic cleavage at the 235-250 segment of the sequence yielded a nicked protein (Mr about 30,000 by gel filtration; 23,000 plus 7,000 in denaturing electrophoresis) devoid of both activities. Protection by the flavoprotein ligands implies that the 23-35 region of the sequence is part of the binding site for ferredoxin and the 235-250 polypeptide segment is in the NADP(+)-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1618997646,"Rat cellular retinol binding protein (CRBP II) is a 134-amino acid intracellular protein synthesized in the polarized absorptive cells of the intestine. We have previously used 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to survey the structural effects of ligand binding on the apoprotein. For these studies, all 4 Trp residues of rat CRBP II were efficiently labeled with 6-fluorotryptophan (6-F-Trp) by inducing its expression in a tryptophan auxotroph of Escherichia coli. Resonances corresponding to 2 of its Trp residues underwent large downfield shifts upon binding of all-trans-retinol and retinal, while resonances corresponding to the other 2 Trp residues underwent only minor perturbations in chemical shifts. To identify which Trp residues undergo changes in their environment upon ligand binding, we have constructed four CRBP II mutants where Trp9, Trp89, Trp107, or Trp110 have been replaced by another hydrophobic amino acid. By comparing the 19F NMR spectrum of each 6-F-Trp-labeled mutant with that of wild type 6-F-Trp CRBP II, we demonstrate that the 19F resonance corresponding to Trp107 undergoes the largest change in chemical shift upon ligand binding (2.0 ppm downfield). This is consistent with the position of this residue predicted from molecular modeling studies. The 19F resonance corresponding to Trp9 also undergoes a downfield change in chemical shift of 0.5 ppm associated with retinol binding even though it is predicted to be removed from the ligand binding site. By contrast, the resonances assigned to Trp89 and Trp110 undergo only minor perturbations in chemical shifts. These results have allowed us to identify residue-specific probes for evaluating the interactions of all-trans-retinol (and other retinoids) with this intracellular binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1498640414,"A novel nucleic acid detection technique is described for the quantitative measurement of eukaryotic mRNA in biological samples. The procedure involves two steps: a hybridization reaction in solution with a biotinylated cDNA probe, and a conventional enzyme immunoassay that uses a monoclonal antibody for DNA.RNA hybrids to detect the specific mRNA.cDNA complexes. The method has comparable sensitivity to 32P-based methods and yields results that are quantitative and highly reproducible. Furthermore, the test can be performed using unfractionated cytoplasm without the need for extraction with organic solvents. This technique provides a rapid and quantitative method for studying changes in cellular mRNA levels, and it is suitable for testing large numbers of samples."
https://openalex.org/W1545980292,"N alpha-Acetylation is a major co-translational modification occurring at the alpha-NH2 group of eukaryotic cytosolic proteins. In order to understand better the specificity of N alpha-acetyltransferase, we used the purified enzyme from yeast (Lee, F.-J. S., Lin, L.-W., and Smith J. A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14948-14955) and synthetic peptides mimicking the NH2 terminus of yeast and human proteins. Alcohol dehydrogenase I-(1-24) and 8 of the 19 synthetic analogues with substitutions at the NH2-terminal residue were N alpha-acetylated with varying efficiency. Penultimate amino acid substitutions, except for proline, had little influence on N alpha-acetylation. Substitution of sequences from N alpha-acetylated proteins into the yeast sequences which cannot be N alpha-acetylated demonstrated that not only the first 3 NH2-terminal residues but also more carboxyl-terminal residues were important for determining the specificity of N alpha-acetyltransferase. Two other peptides mimicking yeast mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (subunit VI) and ATPase inhibitor, which are naturally non-acetylated, were efficiently acetylated. In addition, recombinant human alcohol dehydrogenase I and basic fibroblast growth factor, which are naturally N alpha-acetylated, were not acetylated post-translationally."

https://openalex.org/W1526657663,"Pseudomonas solanacearum is an important phytopathogen that produces a variety of extracellular enzymes. Previous reports suggested that one of these, a 43-kDa beta-1,4-endoglucanase (EGL), is initially synthesized with a 45-residue leader sequence that is removed during export. Experiments with globomycin presented here also suggest that the primary precursor of EGL (ppEGL) has a 45-residue leader sequence but that only the first 19 residues of the leader sequence are removed by signal peptidase II during initial export across the inner membrane. Further analysis suggested that the resultant 46-kDa intermediate precursor (pEGL) is a transient fatty acylated lipoprotein and is located on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane of P. solanacearum. Although Escherichia coli could synthesize ppEGL, modify it with palmitate, and remove the first 19 residues of the leader sequence during export across the inner membrane, only P. solanacearum could export pEGL across the outer membrane and remove the remaining 26 residues of the leader sequence producing the mature, extracellular EGL. The second step of the export process requires export machinery not present in E. coli. To our knowledge this represents the first example of a leader sequence with two distinct parts, one removed during export across the inner membrane and the other removed during export across the outer membrane."
