https://openalex.org/W4311588897,"Abstract In mammals, interactions between sequences within topologically associating domains enable control of gene expression across large genomic distances. Yet it is unknown how frequently such contacts occur, how long they last and how they depend on the dynamics of chromosome folding and loop extrusion activity of cohesin. By imaging chromosomal locations at high spatial and temporal resolution in living cells, we show that interactions within topologically associating domains are transient and occur frequently during the course of a cell cycle. Interactions become more frequent and longer in the presence of convergent CTCF sites, resulting in suppression of variability in chromosome folding across time. Supported by physical models of chromosome dynamics, our data suggest that CTCF-anchored loops last around 10 min. Our results show that long-range transcriptional regulation might rely on transient physical proximity, and that cohesin and CTCF stabilize highly dynamic chromosome structures, facilitating selected subsets of chromosomal interactions."

https://openalex.org/W4311666135,"Abstract Cytosine methylation efficiently silences CpG-rich regulatory regions of genes and repeats in mammalian genomes. To what extent this entails direct inhibition of transcription factor (TF) binding versus indirect inhibition via recruitment of methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins is unclear. Here we show that combinatorial genetic deletions of all four proteins with functional MBDs in mouse embryonic stem cells, derived neurons or a human cell line do not reactivate genes or repeats with methylated promoters. These do, however, become activated by methylation-restricted TFs if DNA methylation is removed. We identify several causal TFs in neurons, including ONECUT1, which is methylation sensitive only at a motif variant. Rampantly upregulated retrotransposons in methylation-free neurons feature a CRE motif, which activates them in the absence of DNA methylation via methylation-sensitive binding of CREB1. Our study reveals methylation-sensitive TFs in vivo and argues that direct inhibition, rather than indirect repression by the tested MBD proteins, is the prevailing mechanism of methylation-mediated repression at regulatory regions and repeats."

https://openalex.org/W4311589770,"Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit maturation is associated with a developmental transition from chloroplasts (in mature green fruit) to chromoplasts (in red fruit). The hallmark red color of ripe tomatoes is due to carotenogenesis and accumulation of the red carotenoid lycopene inside chromoplasts. Plastoglobules (PG) are lipid droplets in plastids that are involved in diverse lipid metabolic pathways. In tomato, information on the possible role of PG in carotogenesis and the PG proteome is largely lacking. Here, we outline the role of PG in carotenogenesis giving particular attention to tomato fruit PG proteomes and metabolomes. The proteome analysis revealed the presence of PG-typical FBNs, ABC1K-like kinases, and metabolic enzymes, and those were decreased in the PG of tomato chromoplasts compared to chloroplasts. Notably, the complete β-carotene biosynthesis pathway was recruited to chromoplast PG, and the enzymes PHYTOENE SYNTHASE 1 (PSY-1), PHYTOENE DESATURASE (PDS), ZETA-CAROTENE DESATURASE (ZDS), and CAROTENOID ISOMERASE (CRTISO) were enriched up to twelvefold compared to chloroplast PG. We profiled the carotenoid and prenyl lipid changes in PG during the chloroplast to chromoplast transition and demonstrated large increases of lycopene and β-carotene in chromoplast PG. The PG proteome and metabolome are subject to extensive remodeling resulting in high accumulation of lycopene during the chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition. Overall, the results indicate that PGs contribute to carotenoid accumulation during tomato fruit maturation and suggest that they do so by functioning as a biosynthetic platform for carotenogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4310727066,"Abstract The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) coordinates mRNA translation and processing of secreted and endomembrane proteins. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) prevents the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, but the physiological regulation of this process remains poorly characterized. Here, in a genetic screen using an ERAD model substrate in Caenorhabditis elegans , we identified an anti-viral RNA interference pathway, referred to as ER-associated RNA silencing (ERAS), which acts together with ERAD to preserve ER homeostasis and function. Induced by ER stress, ERAS is mediated by the Argonaute protein RDE-1/AGO2, is conserved in mammals and promotes ER-associated RNA turnover. ERAS and ERAD are complementary, as simultaneous inactivation of both quality-control pathways leads to increased ER stress, reduced protein quality control and impaired intestinal integrity. Collectively, our findings indicate that ER homeostasis and organismal health are protected by synergistic functions of ERAS and ERAD."
https://openalex.org/W4311576465,"In an increasingly older adult population, understanding the inter-relationship between three age related conditions malnutrition, frailty and sarcopenia is important in order to improve their recognition, treatment and prevention. This study aims to determine the overlap between malnutrition, frailty and sarcopenia by measuring estimates of prevalence for each individual condition. In addition, we will compare two models of frailty which are the accumulation of deficits and phenotype models.This is a cross-sectional study that will use the UK Biobank database, which will include a subset of 381,000 participants: males and females aged 50 years and above who completed the baseline assessments. For the baseline assessments, details of the participants' characteristics will be included. All three conditions will be identified and mapped to variables collected at the baseline assessment. Variables for malnutrition will be mapped according to the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. Frailty will be defined according to two models: the 36 deficits and the phenotype model. Finally, sarcopenia will be assessed according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) standard.This proposed study will help to understand the presence of malnutrition, frailty and sarcopenia in the older population and describe any overlap between the conditions. There is little published research on the overlap between these three conditions. Despite the similarity and shared criteria used for the identification of malnutrition, frailty and sarcopenia there is still a lack of cohesive thinking around the overlap of applied definitions and identification criteria.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04655456 approved on the 10th of December 2020."
https://openalex.org/W4311582845,"The prevalence of loneliness increases among older adults, varies across countries, and is related to within-country socioeconomic, psychosocial, and health factors. The 2000-2019 pooled prevalence of loneliness among adults 60 years and older went from 5.2% in Northern Europe to 24% in Eastern Europe, while in the US was 56% in 2012. The relationship between country-level factors and loneliness, however, has been underexplored. Because income inequality shapes material conditions and relative social deprivation and has been related to loneliness in 11 European countries, we expected a relationship between income inequality and loneliness in the US and 16 European countries.We used secondary cross-sectional data for 75,891 adults age 50+ from HRS (US 2014), ELSA (England, 2014), and SHARE (15 European countries, 2013). Loneliness was measured using the R-UCLA three-item scale. We employed hierarchical logistic regressions to analyse whether income inequality (GINI coefficient) was associated with loneliness prevalence.The prevalence of loneliness was 25.32% in the US (HRS), 17.55% in England (ELSA) and ranged from 5.12% to 20.15% in European countries (SHARE). Older adults living in countries with higher income inequality were more likely to report loneliness, even after adjusting for the sociodemographic composition of the countries and their Gross Domestic Products per capita (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.17-1.97).Greater country-level income inequality was associated with higher prevalence of loneliness over and above individual-level sociodemographics. The present study is the first attempt to explore income inequality as a predictor of loneliness prevalence among older adults in the US and 16 European countries. Addressing income distribution and the underlying experience of relative deprivation might be an opportunity to improve older adults' life expectancy and wellbeing by reducing loneliness prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W4310851490,"Carbonyl sulfide (COS) fluxes simulated by vegetation and soil component models, both implemented in the ORCHIDEE land surface model, were evaluated against field observations at two agroecosystems in central France. The dynamics of a biogenic process not yet accounted for by this model, i.e., COS emissions from croplands, was examined in the context of three independent and complementary approaches. First, during the growing seasons of 2019 and 2020, monthly variations in the nighttime ratio of vertical mole fraction gradients of COS and carbon dioxide measured between 5 and 180 m height (GradCOS/GradCO2), a proxy of the ratio of their respective nocturnal net fluxes, were monitored at a rural tall tower site near Orléans (i.e., a ""profile vs. model"" approach). Second, field observations of COS nocturnal fluxes, obtained by the Radon Tracer Method (RTM) at a sub-urban site near Paris, were used for that same purpose (i.e., a ""RTM vs. model"" approach of unaccounted biogenic emissions). This site has observations going back to 2014. Third, during the growing seasons of 2019, 2020 and 2021, horizontal mole fraction gradients of COS were calculated from downwind-upwind surveys of wheat and rapeseed crops as a proxy of their respective exchange rates at the plot scale (i.e., a ""crop based"" comparative approach). The ""profile vs. model"" approach suggests that the nocturnal net COS uptake gradually weakens during the peak growing season and recovers from August on. The ""RTM vs. model"" approach suggests that there exists a biogenic source of COS, the intensity of which culminates in late June early July. Our ""crop based"" comparative approach demonstrates that rapeseed crops shift from COS uptake to emission in early summer during the late stages of growth (ripening and senescence) while wheat crops uptake capacities lower markedly. Hence, rapeseed appears to be a much larger source of COS than wheat at the plot scale. Nevertheless, compared to current estimates of the largest COS sources (i.e., marine and anthropogenic emissions), agricultural emissions during the late stages of growth are of secondary importance."
https://openalex.org/W4311573129,"Objective This study contributes to the quantitatively large, yet narrow in scope research on body image in gay men by assessing whether gay and heterosexual men systematically differ on various dimensions of body image disturbance and associated pathology, i.e., eating disorder and body dysmorphic disorder symptoms. Moreover, we examined the influence of general everyday discrimination experiences and involvement with the gay community on body image. Method N = 216 men ( n = 112 gay men, n = 104 heterosexual men) participated in an online survey measuring the discrepancy between self-rated current and ideal body fat/ muscularity; drive for leanness, muscularity, and thinness; body satisfaction; body-related avoidance and checking; appearance fixing; overall body image disturbance; eating disorder and body dysmorphic disorder pathology; general everyday discrimination experiences; and involvement with the gay community. Results Gay men showed a greater discrepancy between self-rated current and ideal body fat; higher drive for thinness, body-related avoidance, appearance fixing, overall body image disturbance, eating disorder and body dysmorphic disorder pathology; and lower body appreciation than heterosexual men (all p ≤ .05). Contrary to expectation, everyday discrimination experiences were more strongly associated with body image disturbance and eating disorder/ body dysmorphic disorder pathology in heterosexual men than in gay men (all p ≤ .05). Gay community involvement was not associated with any body image disturbance-, ED-, or BDD aspect in gay men (all p ≥ .20). Discussion The results suggest greater body image disturbance in gay men than in heterosexual men regarding cognitions, emotions, behaviors, and perception as well as higher eating disorder and body dysmorphic disorder pathology. The results also suggest the dilemma of a thin, yet muscular body ideal in gay men. Surprisingly, discrimination experiences and involvement with the gay community did not explain differences in body image disturbance. Gay men may have become resilient to discrimination over time, and body ideals might differ across gay sub-communities."
https://openalex.org/W4311575285,"In this study, pristine biochar derived from date palm at 500°C was used in batch reactors (simulating blending adsorbent in aeration tank) and fixed-bed columns (simulating holding adsorbent in fixed-bed reactors). The removal performance of the biochar was assessed toward single and mixed-metal solutions as well as synthetic primary and secondary treated wastewater for copper (Cu 2+ ), iron (Fe 2+ ), nickel (Ni 2+ ) and zinc (Zn 2+ ). The order of maximum adsorption capacities of the metal ions at pH 7 followed: Fe 2+ (2.92/2.94 mg/g)&gt;Cu 2+ (2.69/2.78 mg/g) &gt;Zn 2+ (2.03/2.19 mg/g)&gt;Ni 2+ (1.69/1.02 mg/g) in single/mixed-metal solutions and Zn 2+ (2.91/11.26 mg/g)&gt;Fe 2+ (0.60/5.29 mg/g)&gt;Cu 2+ (0.56/5.05 mg/g)&gt;Ni 2+ (0.13/2.02 mg/g) in synthetic primary/secondary treated wastewater. Blending biochar in aeration tank reduced metal concentrations. The metal ion concentrations in the final effluent were below the World Health Organization drinking water limits (2, 0.3, 0.1 and 3 mg/L for Cu 2+ , Fe 2+ , Ni 2+ and Zn 2+ , respectively) suggesting that treated secondary wastewater can be spread into potable aquifers following disinfection. The Freundlich and the Pseudo-second order models fit best the batch experimental data. Experimental data from column analysis fit well to the Thomas model. The adsorption of metal ions on the surface of biochar was confirmed by Scanning electron microscopy, Energy dispersive X-ray studies, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Desorption studies using different eluents demonstrated the reusability potential of the studied biochar."
https://openalex.org/W4311581454,"Aphasia following cerebro-vascular accidents has been a primary source of insight for models of language in the brain. However, deviant language patterns in aphasia may reflect processing limitations and cognitive impairment more than language impairment per se.We sought to obtain new evidence from spontaneous speech in Broca's aphasia (BA) for the intactness of grammatical knowledge, operationalized as the preservation of the basic hierarchical structure of syntactic projections.Speech obtained with the AphasiaBank protocol from 20 people with BA, which were independently rated as also being agrammatic, was analyzed and compared to 20 matched non-brain-damaged controls. We quantified (i) marking of Aspect, Tense, and Modality (A-T-M), which are located at specific (high) layers of the syntactic hierarchy and ordered in relation to one another ([M…[T…[A…]]]); (ii) hierarchies of clausal units ([C…[C]]); (iii) discourse markers embedding clauses, located at the highest layer of the hierarchy; and (iv) attachment of adjuncts at different heights of a given hierarchical syntactic structure. Supplementary evidence was obtained from a typology of errors and from pauses subcategorized according to their hierarchical syntactic position.Groups did not quantitatively differ on rates of either Aspect or Modality but underproduced T and embedded clauses. Evidence for compensatory effects was seen in both of the latter two cases. While all adjunct types were underproduced in BA, and pauses overproduced, both showed the same relative proportions within both groups. Errors were largely restricted to omissions, of a kind that would also be expected in condensed neurotypical speech.Overall, these patterns support the hypothesis of intactness of grammatical knowledge in BA clinically rated as agrammatic, questioning it as a disease model of language impairment."
https://openalex.org/W4311572546,"Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) is the active ingredient in sunless tanning products and a combustion product from e-juices in electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). DHA is rapidly absorbed in cells and tissues and incorporated into several metabolic pathways through its conversion to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). Previous studies have shown DHA induces cell cycle arrest, reactive oxygen species, and mitochondrial dysfunction, though the extent of these effects is highly cell-type specific. Here, we investigate DHA exposure effects in the metabolically active, HepG3 (C3A) cell line. Metabolic and mitochondrial changes were evaluated by characterizing the effects of DHA in metabolic pathways and nutrient-sensing mechanisms through mTOR-specific signaling. We also examined cytotoxicity and investigated the cell death mechanism induced by DHA exposure in HepG3 cells. Millimolar doses of DHA were cytotoxic and suppressed glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Nutrient sensing through mTOR was altered at both short and long time points. Increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial-specific injury induced cell cycle arrest and cell death through a non-classical apoptotic mechanism. Despite its carbohydrate nature, millimolar doses of DHA are toxic to liver cells and may pose a significant health risk when higher concentrations are absorbed through e-cigarettes or spray tanning."
https://openalex.org/W4311572621,"Fatigue during walking is a common complaint in cerebral palsy (CP). The primary purpose of this study is to investigate muscle fatigue from surface electromyography (sEMG) measurements after a treadmill-based fatigue protocol with increasing incline and speed in children with CP with drop foot. The secondary purpose is to investigate whether changes in sagittal kinematics of hip, knee and ankle occur after fatigue. Eighteen subjects with unilateral spastic CP performed the protocol while wearing their ankle-foot orthosis and scored their fatigue on the OMNI scale of perceived exertion. The median frequency (MF) and root mean square (RMS) were used as sEMG measures for fatigue and linear mixed effects model were applied. The MF was significantly decreased in fatigued condition, especially in the affected leg and in the tibialis anterior and peroneus longus muscle. The RMS did not change significantly in fatigued condition, while the OMNI fatigue score indicated patients felt really fatigued. No changes in sagittal kinematics of hip, knee and ankle were found using statistical non-parametric mapping. In conclusion, the current fatigue protocol seems promising in inducing fatigue in a population with CP with drop foot and it could be used to expand knowledge on muscle fatigue during walking in CP."
https://openalex.org/W4311577577,"Minor amputations are performed in a large proportion of patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and early identification of the outcome of minor amputations facilitates medical decision-making and ultimately reduces major amputations and deaths. However, there are currently no clinical predictive tools for minor amputations in patients with DFU. We aim to establish a predictive model based on machine learning to quickly identify patients requiring minor amputation among newly admitted patients with DFU. Overall, 362 cases with University of Texas grade (UT) 3 DFU were screened from tertiary care hospitals in East China. We utilized the synthetic minority oversampling strategy to compensate for the disparity in the initial dataset. A univariable analysis revealed nine variables to be included in the model: random blood glucose, years with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, peripheral arterial diseases, DFU history, smoking history, albumin, creatinine, and C-reactive protein. Then, risk prediction models based on five machine learning algorithms: decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were independently developed with these variables. After evaluation, XGBoost earned the highest score (accuracy 0.814, precision 0.846, recall 0.767, F1-score 0.805, and AUC 0.881). For convenience, a web-based calculator based on our data and the XGBoost algorithm was established ( https://dfuprediction.azurewebsites.net/ ). These findings imply that XGBoost can be used to develop a reliable prediction model for minor amputations in patients with UT3 DFU, and that our online calculator will make it easier for clinicians to assess the risk of minor amputations and make proactive decisions."
https://openalex.org/W4311579270,"Objective Examine the relationship between food and housing insecurities, quality of care and quality of life in adults with diabetes using a nationally representative data source. Methods Data from 39,604 adults with diabetes who indicated if they experienced food and/or housing insecurity in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2014, 2015, 2017) was analyzed. Outcomes included quality of care (HbA1c test, eye exam, diabetes education, foot check) and quality of life (general health status, poor physical and mental health days, poor overall health days). Logistic models were run for each quality of care measure and linear models were run for each quality of life measure adjusting for socio-demographics, insurance status, and comorbidity count. Results 35.6% of adults with diabetes reported housing insecurity, 31.8% reported food insecurity, and 23.4% reported both. After adjustment, food and housing insecurity was significantly associated with lower odds of having an eye exam (housing:0.73, 95%CI:0.63,0.85; food:0.78, 95%CI:0.67,0.92; both:0.69, 95%CI:0.59,0.82), worse general health status (housing:-0.06 95%CI:-0.11,-0.01; food:-0.16, 95%CI:-0.21,-0.10; both:-0.14, 95%CI:-0.20,-0.09), and an increased number of poor mental health days (housing:1.73, 95%CI:0.83,2.63; food:2.08, 95%CI:1.16,3.00; both:1.97, 95%CI:1.05,2.90). Food insecurity was also associated with lower odds of receiving diabetes education (0.86, 95%CI:0.74,0.99) and an increased number of poor physical health days (0.95, 95%CI:0.14,1.76). Conclusion Changes to our healthcare delivery system are critical to improving standards of care and quality of life in all populations and may require a shift towards consideration of overlapping social risk factors rather than the siloed approach currently used."
https://openalex.org/W4311579422,"In times of pandemic, health literacy (HL) is very important, as it helps to find, understand, and use essential health information and services. According to WHO, HL is pivotal in fighting infodemic effectively, and education is a vital tool for developing it. In the presented work, we analyze 247 educational materials dedicated to children, adolescents, and their carers explaining the pandemic, prepared by the Chinese, American, German, Italian and Polish governments and international non-governmental organizations. Focusing on the textual and visual side of the documents, we investigated how the pandemic is explained and what discursive measures were used to inform young citizens about the risks and consequences of pandemic restrictions. Additionally, we verified whether the materials helped developing critical thinking, which is crucial to prevent spreading fake news and conspiracy theories. Although the analyzed materials were prepared in different cultural contexts, we identified that all of them contained simple instructions on the desired behaviours during the pandemic. Key messages relating to the importance of hygienic behaviors were often supplemented with guidelines on how to successfully complete each action. While the cultural particularities in presenting the state of the pandemic are visible, the challenges of dealing with the emotional and social crises were dominant all around the world. In our study, we argue that the possibilities of building HL were not fully exploited by the national and international institutions. Citizens were taught how to behave in unusual circumstances but not why they should behave differently. The educational materials lacked reliable knowledge that would allow them to deal with infodemic and develop critical thinking. We conclude that health education expertise worldwide should be focused on enhancing individuals' ability to make informed health decisions and provide three recommendations regarding the process of development of health educational resources for children and the youth."
https://openalex.org/W4311704500,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the final treatment option for patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). Unfortunately, TKA surgery is accompanied by acute postoperative pain that is more severe than arthroplasty performed in other joints. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms specific to post-TKA pain necessitates an animal model that replicates clinical TKA procedures, induces acute postoperative pain, and leads to complete functional recovery. Here, we present a new preclinical TKA model in rats and report on functional and behavioral outcomes indicative of pain, analgesic efficacy, serum cytokine levels, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) transcriptomes during the acute postoperative period. Following TKA, rats exhibited marked deficits in weight bearing that persisted for 28 days. Home cage locomotion, rearing, and gait were similarly impacted and recovered by day 14. Cytokine levels were elevated on postoperative days one and/or two. Treatment with morphine, ketorolac, or their combination improved weight bearing while gabapentin lacked efficacy. When TKA was performed in rats with OA, similar functional deficits and comparable recovery time courses were observed. Analysis of DRG transcriptomes revealed upregulation of transcripts linked to multiple molecular pathways including inflammation, MAPK signaling, and cytokine signaling and production. In summary, we developed a clinically relevant rat TKA model characterized by resolution of pain and functional recovery within five weeks and with pain-associated behavioral deficits that are partially alleviated by clinically administered analgesics, mirroring the postoperative experience of TKA patients."
https://openalex.org/W4311574030,"Objective An extensive international literature demonstrates that understanding pathways to care (PTC) is essential for efforts to reduce community Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP). However, knowledge from these studies is difficult to translate to new settings. We present a novel approach to characterize and analyze PTC and demonstrate its value for the design and implementation of early detection efforts. Methods Type and date of every encounter, or node, along the PTC were encoded for 156 participants enrolled in the clinic for Specialized Treatment Early in Psychosis (STEP), within the context of an early detection campaign. Marginal-delay, or the portion of overall delay attributable to a specific node, was computed as the number of days between the start dates of contiguous nodes on the PTC. Sources of delay within the network of care were quantified and patient characteristic (sex, age, race, income, insurance, living, education, employment, and function) influences on such delays were analyzed via bivariate and mixed model testing. Results The period from psychosis onset to antipsychotic prescription was significantly longer (52 vs. 20.5 days, [p = 0.004]), involved more interactions (3 vs. 1 nodes, [p&lt;0.001]), and was predominated by encounters with non-clinical nodes while the period from antipsychotic to STEP enrollment was shorter and predominated by clinical nodes. Outpatient programs were the greatest contributor of marginal delays on both before antipsychotic prescription (median [IQR] of 36.5 [1.3–132.8] days) and (median [IQR] of 56 [15–210.5] days). Sharper functional declines in the year before enrollment correlated significantly with longer DUP (p&lt;0.001), while those with higher functioning moved significantly faster through nodes (p&lt;0.001). No other associations were found with patient characteristics and PTCs. Conclusions The conceptual model and analytic approach outlined in this study give first episode services tools to measure, analyze, and inform strategies to reduce untreated psychosis."
https://openalex.org/W4311575488,"Distant water fishing occurs worldwide as foreign fleets fish in the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of other states. We test the hypothesis that host state governance performance is an explanatory factor in observed distant water fishing effort using Global Fishing Watch's fishing effort data obtained from vessels' automatic identification system (AIS). We examine the explanatory power of the World Governance Indicators (WGI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, and biophysical fisheries productivity indicators (temperature, oxygen, salinity, nutrients, and primary productivity) on fishing effort from foreign fleets across the four most common gear types (fixed gear, longliners, trawlers, and tuna purse seiners). Our models include both host EEZ fishery productivity indicators and governance indicators with R2 values of 0.97 for longlining, 0.95 trawling, 0.95 for fixed gear and 0.82 for tuna purse seiners. Although a lack of good governance may enable illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) has enabled the legal establishment of foreign fishing contracts. However, it is unlikely that fishing contracts are decoupled from economic and political negotiations on other issues. We argue that it is worthwhile to consider the term ""fish grabbing"", meaning wealthier and politically more powerful states consciously seek to profit from fishing in the waters of often weaker states through developing legal fishing contracts."
https://openalex.org/W4311576549,"School bullying is a major concern for school-aged youth and has great impacts on children’s health and well-being, and an increasing number of school bullying cases have been reported in China. Many studies have indicated that psychological resilience may have a well-established association with school bullying. However, only a limited number of studies have explored this association, especially among primary school students. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between school bullying and psychological resilience among primary school students from a Chinese city. The participants were 6,011 primary school students aged 7–14 years who were recruited in a cross-sectional survey in Luzhou, China. The statistical significance of differences between groups was tested using the χ 2 test or t test. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between psychological resilience and school bullying. The incidence rates of bullies and victims were 30.00% (1803/6011; 95% CI: 28.84%-31.16%) and 69.89% (4201/6011; 95% CI: 68.73%-71.05%), respectively. Psychological resilience was a protective factor of school bullying among primary school students (for bullying perpetrators, OR = 0.76, 95%CI:0.62–0.93, and for bully victims OR = 0.74, 95%CI:0.61–0.90), especially among female students (for bullying perpetrators, OR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.47–0.85, and for bully victims, OR = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.53–0.90). School bullying among primary school students in Luzhou City was highly prevalent. High levels of psychological resilience might be a protective factor in preventing primary students from being involved in school bullying, especially among females."
https://openalex.org/W4311577713,"Despite exhibiting cardiotoxicity, doxorubicin (DOX) is widely used for cancer treatments. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are important in the pathogenesis of heart failure. This necessitates the study of the effect of DOX on CFs. The impairment of calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis is a common mechanism of heart failure. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a receptor-regulated Ca2⁺ entry pathway that maintains calcium balance by sensing reduced calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. ORAI1, a calcium channel protein and the most important component of SOCE, is highly expressed in human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs). It is upregulated in CFs from failing ventricles. However, whether ORAI1 in HCFs is increased and/or plays a role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between ORAI1/SOCE and DOX-induced heart failure. Induction of apoptosis by DOX was characterized in HCFs. Apoptosis and cell cycle analyses were performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured using fluorescence. YM-58483 was used as an ORAI1/SOCE inhibitor. ORAI1-knockdown cells were established by RNA interference. In vivo experiments were performed by intraperitoneally injecting YM-58483 and DOX into mice. We first demonstrated that DOX significantly increased the protein expression level of p53 in HCFs by western blotting. FACS analysis revealed that DOX increased early apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase in fibroblasts. DOX also increased ROS production. DOX significantly increased the expression level of ORAI1 in CFs. Both YM-58483 and ORAI1 gene knockdown attenuated DOX-induced apoptosis. Similarly, YM-58483 attenuated cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase, and ORAI1 knockdown attenuated DOX-induced ROS production in HCFs. In the animal experiment, YM-58483 attenuated DOX-induced apoptosis. In HCFs, ORAI1/SOCE regulates p53 expression and plays an important role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. ORAI1 may serve as a new target for preventing DOX-induced heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W4311577794,"High performance sport for females is an area which is gaining more and more relevance today, but which hasn’t received the same research interest as sport for males. The aim of the present study was to analyse the motivational climate perceived by high performance female athletes and the implications on perceived motor competence and autonomous behaviour and check the differences according category, sport experience and training hours in performance and master climate. The participants were 615 female athletes who practice top level team sports, with ages comprised of 16 to 38 (M = 22,10; SD = 4,91). The sample consisted of two different categories: junior (n = 242) and senior (n = 373). These players participated in different team sports, specifically football, handball, basketball and volleyball, training between 6 and 24 hours a week (M = 8,34; DT = 4,33). The variables measured were: perceived motivational climate in sport, autonomous behaviour and perceived motor competence. A cluster analysis was carried out using, as a variable, the perceived motivational climate, and showing the existence of two profiles, one related to ego and the other to task. The multivariate analysis showed that the profile orientated towards the task had significant differences compared to the autonomous behaviour (M = 4.66 vs M = 3.41). At the same time an analysis was carried out looking at different social demographic variables, revealing how there were differences in the sports experience (those participants with more than ten years’ experience were more orientated towards ego, compared to those with less than ten years’ experience) and the category (junior athletes were more orientated towards the task, compared to senior athletes). It was concluded that a greater orientation towards the task can lead to an improvement in the perception of motor competence, with the youngest and least experienced athletes being the most prominent in this category."
https://openalex.org/W4311578143,"The sea urchin embryo development toxicity test was used to investigate toxicity of the benthic substrate in Biscayne National Park (BISC). Twenty-five sites were selected based upon a high potential for anthropogenic stressor input (e. g., hydrocarbons, personal care products, nutrients, etc.) or proximity to coral reef habitats. We found that sediment interstitial water (porewater) was toxic to urchin embryos at 22 of 25 sites. Healthy sites included two coral reefs (Anniversary Reef and Marker 14 Reef) and Turkey Point Channel. Discrete areas of BISC have highly toxic sediments and the presence of sediment contaminants could negatively impact reproduction, growth and population density of benthic invertebrates, such as corals. Results of the sea urchin embryo development toxicity test can be used as a baseline assessment for monitoring improvements or degradation in ecosystem health and could be a valuable tool to investigate the suitability of degraded habitats for future reef restoration. Since the last comprehensive environmental assessment of BISC was performed in 1999, further investigation into the sources of toxicity at BISC is needed."

The identification of populations with high level of genetic variability for seed longevity and associated traits will become a valuable resource for superior alleles for seed longevity. In this study, Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) approach, simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers and agro-morphological traits have been explored to investigate the diversity and population structure of assembled 96 genotypes. The GBS technique performed on 96 genotypes of soybean ( Glycine max (L.) Merrill) resulted in 37,897 SNPs on sequences aligned to the reference genome sequence. The average genome coverage was 6.81X with a mapping rate of 99.56% covering the entire genome. Totally, 29,955 high quality SNPs were identified after stringent filtering and most of them were detected in non-coding regions. The 96 genotypes were phenotyped for eight quantitative and ten qualitative traits by growing in field by following augmented design. The STRUCTURE (Bayesian-model based algorithm), UPGMA (Un-weighed Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean) and principal component analysis (PCA) approaches using SSR, SNP as well as quantitative and qualitative traits revealed population structure and diversity in assembled population. The Bayesian-model based STRUCTURE using SNP markers could effectively identify clusters with higher seed longevity associated with seed coat colour and size which were subsequently validated by UPGMA and PCA based on SSR and agro-morphological traits. The results of STRUCTURE, PCA and UPGMA cluster analysis showed high degree of similarity and provided complementary data that helped to identify genotypes with higher longevity. Six black colour genotypes, viz ., Local black soybean, Kalitur, ACC Nos. 39, 109, 101 and 37 showed higher seed longevity during accelerated ageing. Higher coefficient of variability observed for plant height, number of pods per plant, seed yield per plant, 100 seed weight and seed longevity confirms the diversity in assembled population and its suitability for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping."
https://openalex.org/W4311581281,"Background There is a persistent lack of understanding on the influence of the environment on behaviour and health. While the environment is considered an important modifiable determinant of health behaviour, past research assessing environments often relies on static, researcher-defined buffers of arbitrary distance. This likely leads to misrepresentation of true environmental exposures. This exploratory study aims to compare researcher-defined and self-drawn buffers in reflecting the spaces and time adolescents engage in physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour. It also investigates if adolescent’s access the PA facility and greenspace nearest their home or school for PA, as well as examine how much time adolescents spent in PA at any PA facilities and greenspaces. Methods Adolescents (aged 14–18 years; n = 34) were recruited from schools in West Yorkshire, England. Seven consecutive days of global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer data were collected at 15 second intervals. Using ArcGIS, we compared 30 different researcher-defined buffers including: radial, network and ellipse buffers at 400m, 800m, 1000m, 1600m and 3000m and participant-defined self-drawn neighbourhoods to objectively measured PA and sedentary space and PA time. Location of PA was also compared to Points of Interest data to determine if adolescents use the nearest PA facility or greenspace to their home or school and to examine how much PA was undertaken within these locations. Results Our exploratory findings show the inadequacy of researcher-defined buffer size in assessing MVPA space or sedentary space. Furthermore, less than 35% of adolescents used the greenspaces or PA facilities nearest to their home or school. Approximately 50% of time spent in PA did not occur within the home, school, PA facility, or greenspace environments. Conclusion Our exploratory findings help to begin to quantify the inadequacy of researcher-defined, and self-drawn buffers in capturing adolescent MVPA and sedentary space, as well as time spent in PA. Adolescents often do not use PA facilities and greenspaces nearest their home and school and a large proportion of PA is achieved outside PA facilities and greenspaces. Further research with larger samples are needed to confirm the findings of this exploratory study."

Many studies have been carried out on litter at present, but less research has been carried out on the eco-hydrological service functions of litter in different plant communities in Karst, especially in the area of Karst peak-cluster depressions in southwest China. To reveal the characteristics of the hydrological function of the litter layer of the plant community in the area of Karst peak-cluster depressions around FAST (Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope), three typical plant community litter layers of the broad-leaved forest, coniferous forest, and shrub were selected as research objects, and the hydrological function of the litter layer of different plant community types was studied using the immersion method. The results indicated: 1) The litter layer of the broad-leaved forest plant community has the strongest function of intercepting and regulating precipitation ( M lmax = 24.17±0.33 t/ha, M sv = 19.93±0.21 t/ha), and its hydrological service function is the best. 2) The higher the decomposition degree of litter, the stronger the interception function. 3) The fitted equations for both the litter water-absorption capacity ( Q ct ) and time ( t ) for plant communities were Q ct = b + a ln t , and the fitted equations for both the litter water-release capacity ( Q st ) and time ( t ) were Q st = a t b . 4) The fitted equations for both the water absorption and release rates ( v c and v s ) and time ( t ) of the litter were v = a t -b . The water absorption rates of litter were the fastest within 5 min (15529.01~22634.43 g/kg·h), with the greatest interception and storage function for short-term rainfall."
https://openalex.org/W4311589762,"Mangrove forest plays a very important role for both ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. In Vietnam, mangrove is mainly distributed in the Mekong delta. Recently, mangrove areas in this region decreased rapidly in both quality and quantity. The forest became bare, divided and scattered into many small patches, which was a major driver of ecosystem degradation. Without a quantitative method for effectively assessing mangrove health in the regional scale, the sustainably conserving mangrove is the challenge for the local governments. Remote sensing data has been widely used for monitoring mangrove distributions, while the characterization of spatial metrics is important to understand the underlying processes of mangrove change. The objectives of this study were to develop an approach to monitor mangrove health in Mui Ca Mau, Ca Mau province of Vietnam by utilizing satellite image textures to assess the mangrove patterns. The research result showed that mangrove areas increased double by 2015, but the forest had become more fragmented. We can be seen those changes in land use mainly come from land conversion from forest to shrimp farms, settlements areas and public constructions. The conserving existing mangrove forest in Mui Ca Mau should consider the relations between mangrove health and influencing factors indicated in the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W4311677387,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, continues to evolve and circulate globally. Current prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures against Covid-19 infection include vaccines, small molecule drugs, and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mainly mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells for viral entry. As emerging mutations in the spike protein evade efficacy of spike-targeted countermeasures, a potential strategy to counter SARS-CoV-2 infection is to competitively block the spike protein from binding to the host ACE2 using a soluble recombinant fusion protein that contains a human ACE2 and an IgG1-Fc domain (ACE2-Fc). Here, we have established Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines that stably express ACE2-Fc proteins in which the ACE2 domain either has or has no catalytic activity. The fusion proteins were produced and purified to partially characterize physicochemical properties and spike protein binding. Our results demonstrate the ACE2-Fc fusion proteins are heavily N-glycosylated, sensitive to thermal stress, and actively bind to five spike protein variants (parental, alpha, beta, delta, and omicron) with different affinity. Our data demonstrates a proof-of-concept production strategy for ACE2-Fc fusion glycoproteins that can bind to different spike protein variants to support the manufacture of potential alternative countermeasures for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants."
https://openalex.org/W4311572475,"Background Improving Quality of Life (QoL) for patients with chronic diseases is a critical step in controlling disease progression and preventing complications. The COVID-19 pandemic has hampered chronic disease management, lowering patients’ quality of life. Thus, we aimed to assess the quality of life and its determinants in patients with common chronic diseases, in Northwest Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1815 randomly selected chronic patients with common chronic diseases. A standardized WHOQOL BREF tool was used, and electronic data collection was employed with the kobo toolbox data collection server. Overall QoL and the domains of Health-Related Quality of life (HRQoL) were determined. Structural equation modelling was done to estimate independent variables’ direct and indirect effects. Path coefficients with a 95% confidence interval were reported. Results About one in third, (33.35%) and 11.43% of the study participants had co-morbid conditions and identified complications, respectively. The mean score of QoL was 56.3 ranging from 14.59 and 98.95. The environmental domain was the most affected domain of HRQoL with a mean score of 52.18. Age, psychological, and environmental domains of HRQoL had a direct positive effect on the overall QoL while the physical and social relationships domains had an indirect positive effect. On the other hand, the number of medications taken, the presence of comorbidity, and complications had a direct negative impact on overall QoL. Furthermore, both rural residency and the presence of complications had an indirect negative effect on overall QoL via the mediator variables of environmental and physical health, respectively. Conclusion The quality of life was compromised in chronic disease patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the environmental domain of HRQoL was the most affected. Several socio-demographic and clinical factors had an impact on QoL, either directly or indirectly. These findings highlighted the importance of paying special attention to rural residents, patients with complications, patients taking a higher number of medications, and patients with comorbidity."

https://openalex.org/W4311574493,"Objective This two-wave longitudinal study aimed at increasing knowledge about levels of parental stressors and rewards among mothers and fathers of children aged 1–18 during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway. Background The COVID-19 pandemic and infection-control measures have caused changes to family life. Managing homeschooling or caring for younger children while working from home may have posed significant strain on parental stress, negatively impacting the quality of parent-child relationships and parents’ sensitivity to their children’s needs. Method We employed data collected in April 2020 and April 2021 from the longitudinal population-based survey in Bergen/Norway (Bergen in ChangE-study). 7424 parents participated (58.6% mothers and 41.5% fathers). Results The overall levels of parental stressors and rewards did not change significantly. Over the two time points, the factors associated with decreased parental stressors were being male, aged 40–49 years, having a relatively high income, and reporting initial difficulties with closed kindergartens or schools. For parents aged 18–29 years, the level of parental stressors increased. Conclusion The study suggests that the overall levels of parental stress remained unchanged during the first year of the pandemic. Even so, the study also uncovered that younger parents represented a vulnerable subgroup. Implications To prevent detrimental consequences in the wake of the pandemic, it could be important to increase awareness and competence among professional staff in kindergartens, primary schools, and child health clinics targeting young parents and their children."

https://openalex.org/W4311580605,"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an essential pillar in the therapy of heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) presenting with broad left bundle branch block (LBBB) or pacemaker dependency. To achieve beneficial effects, CRT requires high bi-ventricular (BiV) pacing rates. Therefore, device-manufacturers designed pacing algorithms which maintain high BiV pacing rates by a left ventricular (LV) pacing stimulus immediately following a right ventricular sensed beat. However, data on clinical impact of these algorithms are sparse. We studied 17 patients implanted with a CRT device providing triggered left ventricular pacing (tLVp) in case of atrioventricular nodal conduction. Assessment of LV dyssynchrony was performed using echocardiographic and electrocardiographic examination while CRT-devices were set to three different settings: 1. Optimized bi-ventricular-stimulation (BiV); 2. Physiological AV nodal conduction (tLVp-off); 3. Physiological AV nodal conduction and tLVp-algorithm turned on (tLVp-on). QRS duration increased when the CRT-device was set to tLVp-off compared to BiV-Stim, while QRS duration was comparable to BiV-Stim with the tLVp-on setting. Echocardiographic analysis revealed higher dyssynchrony during tLVp-off compared to BiV-Stim. TLVp-on did not improve LV dyssynchrony compared to tLVp-off. QRS duration significantly decreased using tLVp-algorithms compared to physiological AV nodal conduction. However, echocardiographic examination could not show functional benefit from tLVp-algorithms, suggesting that these algorithms are inferior to regular biventricular pacing regarding cardiac resynchronization. Therefore, medical treatment and ablation procedures should be preferred, when biventricular pacing rates have to be increased. TLVp-algorithms can be used in addition to these treatment options."

In this study, I carried out a transcriptome analysis of A. emeiensis. A total of 78,381 unigenes were assembled from 64.2 million reads, and 47,541 (60.65%) unigenes were matched to known proteins in the public databases. Then, 9284 expressed sequence tag-derived simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) were identified, and the frequency of SSRs in the A. emeiensis transcriptome was 9.88%. Trinucleotide repeats (3699, 39.84%) were the most common type, followed by dinucleotide (3251, 35.02%) and mononucleotide (1750, 18.85%) repeats. Based on the SSR sequence, 6683 primer pairs were successfully designed, 40 primer pairs were randomly selected, and 10 primer pairs were identified as polymorphic loci from 186 individuals of A. emeiensis.

Thus, this study was designed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of undernutrition among children aged 6 to 59 months.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 432 children aged 6 to 59 months in the Menz Gera Midir District. A multi-stage sampling technique was applied to recruit the study participants. Socio-demographic and socio-economic variables were collected by using structured questionnaires. Anthropometric measurements of the children were measured according to the World Health Organization's recommendation. A data collection sheet was used to collect information on the types of foods and number of meals consumed by the child. A bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with undernutrition.In this study, about 11.3% (95% CI: 8.3-14.3%), 50.2% (95% CI: 45.5-55.0%), and 28% (95% CI: 23.8-32.3%) were wasted, stunted, and underweight, respectively. Children aged 12-23 months (AOR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.01-3.87), 36-47 months (AOR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.00-4.19), and being anemic (AOR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.73-4.92) were found to be an independent predictor of stunting. Moreover, being anemic was found to be significantly associated with wasting (AOR: 6.84; 95% CI: 3.16-14.82).According to the findings of this study, undernutrition was a serious public health issue among 6-59 month old children in the Menz Gera Midir District. Children's age and anemia status were significantly associated with stunting and wasting. Therefore, community-based nutrition programs are vital to reduce childhood undernutrition."
https://openalex.org/W4311582035,"Anemia in pregnancy is a public health concern. It has been diagnosed in 27% of pregnant women in Malaysia and up to 40% of pregnant women globally. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention initiative based on the health belief model. The MyPinkMom program was disseminated through a mobile messaging application to pregnant women to educate them on the prevention of anemia in pregnancy. We conducted a two-arm cluster-assignment, single-blinded, randomized control trial at two government antenatal clinics in Selangor. One clinic was randomly chosen as the intervention group, and the other was chosen as the control group. Sixty pregnant women with anemia from the intervention group received the MyPinkMom intervention program in the form of six infographic video clips, and 60 pregnant women with anemia from the control group received routine counseling on anemia in pregnancy. Pregnant women who had anemia secondary to hemoglobinopathy or other chronic diseases were excluded from this study. MANOVA showed significant increases in hemoglobin, knowledge, attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control scores for adherence to iron supplements, dietary iron, and dietary vitamin C intake (p &lt; 0.001) in the intervention group at week 6. A significant reduction also occurred in dietary tannin intake (p &lt; 0.001) in the intervention group at week 6. The intervention group at week 6 showed a large effect on hemoglobin level increments (partial eta squared, Ƞp2 0.268), dietary iron intake (Ƞp2 0.213), knowledge of anemia in pregnancy (Ƞp2 0.622), subjective norm scores for adherence to iron supplements (Ƞp2 0.167), and reduction in dietary tannin intake (Ƞp2 0.353). Similarly, repeated measures ANOVA showed that changes in hemoglobin levels were significantly different over time (i.e., at baseline, week 6, and week 12) between the intervention and control groups (p &lt; 0.001). Hemoglobin increased rapidly over time among participants in the intervention group but gradually in the control group. To conclude, the newly developed MyPinkMom program that was delivered through a messaging application showed effectiveness in preventing anemia during pregnancy."

CD31 hi Emcn hi vessels induced by PDGF-BB secreted by osteoclast precursors, together with osteoblasts and osteoclasts, constitute the ternary regulatory mechanism of bone tissue reconstruction. Objective This study aimed to determine whether RDTF can promote bone tissue remodeling and induce membrane growth in the rat Masquelet model and to explore its molecular mechanism based on the ternary regulation theory. Methods Thirty-six SD rats were randomized to three groups: blank, induced membrane, and RDTF treatment (n = 12/group). The gross morphological characteristics of the new bone tissue were observed after 6 weeks. Sixty SD rats were also randomized to five groups: blank, induction membrane, low-dose RDTF, medium-dose RDTF, and high-dose RDTF (n = 12/group). After 4 weeks, immunohistochemistry and western blot were used to detect the expression of membrane tissue-related proteins. The mRNA expression of key factors of ternary regulation was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Results RDTF positively affected angiogenesis and bone tissue reconstruction in the bone defect area. RDTF could upregulate the expression of key factors (PDGF-BB, CD31, and endomucin), VEGF, and HMGB1 mRNA and proteins in the ternary regulation pathway. Discussion and conclusion Although the expected CD31 hi Emcn hi vessels in the induction membrane were not observed, this study confirmed that RDTF could promote the secretion of angiogenic factors in the induced membrane.

Methods: Macaca mulatta were used with naturally-occurring and ligature-induced periodontitis. Gingival tissue samples were obtained from healthy, diseased, and resolved sites in four groups: young (≤3 years), adolescent (3–7 years), adult (12–26) and aged (18–23 years). Microarrays targeted circadian rhythm (n = 42), inflammation/tissue destruction (n = 11), bone biology (n = 8) and hypoxia pathway (n = 7) genes. Results: The expression of many circadian rhythm genes, across functional components of the pathway, was decreased in healthy tissues from younger and aged animals, as well as showing significant decreases with periodontitis. Negative correlations of the circadian rhythm gene levels with inflammatory mediators and tissue destructive/remodeling genes were particularly accentuated in disease. A dominance of positive correlations with hypoxia genes was observed, except HIF1A, that was uniformly negatively correlated in health, disease and resolution. Conclusions: The chronic inflammation of periodontitis exhibits an alteration of the circadian rhythm pathway, predominantly via decreased gene expression. Thus, variation in disease expression and the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease may be altered due to changes in regulation of the circadian rhythm pathway functions."

Due to the unstructured job market, women in the informal sector were at high risk to experience the adverse effects of the pandemic. This paper aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on women domestic workers and their families. Semi structured interviews conducted with fifty-four women domestic workers in three districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan were analyzed in five themes: disruption caused by lockdown, loss of livelihood, economic hardships, social support mechanism, and challenges faced during the pandemic. The study underlines that the pandemic left severe impacts on access to basic services, employment, food security at household level and pattern of expenditures. The plummeting economic activities led to sudden drops in earnings that forced families to sell their assets and incur debts. Respondents lamented over the social support system and considered it a necessary but not sufficient condition for uplifting the lives of the poor. Strains in marital relationships led to stress, anxiety and domestic violence among families. The utmost concern was the restoration of economic activities and urgent policy interventions to strengthen social safety measures for the vulnerable segments of society."

Prior research has shown that cattle grazing benefits native annual forb species in California’s coastal prairies, but drought and increasing aridity may alter this relationship. In 2016 and 2017, we resurveyed the vegetation structure, native annual forb cover, and native annual forb richness in ten grazed and ungrazed prairies that were originally measured in 2000 and 2001 along a 200-km gradient from Monterey to Sonoma counties in California. We found that grazed prairies continued to have significantly lower vegetation height and thatch depth than ungrazed prairies, and that shrub encroachment over the 15-year period was significantly greater in ungrazed prairies. Furthermore, grazed prairies continued to have greater native annual forb richness (4.9 species per site) than ungrazed sites (3.0 species per site), but native annual forb richness declined by 2.8 species per site in grazed prairies and 0.1 species per site in ungrazed prairies between survey periods. We suggest that severe drought and increasing aridity may be driving declines in native annual forb richness in grazed prairies. The species we recorded only in earlier surveys were disproportionately wetland-associated and had higher average specific leaf area than species that remained through the second survey period. Finally, the cover of native annual species increased regardless of whether prairies were grazed, suggesting that the high precipitation in 2017 may have benefitted the native annual forb species that persisted at sites between surveys.

We aimed to reveal how AFD encodes the information of temperature into neural activities. cGMP synthesis in AFD is crucial for thermosensation in AFD and thermotaxis behavior. Here we characterized the dynamic change of cGMP level in AFD by imaging animals expressing a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cGMP probe specifically in AFD and found that cGMP dynamically responded to both warming and cooling in a manner dependent on past T c . Moreover, we characterized mutant animals that lack guanylyl cyclases (GCYs) or phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which synthesize and hydrolyze cGMP, respectively, and uncovered how GCYs and PDEs contribute to cGMP and Ca 2+ dynamics in AFD and to thermotaxis behavior."

The citation frequency of a patent is widely recognized as representative of the patent's value. Thus, identifying potential highly cited patents is an important goal. A number of studies have attempted to distinguish highly cited patents from others based on statistical models, but a more effective and applicable method needs to be further developed.This paper treats the prediction of later patent citations as a classification problem and proposes a novel framework based on machine learning methods. First, a indices system to identify highly cited patents is constructed using multiple factors that are believed to influence citation frequency. Second, various machine learning models are utilized to identify highly cited patents. The optimized model with the best generalization capability is selected to predict the future impacts of newly applied patents, which may be representative of emerging significant technologies. Finally, we select the electric vehicle (EV) domain as a case study to empirically test the validity of this framework.The optimized support vector machine (SVM) model performs well in identifying highly cited EV patents. Technological frontiers in the EV domain are identified, which are related to the topics of information systems, batteries, stability control, wireless charging, and vehicle operation.The good performance in prediction accuracy and generalization capability of the method proposed in this paper verifies its effectiveness and feasibility."

Methods It was a randomized clinical trial; data was collected from Mayo Hospital, Lahore. Eighty-eight patients fulfilling the sample selection criteria were randomly assigned into group 1 (neural mobilization) and group 2 (conventional treatment). Pain intensity was measured on a numeric pain rating scale, range of motion with an inclinometer, and functional status with neck disability index (NDI). Data were analyzed using SPSS, repeated measure ANOVA for cervical ranges and the Friedman test for NPRS and NDI were used for within-group analysis. Independent samples t-test for cervical ranges and Mann-Whitney U test for NPRS and NDI were used for between-group comparisons. Results There was a significant improvement in pain, disability, and cervical range of motion after the treatment in both groups compared to the pre-treatment status (p &lt; 0.001), and when both groups were compared neural mobilization was more effective than conventional treatment in reducing pain and neck disability (p &lt; 0.001), but there was no significant difference present in the mean score of cervical range of motion between both groups.

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh human pathogenic coronavirus identified after HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), HCoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1, and MERS-CoV. SARS-Cov-2 is highly similar to SARS-CoV. COVID-19 is the corresponding acute disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that was initially reported in Wuhan, China towards the end of 2019 and spread to millions of humans globally. Unfortunately, limited studies were available on the efficacy of antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19 at the time of this study. ZingiVir-H is an Ayurvedic formulation for use in early therapy of viral disease. This clinical trial was planned to investigate (1) the efficacy and safety of ZingiVir-H and (2) the efficacy of ZingiVir-H as an add-on therapy to the standard of care in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods A total of 123 eligible subjects as per inclusion criteria were randomized within the study. Three subjects later declined to participate in the study and four subjects didn’t meet inclusion criteria, which brought the final evaluable subject count to 116 for the efficacy and safety endpoint analysis. Thus, a total of 116 patients were equally randomised into two groups, namely, ZingiVir-H and Placebo for this clinical trial. The study patients were assigned to receive either ZingiVir-H or Placebo along with the standard of care as per the National Indian COVID-19 treatment protocol. The time interval until a negative RT-PCR obtained, was evaluated during treatment with ZingiVir-H or Placebo for ten days. Liver and kidney function tests were regularly assessed to ensure the safety profile of ZingiVir-H. Results The study found that patients who were administered ZingiVir-H had a median recovery time of 5 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 5–5) when compared to 6 days (95% CI 5–6) in those who received Placebo. Besides, in Ordinal Scale analysis of all the patients treated with ZingiVir-H demonstrated significant redistribution to a better clinical status from ordinal scale 5 to 6 and 7 within five to seven days when compared to that of placebo treatment. The time required for clinical improvement and the number of days needed for hospitalization was significantly less in the ZingiVir-H treated group when compared to placebo. The absence of liver and kidney function changes affirmed the safety profile of ZingiVir-H. No serious adverse events were reported in ZingiVir-H treated patients. Conclusion We found that ZingiVir-H is effective and safe in managing COVID-19 infections and delaying the disease progression from mild to moderate and moderate to severe. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial report on the efficacy/safety of a herbo-mineral Ayurvedic drug against COVID-19 as of yet.

https://openalex.org/W4311588724,"This study attempted to answer the question, ""Can filtering the functional data through the frequency bands of the structural graph provide data with valuable features which are not valuable in unfiltered data""?. The valuable features discriminate between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically control (TC) groups. The resting-state fMRI data was passed through the structural graph's low, middle, and high-frequency band (LFB, MFB, and HFB) filters to answer the posed question. The structural graph was computed using the diffusion tensor imaging data. Then, the global metrics of functional graphs and metrics of functional triadic interactions were computed for filtered and unfiltered rfMRI data. Compared to TCs, ASDs had significantly higher clustering coefficients in the MFB, higher efficiencies and strengths in the MFB and HFB, and lower small-world propensity in the HFB. These results show over-connectivity, more global integration, and decreased local specialization in ASDs compared to TCs. Triadic analysis showed that the numbers of unbalanced triads were significantly lower for ASDs in the MFB. This finding may indicate the reason for restricted and repetitive behavior in ASDs. Also, in the MFB and HFB, the numbers of balanced triads and the energies of triadic interactions were significantly higher and lower for ASDs, respectively. These findings may reflect the disruption of the optimum balance between functional integration and specialization. There was no significant difference between ASDs and TCs when using the unfiltered data. All of these results demonstrated that significant differences between ASDs and TCs existed in the MFB and HFB of the structural graph when analyzing the global metrics of the functional graph and triadic interaction metrics. Also, these results demonstrated that frequency bands of the structural graph could offer significant findings which were not found in the unfiltered data. In conclusion, the results demonstrated the promising perspective of using structural graph frequency bands for attaining discriminative features and new knowledge, especially in the case of ASD."

https://openalex.org/W4311589978,"Introduction Young adults are considered one of the most hesitant groups towards getting vaccinated in the UK, which threatens the success of the vaccination program in ending the pandemic. Identifying and understanding the socio-cognitive beliefs is important to effectively design and implement health communication interventions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the underlying beliefs regarding COVID-19 vaccinations among young adults in the UK. Methods The study consisted of online, one-on-one interviews with 18 individuals (6 males, 12 females) aged between 18 and 29 years, conducted in June 2021. The guiding theoretical framework was the I-Change Model. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were independently coded by two researchers by using the constructs of the I-Change Model. Belief statements were elicited from the codes and the frequency of belief statements was recorded and compared between intenders and non-intenders. Results Similar beliefs were observed in intenders and non-intenders for most constructs of the I-Change Model. However, non-intenders distinguished themselves from intenders by their higher perceived risks of side effects and higher perceived disadvantages of being vaccinated. Non-intenders expressed the belief that the risk of unknown or long-term side effects, such as blood clotting and impact on fertility, were the main reason for them not to be willing to vaccinate. In addition, in both groups, participants had mostly similar beliefs as their friends and family. Conclusion This research provides insights in the specific beliefs of the young adult population of the UK regarding COVID-19 vaccinations, which could have implications for health communication interventions. The findings suggest that such interventions should focus on reducing the uncertainty regarding short- and long-term effects and potentially having a focus on the entire social environment of young adults."
