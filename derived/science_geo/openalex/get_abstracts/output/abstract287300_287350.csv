https://openalex.org/W2077000661,"During February and March 1985, nitrite levels along the northern (approximately 7° to 10°S) Peruvian coast were unusually high. These accumulations occurred in oxygen-deficient waters, suggesting intensified denitrification. In a shallow offshore nitrite maximum, concentrations were as high as 23 micromoles per liter (a record high). Causes for the unusual conditions may include a cold anomaly that followed the 1982-83 El Niño. The removal of combined nitrogen (approximately 3 to 10 trillion grams of nitrogen per year) within zones of new or enhanced denitrification observed between 7° to 16°S suggests a significant increase in oceanic denitrification."
https://openalex.org/W1964643129,"In 1979 two areas of upwelling were observed off Somalia, one near 10 degrees N and one near 5 degrees N. The areas of upwelling were characterized by sea surface temperatures between 17 degrees and 22 degrees C, high concentrations of surface nutrients (5 to 20 micromoles of nitrate per liter) and surface chlorophyll a (0.4 to 5.0 milligrams per cubic meter), primary productivity averaging 1.7 grams of carbon per square meter per day, and a phytoplankton assemblage dominated numerically by the diatom Nitzschia delicatissima."
https://openalex.org/W1975865852,"The warped heliospheric current sheet for early 1976 is calculated from the observed photospheric magnetic field by a potential field method. Comparisons with measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field polarity for early 1976 obtained at several locations in the heliosphere by Helios 1, Helios 2, Pioneer 11, and at the earth show a rather detailed agreement between the computed current sheet and the observations. It appears that the large-scale structure of the warped heliospheric current sheet is determined by the structure of the photospheric magnetic field and that ""ballerina skirt"" effects may add small-scale ripples."
https://openalex.org/W2026231263,"Satellite and research vessel observations of sea surface temperature during the southwest monsoon of 1979 show the development of large wedge-shaped areas of cold water along the Somali coast at both 5 degrees and 10 degrees N during June and July. The cold water associated with the large northern and southern Somali eddy systems could be traced several hundred kilometers offshore. By late August the cold wedge at 5 degrees N translated northeastward as far as 10 degrees N at speeds of 15 to 30 centimeters per second, indicating a coalescence of the systems."
https://openalex.org/W1979181119,"One of the primary objectives of modern surface chemistry of transition metals is the synthesis of surface compounds and complexes and the understanding of their reactivity, structure, and bonding. Such considerations are paramount for advancing understanding of catalysis, adhesion, organic thin-film growth, and electrocatalysis. On selected metals, particularly copper, silver, and gold, selective scission of X-H bonds (where X is oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur) by surface-bound atomic oxygen occurs to form moderately stable species that can be isolated for further study. Selective oxidation reactions may occur heterogeneously by means of this novel oxygen- activated route. Furthermore, this selective chemistry offers a paradigm for synthesis of a wide variety of surface organometallic complexes, whose formation can be predicted from acid-base principles. These subjects are discussed in this article with emphasis on their role in catalytic oxidation cycles."
https://openalex.org/W1977648921,Experimental obliteration of high-contrast wing stripes of the neotropical butterfly Anartia fatima affected neither survival nor wing damage in a natural population over a 5-month period. There is no direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that so-called disruptive wing patterns function as protective coloration in butterflies.
https://openalex.org/W1997983690,"Analysis of fossil birds from the Oligocene Jebel Qatrani Formation in the Fayum depression of Egypt, site of the oldest known hominoid primates, allows precise paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the climatic and biotic conditions that influenced some of the earliest stages of hominoid evolution. Unlike the fossil mammals of the Fayum, which belong largely to extinct groups, most of the birds are referable to living families, with some being close to modern genera. The avifauna consists mainly of aquatic species, with such forms as jacanas (Jacanidae) and shoebilled storks (Balaenicipitidae) indicating expanses of freshwater with dense floating vegetation. An avifauna closely analogous to that of the Fayum is found today only in a limited area of Uganda, north and west of Lake Victoria, a region of swampland bordered by forest and grasslands that presents marked faunal similarities to the environment inferred for the Egyptian Oligocene."
https://openalex.org/W2023506012,"Measurements were made in the equatorial Indian Ocean during spring and summer 1979 from the Somali coast to 62 degrees E in the interior of the western basin. The detailed vertical profiles of horizontal current show that the energetic dominance throughout the region of variability was on vertical scales of several hundreds of meters, confined to within a few degrees of the equator, as observed in 1976. The near-surface equatorial circulation responded directly to variations in the wind field, and satellite-tracked drifter buoys showed the equatorial surface jet extending across the width of the ocean. This eastward flow is generated by the eastward winds that appear in the interval between the northeast and southwest monsoons. The zonal velocity fluctuations extended in a consistent pattern over the observation region. The time and meridional scales of the variability were similar to those observed in 1976, suggesting that the velocity field is dominated by long-term, equatorially trapped motions with long zonal scales."
https://openalex.org/W2070177526,"Direct velocity measurements were made at intermediate depths along the East African coast from March to July 1979. Strong time-dependent flows with multiple reversals in direction were found in the upper 1000 meters between 3 degrees N and 4 degrees S. At 700 meters, there may be a connection between the southwestward coastal current and an equatorial jet observed at 49 degrees E, the latter turning south near the coast. North of 3 degrees N little spatial organization of the flow can be recognized."
https://openalex.org/W1970816764,"Very long baseline interferometry measurements of baselines crossing the San Andreas fault zone in southern California have provided observational constraints on rates of elastic tectonic strain accumulation. The single site located near this fault (the Jet Propulsion Laboratory site) moves in a direction concordant with the Pacific plate motion vector but at approximately half the net rate relative to North America. This motion agrees approximately in amount with geologically determined displacement rates on the San Andreas fault alone but not with the local strike of the fault. When considered together with complementary geodetic data, these results suggest a complex relation between the short-term accumulation of elastic strain and its permanent accommodation on existing faults."
https://openalex.org/W2016320504,"Measurements from March to July 1979 by current meters moored between the shelf and the deep sea from 5° to 8°N show that there was shallow (< 150-meter) coastward and northward circulation between 6° and 8°N long before the onset of the southwest monsoon. After the onset, a powerful coastward flow developed offshore around 6°N, branching into northward and southward flows at the continental rise while the current deepened to more than 250 meters. There seemed to be a separate circulation on the shelf with some counterflow to offshore. All current records show that there were strong fluctuations with periods of 3 to 6 days."

https://openalex.org/W1979160039,"The customary treatment of national economies as closed and self-contained must be substantially modified to allow for those economies that typically trade goods, services, and securities with other countries in increasing volume. Open economy macroeconomics is essential to understanding the major events of the U.S. economy over the past half dozen years. Both the sharp rise in the dollar and the unprecedentedly large U.S. trade deficit are linked to the U.S. budget deficit, as is the drop in the rate of inflation."

https://openalex.org/W1987550023,"Color images of faint objects were used to test two hypotheses for the quasi-stellar object (QSO) pair 1146+ 111B,C: gravitational lens or massive string. Blue, red, and near-infrared CCD (charge-coupled device) images of the field of this QSO pair were examined for gravitational lens multiple-image candidates for all four QSO's in the field (B, C, D, and E). No third image of 1146+111B,C was found, down to 4 magnitudes fainter than BC. This result implies a compact lens mass distribution, if B and C are images of the same QSO. C appears to be redder than B in the wavelength region from 700 to 1100 nanometers. This raises the question of whether B and C are images of the same QSO. Three blue stellar objects of unusual color were found at plausible locations for multiple images of the other two QSO's in the field. A very red object was found at a plausible lens position. Under the hypothesis that B and C are lensed images, these color data severely restrict the possible lens models and imaged QSO multiplicities. One possibility is a compact lens mass of 4 x 10(15) solar masses at a redshift of 0.8. Another is an S-shaped massive string. If the spectrum of any of the three anomalous blue objects were available, it would be possible to distinguish between these two models. However, it is difficult to fit the color and intensity data reported here to either simple string or black hole models. Overall, the simplest model consistent with all the data is the no-lens, no-string hypothesis: B and C probably are separate QSO's, but with some spectral similarities."
