https://openalex.org/W1881064736,"Mitochondrial electron transport drives ATP synthesis but also generates reactive oxygen species, which are both cellular signals and damaging oxidants. Superoxide production by respiratory complex III is implicated in diverse signaling events and pathologies, but its role remains controversial. Using high-throughput screening, we identified compounds that selectively eliminate superoxide production by complex III without altering oxidative phosphorylation; they modulate retrograde signaling including cellular responses to hypoxic and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2107676192,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most prevalent multidrug-resistant pathogens worldwide, exhibiting increasing resistance to the latest antibiotic therapies. Here we show that the triple β-lactam combination meropenem-piperacillin-tazobactam (ME/PI/TZ) acts synergistically and is bactericidal against MRSA subspecies N315 and 72 other clinical MRSA isolates in vitro and clears MRSA N315 infection in a mouse model. ME/PI/TZ suppresses evolution of resistance in MRSA via reciprocal collateral sensitivity of its constituents. We demonstrate that these activities also extend to other carbapenem-penicillin-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. ME/PI/TZ circumvents the tight regulation of the mec and bla operons in MRSA, the basis for inducible resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. Furthermore, ME/PI/TZ subverts the function of penicillin-binding protein-2a (PBP2a) via allostery, which we propose as the mechanism for both synergy and collateral sensitivity. Showing in vivo activity similar to that of linezolid, ME/PI/TZ demonstrates that combinations of older β-lactam antibiotics could be effective against MRSA infections in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2209736027,"Chondrosarcomas are malignant bone tumors that produce cartilaginous matrix. Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes (IDH1/2) were recently described in several cancers including chondrosarcomas. The IDH1 inhibitor AGI-5198 abrogates the ability of mutant IDH1 to produce the oncometabolite D-2 hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) in gliomas. We sought to determine if treatment with AGI-5198 would similarly inhibit tumorigenic activity and D-2HG production in IDH1-mutant human chondrosarcoma cells. Two human chondrosarcoma cell lines, JJ012 and HT1080 with endogenous IDH1 mutations and a human chondrocyte cell line C28 with wild type IDH1 were employed in our study. Mutation analysis of IDH was performed by PCR-based DNA sequencing, and D-2HG was detected using tandem mass spectrometry. We confirmed that JJ012 and HT1080 harbor IDH1 R132G and R132C mutation, respectively, while C28 has no mutation. D-2HG was detectable in cell pellets and media of JJ012 and HT1080 cells, as well as plasma and urine from an IDH-mutant chondrosarcoma patient, which decreased after tumor resection. AGI-5198 treatment decreased D-2HG levels in JJ012 and HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and dramatically inhibited colony formation and migration, interrupted cell cycling, and induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates anti-tumor activity of a mutant IDH1 inhibitor in human chondrosarcoma cell lines, and suggests that D-2HG is a potential biomarker for IDH mutations in chondrosarcoma cells. Thus, clinical trials of mutant IDH inhibitors are warranted for patients with IDH-mutant chondrosarcomas."
https://openalex.org/W2247891525,"Adaptive thermogenesis is the cellular process transforming chemical energy into heat in response to cold. A decrease in adaptive thermogenesis is a contributing factor to obesity. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the compromised adaptive thermogenesis in obese subjects have not yet been elucidated. In this study we hypothesized that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation and subsequent inflammatory responses are key regulators to suppress adaptive thermogenesis. To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6 mice were either fed a palmitate-enriched high fat diet or administered with chronic low-dose LPS before cold acclimation. TLR4 stimulation by a high fat diet or LPS were both associated with reduced core body temperature and heat release. Impairment of thermogenic activation was correlated with diminished expression of brown-specific markers and mitochondrial dysfunction in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). Defective sWAT browning was concomitant with elevated levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy. Consistently, TLR4 activation by LPS abolished cAMP-induced up-regulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in primary human adipocytes, which was reversed by silencing of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Moreover, the inactivation of ER stress by genetic deletion of CHOP or chemical chaperone conferred a resistance to the LPS-induced suppression of adaptive thermogenesis. Collectively, our data indicate the existence of a novel signaling network that links TLR4 activation, ER stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby antagonizing thermogenic activation of sWAT. Our results also suggest that TLR4/ER stress axis activation may be a responsible mechanism for obesity-mediated defective brown adipose tissue activation."
https://openalex.org/W2249632748,"Methylglyoxal (MG) is a reactive metabolic intermediate generated during various cellular biochemical reactions, including glycolysis. The accumulation of MG indiscriminately modifies proteins, including important cellular antioxidant machinery, leading to severe oxidative stress, which is implicated in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, aging, and cardiac disorders. Although cells possess efficient glyoxalase systems for detoxification, their functions are largely dependent on the glutathione cofactor, the availability of which is self-limiting under oxidative stress. Thus, higher organisms require alternate modes of reducing the MG-mediated toxicity and maintaining redox balance. In this report, we demonstrate that Hsp31 protein, a member of the ThiJ/DJ-1/PfpI family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plays an indispensable role in regulating redox homeostasis. Our results show that Hsp31 possesses robust glutathione-independent methylglyoxalase activity and suppresses MG-mediated toxicity and ROS levels as compared with another paralog, Hsp34. On the other hand, glyoxalase-defective mutants of Hsp31 were found highly compromised in regulating the ROS levels. Additionally, Hsp31 maintains cellular glutathione and NADPH levels, thus conferring protection against oxidative stress, and Hsp31 relocalizes to mitochondria to provide cytoprotection to the organelle under oxidative stress conditions. Importantly, human DJ-1, which is implicated in the familial form of Parkinson disease, complements the function of Hsp31 by suppressing methylglyoxal and oxidative stress, thus signifying the importance of these proteins in the maintenance of ROS homeostasis across phylogeny.

https://openalex.org/W2247011864,"Satellite cells are the major myogenic stem cells residing inside skeletal muscle and are indispensable for muscle regeneration. Satellite cells remain largely quiescent but are rapidly activated in response to muscle injury, and the derived myogenic cells then fuse to repair damaged muscle fibers or form new muscle fibers. However, mechanisms eliciting metabolic activation, an inseparable step for satellite cell activation following muscle injury, have not been defined. We found that a noncanonical Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway is rapidly activated in response to muscle injury, which activates AMPK and induces a Warburg-like glycolysis in satellite cells. AMPKα1 is the dominant AMPKα isoform expressed in satellite cells, and AMPKα1 deficiency in satellite cells impairs their activation and myogenic differentiation during muscle regeneration. Drugs activating noncanonical Shh promote proliferation of satellite cells, which is abolished because of satellite cell-specific AMPKα1 knock-out. Taken together, AMPKα1 is a critical mediator linking noncanonical Shh pathway to Warburg-like glycolysis in satellite cells, which is required for satellite activation and muscle regeneration.

Skeletal muscle is the main component in animal locomotion system. It is also the major tissue sustaining respiration and the primary peripheral tissue utilizing glucose and fatty acids, important in preventing obesity and type 2 diabetes (1Schenk S. Horowitz J.F.

Skeletal muscle fibers are frequently damaged during exercise and because of physical trauma or diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (4Irintchev A. Wernig A.

Efficient regeneration following muscle injury is critical for maintaining the normal physiological function of skeletal muscle. On the other hand, insufficient muscle regeneration replaces muscle fibers with fibrotic tissue and weakens the contractile function of muscle, which is a key etiological factor leading to progressive muscle weakness associated with aging and muscle dystrophic diseases (6Uezumi A.

Despite the presence of multiple types of myogenic cells in skeletal muscle, satellite cells are the major postnatal myogenic cells indispensable for muscle regeneration (9Sambasivan R. Yao R.

Satellite cells maintain in a quiescent stage and become activated when muscle regeneration process is triggered (10Montarras D. L'Honoré A. Buckingham M.

Recent studies show that stem cells including satellite cells rely on glycolysis to provide energy (13Kondoh H. Lleonart M.E. Nakashima Y. Yokode M. Tanaka M. Bernard D. Gil J. Beach D.

However, metabolism of stem cells rapidly elevates during wakening from their quiescent state, providing energy needed for stem cell proliferation and further differentiation (10Montarras D.

Warburg glycolysis is a primarily source of energy for certain cancer cells, which allows their fast proliferation (19Warburg O. Posener K. Negelein E.

Cancer cells and stem cells share metabolic similarity, and recently, Warburg-like glycolysis was identified in induced stem cells (21Vazquez-Martin A. Corominas-Faja B. Cufi S. Vellon L.

Band density was normalized to β-tubulin content. Cells grown on multiple well plates were fixed in cold methanol for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 1% BSA, and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Cells were then stained with corresponding secondary antibodies (1:1,000) for 1 h. Images were taken using a EVOS microscope. TA muscle was fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde and frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissue was sectioned (5–10 μm thick). Sections were heated in citrate buffer for 20 min, blocked in 5% goat serum in TBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, and stained with primary antibodies and corresponding fluorescent secondary antibodies. Sections were then mounted in a mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Pax7+ cells with nuclei identified by DAPI staining were classified as satellite cells. For each TA muscle sample, the number of satellite cells and EMH+ muscle fibers on four randomly picked microscopic fields of each of three sections at different depths of the muscle were counted (four fields/section, three sections/muscle). Average numbers obtained from the three examined sections of each muscle sample were used as a biological replicate for comparative analysis. TA muscle frozen sections were rinsed in PBS, stained with Gill's hemotoxylin, and counterstained with eosin Y following the manufacturer's protocol. Ten thousand cells were seeded in each well of 96-well plates. 24 h after seeding, cell culture medium was collected and tested for lactate content using an l-lactate assay kit from Eton Bioscience, Inc. (San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction. 200,000 cells were seeded in each well of 6-well plates. One day after seeding, cell culture medium was changed with fresh medium. Oxygen content in medium was measured after 30 min of incubation with Orion 3-Star Pus Dissolved Oxygen Meter (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Oxygen consumption was calculated from the difference between the oxygen content in medium after 30 min of incubation and the oxygen content in fresh medium. For all studies, at least three independent experiments were conducted. All data are expressed as means ± S.D. The data were analyzed using the general linear model of SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC), and t test or Tukey range test was used to determine significance of differences among means. p < 0.05 was considered significant. To test the role of AMPKα1 in muscle regeneration, we first measured the expression of AMPKα1 during the proliferation and differentiation of isolated satellite cells. AMPKα1 expression profoundly increased (∼6-fold) during the activation and proliferation of satellite cells. After induction of myogenesis, the expression of AMPKα1 dropped first, followed by a slight increase (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with a previous report showing AMPKα1 activity in muscle increases during muscle regeneration, whereas the activity of AMPKα2 remain unchanged (24Fu X. Zhao J.X. Zhu M.J. Foretz M. Viollet B. Dodson M.V. Du M. AMP-activated protein kinase alpha1 but not alpha2 catalytic subunit potentiates myogenin expression and myogenesis.Mol.

Moreover, AMPKα1 expression was consistently and significantly higher than AMPKα2 in quiescent, activated, and differentiating satellite cells (Fig. 1B). These data support our hypothesis that AMPKα1 is important in activating satellite cell proliferation. To test whether AMPKα1 is critical for muscle regeneration following injury, we analyzed the expression of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 in TA muscle injured by cardiotoxin (CTX) injection using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining after injury. AMPKα2 was found to be expressed primarily in the cytoplasm of well differentiated myogenic cells and regenerating muscle fibers (Fig. 1C). In contrast, AMPKα1 was found mainly in mononucleated cells including satellite cells (Fig. 1D). Moreover, we found that AMPKα1 was also expressed in satellite cells in uninjured muscle (Fig. 1D). However, p-AMPKα was only detected in satellite cells after injury, indicating AMPKα1 activation in satellite cells during muscle regeneration, which might be involved in satellite cell activation and proliferation (Fig. 1E). These data further suggest that AMPKα1 has a regulatory role in satellite cell activation, whereas AMPKα2 plays a major role in regulating metabolism in differentiated muscle fibers. Therefore, we focused further studies on the role of AMPKα1 in satellite activation and proliferation. To better understand the influence of AMPKα1 KO on satellite cell activation and proliferation, we then tested the proliferation of satellite cells isolated from tamoxifen-treated Pax7cre/AMPKfl/fl mice in which AMPKα1 gene is specifically deleted in satellite cells. Satellite cell-specific AMPKα1 KO was verified by different assays (Fig. 2, A–E). Indeed, AMPKα1 KO satellite cells proliferated slower than WT myoblasts (Fig. 3A). Because isolated satellite cells lack the niche environment, we further prepared single muscle fibers from tamoxifen-treated Pax7cre/tdomato,EGFP mice and Pax7cre/AMPKα1fl/fl/tdomato,EGFP mice, in which satellite cells express membrane-located EGFP upon tamoxifen treatment accompanied with AMPKα1 KO specifically in satellite cells. 48 h after muscle fiber isolation, satellite cells on muscle fibers were compared. Although 38 of 45 observed WT satellite cells had activated and started to proliferate, only 9 of 41 observed AMPKα1 KO satellite cells showed sign of proliferation, which suggested less efficient satellite cell activation and proliferation because of AMPKα1 KO (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3AMPKα1 KO satellite cells proliferated slower than WT cells in vitro.

Therefore, we questioned whether this pathway is also present in undifferentiated myoblasts and satellite cells and whether AMPKα1 has a mediatory role in eliciting Warburg-like glycolysis. We first tested the effect of Smoothened (Smo) agonist (SAG), an activator of Shh pathway, on AMPK activity in C2C12 myoblasts and WT satellite cells. C2C12 myoblasts and WT satellite cells were treated with 200 nm SAG for only 10 min to avoid the activation of canonical Shh signaling (22Teperino R. Amann S. Bayer M. McGee S.L. Loipetzberger A.

In both C2C12 cells and WT satellite cells, 10 min of SAG treatment activated AMPK (Fig. 4, A and B). l-Lactate assay revealed increased glycolysis rates in C2C12 cells and WT satellite cells in response to SAG treatment, which was absent in AMPKα1 KO satellite cells (Fig. 4C). In addition, SAG promoted the proliferation of both C2C12 cells and purified WT satellite cells but failed to promote proliferation of purified AMPKα1 KO satellite cells (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the proliferative effects of SAG treatment on satellite cells require AMPKα1. Skeletal muscle contains multiple cell types that interact with satellite cells and participate in muscle regeneration (30Joe A.W. Yi L. Natarajan A. Le Grand F. So L. Wang J.

To better understand the potential effect of SAG treatment on satellite cell activation and proliferation in the presence of other cell types, muscle tissue slurry from tamoxifen-treated Pax7cre/tdomato,EGFP mice expressing EGFP in Pax7+ cells was obtained by enzymatic digestion of muscle tissue and plated without sorting. 48 h later, all cells were harvested, and EGFP-positive satellite cells were quantified. We found that SAG treatment increased the number of EGFP+ satellite cells, further supporting the promotive effect of Shh signaling on satellite activation and proliferation (Fig. 4E). To further test whether the observed effects of SAG on satellite cells was through noncanonical Shh signaling, WT primary myoblasts were treated with cyclopamine, a noncanonical Shh specific activator, which is also known to inhibit canonical Shh (22Teperino R.

https://openalex.org/W2213522766,"The major fungal pathogen of humans, Candida albicans, mounts robust responses to oxidative stress that are critical for its virulence. These responses counteract the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated by host immune cells in an attempt to kill the invading fungus. Knowledge of the dynamical processes that instigate C. albicans oxidative stress responses is required for a proper understanding of fungus-host interactions. Therefore, we have adopted an interdisciplinary approach to explore the dynamical responses of C. albicans to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Our deterministic mathematical model integrates two major oxidative stress signalling pathways (Cap1 and Hog1 pathways) with the three major antioxidant systems (catalase, glutathione and thioredoxin systems) and the pentose phosphate pathway, which provides reducing equivalents required for oxidative stress adaptation. The model encapsulates existing knowledge of these systems with new genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, molecular and cellular datasets. Our integrative approach predicts the existence of alternative states for the key regulators Cap1 and Hog1, thereby suggesting novel regulatory behaviours during oxidative stress. The model reproduces both existing and new experimental observations under a variety of scenarios. Time- and dose-dependent predictions of the oxidative stress responses for both wild type and mutant cells have highlighted the different temporal contributions of the various antioxidant systems during oxidative stress adaptation, indicating that catalase plays a critical role immediately following stress imposition. This is the first model to encapsulate the dynamics of the transcriptional response alongside the redox kinetics of the major antioxidant systems during H2O2 stress in C. albicans."

Although routine magnetic resonance imaging is apparently normal, many studies have reported structural alterations in IGE/GGE patients using diffusion tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry. Changes have also been reported in functional networks during generalized spike wave discharges. However, network function in the resting-state without epileptiforme discharges has been less well studied. We hypothesize that resting-state networks are more representative of the underlying pathophysiology and abnormal network synchrony. We studied functional network connectivity derived from whole-brain magnetoencephalography recordings in thirteen IGE/GGE and nineteen healthy controls. Using graph theoretical network analysis, we found a widespread increase in connectivity in patients compared to controls. These changes were most pronounced in the motor network, the mesio-frontal and temporal cortex. We did not, however, find any significant difference between the normalized clustering coefficients, indicating preserved gross network architecture. Our findings suggest that increased resting state connectivity could be an important factor for seizure spread and/or generation in IGE/GGE, and could serve as a biomarker for the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1461755553,"Bipotent axial stem cells residing in the caudal epiblast during late gastrulation generate neuroectodermal and presomitic mesodermal progeny that coordinate somitogenesis with neural tube formation, but the mechanism that controls these two fates is not fully understood. Retinoic acid (RA) restricts the anterior extent of caudal fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) expression in both mesoderm and neural plate to control somitogenesis and neurogenesis, however it remains unclear where RA acts to control the spatial expression of caudal Fgf8. Here, we found that mouse Raldh2-/- embryos, lacking RA synthesis and displaying a consistent small somite defect, exhibited abnormal expression of key markers of axial stem cell progeny, with decreased Sox2+ and Sox1+ neuroectodermal progeny and increased Tbx6+ presomitic mesodermal progeny. The Raldh2-/- small somite defect was rescued by treatment with an FGF receptor antagonist. Rdh10 mutants, with a less severe RA synthesis defect, were found to exhibit a small somite defect and anterior expansion of caudal Fgf8 expression only for somites 1–6, with normal somite size and Fgf8 expression thereafter. Rdh10 mutants were found to lack RA activity during the early phase when somites are small, but at the 6-somite stage RA activity was detected in neural plate although not in presomitic mesoderm. Expression of a dominant-negative RA receptor in mesoderm eliminated RA activity in presomitic mesoderm but did not affect somitogenesis. Thus, RA activity in the neural plate is sufficient to prevent anterior expansion of caudal Fgf8 expression associated with a small somite defect. Our studies provide evidence that RA restriction of Fgf8 expression in undifferentiated neural progenitors stimulates neurogenesis while also restricting the anterior extent of the mesodermal Fgf8 mRNA gradient that controls somite size, providing new insight into the mechanism that coordinates somitogenesis with neurogenesis."

Trait reports (habitual emotions, exhaustion) were assessed via trait questionnaires, and state reports (momentary emotions) were assessed in real time via the experience sampling method by using personal digital assistants (N = 69 high school teachers; 1,089 measures within teachers). In line with our assumptions, multi-level analyses showed that, as compared to the state assessment, teachers reported higher levels of habitual teaching-related emotions of anger, anxiety, shame, boredom, enjoyment, and pride. Additionally, the state-trait discrepancy in self-reports of negative emotions was accounted for by teachers’ emotional exhaustion, with high exhaustion levels corresponding with a greater state-trait discrepancy. Exhaustion levels did not moderate the state-trait discrepancy in positive emotions indicating that perceived emotional exhaustion may reflect identity-related cognitions specific to the negative belief system. Implications for research and educational practice are discussed."

In contrast to UV radiation, focused or converging visible light readily reaches the retina and can damage DNA which possibly contributes to UM development. In this report choroidal, ciliochoroidal and iridociliary melanomas were analyzed for GNAQ and GNA11 mutations which were subsequently correlated to the location of tumor origin. Hotspot mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 can be divided in A>T and in A>C mutation signatures. The GNAQ A626C mutation (Q209P) was almost exclusively observed in choroidal melanomas from the illuminated posterior side. On the other hand, ciliochoroidal UM from the dark anterior side with mostly A>T mutations were clearly associated with light-colored eyes. Combined these data suggest a light and a pigment dependent etiology in UM development."
https://openalex.org/W2270705875,"Siglec-1 (sialoadhesin, CD169) is a surface receptor on human cells that mediates trans-enhancement of HIV-1 infection through recognition of sialic acid moieties in virus membrane gangliosides. Here, we demonstrate that mouse Siglec-1, expressed on the surface of primary macrophages in an interferon-α-responsive manner, captures murine leukemia virus (MLV) particles and mediates their transfer to proliferating lymphocytes. The MLV infection of primary B-cells was markedly more efficient than that of primary T-cells. The major structural protein of MLV particles, Gag, frequently co-localized with Siglec-1, and trans-infection, primarily of surface-bound MLV particles, efficiently occurred. To explore the role of sialic acid for MLV trans-infection at a submolecular level, we analyzed the potential of six sialic acid precursor analogs to modulate the sialylated ganglioside-dependent interaction of MLV particles with Siglec-1. Biosynthetically engineered sialic acids were detected in both the glycolipid and glycoprotein fractions of MLV producer cells. MLV released from cells carrying N-acyl-modified sialic acids displayed strikingly different capacities for Siglec-1-mediated capture and trans-infection; N-butanoyl, N-isobutanoyl, N-glycolyl, or N-pentanoyl side chain modifications resulted in up to 92 and 80% reduction of virus particle capture and trans-infection, respectively, whereas N-propanoyl or N-cyclopropylcarbamyl side chains had no effect. In agreement with these functional analyses, molecular modeling indicated reduced binding affinities for non-functional N-acyl modifications. Thus, Siglec-1 is a key receptor for macrophage/lymphocyte trans-infection of surface-bound virions, and the N-acyl side chain of sialic acid is a critical determinant for the Siglec-1/MLV interaction."

There are three pneumococcal sialidases: NanA, NanB, and NanC. NanC is an unusual sialidase in that its primary reaction product is 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en, also known as DANA), a nonspecific hydrolytic sialidase inhibitor. The production of Neu5Ac2en from α2–3-linked sialosides by the catalytic domain is confirmed within a crystal structure. A covalent complex with 3-fluoro-β-N-acetylneuraminic acid is also presented, suggesting a common mechanism with other sialidases up to the final step of product formation. A conformation change in an active site hydrophobic loop on ligand binding constricts the entrance to the active site. In addition, the distance between the catalytic acid/base (Asp-315) and the ligand anomeric carbon is unusually short. These features facilitate a novel sialidase reaction in which the final step of product formation is direct abstraction of the C3 proton by the active site aspartic acid, forming Neu5Ac2en. NanC also possesses a carbohydrate-binding module, which is shown to bind α2–3- and α2–6-linked sialosides, as well as N-acetylneuraminic acid, which is captured in the crystal structure following hydration of Neu5Ac2en by NanC. Overall, the pneumococcal sialidases show remarkable mechanistic diversity while maintaining a common structural scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W2202596791,"Background The aim of this exploratory study is to gain for the first time a more comprehensive picture of the impact of changes of quinolinic acid concentrations on depressive symptomatology during and after IFN-α therapy. Methods The quinolinic acid concentrations of 35 HCV patients are examined in a prospective survey over the entire period of IFN-α treatment as well as three months later at six different times (baseline, one, three, six and nine months after the beginning of IFN-α treatment, and after the end of treatment). Results During IFN-α treatment Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores rise significantly. At the same time there is greater activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, with a resulting increase in plasma kynurenine concentrations. Compared to baseline values quinolinic acid concentrations increase significantly during therapy, reflecting an increased neurotoxic challenge. In addition, patients with higher scores in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at six and nine months after starting therapy show significantly higher levels of quinolinic acid concentration. Conclusions The increase of quinolinic acid during IFN-α therapy might contribute to depressive symptomatology through the neurotoxic challenge caused by quinolinic acid. Subsequently, our exploratory study results support the inflammatory hypothesis of depression. The awareness of relevant risk factors of IFN-α treatment-induced depression is essential to develop preventative treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2212478354,"To date, most new vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including new recombinant versions of the current BCG vaccine, have usually been screened against the laboratory strains H37Rv or Erdman. In this study we took advantage of our recent work in characterizing an increasingly large panel of newly emerging clinical isolates [from the United States or from the Western Cape region of South Africa], to determine to what extent vaccines would protect against these [mostly high virulence] strains. We show here that both BCG Pasteur and recombinant BCG Aeras-422 [used here as a good example of the new generation BCG vaccines] protected well in both mouse and guinea pig low dose aerosol infection models against the majority of clinical isolates tested. However, Aeras-422 was not effective in a long term survival assay compared to BCG Pasteur. Protection was very strongly expressed against all of the Western Cape strains tested, reinforcing our viewpoint that any attempt at boosting BCG would be very difficult to achieve statistically. This observation is discussed in the context of the growing argument made by others that the failure of a recent vaccine trial disqualifies the further use of animal models to predict vaccine efficacy. This viewpoint is in our opinion completely erroneous, and that it is the fitness of prevalent strains in the trial site area that is the centrally important factor, an issue that is not being addressed by the field."

To demonstrate the effect in vivo, three female patients with benign breast masses associated with mammographically-identified calcifications were evaluated by CUSE.Apparent maximum elasticity (Emax) estimates resulting from individual macrocalcifications (with diameters of 2mm, 3mm, 5mm, 6mm, 9mm, 11mm, and 15mm) showed values over 50 kPa for all cases, which represents more than 100% increase over background (~21kPa). We considered a 2cm-diameter circular region of interest for all phantom experiments. Mean elasticity (Emean) values varied from 26 kPa to 73 kPa, depending on the macrocalcification size. Highly dense clusters of microcalcifications showed higher Emax values than clusters of microcalcification with low concentrations, but the difference in Emean values was not significant.Our results demonstrate that the presence of large isolated macrocalcifications and highly concentrated clusters of microcalcifications can introduce areas with apparent high elasticity in SWE. Considering that benign breast masses normally have significantly lower elasticity values than malignant tumors, such areas with high elasticity appearing due to presence of calcification in benign breast masses may lead to misdiagnosis."

Despite the multimodality treatment such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy (temozolomide: TMZ), the median survival rate of glioblastoma patient is less than 15 months. In this study, we investigated the association between measures of spatial diversity derived from spatial point pattern analysis of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data with molecular status as well as 12-month survival in glioblastoma. We obtained 27 measures of spatial proximity (diversity) via spatial point pattern analysis of multiparametric T1 post-contrast and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI data. These measures were used to predict 12-month survival status (≤12 or >12 months) in 74 glioblastoma patients. Kaplan-Meier with receiver operating characteristic analyses was used to assess the relationship between derived spatial features and 12-month survival status as well as molecular subtype status in patients with glioblastoma. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that 14 spatial features were capable of stratifying overall survival in a statistically significant manner. For prediction of 12-month survival status based on these diversity indices, sensitivity and specificity were 0.86 and 0.64, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the accuracy were 0.76 and 0.75, respectively. For prediction of molecular subtype status, proneural subtype shows highest accuracy of 0.93 among all molecular subtypes based on receiver operating characteristic analysis. We find that measures of spatial diversity from point pattern analysis of intensity habitats from T1 post-contrast and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images are associated with both tumor subtype status and 12-month survival status and may therefore be useful indicators of patient prognosis, in addition to providing potential guidance for molecularly-targeted therapies in Glioblastoma multiforme."
https://openalex.org/W2205887234,"Tracking the response of forest ecosystems to climate change demands large (≥1 ha) monitoring plots that are repeatedly measured over long time frames and arranged across macro-ecological gradients. Continental scale networks of permanent forest plots have identified links between climate and carbon fluxes by monitoring trends in tree growth, mortality and recruitment. The relationship between tree growth and climate in Australia has been recently articulated through analysis of data from smaller forest plots, but conclusions were limited by (a) absence of data on recruitment and mortality, (b) exclusion of non-eucalypt species, and (c) lack of knowledge of stand age or disturbance histories. To remedy these gaps we established the Ausplots Forest Monitoring Network: a continental scale network of 48 1 ha permanent plots in highly productive tall eucalypt forests in the mature growth stage. These plots are distributed across cool temperate, Mediterranean, subtropical and tropical climates (mean annual precipitation 850 to 1900 mm per year; mean annual temperature 6 to 21°C). Aboveground carbon stocks (AGC) in these forests are dominated by eucalypts (90% of AGC) whilst non-eucalypts in the understorey dominated species diversity and tree abundance (84% of species; 60% of stems). Aboveground carbon stocks were negatively related to mean annual temperature, with forests at the warm end of the temperature range storing approximately half the amount of carbon as forests at the cool end of the temperature range. This may reflect thermal constraints on tree growth detected through other plot networks and physiological studies. Through common protocols and careful sampling design, the Ausplots Forest Monitoring Network will facilitate the integration of tall eucalypt forests into established global forest monitoring initiatives. In the context of projections of rapidly warming and drying climates in Australia, this plot network will enable detection of links between climate and growth, mortality and carbon dynamics of eucalypt forests."
https://openalex.org/W2213294212,"Peroxisomes are essential organelles that house a wide array of metabolic reactions important for plant growth and development. However, our knowledge regarding the role of peroxisomal proteins in various biological processes, including plant stress response, is still incomplete. Recent proteomic studies of plant peroxisomes significantly increased the number of known peroxisomal proteins and greatly facilitated the study of peroxisomes at the systems level. The objectives of this study were to determine whether genes that encode peroxisomal proteins with related functions are co-expressed in Arabidopsis and identify peroxisomal proteins involved in stress response using in silico analysis and mutant screens. Using microarray data from online databases, we performed hierarchical clustering analysis to generate a comprehensive view of transcript level changes for Arabidopsis peroxisomal genes during development and under abiotic and biotic stress conditions. Many genes involved in the same metabolic pathways exhibited co-expression, some genes known to be involved in stress response are regulated by the corresponding stress conditions, and function of some peroxisomal proteins could be predicted based on their co-expression pattern. Since drought caused expression changes to the highest number of genes that encode peroxisomal proteins, we subjected a subset of Arabidopsis peroxisomal mutants to a drought stress assay. Mutants of the LON2 protease and the photorespiratory enzyme hydroxypyruvate reductase 1 (HPR1) showed enhanced susceptibility to drought, suggesting the involvement of peroxisomal quality control and photorespiration in drought resistance. Our study provided a global view of how genes that encode peroxisomal proteins respond to developmental and environmental cues and began to reveal additional peroxisomal proteins involved in stress response, thus opening up new avenues to investigate the role of peroxisomes in plant adaptation to environmental stresses."

Model validation is commonly done by verifying that the model is able to reproduce the patterns to be explained. We argue that robust validation must not only be based on corroboration, but also on attempting to falsify the model, i.e. making sure that the model behaves soundly for any reasonable input and parameter values. We propose an open-ended evolutionary method based on Novelty Search to look for the diverse patterns a model can produce. The Pattern Space Exploration method was tested on a model of collective motion and compared to three common a priori sampling experiment designs. The method successfully discovered all known qualitatively different kinds of collective motion, and performed much better than the a priori sampling methods. The method was then applied to a case study of city system dynamics to explore the model's predicted values of city hierarchisation and population growth. This case study showed that the method can provide insights on potential predictive scenarios as well as falsifiers of the model when the simulated dynamics are highly unrealistic."

Enrollment and vaccinations stopped and participants were unblinded but continued follow-up when the Step study evaluating the same vaccine in the Americas, Caribbean, and Australia was unblinded for non-efficacy. Final Phambili analyses found more HIV-1 infections amongst vaccine than placebo recipients, impelling the HVTN 503-S recall study. Methods HVTN 503-S sought to enroll all 695 HIV-1 uninfected Phambili participants, provide HIV testing, risk reduction counseling, physical examination, risk behavior assessment and treatment assignment recall. After adding HVTN 503-S data, HIV-1 infection hazard ratios (HR vaccine vs. placebo) were estimated by Cox models. Results Of the 695 eligible, 465 (67%) enrolled with 230 from the vaccine group and 235 from the placebo group. 38% of the 184 Phambili dropouts were enrolled. Enrollment did not differ by treatment group, gender, or baseline HSV-2. With the additional 1286 person years of 503-S follow-up, the estimated HR over Phambili and HVTN 503-S follow-up was 1.52 (95% CI 1.08–2.15, p = 0.02, 82 vaccine/54 placebo infections). The HR was significant for men (HR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.49, 5.06, p = 0.001) but not for women (HR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.73, 1.72, p = 0.62). Conclusion The additional follow-up from HVTN 503-S supported the Phambili finding of increased HIV-1 acquisition among vaccinated men and strengthened the evidence of lack of vaccine effect among women.

https://openalex.org/W2218252866,"Organismal metabolic rate, a fundamental metric in biology, demonstrates an allometric scaling relationship with body size. Fractal-like vascular distribution networks of biological systems are proposed to underlie metabolic rate allometric scaling laws from individual organisms to cells, mitochondria, and enzymes. Tissue-specific metabolic scaling is notably absent from this paradigm. In the current study, metabolic scaling relationships of hearts and brains with body size were examined by improving on a high-throughput whole-organ oxygen consumption rate (OCR) analysis method in five biomedically and environmentally relevant teleost model species. Tissue-specific metabolic scaling was compared with organismal routine metabolism (RMO2), which was measured using whole organismal respirometry. Basal heart OCR and organismal RMO2 scaled identically with body mass in a species-specific fashion across all five species tested. However, organismal maximum metabolic rates (MMO2) and pharmacologically-induced maximum cardiac metabolic rates in zebrafish Danio rerio did not show a similar relationship with body mass. Brain metabolic rates did not scale with body size. The identical allometric scaling of heart and organismal metabolic rates with body size suggests that hearts, the power generator of an organism’s vascular distribution network, might be crucial in determining teleost metabolic rate scaling under routine conditions. Furthermore, these findings indicate the possibility of measuring heart OCR utilizing the high-throughput approach presented here as a proxy for organismal metabolic rate—a useful metric in characterizing organismal fitness. In addition to heart and brain OCR, the current approach was also used to measure whole liver OCR, partition cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetic parameters using pharmacological agents, and estimate heart and brain glycolytic rates. This high-throughput whole-organ bioenergetic analysis method has important applications in toxicology, evolutionary physiology, and biomedical sciences, particularly in the context of investigating pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2206531383,"Cognitive inhibitory control, the ability to rapidly suppress responses inappropriate for the context, is essential for flexible and adaptive behavior. Although most studies on inhibitory control have focused on the fronto-basal-ganglia circuit, we found that rapid behavioral stopping is enabled by neuronal inhibition in the basal forebrain (BF). In rats performing the stop signal task, putative noncholinergic BF neurons with phasic bursting responses to the go signal were nearly completely inhibited by the stop signal. The onset of BF neuronal inhibition was tightly coupled with and temporally preceded the latency to stop, the stop signal reaction time. Artificial inhibition of BF activity in the absence of the stop signal was sufficient to reproduce rapid behavioral stopping. These results reveal a previously unknown subcortical mechanism of rapid inhibitory control by the BF, which provides bidirectional control over the speed of response generation and inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2286532261,"Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a non-progressive, clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease of impaired night vision. We report a naturally-occurring, stationary, autosomal recessive phenotype in beagle dogs with normal daylight vision but absent night vision. Affected dogs had normal retinas on clinical examination, but showed no detectable rod responses. They had “negative-type” mixed rod and cone responses in full-field ERGs. Their photopic long-flash ERGs had normal OFF-responses associated with severely reduced ON-responses. The phenotype is similar to the Schubert-Bornschein form of complete CSNB in humans. Homozygosity mapping ruled out most known CSNB candidates as well as CACNA2D4 and GNB3. Three remaining genes were excluded based on sequencing the open reading frame and intron-exon boundaries (RHO, NYX), causal to a different form of CSNB (RHO) or X-chromosome (NYX, CACNA1F) location. Among the genes expressed in the photoreceptors and their synaptic terminals, and mGluR6 cascade and modulators, reduced expression of GNAT1, CACNA2D4 and NYX was observed by qRT-PCR in both carrier (n = 2) and affected (n = 2) retinas whereas CACNA1F was down-regulated only in the affecteds. Retinal morphology revealed normal cellular layers and structure, and electron microscopy showed normal rod spherules and synaptic ribbons. No difference from normal was observed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for antibodies labeling rods, cones and their presynaptic terminals. None of the retinas showed any sign of stress. Selected proteins of mGluR6 cascade and its modulators were examined by IHC and showed that PKCα weakly labeled the rod bipolar somata in the affected, but intensely labeled axonal terminals that appeared thickened and irregular. Dendritic terminals of ON-bipolar cells showed increased Goα labeling. Both PKCα and Goα labeled the more prominent bipolar dendrites that extended into the OPL in affected but not normal retinas. Interestingly, RGS11 showed no labeling in the affected retina. Our results indicate involvement of a yet unknown gene in this canine model of complete CSNB."
https://openalex.org/W2202769442,"High concentrations of arsenic, which can be occasionally found in drinking water, have been recognized as a global health problem. Exposure to arsenic can disrupt spatial memory; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we tested whether exercise could interfere with the effect of arsenic exposure on the long-term memory (LTM) of object recognition in mice. Arsenic (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/ kg, i.g.) was administered daily for 12 weeks. We found that arsenic at dosages of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg decreased body weight and increased the arsenic content in the brain. The object recognition LTM (tested 24 h after training) was disrupted by 3 mg/ kg and 10 mg/ kg, but not 1 mg/ kg arsenic exposure. Swimming exercise also prevented LTM impairment induced by 3 mg/ kg, but not with 10 mg/ kg, of arsenic exposure. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (pCREB) in the CA1 and dentate gyrus areas (DG) of the dorsal hippocampus were decreased by 3 mg/ kg and 10 mg/ kg, but not by 1 mg/ kg, of arsenic exposure. The decrease in BDNF and pCREB in the CA1 and DG induced by 3 mg/ kg, but not 10 mg/ kg, of arsenic exposure were prevented by swimming exercise. Arsenic exposure did not affect the total CREB expression in the CA1 or DG. Taken together, these results indicated that swimming exercise prevented the impairment of object recognition LTM induced by arsenic exposure, which may be mediated by BDNF and CREB in the dorsal hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2279607963,"It is not known whether biomarkers of hemodynamic stress, myocardial necrosis, and renal function might predict adverse outcome in patients undergoing percutaneous repair of severe mitral valve insufficiency. Thus, we aimed to assess the predictive value of various established and emerging biomarkers for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in these patients.Thirty-four patients with symptomatic severe mitral valve insufficiency with a mean STS-Score for mortality of 12.6% and a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 19.7% undergoing MitraClip therapy were prospectively included in this study. Plasma concentrations of mid regional-proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP), Cystatin C, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), high-sensitive troponin T (hsTnT), N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), galectin-3, and soluble ST-2 (interleukin 1 receptor-like 1) were measured directly before procedure. MACE was defined as cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure (HF).During a median follow-up of 211 days (interquartile range 133 to 333 days), 9 patients (26.5%) experienced MACE (death: 7 patients, rehospitalization for HF: 2 patients). Thirty day MACE-rate was 5.9% (death: 2 patients, no rehospitalization for HF). Baseline concentrations of hsTnT (Median 92.6 vs 25.2 ng/L), NT-proBNP (Median 11251 vs 1974 pg/mL) and MR-proANP (Median 755.6 vs 318.3 pmol/L, all p<0.001) were clearly higher in those experiencing an event vs event-free patients, while other clinical variables including STS-Score and logistic EuroSCORE did not differ significantly. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, NT-proBNP and in particular hsTnT and MR-proANP above the median discriminated between those experiencing an event vs event-free patients. This was further corroborated by C-statistics where areas under the ROC curve for prediction of MACE using the respective median values were 0.960 for MR-proANP, 0.907 for NT-proBNP, and 0.822 for hsTnT.MR-proANP and hsTnT strongly predict cardiovascular death and rehospitalization for HF in patients undergoing percutaneous repair of mitral valve insufficiency. Both markers might be useful components in new scoring systems to better predict short- and potentially long-term mortality and morbidity after MitraClip procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2200426226,"RNA-based genetic regulation is exemplified by metabolite-binding riboswitches that modulate gene expression through conformational changes. Crystal structures show that the Escherichia coli btuB riboswitch contains a kissing loop interaction that is in close proximity to the bound ligand. To analyze the role of the kissing loop interaction in the riboswitch regulatory mechanism, we used RNase H cleavage assays to probe the structure of nascent riboswitch transcripts produced by the E. coli RNA polymerase. By monitoring the folding of the aptamer, kissing loop, and riboswitch expression platform, we established the conformation of each structural component in the absence or presence of bound adenosylcobalamin. We found that the kissing loop interaction is not essential for ligand binding. However, we showed that kissing loop formation improves ligand binding efficiency and is required to couple ligand binding to the riboswitch conformational changes involved in regulating gene expression. These results support a mechanism by which the btuB riboswitch modulates the formation of a tertiary structure to perform metabolite sensing and regulate gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2204277799,"To assess discrepancies in the analyzed outcomes between protocols and published reviews within Cochrane oral health systematic reviews (COHG) on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR).All COHG systematic reviews on the CDSR and the corresponding protocols were retrieved in November 2014 and information on the reported outcomes was recorded. Data was collected at the systematic review level by two reviewers independently.One hundred and fifty two reviews were included. In relation to primary outcomes, 11.2% were downgraded to secondary outcomes, 9.9% were omitted altogether in the final publication and new primary outcomes were identified in 18.4% of publications. For secondary outcomes, 2% were upgraded to primary, 12.5% were omitted and 30.9% were newly introduced in the publication. Overall, 45.4% of reviews had at least one discrepancy when compared to the protocol; these were reported in 14.5% reviews. The number of review updates appears to be associated with discrepancies between final review and protocol (OR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.77, 5.74, p<0.001). The risk of reporting significant results was lower for both downgraded outcomes [RR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.17, 1.58, p = 0.24] and upgraded or newly introduced outcomes [RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.36, 1.64, p = 0.50] compared to outcomes with no discrepancies. The risk of reporting significant results was higher for upgraded or newly introduced outcomes compared to downgraded outcomes (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.65, 2.16, p = 0.57). None of the comparisons reached statistical significance.While no evidence of selective outcome reporting was found in this study, based on the present analysis of SRs published within COHG systematic reviews, discrepancies between outcomes in pre-published protocols and final reviews continue to be common. Solutions such as the use of standardized outcomes to reduce the prevalence of this issue may need to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W2243762995,"Fe(III) storage by ferritin is an essential process of the iron homeostasis machinery. It begins by translocation of Fe(II) from outside the hollow spherical shape structure of the protein, which is formed as the result of self-assembly of 24 subunits, to a di-iron binding site, the ferroxidase center, buried in the middle of each active subunit. The pathway of Fe(II) to the ferroxidase center has remained elusive, and the importance of self-assembly for the functioning of the ferroxidase center has not been investigated. Here we report spectroscopic and metal ion binding studies with a mutant of ferritin from Pyrococcus furiosus (PfFtn) in which self-assembly was abolished by a single amino acid substitution. We show that in this mutant metal ion binding to the ferroxidase center and Fe(II) oxidation at this site was obliterated. However, metal ion binding to a conserved third site (site C), which is located in the inner surface of each subunit in the vicinity of the ferroxidase center and is believed to be the path for Fe(II) to the ferroxidase center, was not disrupted.

Moreover, in archaeal and eukaryotic ferritin, it has been proposed that when a third Fe(II) is oxidized in site C together with two Fe(II) in the ferroxidase center, a highly conserved tyrosine in the vicinity of site B of the ferroxidase center acts as a molecular capacitor and provides the fourth electron for complete reduction of molecular oxygen to water (24Ebrahimi K.H.

Using site-directed mutagenesis, we created a mutant with a single amino acid substitution that lacked self-assembly but folded properly and remained thermostable. Subsequent analyses of Fe(II) oxidation kinetics, metal ion binding thermodynamics, and Fe(III) storage in comparison with the wild-type protein provided new insight into the direct impact of self-assembly on Fe(II) entry and binding to the ferroxidase center.

All chemicals were reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cytochrome c from horse heart was also obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. WT-PfFtn and its mutant were expressed, purified, and made apo as explained previously (23Ebrahimi K.H. Bill E. Hagedoorn P.-L. Hagen W.R. The catalytic center of ferritin regulates iron storage via Fe (II)-Fe (III) displacement.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A mutant of PfFtn in which arginine 117 was replaced by alanine (R117A-PfFtn) was prepared using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For site-directed mutagenesis, the forward primer was: 5′-GAAAAAGATTACTCGACGGCGGCATTCTTAGAGTGG-3′, and the reverse primer was complementary to the forward primer. The insert of interest was sequenced (Baseclear, Leiden, The Netherlands) to confirm the correct mutation. Steady-state kinetics of Fe(II) oxidation were measured by recording the progress curves of Fe(III) formation at 315 nm using a fiber optics spectrophotometer (Avantes) equipped with a homemade thermoblock and cuvette holder. Measurements were performed in 1-ml glass cuvettes with a path length of 1 cm. A molar extinction coefficient of 2.5 mm−1 cm−1 at 315 nm as reported previously (37Honarmand Ebrahimi K. Hagedoorn P.-L. Jongejan J.A. Hagen W.R. Catalysis of iron core formation in Pyrococcus furiosus ferritin.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2009; 14: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was used to calculated the initial rate of Fe(II) oxidation using the progress curves. Measurements were performed at 37 °C. Buffer was 100 mm Mops, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. A VP-ITC microcalorimeter instrument (Microcal/Malvern) was used to measure Zn(II) binding to WT-PfFtn and R117A-PfFtn. Protein was prepared in 100 mm Mops, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and the Zn(II) solution was prepared in 100 mm Mops, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, to prevent formation of insoluble Zn(II) hydroxide. The instrument settings were: 30 injections with each injection 3 μl; high feedback mode; interval time, 300 s; injection period, 6 s; stirring speed, 502 rpm; reference power, 15 μcal/s; and temperature, 25 °C. The sample cell was filled with the protein solution, 72 μm (monomer) WT-PfFtn or 102 μm (monomer) R117A-PfFtn, and the syringe was filled with 6.95 mm Zn(II) solution. For each experiment, a control experiment in the absence of protein was performed to obtain the heat of dilution of Zn(II) in buffer. Origin 7.0 software customized by Microcal for analysis of ITC data was used to analyze the data. DLS was performed as explained previously (38Ebrahimi K.H. Hagedoorn P.-L. van der Weel L. Verhaert P.D. Hagen W.R. A novel mechanism of iron-core formation by Pyrococcus furiosus archaeoferritin, a member of an uncharacterized branch of the ferritin-like superfamily.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2012; 17: 975-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, a Zetasizer NanoZs instrument (Malvern UK) was used to measure the hydrodynamic diameter of ferritin. Measurements were performed at room temperature, 25 °C. Buffer was 100 mm Mops, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Each measurement consisted of at least 13 runs and was repeated at least two times. Both with WT-PfFtn and R117A-PfFtn four samples were prepared: sample 1, apo protein; sample 2, apo protein aerobically incubated with 2 Fe(II) per monomer; sample 3, apo protein aerobically incubated with 20 Fe(II) per monomer; and sample 4, apo protein aerobically incubated with 50 Fe(II) per monomer. Aerobic addition of Fe(II) was performed stepwise, with each step having two Fe(II) per monomer, to reach the final amount of Fe(II). After each step, the protein was incubated at 50 °C for 5 min. 1 ml of Wt-PfFtn or R117A-PfFtn was washed with at least 200 ml of phosphate buffer (100 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.9) using Amicon Ultra filter units with molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa. This was done to replace Mops buffer, which disturbs the CD spectra of proteins, with phosphate buffer. CD spectra were recorded using a JASCO-815 CD spectrometer as explained previously (38Ebrahimi K.H. Hagedoorn P.-L. van der Weel L. Verhaert P.D. Hagen W.R. A novel mechanism of iron-core formation by Pyrococcus furiosus archaeoferritin, a member of an uncharacterized branch of the ferritin-like superfamily.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2012; 17: 975-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed at room temperature. Formation of the mixed valence [Fe(II)-Fe(III)] cluster in the ferroxidase center was measured using EPR spectroscopy as explained previously (23Ebrahimi K.H. Bill E. Hagedoorn P.-L. Hagen W.R. The catalytic center of ferritin regulates iron storage via Fe (II)-Fe (III) displacement.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed at 15 K, and the other conditions were as follows: microwave frequency, 9380 MHz; microwave power, 127 milliwatt; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; and modulation amplitude, 12.7 gauss. Gel pieces were reduced with dithiothreitol (10 mm), 30 min, room temperature), alkylated with iodoacetamide (20 mm, 60 min, room temperature in the dark), and digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C. After digestion, formic acid and DMSO were added (both 5% v/v) to increase peptide recovery. Protein digests were analyzed on a reversed phase nano-LC coupled to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). An Agilent 1200 series HPLC system was equipped with an in-house packed trapping column (100-μm inner diameter and 20-mm length) and an analytical column (50-μm inner diameter and 250-mm length) filled with Reprosil Pur 120 C18-AQ (Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). Trapping was performed at 5 μl/min for 10 min in solvent A (0.1 m acetic acid), and elution was achieved with a gradient from 0 to 40% solvent B (0.1 m acetic acid in 8:2 (v/v) acetonitrile:water) for 40 min. The LTQ Orbitrap Velos was operated in the positive ion mode, using data-dependent acquisition, automatically switching between MS and MS/MS. Full scan MS spectra (from m/z 400–1500, charge states 2 and higher) were acquired at a resolution of 30,000 at m/z 400 after accumulation to a target value of 106 ions (automatic gain control). Nine data-dependent MS/MS scans (HCD spectra, resolution 7,500 at m/z 400) were acquired using the nine most intense ions with a charge state of 2+ or higher and an ion count of 10,000 or higher. MS/MS spectra were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and Mascot v2.2.02 search engine (Matrix Science). As a reference proteome, the NCBI proteome of P. furiosus (2985 sequences) was used. Carbamidomethyl cysteine was set as a fixed modification and oxidized methionine as a variable modification. Trypsin was specified as the proteolytic enzyme, and up to three missed cleavages were accepted. Mass tolerance for fragment ions was set at 0.05 Da and for precursor peptide ions at 10 ppm. Based on amino acid substitutions at the 3-fold symmetry axes, where putative channels (3-fold channels) have been proposed to exist, an Fe(II) entry path to the internal cavity of eukaryotic ferritin through 3-fold channels is proposed (29Behera R.K. Theil E.C. Moving Fe2+ from ferritin ion channels to catalytic OH centers depends on conserved protein cage carboxylates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 7925-7930Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To test this possibility in PfFtn, we replaced Arg-117 (Fig. 2A), which is located in the middle of the 3-fold symmetry axis in the putative path of Fe(II) to the internal cavity and more than 16 Å away from the ferroxidase center, with an alanine (R117A) using site-directed mutagenesis (“Experimental Procedures”). This was done because alanine cannot bind metal ions, and in the x-ray crystal structure of soybean ferritin, an alanine residue (alanine 163) aligns with arginine 117 in PfFtn (Fig. 2B). After expression and purification of the protein, to check for formation of stable 24-meric structures, the protein was run on a native gel, and the result was compared with that of wild-type PfFtn (Fig. 2C). Although the wild-type protein forms a single band at ∼480 kDa attesting to the presence of stable 24-meric structures, for two different amounts of R117A-PfFtn loaded on the gel essentially a single band at an apparent molecular mass of less than 66 kDa is observed (Fig. 2C). Mass spectrometry confirmed that this band is produced by R117A-PfFtn. Thus, it appears that R117A mutation abolished self-assembly and resulted in formation of monomeric (∼20 kDa) and/or dimeric (∼40 kDa) species. Observation of monomeric/dimeric species using gel electrophoresis might have resulted from the possible instability of the quaternary structure of R117A mutant during electrophoretic separation. To exclude this possibility, we used DLS to study the oligomeric state of R117A-PfFtn in solution. DLS was used to measure the hydrodynamic diameter of apo R117A-PfFtn (Fig. 2D), and the results were compared with two standards: apo WT-PfFtn with diameter of 11–12 nm and cytochrome c with diameter of 3.0 nm (Fig. 2D). The hydrodynamic diameter of WT-PfFtn was 10–11 nm, and that of cytochrome c was 2.6 nm. For apo R117A-PfFtn, a peak was observed, whose maximum varied for different measurements between 3 and 6 nm. We took the average of 20 measurements, which gave a single peak with a maximum at ∼4.2 nm. This value is close to the theoretical value of 4.3 nm for the hydrodynamic diameter of a monomer. This theoretical value was predicted using the formula for the hydrodynamic diameter of a monomeric subunit assuming a prolate ellipsoid shape (like a rugby ball) (39He L. Niemeyer B. A novel correlation for protein diffusion coefficients based on molecular weight and radius of gyration.Biotechnol. Prog. 2003; 19: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), with major axes of ellipsoid being the width and the length of a ferritin monomer, i.e. 3.6 and 5.8 nm, respectively. If R117A-PfFtn would have consisted of a mixture of monomers (∼3.6-nm width and 6-nm length) and dimers (∼7.2-nm width and 6-nm length), during DLS measurements two maxima should have been observed. Therefore, based on the results of gel electrophoresis and DLS together, we conclude that apo R117A-PfFtn was essentially in the monomeric state. Using CD spectroscopy, we tested whether R117A-PfFtn folded into a four-α-helical bundle structure (Fig. 2E). The CD spectrum of R117A-PfFtn showed characteristics of a protein with a secondary structure that is predominantly α-helical, which is indicated by two negative peaks at ∼222 and 208 nm (Fig. 2D). Moreover, comparison of the CD spectrum of R117A-PfFtn with those of proteins or peptides with a four-α-helical bundle structure (40Osterhout J.J. Handel T. Na G. Toumadje A. Long R.C. Connolly P.J.

https://openalex.org/W2217179860,"The emergence and spread of drug resistance represents one of the biggest challenges for malaria control in endemic regions. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is currently deployed as intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) to prevent the adverse effects of malaria on the mother and her offspring. Nevertheless, its efficacy is threatened by SP resistance which can be estimated by the prevalence of dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) and dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) mutations. This was measured among pregnant women in the health district of Nanoro, Burkina Faso.From June to December 2010, two hundred and fifty six pregnant women in the second and third trimester, attending antenatal care with microscopically confirmed malaria infection were invited to participate, regardless of malaria symptoms. A blood sample was collected on filter paper and analyzed by PCR-RFLP for the alleles 51, 59, 108, 164 in the pfdhfr gene and 437, 540 in the pfdhps gene.The genes were successfully genotyped in all but one sample (99.6%; 255/256) for dhfr and in 90.2% (231/256) for dhps. The dhfr C59R and S108N mutations were the most common, with a prevalence of 61.2% (156/255) and 55.7% (142/255), respectively; 12.2% (31/255) samples had also the dhfr N51I mutation while the I164L mutation was absent. The dhps A437G mutation was found in 34.2% (79/231) isolates, but none of them carried the codon K540E. The prevalence of the dhfr double mutations NRNI and the triple mutations IRNI was 35.7% (91/255) and 11.4% (29/255), respectively.Though the mutations in the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes were relatively common, the prevalence of the triple pfdhfr mutation was very low, indicating that SP as IPTp is still efficacious in Burkina Faso."
https://openalex.org/W2216223097,"Objectives To investigate whether the diagnostic performance of lesion-to-fat elasticity ratio (Eratio) was affected by the location of the reference fat. Methods For 257 breast masses in 250 women who underwent shear-wave elastography before biopsy or surgery, multiple Eratios were measured with a fixed region-of-interest (ROI) in the mass along with multiple ROIs over the surrounding fat in different locations. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine that Eratio was independently associated with malignancy adjusted for the location of fat ROI (depth, laterality, and distance from lesion or skin). Mean (Emean) and maximum (Emax) elasticity values of fat were divided into four groups according to their interquartile ranges. Diagnostic performance of each group was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC). False diagnoses of Eratio were reviewed for ROIs on areas showing artifactual high or low stiffness and analyzed by logistic regression analysis to determine variables (associated palpable abnormality, lesion size, the vertical distance from fat ROI to skin, and elasticity values of lesion or fat) independently associated with false results. Results Eratio was independently associated with malignancy adjusted for the location of fat ROI (P<0.0001). Among four groups of fat elasticity values, the AUC showed no significant difference (<25th percentile, 25th percentile~median, median~75th percentile, and ≥75th percentile; 0.973, 0.982, 0.967, and 0.954 for Emean; 0.977, 0.967, 0.966, and 0.957 for Emax). Fat elasticity values were independently associated with false results of Eratio with the cut-off of 3.18 from ROC curve (P<0.0001). ROIs were set on fat showing artifactual high stiffness in 90% of 10 false negatives and on lesion showing vertical striped artifact or fat showing artifactual low stiffness in 77.5% of 71 false positives. Conclusion Eratio shows good diagnostic performance regardless of the location of reference fat, except when it is placed in areas of artifacts."
https://openalex.org/W2241534610,"NDR1/2 kinase is essential in dendrite morphology and spine formation, which is regulated by cellular Ca2+. Lead (Pb) is a potent blocker of L-type calcium channel and our recent work showed Pb exposure impairs dendritic spine outgrowth in hippocampal neurons in rats. But the sensitivity of Pb-induced spine maturity with mixed factors (gender×age×brain regions) remains unknown. This study aimed to systematically investigate the effect of Pb exposure on spine maturity in rat brain with three factors (gender×age×brain regions), as well as the NDR1/2 kinase expression. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to Pb from parturition to postnatal day 30, 60, 90, respectively. Golgi-Cox staining was used to examine spine maturity. Western blot assay was applied to measure protein expression and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR assay was used to examine mRNA levels. The results showed chronic Pb exposure significantly decreased dendritic length and impaired spine maturity in both rat hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. The impairment of dendritic length induced by Pb exposure tended to adolescence > adulthood, hippocampus > medial prefrontal cortex and female > male. Pb exposure induced significant damage in spine maturity during adolescence and early adult while little damage during adult in male rat brain and female medial prefrontal cortex. Besides, there was sustained impairment from adolescence to adulthood in female hippocampus. Interestingly, impairment of spine maturity followed by Pb exposure was correlated with NDR1/2 kinase. The reduction of NDR1/2 kinase protein expression after Pb exposure was similar to the result of spine maturity. In addition, NDR2 and their substrate Rabin3 mRNA levels were significantly decreased by Pb exposure in developmental rat brain. Taken together, Pb exposure impaired dendrite growth and maturity which was subject to gender×age×brain regions effects and related to NDR1/2 signal expression."
https://openalex.org/W2262730464,"Knowledge about the three-dimensional stepping of motor proteins on the surface of microtubules (MTs) as well as the torsional components in their power strokes can be inferred from longitudinal MT rotations in gliding motility assays. In previous studies, optical detection of these rotations relied on the tracking of rather large optical probes present on the outer MT surface. However, these probes may act as obstacles for motor stepping and may prevent the unhindered rotation of the gliding MTs. To overcome these limitations, we devised a novel, impact-free method to detect MT rotations based on fluorescent speckles within the MT structure in combination with fluorescence-interference contrast microscopy. We (i) confirmed the rotational pitches of MTs gliding on surfaces coated by kinesin-1 and kinesin-8 motors, (ii) demonstrated the superiority of our method over previous approaches on kinesin-8 coated surfaces at low ATP concentration, and (iii) identified MT rotations driven by mammalian cytoplasmic dynein, indicating that during collective motion cytoplasmic dynein side-steps with a bias in one direction. Our novel method is easy to implement on any state-of-the-art fluorescence microscope and allows for high-throughput experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2280619077,"Invertebrates possess a diverse collection of pentameric Cys-loop ligand gated ion channel (LGIC) receptors whose molecular structures, evolution and relationships to mammalian counterparts have been intensely investigated in several clinically and agriculturally important species. These receptors are targets for a variety of control agents that may also harm beneficial species. However, little is known about Cys-loop receptors in spiders, which are important natural predators of insects. We assembled de novo transcriptomes from the central and peripheral nervous systems of the Central American wandering spider Cupiennius salei, a model species for neurophysiological, behavioral and developmental studies. We found 15 Cys-loop receptor subunits that are expected to form anion or cation permeable channels, plus a putative acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) that has only previously been reported in molluscs and one annelid. We used phylogenetic and sequence analysis to compare the spider subunits to homologous receptors in other species and predicted the 3D structures of each protein using the I-Tasser server. The quality of homology models improved with increasing sequence identity to the available high-resolution templates. We found that C. salei has orthologous γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), GluCl, pHCl, HisCl and nAChα LGIC subunits to other arthropods, but some subgroups are specific to arachnids, or only to spiders. C. salei sequences were phylogenetically closest to gene fragments from the social spider, Stegodyphus mimosarum, indicating high conservation within the Araneomorphae suborder of spiders. C. salei sequences had similar ligand binding and transmembrane regions to other invertebrate and vertebrate LGICs. They also had motifs associated with high sensitivity to insecticides and antiparasitic agents such as fipronil, dieldrin and ivermectin. Development of truly selective control agents for pest species will require information about the molecular structure and pharmacology of Cys-loop receptors in beneficial species."
https://openalex.org/W1426375636,"Cognitive control has been extensively studied from Event-Related Potential (ERP) point of view in visual modality using Stroop paradigms. Little work has been done in auditory Stroop paradigms, and inconsistent conclusions have been reported, especially on the conflict detection stage of cognitive control. This study investigated the early ERP components in an auditory Stroop paradigm, during which participants were asked to identify the volume of spoken words and ignore the word meanings. A series of significant ERP components were revealed that distinguished incongruent and congruent trials: two declined negative polarity waves (the N1 and the N2) and three declined positive polarity wave (the P1, the P2 and the P3) over the fronto-central area for the incongruent trials. These early ERP components imply that both a perceptual stage and an identification stage exist in the auditory Stroop effect. A 3-stage cognitive control model was thus proposed for a more detailed description of the human cognitive control mechanism in the auditory Stroop tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2140615727,"Ischaemum rugosum Salisb. (Saramolla grass) is a noxious weed of rice that is difficult to control by chemical or mechanical means once established. A study was conducted to determine the effect of light, temperature, salt, drought, flooding, rice residue mulch, burial depth, and pre-emergence herbicides on seed germination and emergence of I. rugosum. Germination was stimulated by light and inhibited under complete darkness. Optimum temperature for germination was 30/20°C (97.5% germination). Germination reduced from 31 to 3.5% when the osmotic potential of the growing medium decreased from -0.1 to -0.6 MPa and no germination occurred at -0.8 MPa. Germination was 18 and 0.5% at 50 and 100 mM NaCl concentrations, respectively, but was completely inhibited at 150 mM or higher. Residue application at 1-6 t ha-1 reduced weed emergence by 35-88% and shoot biomass by 55-95%. The efficacy of pre-emergence herbicides increased with increasing application rates and decreased with increasing rice residue mulching. The efficacy of herbicides was in the order of oxadiazon> pendimethalin> pretilachlor. At 6 t ha-1, all herbicides, regardless of rates, did not differ from the control treatment. I. rugosum seeds buried at 2 cm or deeper did not emerge; however, they emerged by 4.5 and 0.5% at 0.5 and 1 cm depths, respectively, compared to the 39% germination for soil surface seeding. Flooding at 4 DAS or earlier reduced seedling emergence and shoot biomass while flooding at 8 DAS reduced only seedling emergence. The depth and timing of flooding independently reduced root biomass. Flooding at 4 and 6 cm depths reduced the root biomass. Relative to flooding on the day of sowing, flooding at 8 DAS increased root biomass by 89%. Similarly, flooding on the day of sowing and at 2 DAS reduced the root-shoot biomass ratio. Under the no-flood treatment, increasing rates of pretilachlor from 0.075 to 0.3 kg ai ha-1 reduced weed emergence by 61-79%. At the flooding depth of 2-4 cm, pretilachlor reduced weed emergence and shoot and root biomass, but the differences across rates were non-significant. Information generated in this study will be helpful in developing integrated weed management strategies for managing this weed."
https://openalex.org/W2203188289,"Ecologists have long classified Midwestern prairies based on compositional variation assumed to reflect local gradients in moisture availability. The best known classification is based on Curtis’ continuum index (CI), calculated using the presence of indicator species thought centered on different portions of an underlying moisture gradient. Direct evidence of the extent to which CI reflects differences in moisture availability has been lacking, however. Many factors that increase moisture availability (e.g., soil depth, silt content) also increase nutrient supply and decrease soil mechanical impedance; the ecological effects of the last have rarely been considered in any ecosystem. Decreased soil mechanical impedance should increase the availability of soil moisture and nutrients by reducing the root costs of retrieving both. Here we assess the relative importance of soil moisture, nutrient supply, and mechanical impedance in determining prairie composition and structure. We used leaf δ13C of C3 plants as a measure of growing-season moisture availability, cation exchange capacity (CEC) x soil depth as a measure of mineral nutrient availability, and penetrometer data as a measure of soil mechanical impedance. Community composition and structure were assessed in 17 remnant prairies in Wisconsin which vary little in annual precipitation. Ordination and regression analyses showed that δ13C increased with CI toward “drier” sites, and decreased with soil depth and % silt content. Variation in δ13C among remnants was 2.0‰, comparable to that along continental gradients from ca. 500–1500 mm annual rainfall. As predicted, LAI and average leaf height increased significantly toward “wetter” sites. CI accounted for 54% of compositional variance but δ13C accounted for only 6.2%, despite the strong relationships of δ13C to CI and CI to composition. Compositional variation reflects soil fertility and mechanical impedance more than moisture availability. This study is the first to quantify the effects of soil mechanical impedance on community ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2206596548,"Ecophysiological stress and physical disturbance are capable of structuring meadows through a combination of direct biomass removal and recruitment limitation; however, predicting these effects at landscape scales has rarely been successful. To model environmental influence on sexual recruitment in perennial Zostera marina, we selected a sub-tidal, light-replete study site with seasonal extremes in temperature and wave energy. During an 8-year observation period, areal coverage increased from 4.8 to 42.7%. Gains were stepwise in pattern, attributable to annual recruitment of patches followed by centrifugal growth and coalescence. Recruitment varied from 13 to 4,894 patches per year. Using a multiple linear regression approach, we examined the association between patch appearance and relative wave energy, atmospheric condition and water temperature. Two models were developed, one appropriate for the dispersal of naked seeds, and another for rafted flowers. Results indicated that both modes of sexual recruitment varied as functions of wind, temperature, rainfall and wave energy, with a regime shift in wind-wave energy corresponding to periods of rapid colonization within our site. Temporal correlations between sexual recruitment and time-lagged climatic summaries highlighted floral induction, seed bank and small patch development as periods of vulnerability. Given global losses in seagrass coverage, regions of recovery and re-colonization will become increasingly important. Lacking landscape-scale process models for seagrass recruitment, temporally explicit statistical approaches presented here could be used to forecast colonization trajectories and to provide managers with real-time estimates of future meadow performance; i.e., when to expect a good year in terms of seagrass expansion. To facilitate use as forecasting tools, we did not use statistical composites or normalized variables as our predictors. This study, therefore, represents a first step toward linking remotely acquired environmental data to sexual recruitment, an important measure of seagrass performance that translates directly into landscape-scale coverage change."
https://openalex.org/W2202823136,"Stressors frequently increase oxidative damage--unless organisms simultaneously mount effective antioxidant responses. One putative mitigative mechanism is the use of biliverdin, an antioxidant produced in the spleen during erythrocyte degradation. We hypothesized that both wild and captive-bred male veiled chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus), which are highly aggressive to conspecifics, would respond to agonistic displays with increased levels of oxidative damage, but that increased levels of biliverdin would limit this increase. We found that even just visual exposure to a potential combatant resulted in decreased body mass during the subsequent 48-hour period, but that hematocrit, biliverdin concentration in the bile, relative spleen size, and oxidative damage in plasma, liver, and spleen were unaffected. Contrary to our predictions, we found that individuals with smaller spleens exhibited greater decreases in hematocrit and higher bile biliverdin concentrations, suggesting a revision to the idea of spleen-dependent erythrocyte processing. Interestingly, individuals with larger spleens had reduced oxidative damage in both the liver and spleen, demonstrating the spleen's importance in modulating oxidative damage. We also uncovered differences in spleen size and oxidative damage between wild and captive-bred chameleons, highlighting environmentally dependent differences in oxidative physiology. Lastly, we found no relationship between oxidative damage and biliverdin concentration, calling into question biliverdin's antioxidant role in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2174667626,"Penetration of the clivus is required for surgical access of the brain stem. The endoscopic transclivus approach is a difficult procedure with high risk of injury to important neurovascular structures. We undertook a novel anatomical and radiological investigation to understand the structure of the clivus and neurovascular structures relevant to the extended trans-nasal trans-sphenoid procedure and determine a safe corridor for the penetration of the clivus.We examined the clivus region in the computed tomographic angiography (CTA) images of 220 adults, magnetic resonance (MR) images of 50 adults, and dry skull specimens of 10 adults. Multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) of the CT images was performed, and the anatomical features of the clivus were studied in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes. The data from the images were used to determine the anatomical parameters of the clivus and neurovascular structures, such as the internal carotid artery and inferior petrosal sinus.The examination of the CTA and MR images of the enrolled subjects revealed that the thickness of the clivus helped determine the depth of the penetration, while the distance from the sagittal midline to the important neurovascular structures determined the width of the penetration. Further, data from the CTA and MR images were consistent with those retrieved from the examination of the cadaveric specimens.Our findings provided certain pointers that may be useful in guiding the surgery such that inadvertent injury to vital structures is avoided and also provided supportive information for the choice of the appropriate endoscopic equipment."
https://openalex.org/W2176318783,"The human AmphyphisinII/Bin1 N-BAR domain belongs to the BAR domain superfamily, whose members sense and generate membrane curvatures. The N-BAR domain is a 57 kDa homodimeric protein comprising a six helix bundle. Here we report the protein folding mechanism of this protein as a representative of this protein superfamily. The concentration dependent thermodynamic stability was studied by urea equilibrium transition curves followed by fluorescence and far-UV CD spectroscopy. Kinetic unfolding and refolding experiments, including rapid double and triple mixing techniques, allowed to unravel the complex folding behavior of N-BAR. The equilibrium unfolding transition curve can be described by a two-state process, while the folding kinetics show four refolding phases, an additional burst reaction and two unfolding phases. All fast refolding phases show a rollover in the chevron plot but only one of these phases depends on the protein concentration reporting the dimerization step. Secondary structure formation occurs during the three fast refolding phases. The slowest phase can be assigned to a proline isomerization. All kinetic experiments were also followed by fluorescence anisotropy detection to verify the assignment of the dimerization step to the respective folding phase. Based on these experiments we propose for N-BAR two parallel folding pathways towards the homodimeric native state depending on the proline conformation in the unfolded state."
https://openalex.org/W2195708378,"Invasive species can alter coastal ecosystems both directly, e.g. through competition for substratum and nutrients, and indirectly. Indirect effects may be mediated by creation of dissimilar or inimical habitats, changes in predator and/or prey assemblages, alterations in associated biota, and perturbations of water movement and thermal regimes. Previous studies have shown that invasive algae can modify native habitat architecture, disrupt intricately linked food webs and alter epibiotic assemblages. In the UK, the seagrass Zostera marina supports a diverse epibiotic assemblage, influencing key factors such as sediment dynamics, depositional regime and trophic linkages. Increasing encroachment of the invasive alga Sargassum muticum into seagrass meadows changes the physical and chemical characteristics of the local environment and creates the potential for changes in the epibionts associated with the seagrass blades, threatening the integrity of the seagrass ecosystem. We investigated the effects of S. muticum invasion upon the epibiota of Z. marina in a drowned river valley in SW England seasonally from spring to autumn over four years in an in-situ manipulative experiment, comparing permanent quadrats with and without artificially introduced S. muticum. Epibiota were weighed, identified to the most detailed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) possible, and unitary organisms were enumerated. Multivariate PERMANOVA+ analysis revealed significant differences in epibiont assemblages between Sargassum treatments. Linear mixed effects models indicated that differences in epibiota assemblage composition were not reflected as significant differences in mean biomass per sample, or number of epibiont OTUs per sample. We conclude that S. muticum invasion into Z. marina meadows may significantly alter the species composition and abundance distribution of epibiotic assemblages found on the blades of the seagrass. Thus S. muticum invasion could have more wide-reaching effects on processes within coastal ecosystems than predicted purely by direct effects."
https://openalex.org/W2203176997,"The efficacy of using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) alone as a preferred screening test for diabetes has been questioned. This study was aimed to evaluate whether the use of serum advanced glycation end products-peptides (sAGEP) would help to improve the efficacy of FPG in diabetes screening among high-risk Chinese subjects with FPG <7.0 mmol/L. FPG, 2-h plasma glucose (2h-PG), serum glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and sAGEP were measured in 857 Chinese subjects with risk factors for diabetes. The areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves generated by logistic regression models were assessed and compared to find the best model for diabetes screening in subjects with FPG <7.0 mmol/L. The optimal critical line was determined by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity. Among the enrolled subjects, 730 of them had FPG <7.0 mmol/L, and only 41.7% new diabetes cases were identified using the 1999 World Health Organization FPG criterion (FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L). The area under ROC curves generated by the model on FPG-sAGEP was the largest compared with that on FPG-HbA1c, sAGEP, HbA1c or FPG in subjects with FPG <7.0 mmol/L. By maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity, the optimal critical line was determined as 0.69×FPG + 0.14×sAGEP = 7.03, giving a critical sensitivity of 91.2% in detecting 2h-PG ≥11.1 mmol/L, which was significantly higher than that of FPG-HbA1c or HbA1c. The model on FPG-sAGEP improves the efficacy of using FPG alone in detecting diabetes among high-risk Chinese subjects with FPG <7.0 mmol/L, and is worth being promoted for future diabetes screening."
https://openalex.org/W2231494303,"CD4+ T-helper cells that produce interleukin-17 (Th17 cells) are characterized as pathological T-helper cells in autoimmune diseases. Differentiation of human and mouse Th17 cells requires a key transcription regulator, retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt), which is a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases. To develop a therapeutic agent for Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases, we have established a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for candidate screening, in which the luciferase activity in RORγt-LBD positive and negative Jurkat cells were analyzed to evaluate induction of RORγt activity by compounds. This technique was applied to screen a commercially-available drug-like chemical compound library (Enamine) which contains 20155 compounds. The screening identified 17 compounds that can inhibit RORγt function in the HTS screen system. Of these, three tetraazacyclic compounds can potently inhibit RORγt activity, and suppress Th17 differentiation and IL-17 production. These three candidate compounds could significantly attenuate the expression of the Il17a by 65%- 90%, and inhibit IL-17A secretion by 47%, 63%, and 74%, respectively. These compounds also exhibited a potent anti-RORγt activity, with EC50 values of 0.25 μM, 0.67 μM and 2.6 μM, respectively. Our data demonstrated the feasibility of targeting the RORγt to inhibit Th17 cell differentiation and function with these tetraazacyclic compounds, and the potential to improve the structure of these compounds for autoimmune diseases therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2215840523,"It was previously shown that a small lesion in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) prevented both cortical plasticity and sensory learning in the adult mouse visual system: While 3-month-old control mice continued to show ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in their primary visual cortex (V1) after monocular deprivation (MD), age-matched mice with a small photothrombotically induced (PT) stroke lesion in S1, positioned at least 1 mm anterior to the anterior border of V1, no longer expressed OD-plasticity. In addition, in the S1-lesioned mice, neither the experience-dependent increase of the spatial frequency threshold (""visual acuity"") nor of the contrast threshold (""contrast sensitivity"") of the optomotor reflex through the open eye was present. To assess whether these plasticity impairments can also occur if a lesion is placed more distant from V1, we tested the effect of a PT-lesion in the secondary motor cortex (M2). We observed that mice with a small M2-lesion restricted to the superficial cortical layers no longer expressed an OD-shift towards the open eye after 7 days of MD in V1 of the lesioned hemisphere. Consistent with previous findings about the consequences of an S1-lesion, OD-plasticity in V1 of the nonlesioned hemisphere of the M2-lesioned mice was still present. In addition, the experience-dependent improvements of both visual acuity and contrast sensitivity of the open eye were severely reduced. In contrast, sham-lesioned mice displayed both an OD-shift and improvements of visual capabilities of their open eye. To summarize, our data indicate that even a very small lesion restricted to the superficial cortical layers and more than 3mm anterior to the anterior border of V1 compromised V1-plasticity and impaired learning-induced visual improvements in adult mice. Thus both plasticity phenomena cannot only depend on modality-specific and local nerve cell networks but are clearly influenced by long-range interactions even from distant brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2193511056,"Despite the difference among specific methods, existing Sensitivity Analysis (SA) technologies are all value-based, that is, the uncertainties in the model input and output are quantified as changes of values. This paradigm provides only limited insight into the nature of models and the modeled systems. In addition to the value of data, a potentially richer information about the model lies in the topological difference between pre-model data space and post-model data space. This paper introduces an innovative SA method called Topology Oriented Sensitivity Analysis, which defines sensitivity as the volatility of data space. It extends SA into a deeper level that lies in the topology of data."
https://openalex.org/W2341417672,"For phase II oncology trials, Simon’s two-stage design is the most commonly used strategy. However, when clinically unevaluable patients occur, the total number of patients included at each stage differs from what was initially planned. Such situations raise concerns about the operating characteristics of the trial design. This paper evaluates three classical ad hoc strategies and a novel one proposed in this work for handling unevaluable patients. This latter is called the rescue strategy which adapts the critical stopping rules to the number of unevaluable patients at each stage without modifying the planned sample size. blue Simulations show that none of these strategies perfectly match the original target constraints for type I and II error rates. Our rescue strategy is nevertheless the one which best approaches the target error rates requirement. A re-analysis of one real phase II clinical trials on metastatic cancer illustrates the use of the proposed strategy."
