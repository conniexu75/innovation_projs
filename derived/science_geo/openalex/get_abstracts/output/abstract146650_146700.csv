https://openalex.org/W2049871798,"Evidence accumulated from clinical and basic research has indirectly implicated the insulin receptor (IR) in brain cognitive functions, including learning and memory (Wickelgren, I. (1998) Science 280, 517–519). The present study investigates correlative changes in IR expression, phosphorylation, and associated signaling molecules in the rat hippocampus following water maze training. Although the distribution of IR protein matched that of IR mRNA in most forebrain regions, a dissociation of the IR mRNA and protein expression patterns was found in the cerebellar cortex. After training, IR mRNA in the CA1 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was up-regulated, and there was increased accumulation of IR protein in the hippocampal crude synaptic membrane fraction. In the CA1 pyramidal neurons, changes in the distribution pattern of IR in particular cellular compartments, such as the nucleus and dendritic regions, was observed only in trained animals. Although IR showed a low level of in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation, an insulin-stimulated increase of in vitro Tyr phosphorylation of IR was detected in trained animals, suggesting that learning may induce IR functional changes, such as enhanced receptor sensitivity. Furthermore, a training-induced co-immunoprecipitation of IR with Shc-66 was detected, along with changes in in vivo Tyr phosphorylation of Shc and mitogen-activated protein kinase, as well as accumulation of Shc-66, Shc-52, and Grb-2 in hippocampal synaptic membrane fractions following training. These findings suggest that IR may participate in memory processing through activation of its receptor Tyr kinase activity, and they suggest possible engagement of Shc/Grb-2/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades.

IR is widely distributed in the brain (1Werther G.A. Hogg A. Oldfield B.J. Mckinley M.J. Figdor R. Allen A.M. Mendelsohn F.A.O. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1562-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), with particularly high concentrations in neurons and much lower levels in glia (2Marks J.L. King M.G. Baskin D.G.

Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 387-414PubMed Google Scholar). Although IR mRNA is largely localized in neuronal somata, abundant IR protein is found in both cell bodies and synapses, including the dendritic field of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, the adrenergic terminals in hypothalamus, and membranes of dendrodendritic synaptosomes from the rat olfactory bulb (3Schwartz M.W. Figlewicz D.P. Baskin D.G. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 387-414PubMed Google Scholar, 4Marks J.L. Maddison J. Eastman C.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 50: 774-781Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although the major molecular structure and most of the properties of IR in the central nervous system are indistinguishable from those in peripheral tissues, some differences exist between central nervous system IRs and peripheral IRs. Both the α and β subunits, for example, of IR in the central nervous system are slightly lower in molecular weight than those in the periphery (5Heidenreich K.A. Zahniser N.R. Berhanu P. Brandenburg D. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8527-8530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike peripheral IR, the brain IR does not undergo down-regulation after exposure to high concentrations of insulin (6Zahniser N.R. Goens M.B. Hanaway P.J. Vinych J.V. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1354-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Boyd Jr., F.T. Raizada M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: C283-C287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, insulin appears to regulate glucose metabolism only in glia cells but not in neurons (3Schwartz M.W. Figlewicz D.P. Baskin D.G. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 387-414PubMed Google Scholar, 8Heidenreich K.A. Brandenburg D. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Clarke D.W. Boyd F.T. Kappy M.S. Raizada M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11672-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have led to speculation that the neuronal IRs mediate functions different from those regulated by their peripheral and glial counterparts. IR is a glycoprotein with an α2β2tetrameric structure. Binding of insulin to the extracellularly located α subunits results in autophosphorylation of the β subunits at tyrosine residues 1158, 1162, and 1163, located in the cell interior (10Kahn C.R. White M.F. Shoelson S.E. Backer J.M. Araki E. Cheatham B. Csermely P. Folli F. Goldstein B.J. Huertas P. Rothenberg P.L. Saad M.J.A. Siddle K. Sun X.J. Wilden P.A. Yamada K. Kahn S.A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 291-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation stimulates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of IR, which is believed to initiate the biological actions of insulin (10Kahn C.R. White M.F. Shoelson S.E. Backer J.M. Araki E. Cheatham B. Csermely P. Folli F. Goldstein B.J. Huertas P. Rothenberg P.L. Saad M.J.A. Siddle K. Sun X.J. Wilden P.A. Yamada K. Kahn S.A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 291-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other growth factor receptors, phosphorylated IR triggers subsequent biological responses by activating different cellular signal transduction cascades. These include interaction of the receptor with IR substrate proteins and a variety of Src homology domain 2- and 3-containing proteins (11Roth R.A. Zhang B. Chin J.E. Kavocina K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 48: 2-18Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Quon M.J. Butte A.J. Taylor S.I. Trends Endocrinol.

One of such pathways involves Shc, an adapter protein (14Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci G.

This process is known to bring about activation of Ras (16Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Ratzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that in turn triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway leading to regulation of nuclear transcription (18Orban P.C. Chapman P.F. Brambilla R. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 38-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is found that the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Shc is responsible for the IR-mediated mitogenic signaling (19Ricketts W.A. Rose D.W. Shoelson S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26165-26169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Evidence from functional studies demonstrates that insulin/IR may play a modulatory role in brain synaptic transmission. Consistent with its enriched distribution in adrenergic terminals, insulin is found to promote central catecholaminergic activities by releasing both epinephrine and norepinephrine (20Sauter A. Goldstein M. Engel J. Ueta K. Brain Res. 1983; 260: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), inhibiting synaptic reuptake of norepinephrine (21Raizada M.K. Shemer J. Judkins J.H. Clarke D.W. Masters B.A. LeRoith D. Neurochem. Res. 1988; 13: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and altering catecholomine kinetics (22Masters B.A. Shemer J. Judkins J.H. Clarke D.W. LeRoith D. Raizada M.K. Brain Res. 1987; 417: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the hippocampus, insulin is reported to enhance α1 adrenergic receptor activity, leading to stimulation of membrane phosphoinositol turnover and diacylglycerol production (23Figlewicz D.P. Szot P. Brain Res. 1991; 550: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), two important second messengers involved in PKC activation. At the behavioral level, insulin/IR has been implicated in at least two major brain functions: feeding behavior (3Schwartz M.W. Figlewicz D.P. Baskin D.G. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 387-414PubMed Google Scholar, 24Woods S.c. Chavez M. Park C.R. Riedy C. Kaiyala K. Richardson R.D. Figlewicz D.P. Schwartz M.W. Porte Jr., D. Seeley R. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1996; 20: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and cognition, including learning and memory (25Wickelgren I. Science. 1998; 280: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A role for insulin/IR in learning and memory is supported by several findings. First, IR is highly concentrated in neurons of specific brain regions, such as hippocampus, amygdala, and some cortical areas (1Werther G.A. Hogg A. Oldfield B.J. Mckinley M.J. Figdor R. Allen A.M. Mendelsohn F.A.O. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1562-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 2Marks J.L. King M.G. Baskin D.G. Molecular Biology and Physiology of Insulin and Insulin-like Growth Factors. Plenum Press, New York1991: 459-470Google Scholar). Secondly, data from behavioral-pharmacological studies show that injection of streptozotocin, a diabetes-inducing compound, into the brain induces significant memory impairment (26Lannert H. Hoyer S. Behav. Neurosci. 1998; 112: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). More importantly, defects in insulin action in both periphery and the brain have been found in Alzheimer's disease (27Craft S. Peskind E. Schwartz M.W. Schellenberg G.D. Raskind M. Porte Jr., D. Neurology. 1998; 50: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 28Craft S. Neocomer J. Kanne S. Dagogo-Jack S. Cryer P. Sheline Y. Luby J. Dagogo-Jack A. Alderson A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1996; 17: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and insulin has been shown to reduce phosphorylation of tau protein in human neuronal cultures by inhibiting activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3, hence promoting association of tau to microtubules (29Hong M. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19547-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Finally, impairment of brain cognitive functions in diabetes mellitus, presumably due to disruption of glucose metabolism, is well documented (30Matthaei S. Horuk R. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1986; 35: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Stolk R.p. Breteler M.M.B.

Despite the large body of evidence from clinical and animal studies suggesting involvement of insulin/IR in learning and memory, actual correlated changes of IR during memory processing have never been reported. In this study, we investigate changes in IR expression, Tyr phosphorylation, and certain IR-associated signaling molecules in the rat hippocampal neurons following a water maze training experience. Male 60–90 day-old Wistar rats (200–250 g) were housed in standardized conditions as described elsewhere (35Cavallaro S. Meiri N. Yi C.L. Musco S. Ma W. Goldberg J. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9669-9673Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To adapt rats to the experimental environment and behavioral activity, all rats were subjected, in the first day of experiments, to 2 min of swimming in a 1.5 m (diameter) × 0.6 m (depth) pool, with water temperature set at 21 ± 1 °C. On the following day, rats were trained in a four-trial water maze task, each trial lasting up to 2 min. During training, rats learned to escape from water by finding an unseen rigid platform submerged about 1 cm below the water surface in a fixed location. The escape latency during each trial was measured as an indicator of learning. In order to assess short-term and long-term biochemical changes, rats were sacrificed at 1 and 24 h, respectively, after training. For the controls, rats were given four swimming trials, but without the platform present in the pool. The length of each swimming trial for each control rat was yoked to that of each trained rat to equalize nonlearning components, such as locomotor activity and stress. These swimming controls were also sacrificed at 1 and 24 h, respectively, after the last swimming trial. All rats were sacrificed by decapitation, and their hippocampi were rapidly removed, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C before use. Hippocampi from a naı̈ve group were also collected and used for basal controls. For in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry studies, the whole brain was rapidly removed following decapitation and frozen on dry ice. In total, 15 rats were used for each group. The experiments were carried out under the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health regulations for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes. A fragment of cDNA corresponding to bases 760–1140 of the rat IR mRNA (GenBankTM accession number M29014) was synthesized by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from the rat hippocampus (see under “RT-PCR” below). This fragment shared no homology with any other proteins in the rat brain and was subcloned into the SrfI cloning site of pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) cloning vector (Stratagene) to produce a template for riboprobe synthesis. The sense and antisense riboprobes were synthesized by in vitrotranscription with T7 or T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion) respectively in the presence of 1 μg of IR DNA template, 0.5 mm NTPs and 2 mm [α-35S]UTP (>1000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). The transcribed product was purified on a Sephadex G-25 spin column (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), and the final labeling to the probe was assessed by scintillation counting. Brains from naive, trained, and swimming control rats were sectioned at 12 μm in a cryostat at −20 °C. Sections were collected on silanated glass slides (Digene) and dried at room temperature before being returned to −80 °C for storage. Brain slices were fixed for 5 min in 4% formaldehyde, acetylated, and dehydrated in graded ethanol. The IR riboprobe (1 × 106 cpm in 50 μl) was applied to each slide holding three sections and hybridized at 55 °C for 30 h in a mixture containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 4 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10 μg/ml yeast total RNA, 10 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% NTS. Slices hybridized with the sense riboprobe or pretreated with RNase before hybridization with the antisense probe were used as negative controls. Following high stringency posthybridization washes and RNase treatment, brain sections were dehydrated in graded ethanol and then subjected to film and liquid emulsion autoradiography. Frozen brain sections from naı̈ve, swimming control, and trained rats were fixed for 5 min in 4% formaldehyde. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and preincubation with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, the slices were incubated overnight at room temperature in the same medium containing the primary antibody against rat insulin receptor-β (Santa Crutz Biotechnology) diluted to 1:400. In control slices, the primary antibody was omitted. Slices were washed with PBS, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG diluted to1:400 for 1 h at room temperature. Following a wash process, signals were visualized with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique (Elite kit, Vector Laboratories), in which 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine was used as chromogen. Adult rats were killed by decapitation, and their cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex were rapidly dissected and frozen on dry ice. The total RNA from each above region was extracted using RNA Isolator (Genosys). Following removal of genomic DNA with DNase treatment, the RNA samples were subjected to a reverse transcription reaction to synthesize single strand cDNAs using the first strand cDNA synthesis mix (Novagen). Amplification of a 372-base pair IR cDNA fragment was performed on a DNA thermal cycler 480 (Perkin-Elmer) through a 25-cycle PCR (94 °C 1 min, 50 °C 1 min, and 74 °C 2 s) with primers 5′-CTCTGTCCGCATCGAGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCACACACTGACCATCCA-3′ (reverse). To control for any variability in sample processing, primers (forward, 5′-AGGTGCTCAACAACATGGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-TACCAGAGGCCACAGTAGCT-3′) synthesizing a 183-base pair rat phosphoglycerate kinase 1 cDNA fragment were included in the PCR amplification. The final PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. The general cytosolic and crude synaptic membrane fractions were prepared by centrifugation according to the procedure of Rostas et al. (36Rostas J.A. Brent V.A. Heath J.W. Neame R.L. Powis D.A. Weinberger R.P. Dunkley P.R. Neurochem. Res. 1986; 11: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the frozen tissues from different brain regions were homogenized respectively in precooled Buffer A (0.32 m sucrose, 2 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1 dose of protease inhibitor mixture purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was diluted to 10% (w/v) with Buffer A, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (S1) was preserved, whereas the pellet (P1) was washed with Buffer A and centrifuged at 1000 × g again for 5 min. The supernatant was combined with S1 and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant (S2) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to produce a general cytosolic fraction (S3). The pellet (P2) was osmotically lysed (10 ml/g original tissue) on ice for 30 min in Buffer B (2 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 μm Ca2+, and 1 dose of protease inhibitor mixture), and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet (P2M) from this step was collected as a crude synaptic membrane fraction, redissolved in a small volume of 2 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing a dose of protease inhibitor mixture, and stored at −80 °C until use. To investigate training-induced changes, hippocampi from four rats were combined to generate three independent pools from a total of 12 rats in each group. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad Protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). The human IR or IGF-1R that was stably transfected into the NIH 3T3 cell (37Kadowaki T. Bevins C.L. Cama A. Ojamaa K. Marcus-Saumuels B. Kadowaki H. Beitz L. Mckeon C. Taylor S.I. Science. 1988; 240: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 38Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as positive control for the rat hippocampal IR. Tyrosine phosphorylated IR or IGF-1R was generated by stimulating the transfected cells with insulin (100 nm at 37 °C for 2 min). Cells were washed with ice-cooled PBS and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were then lysed on ice for 30 min in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 dose of protease inhibitor mixture) and briefly centrifuged at 8000 rpm (4 °C). The supernatant was collected as cell lysates. Protein concentrations were assessed using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Proteins from each subcellular fraction were separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membrane. Blocked with 5% milk powder in 0.01 m PBS, pH 7.5, the membrane was incubated with a given primary antibody (such as antibody against IR, Sch, Grb-2, MAPK, or phosphotyrosine) at 4 °C overnight with constant shaking. On the following day, the membrane was washed and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h. The immunoreactive signal was then revealed with the enhanced chemiluminescence process. Alternatively, a target protein was immunoprecipitated from subcellular fractions with its specific antibody and then detected with immunoblotting procedures. If the protein of interest was expected to have a molecular mass similar to that of the heavy chain of IgG (around 55 kDa), the primary antibody was covalently cross-linked to agarose beads in a cross-link reaction using the CarboLinkTM kit (Pierce). This process retained IgG molecules on agarose beads during sample denaturing, thereby preventing the target protein signal(s) from being masked by IgG in immunoblotting. In vitro phosphorylation of hippocampal S3 and P2M proteins was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/μl leupeptin, ± 1 mm CaCl2 ± 0.1 μm insulin, and 50 μg of S2 or P2M proteins. Although Mn2+ has been known to be a potent effector for in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation, it was eliminated from the present reactions, as it reacted with sodium vanadate to form yellow precipitates. The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by addition of ATP to a final concentration of 100 μm. After incubating at 37 °C for 3 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of SDS reducing sample buffer. The mixture was boiled for 10 min followed by separation by a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in Immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Py20, Upstate). All biochemical experiments were repeated at least three times for each pool of hippocampal tissues. In situ hybridization histochemistry images and signals from immunoblotting were analyzed by measuring the optic mean density using the NIH Image program. Values from the swimming controls and trained animals were normalized against values from naı̈ve animals. Data from three pooled samples were subjected to one- or two-way analysis of variance. Consistent with previous findings, our in situhybridization histochemistry results showed that IR mRNA is widely expressed in the rat brain (Fig.1 A). The highest density of IR mRNA signals was revealed in the cerebellar cortex and choroid plexus of the third and lateral ventricles. Concentrated IR mRNA signals were also detected in forebrain areas, such as anterior olfactory nucleus, pyriform cortex, thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, hippocampal formation, amygdaloid nucleus, and the cerebral cortex. IR mRNA levels in the hippocampus, cerebral, and cerebellar cortex were also measured using RT-PCR, which again revealed highest levels of IR PCR product in the cerebellum (Fig.2 A), indicating a high concentration of IR mRNA in this area.Figure 2Comparison of IR mRNA and protein in different brain regions. A shows the RT-PCR result indicating that the cerebellar cortex (CCtx) possesses the highest IR mRNA level among the three brain regions examined.B shows immunoblotting results for IR protein levels in subcellular fractions from the three above brain regions. The protein concentration in the cerebellar cortex is lower than that in the cerebral cortex (CrCtx) and hippocampus (HP). Theright lane is a positive control showing the human IR that is overexpressed in the NIH 3T3 cells. Results from RT-PCR and immunoblotting of brain homogenates were subjected measured by densitometry. The densitometry ratio of IR protein to IR mRNA for different regions is shown in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When IR protein levels in the rat brain were measured with immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry, the polyclonal anti-IR-β antibody detected a 95-kDa protein band from subcellular preparations of the rat brain that migrated slightly faster on SDS gel than the human IR transfected in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2 B). The ratio of IR protein to mRNA was much lower in the cerebellar cortex than in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, (Fig. 2 C). In all three areas, IR protein was highly concentrated in the P2M fraction. The disassociation of mRNA and protein expression in distinct brain regions was confirmed by results from immunohistochemistry studies. Fig. 3 A shows the liquid emulsion results, which demonstrate cellular distribution of IR mRNA. The dark grains represent the IR mRNA signals, a high concentration of which is present in both Purkinje (indicated byarrows) and granule cells of the cerebellar cortex (bottom panel), whereas the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal CA1 area had lower levels of IR mRNA signals (top panel). Fig. 3 B shows that immunoreactivity (indicated by darkness of the brown staining) of IR protein in the CA1 pyramidal cells (top panel) was stronger than that in Purkinje and granule cells of the cerebellar cortex (bottom panel). In addition, the cerebral cortical neurons and the choroidal epithelium also showed high IR immunoreactivity (data not shown). We trained rats in a four-trial water maze task for 1 day in order to distinguish cellular events associated with memory formation with those trigged by other processes such as recall, which usually results from multi-day training tasks. After training, rat maze learning (Fig. 4 A) was demonstrated by significantly reduced escape latency (F3,59= 40.36, p < 0.001). Training induced an up-regulation of IR mRNA in the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 4 B). Compared with swimming controls trained animals showed 30% and 22% increases in IR mRNA in the CA1 area at 1 h and 24 h after training. A two-way analysis of variance showed significant training (F1,8 = 14.04, p = 0.006), but not time effects. Similarly, 30–40% increases were found in dentate gyrus after training (F1,8 = 14.51,p = 0.005), whereas no significant changes were found in CA3 region. Changes in IR protein levels after training were determined with immunoblotting (Fig. 4 C). No significant changes in IR protein were found in the total homogenate fraction (Fig. 4 C, a). A decrease (19%) in IR immunoreactivity in the S3 fraction was apparent 1 h after training (F1,8 = 18.55,p = 0.0026, Fig. 4 C, b). On the other hand, a significant increase in IR protein was detected in the P2M fraction at 1 and 24 h after training (F1,8 =11.36,p < 0.01, Fig. 4 C, c). Similar results were also obtained following immunoprecipitation of IR from P2M fractions from each group of animals (data not shown). Fig. 4 D illustrates immunocytochemical changes in IR protein in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells after training. The brown staining indicates immunoreactivity of IR in the CA1 neurons. For swimming controls, the majority of cells (∼ 80%) in the CA1 area showed moderate IR immunostaining, with a distribution pattern similar to that of naı̈ve animals (see Fig. 3).

In this study, treatment of human tumor cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trapoxin (TPX), resulted in selective changes in genes that control the cell cycle. TPX activated p21waf1 transcription that led to elevated p21waf1 protein levels in three human tumor cell lines without altering the protein levels of cdk2, cdk4, or cyclin B. In addition, TPX increased cyclin E transcription without increasing the levels of Rb, E2F, dihydrofolate reductase, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The elevated levels of p21waf1 protein led to decreased Rb phosphorylation and cdk2 activity. These effects resulted in G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest in H1299 human lung and MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells and apoptosis in A549 lung carcinoma cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that TPX increased the level of chromatin acetylation associated with histone H3 in the trapoxin-responsive region of the p21waf1 promoter. This study demonstrates that inhibition of HDAC by TPX increases acetylation of H3-associated chromatin and alters gene expression with marked selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2088839227,"Glycoprotein-associated amino acid transporters (gpaAT) are permease-related proteins that require heterodimerization to express their function. So far, four vertebrate gpaATs have been shown to associate with 4F2hc/CD98 for functional expression, whereas one gpaAT specifically associates with rBAT. In this study, we characterized a novel gpaAT, LAT2, for which mouse and human cDNAs were identified by expressed sequence tag data base searches. The encoded ortholog proteins are 531 and 535 amino acids long and 92% identical. They share 52 and 48% residues with the gpaATs LAT1 and y+LAT1, respectively. When mouse LAT2 and human 4F2hc cRNAs were co-injected into Xenopus oocytes, disulfide-linked heterodimers were formed, and an l-type amino acid uptake was induced, which differed slightly from that produced by LAT1–4F2hc: the apparent affinity forl-phenylalanine was higher, and l-alanine was transported at physiological concentrations. In the presence of an external amino acid substrate, LAT2–4F2hc also mediated amino acid efflux. LAT2 mRNA is expressed mainly in kidney and intestine, whereas LAT1 mRNA is expressed widely. Immunofluorescence experiments showed colocalization of 4F2hc and LAT2 at the basolateral membrane of kidney proximal tubules and small intestine epithelia. In conclusion, LAT2 forms with LAT1 a subfamily of l-type gpaATs. We propose that LAT1 is involved in cellular amino acid uptake, whereas LAT2 plays a role in epithelial amino acid (re)absorption.

For instance, active amino acid uptake is a necessity for growing cells. On the other hand, transepithelial transport of amino acids across (re)absorptive epithelia requires, besides an active amino acid uptake on the luminal side, an extrusion mechanism on the basolateral side. Recently, various members of the novel family of glycoprotein-associated amino acid transporters (gpaATs)1have been identified and shown to play a role in cellular uptake and/or basolateral extrusion of basic and neutral amino acids. These permease-related proteins with 12 putative transmembrane domains require heterodimerization with a type II glycoprotein to express their function.

The association of gpaATs with 4F2hc or possibly rBAT is a prerequisite for the transporters to reach the cell surface (2Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J.

In epithelial cells, 4F2hc is localized at the basolateral membrane (10Quackenbush E.J. Gougos A. Baumal R. Letarte M. J.

Moreover, the glycoproteins may regulate the surface expression of the transporters. 4F2hc mRNA is strongly induced in cell proliferation (13Lindsten T. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell.

Leiden J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1915-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 4F2 antigen was originally described in dividing T cells as an activation antigen composed of a heavy chain and a disulfide-linked light chain (17Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S. Shelhamer J.H. Mostowski H.S. Thomas C.A. Strominger J.L. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1409-1414PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hemler M.E. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 623-628PubMed Google Scholar). Human 4F2hc comprises 529 amino acids with an intracellular NH2 terminus and a single transmembrane region, but migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 85–93 kDa due to four extracellular glycosylation sites (19Teixeira S.

Both proteins activate amino acid transport when expressed alone in Xenopusoocytes, presumably due to their association with endogenous light chains of the gpaAT family (23Wells R.G.

When 4F2hc is coexpressed with a gpaAT, this leads to a much earlier appearance of amino acid transport, which is light chain-specific. The actual vectorial transport of amino acids is thought to be mediated by cotransporter(s) and/or uniport(s), which have a limited range of amino acid specificity. Therefore, the gpaAT family members, which function as amino acid exchangers for a broad range of amino acids, are required to extend the transport specificity range to amino acids not accepted by the cotransporter(s) and/or uniport(s). Apparent gene duplication within the family may represent specialization of function in cell proliferation or amino acid transport across epithelial cell layers. The pair of y+l system transporters best exemplifies such duplication: whereas y+LAT2 has a broad tissue expression (9Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Ohira M. Kawarabayasi Y. Ohara O. Tanaka A.

Verrey, unpublished results. y+LAT1 is expressed mainly in intestine and kidney epithelia. The actual function of y+LAT1 is the exchange of intracellular cationic amino acids against extracellular neutral amino acids cotransported with a Na+ ion (5Torrents D. Estevez R. Pineda M.

They also highlight the crucial role of gpaATs for the extension of the specificity range of amino acid transport. In this study, we characterize a new gpaAT, LAT2, which is structurally and functionally most related to LAT1. In contrast to LAT1, which is expressed widely, LAT2 is prominently expressed in the basolateral membrane of (re)absorbing epithelia and is thus suggested to play a role in amino acid (re)absorption. An EST with the cDNA for mLAT2 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AA288581) was identified by data base searches (BLAST programs of NCBI and EMBnet-CH) with the sequences of ASUR4 and E16 as query. Based on the sequence of mLAT2, several overlapping ESTs of the human cDNA were found. The clones were obtained from the IMAGE consortium. Two of them (GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers H99270 and N32639) were digested with AflIII and NotI to generate fragments of 1371 and 2357 base pairs, respectively, which were ligated into pGEM-11Zf(+) (Promega) previously linearized with NotI and dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The mLAT2 and hLAT2 ESTs were sequenced on both strands by automated sequencing (LI-COR Inc., DNA sequencer 4200L). The sequences of hLAT2 and mLAT2 cDNAs are available under GenBankTM/EBI accession numbersAF171669 and AF171668, respectively. The open reading frames of mLAT2 and hLAT2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Vent® polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and transferred to the pSD5easy vector (31Puoti A. May A. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5949-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). mLAT2 was flanked at its 5′-end by 35 untranslated nucleotides with an XhoI site and at its 3′-end by 32 nucleotides with a HindIII site, whereas hLAT2 had 26 5′-nucleotides and a HindIII site and 26 3′-nucleotides with a BamHI site. For cRNA synthesis, plasmids containing the cDNAs of h4F2hc (vector pSport) (19Teixeira S. Di Grandi S. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9574-9580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mLAT2 and hLAT2 (pSD5easy) were linearized using the restriction sitesHindIII and BglII, respectively. cRNA was synthesized with T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases (Promega), respectively, according to standard protocols. Oocytes were treated with collagenase A for 2–3 h at room temperature in Ca2+-free buffer containing 82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) to remove follicular cells and then kept at 16 °C in ND96 buffer containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Injection of cRNAs into oocytes was as for uptake experiments (see below). After injections, oocytes were incubated for 48 h in ND96 buffer supplemented with 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine. The oocytes were washed twice in ND96 buffer and lysed in oocyte lysis buffer (20 μl/oocyte) containing 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were vortexed for 20 s, incubated briefly on ice, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting of trichloroacetic acid precipitates from aliquots. Immunoprecipitations were performed with the mouse anti-human 4F2hc monoclonal antibody of Haynes et al. (17Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S. Shelhamer J.H. Mostowski H.S. Thomas C.A. Strominger J.L. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1409-1414PubMed Google Scholar) or a polyclonal antibody against mLAT2. This antibody was raised in two rabbits (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) using as antigen a synthetic peptide (Peptide Service, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne) with the 17 COOH-terminal amino acids of mLAT2 plus an NH2-terminal cysteine coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Eurogentec). The anti-human rBAT polyclonal antibody was raised similarly using a synthetic peptide with the 18 NH2-terminal amino acids as antigen. Antibodies were bound to 30 μl of Affi-Gel-protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad) in oocyte lysis buffer for 2 h at room temperature using a shaker at very low speed. Equal amounts (2 × 106cpm/μl) of lysates were mixed with the coupled beads and shaken slowly overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 500 mmLiCl and four times in the same buffer without LiCl. The beads were resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer and heated at 65 °C for 15 min. β-Mercaptoethanol (2%) was added for reduced samples. After migration, the 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were fixed in 30% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid for 1 h, treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min, and rinsed in H2O for 5 min. The gels were dried and exposed to Eastman Kodak BiomaxTM films at −75 °C. Xenopus oocytes were injected with 5 ng of cRNA dissolved in 33 nl of water and incubated for 24 h at 16 °C in ND96 buffer. Before the experiment, they were washed six times with (+Na)- or (−Na)-buffer containing 100 mm NaCl ((+Na)-buffer) or choline Cl ((−Na)-buffer), 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). Six oocytes/experiment were preincubated for 2 min at 22 °C. The buffer was replaced with (+Na)- or (−Na)-buffer, respectively, supplemented with a 100 μm concentration of the indicated l-amino acid and the corresponding l-3H-labeled amino acid as a tracer (except forl-[14C]glutamine). Uptakes were performed for 3 min because pilot experiments had shown linear amino acid uptake during this period. The oocytes were washed five times with 3 ml of (+Na)- or (−Na)-buffer, respectively, and distributed to individual vials. After oocyte lysis in 2% SDS, the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. Uptakes for dose-response curves were performed at five different amino acid concentrations. Sigmoid curves corresponding to Michaelis-Menten kinetics were fitted to the experimental data, and amino acid concentrations for half-maximal activation (apparent K m) were derived. For efflux studies, oocytes were injected 18 h after injection of the corresponding cRNA with 1 nmol of the indicated amino acid and 10 pmol of 3H-labeled amino acid as a tracer dissolved in 33 nl of water. After incubation for 4 h at 16 °C in ND96 buffer, oocytes were washed six times with (+Na)-buffer and again three times just before the start of experiments. For each group of four oocytes, the buffer was replaced with 300 μl of (+Na)-buffer supplemented with 1 mml-phenylalanine. Three aliquots of 4 μl of buffer were taken at 1, 3, 6, and 10 min after the start of the incubation (22 °C), and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. Absolute efflux values were calculated taking into account the loss of radioactivity during the injection and subsequent preincubation, which was 0.2–25%. The impact of endogenous oocyte amino acids on the specific activity was calculated (see Taylor and Smith (32Taylor M.A. Smith L.D. Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for oocyte content of different amino acids). Total RNA was isolated from various tissues of three female and two male mice (B10D2 and B6D2 strains) by a modification of the method of Chirgwin et al. (33Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Nitrogen-frozen tissues were homogenized in RNA lysis buffer (3m sodium acetate (pH 6), 4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, and 8% β-mercaptoethanol) using a homogenizer. The lysates were spun at 9700 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were layered on top of 1.4 ml of a 5.7 mcesium chloride cushion in Ultra-Clear tubes (Beckman Instruments Inc.). The tubes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 20 °C. The pellet was dissolved in H2O, extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was dissolved in H2O. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA were migrated on formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gels, transferred onto GeneScreen Plus membrane (NEN Life Science Products), and UV-cross-linked.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1152-1159PubMed Google Scholar); nucleotides 541–930), and mouse 4F2hc (full-length cDNA) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Hybridizations were performed at 65 °C (60 °C for the rLAT1 probe) in hybridization solution (7% SDS, 250 mmNaH2PO4, and 1 mm EDTA) for 16–18 h. The membranes were washed twice in 1× SSPE (saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA) and 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 42 °C and twice in 1× SSPE and 0.1% SDS for 25 min at 65 °C (2× SSPE and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for the rLAT1 probe). The membranes were exposed with BiomaxTM films or a BAS-MP 2040S imaging plate (Fuji). The signals were quantified with Aida 2.0 software (Fuji). Kidneys from a nu/nu mouse were sectioned in halves through the papilla, immediately snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane precooled with liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −75 °C until sectioning. The small intestine from a B10D2 mouse was directly nitrogen-frozen and stored at −75 °C until sectioning. Sections of 7 μm were made with a cryomicrotome (Jung CM 1800, Leica Inc.), placed on gelatin-coated glass slides, fixed for 90 s in methanol, rinsed in PBS, and incubated in PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Primary antibodies (rabbit anti-mouse LAT2 or rat anti-mouse 4F2hc/RL388 (22Lüscher B. Rousseaux M. Lees R. MacDonald H.R. Bron C. J.

Immunol. 1985; 135: 3944-3950PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Claude Bron) were added at several dilutions for 1 h. The slides were extensively washed in PBS, and secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG) were added for 45 min in the dark. As a specificity control for the anti-LAT2 antibody, preimmune serum of the same rabbit was used. No staining was observed. Furthermore, the filters for the detection of green or red fluorescence were highly specific, and no spillover was observed. For double-staining experiments, primary antibodies were added simultaneously, but secondary antibodies were added sequentially: first, the Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG for 45 min, and after extensive washing with PBS, the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG for 45 min. The slides were extensively washed in PBS, mounted, and observed with a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop, Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with a CCD camera. Mouse and human ESTs encoding a new member of the gpaAT family were identified by data base searches with BLAST programs at NCBI and EMBnet-CH using the LAT1 and y+LAT1 protein sequences as queries. The mouse full-length protein is encoded by a single 3717-base pair cDNA (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF171668). The human ortholog cDNA (3728 base pairs; GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF171669) was obtained by fusing two partial ESTs (GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers H99270 and N32639). These new transporter cDNAs and their protein products were subsequently named mLAT2 and hLAT2 based on their structural and functional relationship with LAT1 (see below). The mouse and human proteins encoded by the LAT2 cDNAs are composed of 531 and 535 amino acids, respectively, and their sequences are 91.9% identical to each other (data not shown). The highest level of identity to other members of the gpaAT family is obtained for LAT1 (52% identity between hLAT1 and hLAT2). The identity level is slightly lower for human y+LAT1 (48%) and human y+LAT2 (46.6%). Human b0,+AT, the light chain associated with rBAT, is 40.7% identical.2 The primary structure of mLAT2 and hLAT2 suggests, as for LAT1 and y+LAT1 (1Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar), Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics). A conserved cysteine involved in disulfide bridging with 4F2hc is located in the extracellular loop between putative transmembrane domains 3 and 4 in X. laevis LAT1 (ASUR4, X. laevisAmAT-l-lc) and SPRM1 (Schistosoma mansonihomolog) (37Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is also conserved in LAT2 (residues 153 and 154 in mLAT2 and hLAT2, respectively). Using immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins expressed in X. laevis oocytes, we tested whether LAT2 is disulfide-linked to h4F2hc or/and rBAT. In Fig. 1, we show that 4F2hc expressed alone, independently of sample reduction, migrated at ∼80 kDa when immunoprecipitated with anti-4F2hc antibody (lanes 5 and 16), whereas no band appeared when anti-LAT2 antibody was used (lanes 2 and 13). Correspondingly, LAT2 expressed alone appeared as a band of ∼42 kDa when immunoprecipitated with anti-LAT2 antibody (lanes 1 and12), but was absent when immunoprecipitated with anti-4F2hc antibody (lanes 4 and 15). When both 4F2hc and LAT2 were coexpressed in oocytes, they were coprecipitated by anti-4F2hc (lanes 6 and 17) or anti-LAT2 (lanes 3 and 14) antibody. Under nonreducing conditions, a LAT2–4F2hc complex that migrated at ∼120 kDa was precipitated by either antibody (lanes 3 and 6), together with some uncoupled 4F2hc precipitated with anti-4F2hc antibody (lane 6; 80 kDa) and some uncoupled LAT2 precipitated with anti-LAT2 antibody (lane 3; 42 kDa). Under reducing conditions, the complex was almost completely reduced to an ∼80-kDa band (4F2hc) and an ∼42-kDa band (LAT2) (lanes 14 and 17). We then tested whether LAT2 possibly also associates with rBAT. Immunoprecipitation of rBAT expressed alone, independently of sample reduction, displayed two bands at ∼75 and 85 kDa (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 20), representing most probably core- and terminally glycosylated forms of the protein. LAT2 expressed alone was not precipitated by anti-rBAT antibody (lanes 11 and22). Surprisingly, when rBAT and LAT2 were coexpressed, rBAT was coprecipitated by anti-LAT2 antibody, as seen under reducing conditions (lane 19). Under nonreducing conditions, however, the complex was not detected at the level of a heterodimer (∼130 kDa), but migrated in a high molecular mass complex, the composition of which is not known (lane 8).

Lack of the wild type protein leads to broad spectrum disease resistance against the pathogenic powdery mildew fungus and deregulated leaf cell death. Scanning N-glycosylation mutagenesis and Mlo-Lep fusion proteins demonstrated that Mlo is membrane-anchored by 7 transmembrane (TM) helices such that the N terminus is located extracellularly and the C terminus intracellularly. Fractionation of leaf cells and immunoblotting localized the protein to the plant plasma membrane. A genome-wide search for Mlo sequence-related genes in Arabidopsis thaliana revealed approximately 35 family members, the only abundant gene family encoding 7 TM proteins in higher plants. The sequence variability of Mlo family members within a single species, their topology and subcellular localization are reminiscent of the most abundant class of metazoan 7 TM receptors, the G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2124352629,"Apoptosis is a programmed cell death mechanism to control cell number in tissues and to eliminate individual cells that may lead to disease states. The present study investigates chromium(VI) (Cr(VI))-induced apoptosis and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and p53 in this response. Treatment of human lung epithelial cells (A549) with Cr(VI) caused apoptosis as measured by DNA fragmentation, mitochondria damage, and cell morphology. Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis is contributed to ROS generation, resulting from cellular reduction of Cr(VI) as measured by flow cytometric analysis of the stained cells, oxygen consumption, and electron spin resonance spin trapping. Scavengers of ROS, such as catalase, aspirin, andN-acetyl-l-cysteine, decreased Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis, whereas NADPH and glutathione reductase, enhancers of Cr(VI)-induced ROS generation, increased it. p53 is activated by Cr(VI), mostly by ROS-mediated free radical reactions. Cr(VI)-induced ROS generation occurred within a few minutes after Cr(VI) treatment of the cells, whereas p53 induction took at least 5 h. The level of Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis was similar in both p53-positive cells and p53-negative cells independent of p53 status in the early stage (0–3 h) of Cr(VI) treatment. However, at the later stage (3–24 h), the level of the apoptosis is higher in p53-positive cells than in p53-negative cells. These results suggest that ROS generated through Cr(VI) reduction is responsible to the early stage of apoptosis, whereas p53 contributes to the late stage of apoptosis and is responsible for the enhancement of Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis at this stage.

Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a response to physiologic and pathologic stresses that disrupt the balance between the rates of cell division and elimination. In diseases such as cancer, there is an imbalance between the rate of cell proliferation and cell death. Agents that promote or suppress apoptosis can alter the rates of cell division and death, influencing the anomalous accumulation of neoplastic cells. Although many questions remain to be answered, it is generally believed that in certain cell types, oxidative stress is a critical part of the apoptotic process (2Jabs T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). It has been reported that oxidant or oxidant-promoting agents cause necrosis at higher concentrations and apoptosis at lower concentrations (2Jabs T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Antioxidants can inhibit or delay oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (2Jabs T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Another important mediator of apoptosis is p53 (3Lotem J. Sachs L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12507-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). Activation of p53 involves growth arrest and/or apoptosis. Recent studies indicate that reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 are downstream mediators of p53-dependent apoptosis (4Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar, 5Johnson T.M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar): (a) the transcriptional induction of redox-related genes; (b) the generation of ROS; and (c) the oxidative degradation of mitochondrial components, leading to apoptosis. The present study focuses on Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. Cr(VI) compounds are highly toxic and carcinogenic (6De Flora S. Bagnasco M. Serra D. Zanacchi P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 238: 99-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). They are potent inducers of tumors in experimental animals. They cause DNA damage, such as DNA strand breaks and dG hydroxylation (6De Flora S. Bagnasco M. Serra D. Zanacchi P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 238: 99-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that in cellular systems, Cr(VI) is reduced by certain flavoenzymes such as glutathione reductase to generate Cr(V) (7Shi X. Chiu A. Chen C.T. Halliwell B. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B Crit. Rev. 1999; 2: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 8Shi X.L. Dalal N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9Shi X.G. Dalal N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). During this process, molecular oxygen is reduced to O·̄2, which generates H2O2 via dismutation (7Shi X. Chiu A. Chen C.T. Halliwell B. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B Crit. Rev. 1999; 2: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The resultant Cr(V) reacts with H2O2 to generate ⋅OH radical via a Fenton-like reaction. Thus, during the one-electron reduction of Cr(VI), a whole spectrum of ROS are generated. Through ROS-mediated reactions, Cr(VI) is able to cause DNA damage (10Shi X. Mao Y. Knapton A.D. Ding M. Rojanasakul Y. Gannett P.M. Dalal N. Liu K. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2475-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and activation of nuclear transcription factor NF-κB (11Ye J. Zhang X. Young H.A. Mao Y. Shi X. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2401-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that ROS play an important role in carcinogenesis induced by a variety of carcinogens. The net effect of the response is determined by a balance between intercellular oxidants and antioxidants. ROS-mediated reactions are believed to play a key role in Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage. Cell cycle surveillance mechanisms set checkpoints for cell cycle progression. If the cell is damaged by external agent, such as Cr(VI), that may cause DNA breaks, cell cycle progression will be transiently delayed to allow the cell to repair the damaged DNA. If the DNA is severely damaged, the cell will undergo apoptosis (12Shackelford R.E. Kaufmann W.K. Paules R.S. Environ. Health Perspect. 1999; 107 (Suppl. 1): 5-24PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a defense mechanism by which the body can eliminate damaged cells. Thus investigation on the role of ROS in Cr(VI) induced apoptosis is important to understand the mechanism of carcinogenesis caused by not only Cr(VI) but also by other carcinogens. We report here that Cr(VI) is a direct ROS promoting agent that causes mitochondria damage and induces apoptosis. The apoptotic processes involves both p53-independent and p53-dependent pathways. Potassium dichromate (Cr(VI)) and chromium fluoride (Cr(III)) were purchased from Aldrich. Chromium-GSH complex (Cr(IV)) was synthesized according to the method described earlier (13Liu K.J. Shi X. Dalal N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Aspirin, β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH),N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), DCFH-DA, and cyclosporine A (CsA) were purchased from Sigma. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Dihydroethidium, JC-1, and DiOC6 were purchased from Molecular Probe (Eugene, OR). The human lung epithelial cell lines (A549 and H1299) and the human prostate epithelial cell line PC3 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator with RPMI 1640 cell culture medium that was supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells form a monolayer at confluence. Trypsin (0.25%) EDTA solution was used to detach the cells from the culture flask for plating and passing the cells. The cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in supplemented RPMI 1640 and incubated for16 h before the cells were subjected to treatment in triplicate wells. After treatment, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (2.68 mm KCl, 1.47m KH2PO4, 8 mmNa2KPO4, 136.75 mm NaCl), and apoptosis was quantitated by measuring the levels of cytosolic histone-bound DNA fragments. This was done by using a cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit manufactured by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The assays were carried out according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells were lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer at room temperature. The lysate from three identical wells was combined, and 20 μl of the resulted lysate was mixed with 80 μl of antibody solution in a well of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate. The loaded wells were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The substrate was added after the wells were washed three times in washing buffer. After incubation at 37 °C for 10–20 min, the reaction was stopped, and optical density was measured using a microplate reader at a wavelength of 405 nm. The readings were used to represent the degree of apoptosis. A mean value of three separate experiments was for analysis. Apoptosis was also examined by morphological analysis. At the end of chromium treatment, the cells were washed twice in PBS and then fixed with 10% buffered formalin. The cells were stained with Wright staining kit containing solutions A, B, and C (Volu-Sol, Inc., Louisville, KY). The staining was conducted in a 96-well tissue culture plate according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were stained in 100 μl of Wright's stain solution (solution A) for 2 min, treated with 100 μl solution B for 1.5 min, and then rinsed in solution C for 10 s. After being air-dried, the stained cells were observed under a Leitz inverted microscope. The cell image was captured with a Sony 3CCD color video camera and printed with a Sony color video printer. The sample cells were suspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml propidium iodine 5 min before flow cytometry assay. JC-1 was excited at 490 nm and detected at 600 nm. DiOC6 was excited at 488 nm and detected at 525 nm. Dihydroethidium was excited at 490 nm and detected at 620 nm. DCFH-DA was excited at 488 nm and detected at 525 nm. JC-1 (14Cossarizza A.

The dye was dissolved in Me2SO and diluted with PBS at 1:1000. The cells were plated in a 6-well plate at 5 × 105/well 16 h before treatment. After the cells were treated with chromium, the diluted dyes were applied to the cells for 15 min at 37 °C. The final concentrations were 10 μg/ml for JC-1 and 40 nm for DiOC6. Then the cells were washed twice in PBS and harvested for FACS analysis. Dihydroethidium is a O·̄2-specific dye (19Marchetti P. Castedo M. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Hirsch T. Macho A. Haeffner A.

The cells were plated in a 6-well plate at 5 × 105/well 16 h before treatment. Dihydroethidium was added into the cell culture 15 min before the treatment was completed, and the staining was carried out at 37 °C. The final Me2SO concentration in the cells culture was 0.1%. Then the cells were washed in PBS and harvested for FACS analysis. In the case of cellular image, the cells (2 × 104/well) were plated onto a glass slip in the 24-well plate. After being stained, the cells were washed in PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin. The slip was mounted on a glass slide and observed using a Saratro 2000 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyrale, CA) laser scanning confocal microscope (Optiphot-2, Nikon, Inc., Melville, PA) fitted with an argon-ion laser. DCFH-DA has been used frequently to monitor oxidative burst (5Johnson T.M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Under the same condition, DCFH-DA (5 μm) was used to stain H2O2 inside the cells. p53 protein was analyzed by Western blot assay. The cells were plated in a 100-mm culture dish and treated with chromium. The nuclear protein was prepared as described before (22Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 107 cells were treated with 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm dithiothreitol) on ice for 4 min. After 1 min of centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, the supernatant was saved as a cytoplasmic extract. The nuclei were washed once with the same volume of buffer without Nonidet P-40 and then were treated with 300 μl of extraction buffer (500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol with the same concentrations of HEPES, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, and dithiothreitol as the lysis buffer) and pipetted several times. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was harvested as the nuclear protein extract and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). A standard Western blot was carried out to detect p53 protein level in 10 μg of the nuclear protein. Monoclonal p53 antibody (sc-126) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Oxygen consumption measurements were carried out using Gilson oxygraph equipped with a Clark electrode (Gilson Medical Electronics, Middledton, WI). Measurements were made from mixtures containing 1.0 × 106/ml cells, 300 μm Cr(VI), 300 μm Cr(IV), 300 μm Cr(III), and 1 mm NADPH in a total volume of 1.5 ml. The oxygraph was calibrated with medium equilibrated with oxygen of known concentrations. ESR spin trapping technique was used to detect short-lived free radical intermediates. This technique involves the addition-type reaction of a short-lived radical with a paramagnetic compound (spin trap) to form a relatively long-lived free radical product (spin adduct), which can then be studied using conventional ESR. The intensity of the signal is used to measure the amount of short-lived radicals trapped, and the hyperfine couplings of the spin adduct are generally characteristics of the original trapped radicals. The spin trapping is a method of choice for detection and identification of free radical generation because of its specificity and sensitivity. All ESR measurement were conducted using a Varian E9 ESR spectrometer and a flat cell assembly. Reactants were mixed in a test tube in a final volume of 500 μl. The reaction mixture was then transferred to a flat cell for ESR measurement. Hyperfine couplings were measured (to 0.1 G) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl was used as a reference. The relative radical concentration was estimated by multiplying half of the peak height by (ΔHpp)2, where ΔHpp represents peak-to-peak width. The program EPRDAP, version 2.0, was used for data acquisition and analysis. The human lung tumor cell line, A549, was used to study Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. DNA fragmentation assay was carried out by detection of histone-bound DNA fragments in a whole cell lysate with a cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system as stated under “Materials and Methods.” Indeed, Cr(VI) was able to induce apoptosis in A549 cells. The induction of apoptosis is dose-dependent (Fig.1 A). The apoptosis increased with Cr(VI) concentrations from 75 to 300 μm, saturated at a dose above 300 μm, and decreased slightly at 500 μm. Thus, 300 μm was used for all experiments in this study. At this concentration, Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis depended upon incubation time (Fig. 1 B). The earliest time for DNA fragmentation to be detectable was 2 h after the Cr(VI) treatment. The DNA fragmentation increased thereafter until 24 h and then decreased (Fig. 1 B) Observation of the cell morphology also indicates that Cr(VI) is able to induce apoptosis in the lung type II epithelial cells (Fig.2). The Cr(VI)-treated cells undergo condensation of both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, which is typical of the apoptotic process. Mitochondria are the limiting factor in the apoptosis pathway in many experimental systems (23Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Disruption of mitochondria transmembrane potential (Δψm) has been an established indicator of mitochondrial damage in the progression of apoptosis (14Cossarizza A. Kalashnikova G. Grassilli E.

The result shows that at 16 h post-treatment with 300 μm Cr(VI), Δψm was significantly reduced (Fig. 3). The gated population of stained cells dropped from 98 to 63% for JC-1 staining and from 82 to 67% for DiOC6 staining, confirming damage at the mitochondrial level, which may be related to the apoptotic response of the cells to Cr(VI). The tumor suppressor gene product, p53, has been reported to mediate apoptosis in many experimental systems. It is believed that this activity is responsible for the tumor suppressive function of p53 (24Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar, 25Brown J.M. Wouters B.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1391-1399PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lin D.L. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14649-14652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This section examines whether p53 protein is involved in Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. The p53 activity was studied by extracting nuclear protein from Cr(VI)-treated cells and monitoring the p53 protein by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4). The p53 protein was detectable in the nuclear extract of the untreated cells (Fig. 4,lane 1). After an exposure to Cr(VI), the p53 protein level was elevated in a time-dependent manner. A Cr(VI)-induced increase in p53 was not noticeable at 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 h during the period of Cr(VI) treatment (Fig. 4, lanes 2–5). However, an increase in the p53 level was observed at 2 h after a 3-h incubation of the cells with Cr(VI) (Fig. 4, lane 6), and this increase reached its peak at 20 h after the treatment (Fig.4, lane 8). Housekeeping transcription factor YY1 was used as a protein loading control. The above results demonstrate that p53 was activated by Cr(VI) because nuclear p53 level was induced. The question to be answered is whether p53 activation contributed to the progression of Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. p53-positive and -negative cell lines were employed to address this question. A549 is a p53-positive cell line. Both H1299, a human lung tumor cell line (25Brown J.M. Wouters B.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1391-1399PubMed Google Scholar), and PC3, a human prostate tumor cell line (27Rubin S.J. Hallahan D.E. Ashman C.R. Brachman D.G. Beckett M.A. Virudachalam S. Yandell D.W. Weichselbaum R.R. J. Surg. Oncol. 1991; 46: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), are p53-negative cells. These three cells types were treated for 3 h with Cr(VI) at different concentrations and examined for apoptosis 24 h later. The results show that, at all three concentrations, the p53-positive cells expressed much stronger apoptosis than the p53-negative cells (Fig.5 A). In the time course analysis, both A549 (p53+) and H1299 (p53−) cells were treated with 300 μm Cr(VI), and apoptosis was monitored at different times post-treatment (Fig. 5 B). The results show that, at the early stage (<3 h), there was no difference between the p53-positive and -negative cells, indicating that p53 does not play a significant role at this stage of Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. A difference in the rate of apoptosis was observed at 12 h post-treatment, and at 24 h, apoptosis in A549 cells was twice that found in H1299 cells. This difference in Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis exhibited in the p53 wild type and mutant type cells suggests that both p53-independent and p53-dependent pathways may be involved in at the later stage of Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. ROS are considered to play a major role in Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. For example, through ROS, Cr(VI) causes DNA damage (10Shi X. Mao Y. Knapton A.D. Ding M. Rojanasakul Y. Gannett P.M. Dalal N. Liu K. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2475-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 28Snyder R.D. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and NF-κB activation (11Ye J. Zhang X. Young H.A. Mao Y. Shi X. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2401-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Chen F. Ye J. Zhang X. Rojanasakul Y. Shi X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore examined ROS generation in the Cr(VI)-treated cells. The ability of Cr(VI) to generate ⋅OH radicals was examined using an ESR spin trapping method. Fig.6 A shows a typical ESR spectrum generated by cellular reduction of Cr(VI) from a reaction mixture containing Cr(VI) and A549 cells in pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered solution. The spectrum consists of an 1:2:2:1 quartet with splittings of a H = a N = 14.9 G, where a N and a H denote hyperfine splittings of the nitroxyl nitrogen and α-hydrogen, respectively. Based on these splittings and the 1:2:2:1 line shape (9Shi X.G. Dalal N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), this spectrum was assigned to the DMPO/−OH adduct, which is evidence of −OH radical generation. In the presence of NADPH, the signal was enhanced (Fig. 6 B). The peak atg = 1.9792 was assigned to Cr(V) according to the value reported in the literature for the Cr(V) species (9Shi X.G. Dalal N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Addition of catalase completely eliminated the signals of DMPO/·OH (Fig.6 C), indicating that ·OH radical generation involves H2O2 via a Fenton-like reaction. The ability of Cr(VI) to generate O·̄2, and H2O2 in the human epthelial cells was analyzed by intracellular staining of O·̄2 and H2O2. Hydroethidine, a specific fluorescent dye for O·̄2, and DCFH-DA, a fluorescent dye for H2O2, were applied to cells for tracking generation of ROS. The cells were examined with a laser scanning confocal microscope. Both O·̄2 and H2O2were visualized inside the untreated cells (Fig.7 A, Untreated). Because these oxygen species are mainly produced in the mitochondria, the bright color fluorescent dots in the cytoplasm represent subcellular location of O·̄2 and H2O2, respectively. In the presence of Cr(VI), both O·̄2 and H2O2 were dramatically enhanced (Fig.7 A, Cr(VI) Treated). This increase occurred within 30 min. Hydroethidine exhibits a red or orange color after being oxidized by O·̄2. DCFH-DA exhibits green and orange colors after being oxidized. The generation of O·̄2 and H2O2 was quantified by flow cytometry analysis of the stained cells. For O·̄2, the gated cell population increased from 36 to 62% after Cr(VI) treatment (Fig. 7 B). In the presence of SOD, the Cr(VI)-induced population dropped from 62 to 46%. SOD treatment reduced the basal population from 36 to 30%. These results confirm at the cellular level that Cr(VI) induced ROS production after penetrating into the cells. In addition, SOD is able to pass the cell membrane and prevent accumulation of O·̄2 resulting from reduction of Cr(VI). A similar result was obtained for H2O2 by flow cytometry (data not shown). Because O·̄2 is the one-electron reduction product of molecular oxygen, the O2 consumption from cells treated with Cr(VI) was measured using an oxygraph. As shown in Fig. 7 C, Cr(VI) enhanced the O2 consumption, and NADPH was able to accelerate it slightly. Cr(III) or Cr(IV) did not exhibit any observable activity. Several strategies were used to investigate the role of the radicals in Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. Different oxidative states of chromium were examined for their activity in induction of apoptosis. Cr(III), Cr(IV), and Cr(VI) exhibit different activities in the generation of free radicals, with Cr(VI) being the strongest one. Results of the apoptosis assay indicate that although Cr(III) and Cr(IV) were able to induce apoptosis slightly, their activities were much weaker than that of Cr(VI) (Fig.8 A). This is in line with the fact that Cr(VI) can be rapidly reduced to the lower oxidative state such as Cr(V) and ROS are generated during the reaction. In the presence of NADPH, the free radical production was enhanced (Fig.6 B). As reported earlier, glutathione reductase is another major Cr(VI) reductant. Both of these reagents promoted Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8 B). The effects of antioxidants were also examined in this experimental system. Catalase, (5Johnson T.M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11848-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), aspirin (30Kataoka M. Tonooka K. Ando T. Imai K. Aimoto T. Free Radical Res. 1997; 27: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and NAC (5Johnson T.M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11848-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) are established antioxidants. Their ability to block Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis were examined. The cells were pretreated with each of the three antioxidants and then analyzed for Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. The results shows that all of three antioxidants were effective in inhibiting Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8 C). The reduction was 40% by catalase, 50% by aspirin, and 90% by NAC, demonstrating a role of ROS in the Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. The previous sections have shown that Cr(VI) is able to activate p53 and that p53 induction is involved in Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. p53 is a transcription factor involved in the activation of man oxidative stress genes (4Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). It has been reported that p53 gene product causes apoptosis using ROS as downstream mediators. Because there are two mechanisms of ROS generation, the direct generation of ROS from Cr(VI) reaction and the p53-mediated transcriptional activation, this section examines which mechanism is critical for the initiation of apoptosis, focusing on the early events of apoptosis before p53 activation. Mitochondrial damage was observed in the early stage of Cr(VI) treatment. The damage was detected with FACS analysis of the JC-1-stained cells. In the presence of Cr(VI), the gated cell population was dropped from 36 to 25% within 2.5 h (Fig.9 A). CsA is an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition (17Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Zanin C. Vayssiere J.L. Petit P.X. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Inhibition of permeability transition leads to prevention of Δψm disruption. CsA was utilized to prevent the metal-induced mitochondrial damage. The result showed that CsA pretreatment can prevent Cr(VI)-induced Δψm disruption (Fig. 9 A). CaA pretreatment also reduced Cr(VI)-induced DNA fragment (Fig. 9 B), suggesting mitochondrial involvement in the initiation of Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis, which seems p53-independent. The present study shows that Cr(VI) is able to cause apoptosis in the epithelial cell line A549. ROS are involved in the apoptotic response. The following experimental observations support this conclusion: (a) Reaction of Cr(VI) with cells generates ROS; (b) NADPH and glutathione reductase enhances the ROS generation and Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis; (c) Cr(VI)-induced apotosis can be inhibited by antioxidants including catalase, aspirin, and NAC; and (d) The apoptotic potential of chromium with different oxidative states is associated with the ability to generate ROS. Among these species, Cr(VI) is most potent in ROS generation and apoptosis induction. It has been reported that ROS are downstream mediators in the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway (4Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar, 5Johnson T.M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11848-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that Cr(VI) is able to induce activation of p53 protein. p53 protein is a tumor suppressor protein that transmits signals arising from various forms of cellular stress, including DNA damage and hypoxia, to genes and factors that induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (31Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The p53 signaling pathway can be divided into two parts, upstream of p53 and downstream of p53. The immediate downstream components of the p53 pathway are p53 transactivation targets. The present study shows that an accumulation of p53 protein was induced by Cr(VI) and that p53 is involved in the Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. It has been reported that a dozen genes can be induced by more than 10-fold when p53 level was increased in the cells. It may be noted that more than half of those genes are directly or indirectly involved in metabolism of ROS, and ROS are required in the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway (4Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). Because the results obtained from the present study show that antioxidants and enhancers of ROS generation modulate Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis, it appears that ROS generated by p53 activation may also contribute to Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. In addition to the p53-dependent pathway, this study also demonstrates that Cr(VI) is able to induce apoptosis through p53-independent pathway. As discussed above, ROS can be generated by two different mechanisms. One is the direct ROS generation in the Cr(VI) reduction process. The other is p53-mediated ROS production. The following observations support the hypothesis that Cr(VI) can induce apoptosis through a p53-independent pathway: (a) Cr(VI)-induced mitochondrial damage occurred within 3 h. In this period p53 has not been activated. Blockage of ROS by antioxidants prevented the mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. (b) Cr(VI)-induced DNA fragmentation became detectable at the same time when p53 was activated. If the DNA fragmentation was dependent on p53 activation, it should happen after p53 activation. (c) Cr(VI) is able to induce apoptosis in the p53-negative cells. At the early stage of apoptotic response, the p53-negative cells and p53-positive cells expressed similar levels of Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis. At the late stage, the p53 wild type cells exhibited a higher level of apoptosis. This indicates that at this stage, Cr(VI) induces apoptosis through both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways. (d) ROS generated by cellular reduction of Cr(VI) occurs within 30 min. In contrast, p53-mediated ROS production can only occur after p53 is activated. This activation process takes a much longer time. The results obtained from the present study support the following conclusions: (a) In the apoptotic signaling pathway, ROS generated from both Cr(VI) reduction and p53 activation play important roles. (b) The Cr(VI)-derived ROS initiate apoptosis before activation of p53 protein. (c) Although p53 is not required for initiation of Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis, it may enhance apoptosis by transcriptional activation of redox-related genes. (d) Cr(VI) induces apoptosis through both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways. (e) ROS generated by Cr(VI) may play a dual role in the mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis: genetic damage and apoptosis. The Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis may depend on the balance of these two opposite processes. (f) it may be speculated that other metal carcinogenes, such as vanadium, cobalt, and nickal, which are also direct ROS-promoting agents (32Leonard S. Gannett P.M. Rojanasakul Y. Schwegler-Berry D. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Shi X. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 70: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,33Shi X. Dalal N.S. Kasprzak K.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), may cause apoptosis by a mechanism similar to that of Cr(VI)."

Using purified osteoclasts, we examined the effects of alendronate, risedronate, pamidronate, etidronate, and clodronate on apoptosis and signaling kinases.

It is generally accepted that BPs inhibit bone resorption by acting directly or indirectly on osteoclasts, cells of hematopoietic origin. Until recently the molecular mechanism of action of BPs was not known (1Fleisch H. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 80-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 2Rodan G.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Recent pharmacological studies suggest that nitrogen-containing BPs (N-BPs), such as alendronate (ALN), risedronate (RIS), ibandronate, and pamidronate (PAM), act on the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway (3Luckman S.P.

N-BPs were recently shown to inhibit either isopentenyl diphosphate synthase or the downstream enzyme, farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase, or both (5van Beek E. Pieterman E. Cohen L. Löwik C. Papapoulos S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), while clodronate (CL2) had little or no effect on these enzymes. Inhibition of either enzyme in this pathway blocks cholesterol biosynthesis, as well as farnesylation and geranylgeranylation. We recently showed that only geranylgeraniol (GGOH) prevented the effects of ALN on bone resorption (pit formation) in vitro (4Fisher J.E. Rogers M.J. Halasy J.M. Luckman S.P. Hughes D.E.

The final outcome of BP action appears to be osteoclast apoptosis, which was suggested to be the means by which BPs inhibit bone resorption (10Hughes D.E. Wright K.R. Uy H.L. Sasaki A. Yoneda T.

However, macrophages may not fully mimic osteoclast responses to bisphosphonates, since apoptosis in these cells is blocked by addition of either farnesyl diphosphate or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (3Luckman S.P.

Recent evidence suggests that Mammalian Sterile 20-like (Mst) kinase 1 is a substrate for caspase 3 in several hematopoietic cells and can induce apoptosis in mesenchymal cell lines (13Graves J.D.

In this study we investigated the effect of several BPs on apoptosis and activation of signaling kinases in purified osteoclasts. BPs induced osteoclast apoptosis and activation of the 34-kDa Mst1 kinase by up to 13-fold, while reducing the activity of Mst1 (59 kDa) and Mst2 (60 kDa) kinases by up to 50%. Slight 34-kDa Mst2 kinase activity was also observed, and two other responsive kinases of 50 and 36 kDa remain unidentified. Induction of apoptosis by withdrawal of serum and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) elicited kinase responses similar to those produced by BPs, while staurosporine activated both full-length Mst and 34-kDa Mst1 kinase activities without altering the 50-kDa kinase activity. The findings indicate that BPs act directly on osteoclasts to induce caspase cleavage of Mst1, as a signaling intermediate in the induction of apoptosis, and suggest that geranylgeranylation is the upstream target of ALN and RIS in inducing apoptosis. Co-cultures of murine osteoblasts and marrow cells were prepared as described by Wesolowski et al. (16Wesolowski G. Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nagy R.M. Tezuka K. Tanaka H. Rodan G.A. Rodan S.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Bone marrow cells were harvested from 6-week-old male Balb/C mice by flushing the marrow spaces of freshly isolated long bones (tibiae and femora) with α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU and 100 μg/ml, respectively). Bone marrow cells were suspended in Oc medium: α-minimal essential medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10% v/v; HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 10 nm 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Bone marrow cells were then added to subconfluent monolayers of osteoblastic MB 1.8 cells and cultured for 6–7 days at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Co-cultures were first treated with type I collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. Suspended osteoblasts were gently aspirated, leaving a mixture enriched in prefusion Ocs and the remaining MB1.8 osteoblasts. All cells were released with EDTA (0.2 g/liter in PBS) for 20 min at 37 °C and then re-plated in Oc medium and cultured for an additional 3 days. Oc-forming cultures, generated as above in 24 well plates, were treated with type 1 collagenase at a concentration of 1 mg/ml (in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed twice with PBS and monitored under the microscope for complete removal of osteoblastic cells. Ocs were then maintained in Oc medium supplemented with M-CSF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 5 ng/ml. Ocs were treated with indicated compounds in the Oc medium for 18 h and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and with Hoechst nuclear (no. 33342; Sigma) stain as follows. Cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde (in PBS) and then rinsed with PBS. Cells were then stained with Fast Red Violet LB (Sigma) dissolved in TRAP buffer (sodium acetate (50 mm), sodium tartrate (30 mm), and Triton X-100 (0.1%), naphthol AS-MX phosphate (100 mg/ml), pH 5.0) for 10 min at 37 °C. After TRAP staining, nuclear staining was performed with 5 μg/ml Hoechst stain in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with water and stored in the dark at 4 °C. Total osteoclast number (i.e. TRAP (+) multinucleated cells ≥250 μm in diameter) in each well and the number of osteoclasts with pyknotic nuclei were quantitated microscopically using a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a 10× objective and an ultraviolet light source. Oc-forming cultures, generated as above in six-well plates, were treated with type XI collagenase (Sigma) in PBS to remove all osteoblasts, followed by EDTA to remove prefusion Ocs. Ocs (≥95% purity) were then maintained in Oc medium supplemented with M-CSF (5 ng/ml). Oc treatments began within 30 min of purification, except when a time course was initiated. For time courses, Ocs were purified simultaneously and later lysed simultaneously. Under these circumstances, treatments were started at indicated times prior to formation of lysates. After treatments, cells were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold β-glycerophosphate-HEPES buffered solution (β-HBS): 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), β-glycerophosphate (50 mm), EGTA (1 mm), NaCl (150 mm). Cells were washed again with β-HBS-I: β-HBS supplemented with leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), microcystin LR (1 μm), Na3VO4 (1 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Ocs were then lysed in β-HBS-I containing Triton X-100 (0.2%). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford reagent kit (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitations we used β-HBS-IP, which was β-HBS-I without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and instead supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma): 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (48 μg/ml), epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido (4-guanido)butane (1 μg/ml), bestatin (2.8 μg/ml), leupeptin (2.1 μg/ml (12.1 μg/ml final)), aprotinin (1 μg/ml (11 μg/ml final), pepstatin A (2.1 μg/ml), and 1,10-phenanthroline (20 μg/ml). Anti-Krs1 (Mst2) amino-terminal and anti-Krs2 (Mst1) amino-terminal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-Krs1+2 carboxyl-terminal antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) and anti-Krs1 carboxyl-terminal goat polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein lysates (50 μg) were diluted in 1 ml of ice-cold β-HBS-IP containing Tween 20 (0.05%) and then combined with primary anti-amino-terminal (3 μg) or anti-carboxyl-terminal (2 μg of each) Mst1 and/or Mst2 antibodies. Rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody (1 μl; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Aurora, OH) was added to increase binding to protein A-conjugated agarose beads (10 μl bead volume; Sigma). Lysate-antibody-bead mixtures were gently mixed overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times with ice-cold β-HBS-IP containing Tween 20 (0.05%) and the supplemental protease inhibitor mixture described above. Antibodies and antigen were released by suspending the beads in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and mixed vigorously at 37 °C in a Thermomixer (Brinkmann, Westbury, NY). Kinase assays were performed in the gel using methods based on Kameshita and Fujisawa (17Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and Gotoh et al. (18Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were cast with myelin basic protein (0.2 mg/ml) added prior to polymerization. Lanes were loaded with equivalent amounts of protein lysate (5–10 μg/lane) or the entirety of each immunoprecipitation, and then gels were electrophoresed. Gels were washed twice at room temperature with Buffer A: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6; 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol supplemented with isopropanol (20%), followed by two washes with Buffer A. Proteins were denatured with urea (6 m in Buffer A) at room temperature and renatured at 4 °C with urea at 3m, 1.5 m, and then 0.75 m (in Buffer A), followed by three washes with Buffer A containing Tween-20 (0.05%). Gels were then washed twice with Kinase Buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C. Similar, but weaker kinase activities were obtained when 20 mm MgCl2 was used instead of 5 mm MnCl2. Kinase reactions lasted 30 min at 30 °C using Kinase Buffer containing 0.02 mm ATP with ∼1000 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP. Kinase reactions were stopped and unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed with six washes using 5% trichloroacetic acid/1% NaPPi (w/v). Gels were then stained, destained, and dried using standard techniques. Gels were exposed to phosphorimaging screens and scanned and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Storm system and associated software (Sunnyvale, CA). N-BPs were shown to disrupt the cytoskeleton, abolish the ruffled border, and induce apoptosis in osteoclasts and macrophages (3Luckman S.P. Hughes D.E. Coxon F.P. Russell R.G.G. Rogers M.J. J.

Luckman S.P. Hughes D.E. Masarachia P.J. Wesolowski G. Russell R.G. Rodan G.A. Reszka A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), suggesting that geranylgeranyl diphosphate, an isoprenylation precursor derived from the mevalonate pathway or from GGOH, is rate-limiting for osteoclast activity. Geranylgeranylated G-proteins regulate cytoskeletal organization, vesicular trafficking, and apoptosis (20Sebti S. Hamilton A.D. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1997; 9: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Focusing on the latter, we examined the effects of GGOH and of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK on ALN-, RIS-, CL2-, and EHDP-induced apoptosis in purified Ocs. Ocs were identified by TRAP staining as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and apoptosis in these cells was scored based on the presence of pyknotic nuclei. This method correlated with TUNEL staining in this system (data not shown). Base-line apoptosis in untreated Ocs maintained for 18 h was 9%. Typically, nuclei were deployed in ringlike structures (Fig.1 A). Treatment with ALN (30 μm) for 18 h increased the number of cells with nuclear condensation (apoptosis) by 3-fold (Fig.1, B and E). RIS (30 μm) produced similar effects (Fig. 1 E). Both GGOH (Fig. 1, Cand E) and Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 1, D and E) prevented ALN- or RIS-induced apoptosis, reducing the number of cells with condensed nuclei to control levels. However, while GGOH prevented both nuclear condensation and disappearance of the ringlike structure in N-BP-treated Ocs, Z-VAD-FMK-treated cells showed normal nuclear morphology without the ringlike arrangement. Instead, these nuclei were clustered in one or more regions of the osteoclast. Apoptosis induced by CL2 and EHDP was also suppressed by Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 1 E) but was not affected by GGOH. Apoptosis induced by the withdrawal of M-CSF was also prevented by Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 1 E). Several geranylgeranylated proteins, including members of the Ras family of small GTPases, activate signaling pathways and control apoptosis through their regulation of protein kinases. We assessed kinase activity in purified murine Oc-like cells obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In-gel kinase assays of Oc lysates (Fig. 2) showed that treatment with ALN (panel A), PAM (panel B), RIS (panel C), or CL2 (panel D) for 12–20 h (treatment times are indicated above each lane) increased the activity of 34- and 36-kDa kinases 5–13-fold when compared with untreated controls (0 h) or to osteoclasts treated for 1–2 h, respectively. After 16 h, 50-, 59-, and 60-kDa kinases showed decreases in activity of up to 50% (most notable in Figs. 2 D and 3). ALN and RIS triggered these kinase responses at 10–100 μm. At 30 μm, RIS (Fig. 2 C) elicited a slightly higher activation of the 34- and 36-kDa kinases than ALN (Fig. 2 A). PAM had no effect at 10 or 30 μm, was slightly effective at 60 μm (data not shown), while 100 μm PAM (Fig. 2 B) elicited about the same response as 30 μm ALN (Fig. 2 A) or RIS (Fig. 2 C). However, at 100 μm, PAM-treated cultures also showed the accumulation of debris in the medium, which was not observed with ALN or RIS. Treatment with EHDP (300 μm; Fig. 2 E) for 2–24 h activated the 34-kDa kinase less than 2-fold and there was no effect on kinases migrating at 36, 50, 59, or 60 kDa. In many experiments, EHDP elicited no response at all (data not shown). Tiludronate up to 300 μm did not significantly alter kinase activities (data not shown).Figure 3Alendronate-activated 34-kDa kinase is immunoprecipitated by anti-Mst1 kinase antibodies. Ocs were prepared as described in Fig. 2. Osteoclasts were left untreated (lanes 1, 3, 5,7, and 9) or were treated with 30 μm ALN (lanes 2, 4,6, 8, and 10) for 21 h prior to the preparation of protein lysates. In-gel kinase assays were used to analyze kinase activities in crude lysates (lanes 1 and 2) and in the following immunoprecipitates: anti-Mst1 amino-terminal (lanes 3 and4), anti-Mst2 amino-terminal (lanes 5and 6), anti-Mst1 and -Mst2 carboxyl-terminal (lanes 7 and 8) and rabbit-anti goat IgG control (lanes 9 and 10). Radioactive bands were visualized by phosphorimaging. Molecular mass markers (in kDa) are indicated to the right. The identity of Mst1 (59 kDa), Mst2 (60 kDa), and cleaved Mst1 (34 kDa) are indicated to the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Oc cultures used in these experiments were 95% pure by cell count, suggesting that the BPs act directly on the osteoclast. Since Ocs in these populations are large and multinucleated, they may contribute ≥99% of the protein and kinase signals in these assays. To examine the potential contribution of kinase signals from the minor population of contaminating osteoblasts, we examined kinase responses to ALN in pure MB1.8 osteoblast cultures (Fig. 2 F). Untreated MB1.8 osteoblasts show a different kinase profile than Oc controls; the 60-kDa kinase in untreated MB1.8 cells appears to migrate as a single band, and the 50-kDa kinase is a more distinct doublet (panel E, lane 1). Additional kinase activity is observed at 43 kDa, possibly corresponding to ERK1, ERK2, or p38 kinases, while no activity was observed at 34 or 36 kDa. After treatment with ALN (30 μm) for 2–24 h, no changes in kinase activity were observed, indicating that the responses to BPs described above occurred in the Ocs. To identify the kinases that respond to BPs in the osteoclast, we used antibodies against kinases with molecular masses in the observed range and assayed immunoprecipitates using in-gel kinase assay. The kinases activated by ALN (Fig. 3) and other BPs (data not shown) were only immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Mst1 or Mst2, also know as kinase responsive to stress (Krs) 2 and 1, respectively. Antibodies directed to the amino terminus of either Mst1 (Fig. 3, lanes 3 (control) and 4(ALN)) or Mst2 (lanes 5 (control) and6 (ALN)) immunoprecipitated both kinases in the 59-kDa (Mst1)/60-kDa (Mst2) doublet in Oc lysates of control and ALN-treated cells. Mst1:Mst1 dimerization has been described and involves a carboxyl-terminal domain that is conserved in Mst2 (22Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Consistent with the formation of Mst1:Mst2 heterodimers, either type of antibody precipitated both Mst1 and Mst2. Anti-Mst1 immunoprecipitated Mst1 to a greater extent than Mst2, and vice versa. This is explained by assuming random association, where anti-Mst1 precipitates Mst1:Mst1, Mst1:Mst2, and Mst2:Mst1, but not Mst2:Mst2 (yielding a 2:1 ratio), while anti-Mst2 will give a similar ratio favoring Mst2. Although bands were not separated sufficiently for quantitation, the data are consistent with this ratio. Immunodepletion with a mixture of both anti-Mst1 and Mst2 antibodies removed >95% of all kinase activity migrating at 59/60 kDa, suggesting that this activity doublet was comprised primarily of these kinases (data not shown). Several studies have recently described an apoptosis response, associated with caspase cleavage of the 59-kDa Mst1 and Mst2 kinases to form catalytically active species migrating at 34–36 kDa (13Graves J.D.

Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase cleavage of Mst1 occurs at the DEMD sequence (residues 323–326), while Mst2 is cleaved at DELD (residues 319–322). The catalytically active 34-kDa kinase domain is readily immunoprecipitated using antibodies directed only to the Mst amino terminus (13Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K.M. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Anti-Mst1 amino-terminal antibody (Fig. 3, lanes 3 (control) and 4 (ALN)) immunoprecipitated the 34-kDa kinase activated by the BPs in the osteoclast, while anti-Mst2 was much less effective (lanes 5 and6). This suggested that the 34-kDa kinase activated by BPs was predominantly the amino-terminal fragment of Mst1. Antibodies directed to the non-catalytic carboxyl-terminal domain of Mst1 and Mst2 immunoprecipitated only the full-length Mst1 and Mst2 isoforms from both untreated (lane 7) and ALN-treated (lane 8) osteoclast lysates. To determine whether the 34-kDa Mst1 kinase was generated as a result of caspase activities, purified Ocs were treated with ALN (Fig.4, lanes 4–6), RIS (lanes 7–9), or CL2 (lanes 10–12) in the absence or presence of the caspase inhibitors: Z-VAD-FMK (lanes 5, 8, and11) or Z-DEVD-FMK (lanes 6,9, and 12). Kinase activity of 34-kDa Mst1 was reduced by either caspase inhibitor, relative to cells treated with ALN, RIS, or CL2, alone (lanes 4, 7, and 10, respectively). These data suggest that BP-induced activation of the 34-kDa species resulted from caspase cleavage of full-length Mst1. In the absence of BP treatment, both caspase inhibitors reduced base-line 34-kDa Mst1 activities (lanes 2 and 3) relative to control (lane 1). The findings indicate that the activity migrating at 36-kDa kinase was also caspase-dependent, although the identity of this kinase remains to be determined. Analyses of p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase using GST-ATF2 as a kinase substrate for in-gel kinase assays and using phosphospecific antibodies to probe immunoblots showed that these kinases were not activated in osteoclasts treated with ALN (data not shown). Recent studies suggest that ALN and other N-BPs act on the Oc by inhibiting protein geranylgeranylation, related to their inhibition of the mevalonate pathway (4Fisher J.E. Rogers M.J. Halasy J.M. Luckman S.P. Hughes D.E. Masarachia P.J. Wesolowski G. Russell R.G. Rodan G.A. Reszka A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 5van Beek E. Pieterman E. Cohen L. Löwik C. Papapoulos S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To examine if inhibition of the mevalonate pathway is sufficient to induce caspase cleavage of Mst1 kinase, osteoclast cultures were treated with the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin (LOV) for 2–24 h. In-gel kinase assays (Fig.5 A) showed that, like N-BPs (Fig. 2), LOV induced 34-kDa Mst1 and 36-kDa kinases and decreased Mst1, Mst2, and 50-kDa kinase activities. The profile of these responses was similar to that of ALN, PAM, and RIS (Fig. 2,A–C, respectively) indicating that inhibition of the mevalonate pathway can induce Mst1 kinase cleavage in these cells. Recent studies showed that induction of apoptosis in J774 macrophages by N-BPs or statins was blocked by the addition of either geranylgeranyl or farnesyl precursors (3Luckman S.P. Hughes D.E.

This is consistent with FPP synthase as the target for N-BP action but does not separate between geranylgeranylation and farnesylation as rate-limiting targets in N-BP action on the Oc.

Increase in 34-kDa Mst1 activity with either BP or LOV was blocked by GGOH but not by farnesol, although a partial reduction in 34-kDa kinase activity was seen in the presence of farnesol in some experiments (data not shown and Ref. 4Fisher J.E.

Although Akt stimulates survival by phosphorylating Bad at Ser136, Akt is not able to phosphorylate Bad at Ser112, suggesting the existence of additional pathways regulating Bad phosphorylation at Ser112 (12Datta S.R.

Protein kinase A localized to the mitochondrial membrane has been recently shown to phosphorylate Bad at Ser112 (14Harada H. Becknell B. Wilm M. Mann M. Huang L.J. Taylor S.S. Scott J.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), and the calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin can induce apoptosis by dephosphorylating Bad at Ser112 and Ser136 (15Wang H.-G.

Drugs such as TPA or bryostatin that activate protein kinase C (PKC) are also able to promote cell survival and protect against cell death (16Lucas M. Sanchez-Margalet V. Gen.

For example, TPA rescues immune cells from glucocorticoid-induced cell death and can rescue cells from growth factor withdrawal (16Lucas M. Sanchez-Margalet V. Gen.

Similarly, agents that inhibit PKC such as staurosporin or UCN-01 are known to be potent inducers of apoptosis (20Jarvis W.D. Turner A.J. Povirk L.F. Traylor R.S. Grant S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1707-1714PubMed Google Scholar, 21Couldwell W.T. Hinton D.R. He S. Chen T.C. Sebat I. Weiss M.H. Law R.E.

Furthermore, tumor cell sensitivity to anti-metabolites such as araC is greatly enhanced by disruption of the PKC pathway (23Whitman S.P. Civoli F. Daniel L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23481-23484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and has been traced to post-translational changes in the Bcl-2 checkpoint molecules (24Murata M. Nagai M. Fujita M. Ohmori M. Takahara J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that certain PKC isoforms may act to deliver survival signals that protect against cell death. However, the targets of PKC that protect against cell death remain largely unknown. One downstream target of PKC is the serine/threonine kinase p90RSK, also referred to as RSK-1, which contains two distinct kinase domains within a single polypeptide (26Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This enzyme is activated by TPA and functions downstream of p42/44MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) in the MAP kinase signaling cascade (27Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of p90RSK coincides with oncogenic transformation (28Erikson E. Stefanovic D. Blenis J. Erikson R.L. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3147-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), stimulation of G0/G1transition (29Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9803-9810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the few identified physiological substrates of this enzyme is the transcription factor CREB (33Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). TPA activates p90RSK by phosphorylation at several sites located within the activation loop of the C-terminal kinase domain (34Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at the C-terminal activation loop leads to phosphorylation and activation of the N-terminal kinase domain, which in turn phosphorylates downstream targets such as CREB (34Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To date the role of p90RSK in regulating cell survival has not been studied directly. Here we demonstrate that TPA, an activator of classical and novel protein kinase C isoforms, protects cells against Bad-mediated cell death and also stimulates phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112. Inhibitors of PKC block Bad phosphorylation, suggesting that PKC might directly phosphorylate Bad; however, in our hands, we have been unable to detect significant in vitro phosphorylation of Bad by several different conventional and novel PKC isoforms, suggesting that PKC activates a downstream Bad kinase. We demonstrate that TPA activates p90RSK in a PKC-dependent fashion and that in vitro p90RSK can directly phosphorylate Bad at Ser112. Overexpression of p90RSK in HEK293 cells stimulates Bad phosphorylation at Ser112. Furthermore, treatment of HEK293 cells with TPA or overexpression of p90RSK suppresses Bad-mediated cell death. These results suggest that the effects of phorbol ester and PKC on cell survival act via a pathway involving a p90RSK-dependent phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112. Our results suggest that the PKC/p90RSK pathway may play an important role in regulating cell death decisions at the Bcl-xL checkpoint via phosphorylation and inactivation of Bad. Forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, TPA, fetal calf serum, and mammalian cell culture media were from Sigma. Phosphorylation state-specific Bad antibodies (Ser112) and (Ser136) and control Bad antibodies were from New England Biolabs. p90RSK-specific monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. RSK-2- and RSK-3-specific antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). MEK protein kinase inhibitor PD98059 and protein kinase A were from New England Biolabs, and SB203580 was kindly provided by John Lee and Peter Young. PKC inhibitors GO6983, GO6976, and bisindolymaleimide, wortmannin, LY294002, and rapamycin were from Calbiochem; bryostatin was from Alexis; β-galactosidase stain kit was from Invitrogen; and in situ cell death detection kit for the TUNEL assay was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The Phototope-HRP Chemiluminescent Western Detection Kit was from New England Biolabs. HEK293 cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse serum. COS1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. The GST-Bad mammalian expression vector was constructed by fusion of the complete coding sequence of Bad amplified from a mouse brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) and cloned into theBamHI/NotI sites of eukaryotic expression vector pEBG. pEBG expresses an amino-terminal GST fusion of the cloned gene under the control of the strong, constitutively active human EF-1 α promoter (63Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). GST-Bad S112A, S136A, and S112A/S136A mammalian expression vectors were constructed by transferringBbgI/AfeI fragments from pCMVBadS112A, pCMVBadS136A, and pCMVBadS112A/S136A (obtained from Stanley Korsmeyer) into a GST-Bad mammalian expression vector. Maltose-binding protein (MBP)/14-3-3 δ and ε were kindly provided by Michael Yaffe and Lewis Cantley. pMT2-p90RSK was provided by Joseph Avruch, and pMT2RSK2 and pMT2RSK3 were provided by Christian Bjorbaek. The anti-phospho-Bad (Ser112) and anti-phospho-Bad (Ser136) antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with synthetic phosphopeptides covalently coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The presence of phosphospecific immunoreactivity was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using both the phosphorylated and the nonphosphorylated peptides. After purification of IgG using protein A-agarose, the phosphopeptide-specific antibodies were purified by first passing IgG over immobilized, nonphosphorylated peptide, to remove antibodies reactive with the nonphosphorylated epitopes. The nonabsorbed fraction was then passed over a column of immobilized phosphopeptide. After extensive washing, the retained immunoglobulins were eluted at low pH, rapidly neutralized, dialyzed, and concentrated. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells was performed as described previously (35Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) with various amounts of expression plasmid as described in the figure legends. The total amount of DNA transfected was maintained at 20 μg with pGEM3. Following calcium phosphate transfections, cells were glycerol-shocked and incubated for 24 h in media containing 10% fetal calf serum and for 18 h without serum. Cells were treated with 200 nm TPA for the indicated times. MBP-14-3-3 proteins bound to maltose beads were mixed with extracts prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with Bad expression vectors and treated with or without TPA and lysed in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C; beads were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline; and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer for Western analysis. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.15 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue). Extracts from 105 cells (20 μl) were fractionated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature; incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C; incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature; and finally visualized using the Phototope-HRP Chemiluminescent Western Detection Kit. p90RSK activity was detected by immunoprecipitation of p90RSK from HEK293 cell extracts. HEK293 cells were pretreated with different inhibitors for 1 h and then treated with 200 nm TPA for 30 min. Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Extracts from 5 × 105 cells were incubated with p90RSKantibody overnight and with protein A beads for 3 h at 4 °C by gentle rocking. Immunocomplexed beads were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm β-Glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmMgCl2). Immunocomplexes were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of GST-Bad protein or MBP-Bad and Bad mutation and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Kinase reactions were terminated with SDS sample buffer, and Bad phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting. Wild-type and mutant peptides spanning Bad amino acid sequences from 106 to 141 were chemically synthesized with a cysteine added to the N terminus of each peptide. Phosphopeptides were synthesized by incorporating phosphorylated serine at position 112 or 136. Mutant peptides were synthesized with the following changes: Ser112 changed to Ala, Ser136 changed to Ala, or the double mutant where both Ser112 and Ser136 were changed to Ala. Fusion proteins were prepared by incubating each peptide with bacterially expressed MBP-paramyosin isolated and purified using the IMPACT protein expression system (New England Biolabs) using the Mxe GyrA intein as described by Evans et al. (36Evans J. T.C. Benner J. Xu M.-Q. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2256-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Following the peptide ligation reaction, MBP fusion proteins were purified away from free peptides by binding to maltose beads. HEK293 cells were transfected with pCMVBad, plus or minus p90RSK. 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 18 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min, blocked with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate. After extensive washing, cells were incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and fluorescein-labeled nucleotide mixture for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 30 min, washed, and then developed with 3′3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride solution. After transfection and treatment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 10 min at room temperature. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml X-Gal inN,N-dimethylformamide, 4 mm potassium ferricyanide, 4 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mmMgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline buffer for 24 h. Blue color-containing cells were examined under a microscope. Phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (37Czernik A.J. Girault J.A. Nairn A.C. Chen J. Snyder G. Kebabian J. Greengard P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 264-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) directed against Ser112 and Ser136 of Bad were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The antibodies were shown to be highly specific for the phosphorylated epitope by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and by Western blotting using phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated GST-Bad protein (data not shown). To further characterize antibody site specificity, a series of MBP-Bad fusion proteins was constructed by ligating to the C terminus of MBP chemically synthesized Bad peptides or Bad peptides phosphorylated at Ser112, Ser136, or both sites (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 36Evans J. T.C. Benner J. Xu M.-Q. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2256-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, phospho-Bad Ser112 antibody only recognizes MBP-Bad fusion protein when phosphorylated at Ser112 or Ser112 and Ser136, whereas phospho-Bad Ser136 antibody only recognizes MBP-Bad fusion protein when phosphorylated at Ser136 or Ser112 and Ser136. These results demonstrate a high degree of specificity for both antibodies to their specific phosphoserine residues. We next examined antibody specificity in vivo. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type GST-Bad or GST-Bad S112A, S136A, or S112A/S136A mutants. Cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted using phosphospecific antibodies directed against Bad Ser112 (Fig. 1 B, top) or Bad antibody (Fig. 1 B, bottom). Treatment of HEK293 cells with TPA increased the phosphorylation of wild-type GST-Bad at Ser112. Mutation of Ser112 to Ala blocked the TPA-induced immunoreactivity. Mutation of Ser136 to Ala did not block TPA-induced Ser112 phosphorylation, demonstrating the site specificity of the phospho-Bad Ser112 antibodies. Wild-type and mutant GST-Bad proteins were expressed at similar levels as determined using Bad antibody (Fig. 1 B,bottom). We next explored other agents that might also stimulate phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112 using the phosphospecific Bad Ser112 antibody. Treatment of GST-Bad transfected HEK293 cells with TPA or epidermal growth factor produced the largest induction of GST-Bad phosphorylation at Ser112. Forskolin, UV irradiation, and platelet-derived growth factor also reproducibly stimulated phosphorylation at Ser112 (Fig.2 A). TPA rapidly induced a sustained phosphorylation of Bad, evident within 5 min of treatment, that remained elevated 8 h after treatment (Fig. 2 B). Bryostatin, another activator of PKC, as well as TPA induced endogenous Bad Ser112 phosphorylation in COS1 cells (Fig.2 C). Since phorbol esters are known to activate classical and novel PKC isoforms as well as several other growth-associated pathways including the MAP kinase cascade, we next used selective inhibitors to determine the role of several different intracellular signal transduction pathways on Bad phosphorylation at Ser112. Treatment of HEK293 cells with rapamycin (a selective mTOR/FRAP inhibitor) or two different PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, had no effect on TPA-stimulated Bad phosphorylation. Inhibitors of MEK and the MAPK cascade (PD98059), or p38 MAPK (SB203580) had very small effects on TPA-stimulated Bad phosphorylation at Ser112 (Fig.3 A). We next examined the ability of several different PKC inhibitors to block TPA-stimulated Bad phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). Bisindolymaleimide I (also known as GF 109203X or GO6850) is a potent inhibitor of PKCα, -β1, -β2, -γ, -δ, and -ε isoforms. 10 nm bisindolymaleimide I partially blocked, while 100 nm completely blocked, TPA-induced Bad phosphorylation at Ser112. Furthermore, 1 μm bisindolymaleimide I reduced phosphorylation at Ser112 to below basal levels (Fig. 3 B), suggesting an effect on basal Bad phosphorylation. Treatment of HEK293 cells with 100 nmGO6983, a potent inhibitor of PKCα, -β, -γ, and -δ isoforms, also blocked TPA-stimulated Bad phosphorylation. Significantly, treatment with GO6976 had little or no effect on TPA-stimulated Ser112 phosphorylation until concentrations of 1 μm were reached. This inhibitor has been reported to selectively inhibit Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms α, and β1, but to have no effect on the Ca2+-independent isoforms ε and δ (38Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The potent inhibition by bisindolymaleimide I and the inability of GO6976 to block TPA-mediated signaling to Bad suggest a role for the Ca2+-independent, novel PKC isoforms. We next sought to identify the TPA-activated protein kinase phosphorylating Bad at Ser112. Since both TPA and bryostatin induce Bad phosphorylation and PKC inhibitors block Bad phosphorylation, we first tested the ability of various PKC isoforms to directly phosphorylate Bad at Ser112. Several different conventional (α, β1, β2, γ), novel (ε, δ), and atypical (ζ) PKC isoforms were tested for their ability to phosphorylate Badin vitro. Surprisingly, although the PKC isoforms were able to phosphorylate various control proteins and peptides, all of the isoforms tested were unable to phosphorylate Bad at Ser112(data not shown). This result suggested that PKC may activate a downstream protein kinase that in turn phosphorylates Bad at Ser112. The role of p90RSK was next investigated, since this protein kinase is activated by TPA downstream of PKC (39Grove R. Price D.J. Banerjee P. Balasubramanyam A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7727-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of p90RSK in vitro is reported to be consistent with the RXXS motif in which Bad Ser112 is found (28Erikson E. Stefanovic D. Blenis J. Erikson R.L. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3147-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To test whether p90RSKcould phosphorylate Bad at Ser112, p90RSK was immunoprecipitated from mock- or TPA-treated HEK293 cells using a p90RSK-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed using wild-type and mutant MBP-Bad fusion proteins as substrates, and Bad phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting using a phospho-Bad Ser112 antibody (Fig.4 A). TPA stimulated p90RSK kinase activity that phosphorylated wild-type Bad and the Bad S136A mutant but not the S112A and S112A/S136A mutants. Immunocomplexes were also incubated in a kinase assay using recombinant GST-Bad fusion protein as substrate, and Bad phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting using phospho-Bad Ser112 (Fig.4 B, top) and phospho-Bad Ser136 (Fig.4 B, bottom) antibodies. As shown in Fig.4 B, TPA stimulates the ability of p90RSK to phosphorylate recombinant GST-Bad at Ser112 but not at Ser136. These results suggest that in vitrop90RSK phosphorylates Bad at Ser112 but not significantly at Ser136. We next reasoned that if p90RSK was downstream of PKC on a pathway leading to Bad phosphorylation at Ser112, then p90RSK activity should show a profile of inhibitor sensitivity similar to that observed for Bad Ser112phosphorylation. To test this, we examined the sensitivity of p90RSK kinase activity to 20 μm PD98059, 100 nm GO6983, 100 nm GO6976, or 100 nmbisindolymaleimide I by pretreating cells for 1 h with each inhibitor. Following a 30-min TPA treatment, cell extracts were prepared, p90RSK was immunoprecipitated, and kinase activity was determined as described above. As observed for Bad Ser112 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A), pretreatment with either GO6983 or bisindolymaleimide I blocked p90RSKactivity (Fig. 4 B). Pretreatment with PD98059 and GO6976 resulted in little or no effect on p90RSK activity, in good agreement with their effects on Bad Ser112 phosphorylation (compare Fig. 3 A with Fig. 4 B). To exclude the possibility that these inhibitors block p90RSK activity directly, p90RSK was immunoprecipitated from TPA-treated HEK293 cell extracts, and immunocomplexes were preincubated in the presence of 20 μm PD98059 and 1 μm of each of the three different PKC inhibitors (GO6983, GO6976, or bisindolymaleimide I) in vitro for 1 h at 37 °C. Kinase assays were then carried out using GST-Bad as substrate. As shown in Fig. 4 C, even a 10-fold increase over the concentrations of GO6983 and bisindolymaleimide I required to block p90RSK activity in vivo had no effect on p90RSK activity in vitro (Fig. 4, compareC with B), indicating that these compounds are not directly inhibiting p90RSK activity. We next examined the ability of p90RSK to stimulate Bad phosphorylation at Ser112 when overexpressed by transfection. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding pMT2-p90RSK and GST-Bad or encoding GST-Bad S112A, S136A, and S112A/S136A mutants; 24 h after transfection, cells were grown in the medium without serum for a further 18 h and then treated with TPA for 30 min before harvesting. Cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting using phospho-Bad Ser112 antibody. Overexpression of p90RSK induced Bad phosphorylation at Ser112 in the absence of TPA treatment, suggesting that overexpressed p90RSK is at least partially active in the absence of TPA (Fig. 4 D, lane 4). Bad Ser112 phosphorylation was further stimulated by TPA in cells transfected with p90RSK (Fig. 4 D,lane 5). Mutation of Bad Ser112 to Ala, but not Ser136 to Ala, blocks p90RSK-induced phosphorylation. We further investigated the role of other RSK family members on Bad Ser112 phosphorylation. RSK-2 and RSK-3 were immunoprecipitated from mock-, T"
https://openalex.org/W2105248147,"Activity of the sympathetic nervous system is an important factor involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and associated metabolic and vascular abnormalities. In this study, we investigate the molecular basis of cross-talk between β3-adrenergic and insulin signaling systems in mouse brown adipocytes immortalized by SV40 T infection. Insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and IRS-2 was reduced by prestimulation of β3-adrenergic receptors (CL316243). Similarly, insulin-induced IRS-1-associated and phosphotyrosine-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity, but not IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity, was reduced by β3-adrenergic prestimulation. Furthermore, insulin-stimulated activation of Akt, but not mitogen-activated protein kinase, was diminished. Insulin-induced glucose uptake was completely inhibited by β3-adrenergic prestimulation. These effects appear to be protein kinase A-dependent. Furthermore inhibition of protein kinase C restored the β3-receptor-mediated reductions in insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity. Together, these findings indicate cross-talk between adrenergic and insulin signaling pathways. This interaction is protein kinase A-dependent and, at least in part, protein kinase C-dependent, and could play an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance associated with sympathetic overactivity and regulation of brown fat metabolism. Activity of the sympathetic nervous system is an important factor involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and associated metabolic and vascular abnormalities. In this study, we investigate the molecular basis of cross-talk between β3-adrenergic and insulin signaling systems in mouse brown adipocytes immortalized by SV40 T infection. Insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and IRS-2 was reduced by prestimulation of β3-adrenergic receptors (CL316243). Similarly, insulin-induced IRS-1-associated and phosphotyrosine-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity, but not IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity, was reduced by β3-adrenergic prestimulation. Furthermore, insulin-stimulated activation of Akt, but not mitogen-activated protein kinase, was diminished. Insulin-induced glucose uptake was completely inhibited by β3-adrenergic prestimulation. These effects appear to be protein kinase A-dependent. Furthermore inhibition of protein kinase C restored the β3-receptor-mediated reductions in insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity. Together, these findings indicate cross-talk between adrenergic and insulin signaling pathways. This interaction is protein kinase A-dependent and, at least in part, protein kinase C-dependent, and could play an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance associated with sympathetic overactivity and regulation of brown fat metabolism. brown adipose tissue insulin receptor substrate mitogen-activated protein kinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein kinase A protein kinase C uncoupling protein-1 fetal bovine serum bovine serum albumin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate The sympathetic nervous system has long been recognized to play an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and associated metabolic and vascular abnormalities, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (for a recent review see Ref. 1Reaven G.M.

At a molecular level, insulin has been shown to phosphorylate tyrosyl residues in the C terminus of the β2-adrenergic receptor (2Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

To investigate the cross-talk between the insulin and adrenergic signaling systems, we have utilized brown adipocytes. These provide an attractive cell model for several reasons. Brown adipose tissue (BAT)1 is highly regulated by the sympathetic nervous system and expresses different subtypes of adrenergic receptors (8Rehnmark S. Nechad M. Herron D. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16464-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Puigserver P. Pico C. Stock M.J. Palou A. Mol. Cell.

BAT is important in controlling energy balance in rodents by its capacity to uncouple mitochondrial respiration, a process mediated by the expression of the uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) (for recent review see Ref. 13Lowell B.B. Flier J.S. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar and references therein). And finally, BAT is an insulin-sensitive tissue and contains the main elements of the insulin signaling system (14Porras A. Alvarez A.M. Valladares A. Benito M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 825-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Pons S. White M.F. Benito M. Mol.

Thus, in the cells binding of insulin to its receptor leads to activation of the receptor kinase and tyrosine phosphorylation of several insulin receptor substrates (IRS) including IRS-1 and IRS-2. These, in turn, interact with Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), Grb2, SHP2, and others. Activation of PI 3-kinase leads to activation of the main downstream effector Akt and stimulation of glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and protein synthesis. Association of IRS proteins with Grb2 leads to recruitment of SOS and RAS and results in activation of the MAP kinase pathway, a major regulatory pathway for gene expression (for recent reviews see Refs. 18Kahn C.R.

In this study, we present a cell model of immortalized brown adipocytes and demonstrate molecular evidence for divergent β3-adrenoreceptor-mediated alterations at multiple levels of the insulin signaling system, including glucose uptake as a final biological end point.

(New York), adenosine deaminase and collagenase from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, phosphoinositol from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), thin layer chromatography plates from VWR (Bridgeport, NJ), nitrocellulose from Schleicher & Schuell, membranes for Northern blotting from Micron Separations, Inc. (Westborough, MA), and electrophoresis supplies from Bio-Rad. The β3-receptor agonist CL316243 was kindly provided by Dr. Kurt Steiner (Wyeth Ayerst Research, Princeton, NJ). Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting included the following: anti-UCP-1 (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX), anti-IRS-1 (raised in rabbit against C terminus), anti-IRS-2 (raised in rabbit against PH domain and C terminus), antiphosphotyrosine 4G10 (kindly provided by Dr. Morris White, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA), anti-insulin receptor (kindly provided by Dr. Bentley Cheatham, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA), polyclonal anti-PI 3-kinase p85 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), antiphosphospecific MAP kinase, antiphosphospecific Akt (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and anti-Akt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Protein A-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and the PKC assay system was from Promega (Madison, WI). Penicillin/streptomycin and the PKA assay system were from Life Technologies, Inc.; forskolin, the PKC inhibitors GF109203X and Ro-31–8245 were from Calbiochem; 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose and [γ-32P]ATP were from NEN Life Science Products, and 125I-protein A was supplied by ICN Biochemicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). All other supplies were from Sigma. Interscapular brown adipose tissue was isolated from newborn FVB mice (Taconic), minced, and subjected to collagenase digestion (2 mg of collagenase in 2 ml of isolation buffer containing 0.123 m NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, 100 mm Hepes, and 4% BSA) for 30 min. The digested tissue was filtered through a 100-μm nylon screen. Collected cells were centrifuged (200 × g) for 5 min. The pellet consisting of precursor cells was washed once in isolation buffer and centrifuged again. Cells were resuspended in 2 ml of culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 25 mm glucose, 20% FBS, 20 mm Hepes, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin), seeded on two 35-mm plates, and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The medium was changed every day. After reaching 80% confluence, cells were passed to 10-cm plates and infected with the puromycin resistance retroviral vector pBabe encoding SV40 T antigen (kindly provided by Dr. J. DeCaprio, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston) for 24 h. Following infection, the brown adipose precursor cells were maintained in culture medium for 72 h and then subjected to selection with puromycin (1 μg/ml) for at least 3 weeks. For differentiation, selected preadipocytes were grown to confluence in culture medium supplemented with 20 nm insulin and 1 nm T3 (differentiation medium). Confluent cells were incubated for 24 h in differentiation medium further supplemented with 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.5 μmdexamethasone, and 0.125 mm indomethacin (induction medium). Subsequently, the cells were maintained in differentiation medium for 4–5 days until exhibiting a fully differentiated phenotype with massive accumulation of multilocular fat droplets. Experiments were carried out after starving the cells in serum-free medium for 16–18 h. Unless indicated otherwise, cells were pretreated for 30 min with adenosine deaminase (2 units/ml), followed by the β3-adrenergic agent for 30 min, and then stimulated with insulin for 5 min. All experiments were performed within 20 passages following immortalization. At the end of the stimulation period, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, 137 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Igepal CA-630, 2 mm vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The fat cake was removed with cotton-tipped applicators, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Protein amount was determined by the Bradford method (22Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using BSA as standard, and the dye reagent concentrate was from Bio-Rad. Equal amounts of protein (100 μg and 1 mg, respectively) were either directly solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (LSB) or immunoprecipitated for at least 2 h at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies. Immune complexes were collected by adding 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes in extraction buffer immunoprecipitates were solubilized in LSB. Lysates or immunoprecipitates were boiled for 2 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in TBS (10 mm Tris, 0.15 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.2) containing 3% BSA for 30 min, incubated with the respective antibodies for 2 h, washed 3 times for 5 min each in TBS, and incubated with 125I-protein A for 45 min. After three washes for 5 min each, the immunoblots were exposed on a PhosphorImager screen, and signals were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Cells were incubated with or without the indicated hormones in non-serum-containing DMEM with 25 mmglucose for the indicated periods, and lysates were obtained as described above. Supernatants containing 1 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibodies, and the immune complexes were collected by adding 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed twice with PBS containing 1% Igepal-CA 630, twice with 0.5 m LiCl, 0.1 mTris, pH 7.5, and twice in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Sepharose beads were resuspended in a mixture containing 50 μl of reaction buffer, 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, and 10 μl of phosphatidylinositol (2 μg/μl, previously dried under a gentle argon stream and resuspended in 10 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA by sonication at 4 °C). Reactions were initiated by addition of 5 μl of a solution containing 880 μm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, and 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (3.000 Ci/mmol) per tube. The reactions were stopped after 10 min by adding 20 μl of 8 n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3/methanol (1:1). After a brief centrifugation in a desktop centrifuge, 50 μl of the lower organic phase of each sample were spotted on a silica gel thin layer chromatography plate. The plate was developed in CHCl3/methanol/H2O/NH4OH (120:94:23:2.4), dried, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Protein kinase B/Akt assays were performed essentially as described (23Ueki K. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kaburagi Y. Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Komuro I. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5315-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates with anti-Akt antibody were washed and resuspended in 40 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μmATP, 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 μg Crosstide). After 20 min at 30 °C the reaction was stopped, and aliquots were spotted on squares of P-81 paper, washed, and counted by Cerenkov. Protein kinase A and C assays were done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis was performed according to standard techniques using denaturing formaldehyde-containing agarose gels (24Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 9.1-9.62Google Scholar). After stimulation with the indicated reagents for 4 h, total cellular RNA was isolated by using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX). 20 μg of RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels. Ethidium bromide staining of the gels confirmed equal loading and integrity of the RNA. RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Micron Separations, Inc., Westborough, MA), and blots were hybridized with 25 ng of a UCP-1-specific cDNA probe previously labeled by using a random prime labeling kit (Promega, Co., Madison, WI) for 2 h at 65 °C. Blots were washed once in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 20 min and once in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min. Membranes were allowed to air-dry and exposed on a PhosphorImager Screen followed by quantitation with a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Cells were assayed for glucose uptake essentially as described (25Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Reynet C. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23111-23116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Differentiated monolayers of brown adipocytes were pretreated with 2 units/ml adenosine deaminase for 30 min. Unless indicated otherwise, subsequent pretreatment with the β3-selective agonist CL316243 was for 30 min, before insulin was added for another 30 min. At the end of the stimulation period, cells were exposed to 50 μl of 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose (0.5 μCi/ml final concentration) for 3 min. The incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting of triplicate points. Results are indicated as mean ± S.E. for all data. Unpaired Student's t tests were used for analysis of differences between various cell treatments. pvalues <0.05 are considered significant and <0.01 highly significant. Brown fat precursor cells were isolated from interscapular brown fat of newborn mice and immortalized by SV40 T antigen infection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Preadipocytes showed a spindle-shaped morphology similar to fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A, top panel, left). Northern blot analysis revealed no detectable UCP-1 mRNA in brown fat precursor cells (data not shown), and no fat accumulation could be seen using the fat-specific Oil Red O staining (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel, left). Following differentiation with insulin, T3, indomethacin, isobutylmethylxanthine, and dexamethasone, confluent cells became smaller, rounded up, accumulated fat, and the cytoplasm/nucleus-ratio increased dramatically. Once fully differentiated, multilocular fat droplets could be detected both microscopically (Fig. 1 A, top panel, right) and by Oil Red O staining (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel, right). UCP-1 mRNA was expressed in the basal state and could be further increased by 3–4-fold upon β3-receptor-specific (CL316243) stimulation (Fig. 1 C). This was paralleled by changes in UCP-1 at the protein level (Fig. 1 D). An important functional characteristic of adipocytes, including brown adipocytes, is insulin-dependent glucose uptake. Insulin-induced glucose uptake in our cell lines was dose-responsive with a submaximal, approximately 6-fold increase at an insulin concentration of 10 nm (Fig. 1 B). For cross-talk experiments, we used a maximally stimulatory concentration of insulin of 100 nm, unless indicated otherwise. To investigate the molecular basis of an interaction between adrenergic and insulin signaling systems, we first assessed changes at proximal steps of the insulin signaling cascade. Insulin alone produced an approximately 10-fold increase in tyrosine autophosphorylation of the β-subunit of its receptor in differentiated brown adipocytes. This was diminished by 40% in β3-receptor agonist (CL316243)-pretreated brown adipocytes as compared with insulin treatment alone (Fig.2 A), a statistically highly significant reduction. Insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced in parallel by 45% when cells were pretreated with the CL316243 as compared with insulin treatment alone (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, the decrease in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 was reproducibly less and averaged only 28% under the same treatment conditions (Fig. 2 C). These alterations in insulin-mediated IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation were highly statistically significant. Treatment with the β3-adrenoreceptor agonist alone had no significant effect on the basal tyrosine phosphorylation neither of the insulin receptor nor of IRS-1 or IRS-2. A pivotal regulator for most of the metabolic actions of insulin is activation of the lipid kinase PI 3-kinase. This occurs by binding of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase to tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrates such as IRS-1 and IRS-2 with subsequent activation of the p110 catalytic subunit of the enzyme. By immunoprecipitating cell lysates with IRS-specific antibodies and immunoblotting with an antibody detecting the p85-subunit, we found that insulin treatment alone induced a 4-fold increase in p85 binding to IRS-1 as compared with the basal state. Activation of the β3-adrenergic receptor prior to insulin stimulation reduced the insulin-induced increase in p85 binding to IRS-1 by 45%. This alteration was highly statistically significant (Fig. 3 A, top panel). The association of IRS-2 with p85 was also increased 3-fold upon insulin treatment alone. However, in contrast to the changes seen with IRS-1, pretreatment with the β3-adrenoreceptor agonist resulted in only a 15% decrease in p85 binding to IRS-2, and this change did not reach the level of statistical significance (Fig. 3 B, top panel). Thus, β3-adrenergic stimulation reduced insulin receptor phosphorylation, IRS-1 phosphorylation, and p85 binding to IRS-1 about 40–45% but had a much smaller effect on IRS-2 phosphorylation and no significant effect on p85 docking to IRS-2. To determine the effects of these changes in p85 subunit binding, we performed in vitro PI 3-kinase assays on IRS-1- and IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity was strongly increased upon insulin treatment. β3-Agonist pretreatment prior to insulin stimulation led to a 40% decrease in activity as compared with insulin treatment alone (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). This change was statistically highly significant and paralleled the reduction in p85 binding. IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity was also strongly induced by insulin. However, pretreatment with the β3-receptor agonist did not result in a significant change of insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activity consistent with the lack of effect on p85 binding to this insulin receptor substrate (Fig. 3 B, bottom panel). As a parameter for the total insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activity, we performed PI 3-kinase activity assays in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. Again, insulin treatment alone induced a strong increase in PI 3-kinase activity. β3-Adrenergic prestimulation reduced this increase by 30% (p < 0.01) (Fig.4 A). β3-Adrenergic stimulation alone also significantly reduced the basal activity level, an effect less appreciated with the individual substrates (Fig. 4 A). PI 3-kinase mediates the activation of Akt, and this has been closely linked to glucose transport. By immunoblotting with a phospho-specific antibody to activated Akt, we found a 10-fold increase in phosphorylation of this enzyme over basal levels by insulin stimulation alone. Following β3-adrenergic prestimulation, the insulin-mediated Akt phosphorylation was reduced by 25% (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4 B). This decrease was accompanied by a 15% reduction in Akt kinase activity (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4 D). Phosphorylation of MAP kinase, another key regulator in insulin and growth factor signaling pathways, was also increased 5-fold by insulin stimulation alone, as determined by immunoblots using a phospho-specific antibody against the activated isoforms p42 and p44. Stimulation with the β3-adrenoreceptor agonist CL316243 alone also led to a small but significant increase in MAP kinase phosphorylation over the basal state. However, β3-adrenergic prestimulation did not further augment the insulin-mediated increase but tended to rather decrease it, although this change was not significant (p = 0.15) (Fig. 4 C). Gα subunits of β-adrenergic receptors activate membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase thereby increasing intracellular cAMP-levels which, in turn, activate protein kinase A (PKA). Indeed, pretreatment of brown adipocytes with dibutyryl cAMP and the adenylyl cyclase-activating compound forskolin could mimic the molecular changes observed with β3-adrenergic pretreatment (Fig.5). Insulin-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A), p85 binding to IRS-1 (Fig. 5 B), and IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 5 C) as well as insulin receptor, IRS-2, and Akt phosphorylation (data not shown) were decreased significantly after pretreating brown adipocytes with these compounds. Additionally, pretreatment of these cells with the specific PKA inhibitor H-89 could reverse the IRS-1-associated effects observed after CL316243 treatment (Fig. 5, A–C), as well as the changes in insulin receptor, IRS-2, and Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). Gα subunits of G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to activate PKC isoforms. To determine whether PKC might play a role in the signaling pathways responsible for the alterations observed, the influence of general PKC inhibition on the effects of β-adrenergic agents was studied using the general PKC inhibitors GF109203X and Ro-31-8425. The decrease in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 caused by β3-adrenergic prestimulation was restored by inhibition of PKC (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, the β3-adrenoreceptor-mediated reductions in insulin-induced IRS-1 binding to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity also were rescued by PKC inhibition (Fig. 6, B and C). PKC inhibition alone or in combination with insulin did not have significant effects on the basal or the insulin-stimulated levels of phosphorylation or p85 binding and associated PI 3-kinase activity (data not shown). The rescuing effect of PKC inhibition was specific for IRS-1. Inhibition of PKC did not result in significant changes in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor β-subunit, IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, p85 binding, or IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity after CL316243 treatment (data not shown). One of the major effects of insulin signaling is stimulation of glucose uptake. Insulin alone induced an approximately 6-fold increase in glucose uptake in these differentiated culture brown adipocytes. Pretreating cells with the β3-adrenoreceptor agonist CL316243 for only 5 min prior to insulin treatment reduced the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 55%. The inhibition became almost complete after 40 min of treatment with CL316243 (Fig. 7 A). The inhibitory effect of β3-adrenergic prestimulation on insulin-induced glucose uptake was dose-dependent. Pretreatment of cells with CL316243 at a concentration of 1 nm reduced the insulin-mediated glucose uptake by 50%, and insulin-induced glucose uptake was almost completely abolished at a concentration of 100 nm (Fig. 7 B). Treatment with 100 nm CL316243 alone did not have a significant effect on the basal level of glucose uptake. The inhibition of insulin-induced glucose uptake by β3-adrenergic prestimulation could be mimicked with dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin treatment (Fig. 7 C). Additionally, the decrease in insulin-induced glucose uptake after CL316243 pretreatment could be partially rescued by inhibition of PKA with H-89 (Fig. 7 C). In contrast, the PKC inhibitor GF109203X itself had a negative effect on insulin-induced glucose uptake and did not rescue glucose uptake after β3-agonist prestimulation (Fig. 7 D). However, when brown adipocytes were treated overnight with 1 μg/ml PMA to down-regulate classical (α, β, and γ) and novel (δ, ε, φ, and η) PKC isoforms, insulin-induced 2-deoxyglucose uptake was only reduced by 24% after β3-agonist pretreatment in PMA-treated cells compared with 64% in non-PMA-treated adipocytes (Fig. 7 E). By using a brown adipocyte cell model, we have studied the molecular mechanisms of interaction between sympatho-adrenergic and insulin signaling pathways and action. We have utilized SV40 T antigen-immortalized brown adipocytes, since these cells exhibit a highly differentiated phenotype and can be established from different animal models of insulin resistance from a single newborn mouse. Brown fat is a characteristic target tissue for β3-adrenergic agents that regulate adaptive thermogenesis in these cells by virtue of expression of the mitochondrial protein UCP-1. These cells also exhibit the classical function of insulin in fat, i.e. stimulation of glucose transport. Our cell lines demonstrate both insulin-induced glucose uptake and expression of UCP-1 at mRNA and protein level in the basal state as well as in response to β3-adrenergic stimulation. As compared with other well studied white adipose cell lines, e.g. 3T3-L1 cells, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in differentiated brown adipocytes is similarly robust (6-fold stimulation) and sensitive (submaximal response at 10 nm insulin). Furthermore, these cells exhibit the typical morphology of mature brown adipocytes with massive accumulation of multilocular fat. In this study, we find that β3-adrenergic prestimulation results in a decrease in insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. This most likely reflects decreased receptor kinase activity and is consistent with a number of previous studies in rat and human adipocytes showing a decrease in receptor kinase activity by nonspecific β-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol (3Issad T.

The decrease in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was not accompanied by a shift in mobility of the receptor β-subunit on SDS gels (data not shown), suggesting that it is not due to increased serine/threonine phosphorylation of the receptor. This finding is in accordance with studies by Issad et al. (3Issad T. Combettes M. Ferre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) who were unable to detect increased serine/threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor by phosphopeptide mapping following adrenergic stimulation. In parallel with the decrease in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and to a lesser extent IRS-2, was also reduced by β3-adrenergic pretreatment. This is due to a decrease in receptor tyrosine kinase activity as indicated by the diminished receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. However, this differentially affects IRS-1 and IRS-2. In this context, it should be noted that the C-terminal regions of IRS-1 and IRS-2 are rather poorly conserved (35% identity) (21White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), and the presence of different receptor binding domains such as the “kinase regulatory loop binding domain” which is present in IRS-2, but not IRS-1 (26Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), might well explain the difference observed. Different compartmentalization and trafficking of IRS-1 and IRS-2 have been observed in fat cells and might also play a role (27Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as IRS-2 is more rapidly phosphorylated than IRS-1 (data not shown), we cannot exclude the possibility that CL316243-induced changes in p85 binding to IRS-2 and IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity can be observed at different time points of insulin stimulation. At the level of PI 3-kinase activity, insulin-induced phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase activity was decreased by β3-adrenergic prestimulation, both in the basal state and after insulin stimulation. This suggests insulin receptor-independent and receptor-dependent cross-talking mechanisms. In agreement with this work, Ohsaka et al. (28Ohsaka Y. Tokumitsu Y. Nomura Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity is suppressed by β3-adrenergic stimulation in rat adipocytes via a direct cAMP-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, this decrease in PI 3-kinase activity is associated with a reduction in insulin-induced activation of Akt. It is likely to be caused, at least in part, by the decreased PI 3-kinase activity observed, but Akt has also been demonstrated to be regulated by PI 3-kinase-independent stimuli including stress (29Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7639-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 30Konishi H. Kuroda S. Tanaka M. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, again a number of separate signaling pathways is likely to interact at this level. MAP kinase in brown adipocytes is activated by both insulin and β3-adrenergic stimulation (present study and Ref. 31Shimizu Y. Tanishita T. Minokoshi Y. Shimazu T. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The potential mechanism for this G protein-coupled receptor-mediated MAP kinase activation is under intensive investigation. One possible pathway involves Gβγ subunits (reviewed in Ref. 32Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Also, evidence has been presented for Gsα initiating MAP kinase activation (33Wan Y. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14533-14537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Interestingly, β3-adrenergic stimulation prior to insulin treatment did not result in a further increase of MAP kinase activation but rather tended to decrease it. In the context of our data, a plausible explanation is that the inhibition of insulin-induced signaling pathways upstream of MAP kinase might prevent a sufficient insulin-stimulated increase. Surprisingly, despite only modest decreases in PI 3-kinase and even smaller decreases in Akt activation, the inhibition of insulin-induced glucose uptake by β3-adrenergic prestimulation was almost complete. From these observations two non-mutually exclusive conclusions could be drawn. On the one hand, it is possible that a small decrease in Akt activation as detected on immunoblots and byin vitro kinase assays might be sufficient to cause a considerable inhibition of glucose uptake. Alternatively, inhibition of insulin-induced glucose uptake after β3-agonist treatment might be mediated by Akt-independent pathways. Recent studies using a dominant negative Akt mutant lend support to the latter hypothesis (35Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In our cells, β3-adrenergic stimulation alone did not result in a significant increase in glucose uptake. This is in contrast to previous reports that demonstrated an approximately 2-fold increase in glucose uptake in response to (nor)adrenergic stimulation using cultured rat brown adipocytes (36Shimizu Y. Satoh S. Yano H. Minokoshi Y. Cushman S.W. Shimazu T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37Shimizu Y. Kielar D. Minokoshi Y. Shimazu T. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We do not know the cause for this discrepancy. It is conceivable that differences in the experimental systems such as cell starvation periods, stimulation times, the presence or absence of adenosine in the culture media, and the usage of different adrenergic compounds at different concentrations are responsible. Finally, our data suggest both PKA-dependent and PKC-dependent signaling pathways mediating the β3-adrenergic effects on the insulin signaling system. Treatment of brown adipocytes with dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin resulted in significant changes similar to CL316243 treatment, and inhibition of PKA by H-89 reversed all changes detected after β3-agonist pretreatment. Furthermore, PKC inhibition rescued the β3-receptor-mediated decreases in insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, p85 binding, and IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity. We performed PKA activity assays to exclude the possibility that this rescuing effect of the PKC inhibitors could be explained by an additional PKA inhibitory effect of GF109203X and Ro-31-8425. Whereas the PKA inhibitor H-89 decreased PKA kinase activity by 75%, no change of this protein kinase was detectable after PKC inhibitor treatment (data not shown). Whereas adrenergic activation of PKA has long been known to alter insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity (38Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. Rochet N. Van Obberghen E.L.M.-B.Y. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in brown adipocytes, at present, the signaling pathway from β-adrenergic receptors to activation of PKC in general and its consequences are poorly understood. PKC has been shown to be activated by the β2-adrenergic receptor (39Singh H. Linas S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F193-F199PubMed Google Scholar). In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, PKCα and other unidentified isoforms are involved in the β-adrenergic receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase (40Levesque L. Crooke S.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 425-434PubMed Google Scholar). However, as we did not see changes in total or isoform-specific PKC activity after exposure of adipocytes to CL316243 (data not shown), the detailed mechanisms of activation and the identity of PKC isoforms involved remain unknown. On the other hand, our observation that inhibition of PKC decreased the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake also suggests the involvement of PKC isoforms as positive regulators. This is consistent with recent studies demonstrating a role for the atypical PKC isoforms ζ and λ in mediating this insulin effect (41Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A.

In summary, we have characterized the cross-talk between adrenergic and insulin signaling pathways in a brown adipocyte cell model at different levels. We find that β3-adrenergic stimulation inhibits insulin signaling and insulin-induced glucose uptake. The mechanisms presented here might constitute a molecular basis important in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in states of adrenergic overactivity and in brown adipocyte metabolism.

Based on the observed hydrogen bonding network and previous spectroscopic and kinetic work, a general mechanism of peroxidase substrate oxidation is proposed. ferulic acid benzhydroxamic acid cyanide horseradish peroxidase C Ferulic acid ((3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid, FA)1 is a phenolic cinnamic acid derivative that is abundant in nature and known to act as anin vivo substrate for peroxidases (1Fry S.C. Greppin H. Penel C. Gaspar T. Molecular and Physiological Aspects of Plant Peroxidases. University of Geneva, Geneva1986: 169-182Google Scholar). FA enhances the rigidity and strength of plant cell walls by cross-linking with pentosans, arabinoxylans, and hemicelluloses, thereby making the cell walls less susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis during germination (2Fulcher R.G. O'Brien T.P. Lee J.W. Aust. J. Biol. Sci. 1972; 25: 23-34Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The compound is a dibasic acid that exhibits an extended resonance stabilization of the phenolate anion, hence slightly increasing its acidity relative to phenol. pK a values of 4.6 and 9.4 have been reported (3Kenttämaa J. Räisänen S. Auterinen L. Lindberg J.J. Suom. Kemistilehti B. 1970; 43: 333-336Google Scholar). Peroxidases have been reported to be the FA cross-linking catalyst (4Markwalder H.U. Neukom H. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 836-837Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The level of FA and its derivatives seems to be positively correlated with protection of the plant against insects (5Suga T. Ohta S. Munesada K. Ide N. Kurokawa M. Shimizu M. Ohta E. Phytochemistry. 1993; 33: 1395-1401Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), fungal (6Putman L.J. Laks P.E. Pruner M.S.

Wilson M.F. U.K. patent 88-29167. 1989; Google Scholar) attack. In plants, FA is thought to arise from the conversion of cinnamic acid (9Gross G.G. Higuchi T. Biosynthesis and Biodegradation of Wood Components. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando1985: 229-271Crossref Google Scholar), and frequently it is esterified to hydroxyl groups of polysaccharides (10Meyer K. Kohler A. Kauss H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), flavonoids, and hydroxycarboxylic acids (11Herrmann K. CRC Crit. Rev. Food. Sci. Nutr. 1989; 28: 315-347Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and to plant sterols (12Seitz L.M. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 1989; 37: 662-667Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar,13Evershed R.P. Spooner N. Prescott M.C. Goad L.J. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 440: 23-35Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The initial step in the biosynthesis of lignin is the enzymatic dehydrogenation of monolignols (14Freudenberg K. Science. 1965; 148: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) to produce phenoxyl radicals. The radicals can link up to form dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers. Laccases and plant peroxidases have been proposed to be the in vivo generators of the phenoxyl radicals. The peroxidase oxidation of compounds with a syringyl group can be enhanced by esters of 4-coumaric acid and FA (15Takahama U. Oniki T. Obinger C. Burner U. Ebermann R. Penel C. Greppin H. Plant Peroxidases: Biochemistry and Physiology. University of Geneva, Geneva1996: 118-123Google Scholar). For these reasons, it is of interest to study the interactions between the cell wall component FA and the well characterized horseradish peroxidase C. Peroxidases catalyze the oxidative coupling of phenolic compounds using H2O2 as the oxidizing agent. The reaction is a three-step cyclic reaction by which the enzyme is first oxidized by H2O2 and then reduced in two sequential one-electron transfer steps from reducing substrates, typically a small molecule phenol derivative (the charges of heme propionates are ignored in the scheme).

J. 1991; 273: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The oxidation of native enzyme by H2O2 (Reaction 1) is well understood, and numerous experiments (17Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Miller M.A. Kraut J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6592-6593Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have confirmed the general catalytic mechanism for this step first proposed by Poulos and Kraut (18Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidation of phenolic substrates (Reactions 2 and 3) has been less well understood, but a histidine (19Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 136-142Google Scholar) (His42 in HRPC) and an arginine (20Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4023-4030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) (Arg38 in HRPC) have been shown to contribute significantly to enhance the rate of substrate oxidation. The HRPC-CN-FA complex has a K d for FA of 3.8 mm (21Veitch N.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which is 15-fold higher than theK d of the HRPC-CN-benzhydroxamic acid (BHA). Like FA, most reducing substrates bind to peroxidases with dissociation constants in the mm range (22Leigh J.S. Maltempo M.M. Ohlsson P.I. Paul K.G. FEBS Lett. 1975; 51: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Morishima I. Ogawa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2814-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Paul K.G. Ohlsson P.I. Acta Chem. Scand. 1978; B 32: 395-404Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). There is, however, no direct correlation between the K d of a substrate and its reactivity toward compounds I and II. In general the rates of reaction of compound I with substrates correlate well with the driving force for the reaction (25Candeias L.P. Folkes L.K. Porssa M. Parrick J. Wardman P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of substrate molecules (26Sakurada J. Sekiguchi R. Sato K. Hosoya T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4093-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), or their calculated ionization potentials (27Rietjens I.M.C.M. Osman A.M. Veeger C. Zakharieva O. Antony J. Grodzicki M. Trautwein A.X. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 372-376Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). FA acid is, however, an excellent substrate for HRPC (see later), the immediate product being diferulic acid (4Markwalder H.U. Neukom H. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 836-837Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The formation of stable complexes between a variety of aromatic donor molecules including FA and the CN adduct of HRPC has been studied extensively by NMR techniques (21Veitch N.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The CN bound state of the enzyme has been preferred by NMR spectroscopists because of its low spin nature. In crystallographic studies, the oxyperoxidase complex (Compound III) has served as a model for the Fe3+-OOH− species, a labile intermediate in the formation of Compound I (28Miller M.A. Shaw A. Kraut J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Edwards S.L. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2588-2595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this crystallographic study, we describe the structure of the HRPC-CN-FA complex, which serves as a model for the pre-electron transfer complex formed between FA and compounds I and II. The presence of cyanide at the sixth coordination position of the heme iron sterically hinders the distal heme pocket and to some extent parallels the effect of the ferryl oxygen in Compounds I and II. Based on the structures of the HRPC-FA and HRPC-CN-FA complexes, we propose a general mechanism for oxidation of small phenolic substrates. The second order rate constants for the reduction of compounds I and II were determined as described previously (30Smith A.T. Sanders S.A. Thorneley R.-N.F. Burke J.F. Bray R.-R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) under pseudo-first order conditions. Plots ofk obs versus substrate concentration were linear over the range studied, which were: 2.5–15 μm for ferulic acid, 1–9 mm for indole-3-propionic acid, 1–8 mm forp-aminobenzoic acid, and 15–75 μm for ferrocyanide. All measurements were conducted at 25 ± 0.2 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, on an Applied Photo Physics SX18MV stopped flow system. Crystals were grown from a mixture of equal amounts (2 μl) of recombinant HRPC and reservoir solution and 1 μl of saturated FA in 2-propanol by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 10 °C. The drops were equilibrated against a reservoir of 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 mCa(CH3COO)2, and 0.1 m cacodylate buffer at pH 6.5. Immediately prior to data collection the crystals were immersed to a cryo-protective solution consisting of 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 mCa(CH3COO)2, and 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5. At 120 K the crystals were orthorhombic, space group P212121, with unit cell dimensionsa = 40.3 Å, b = 67.3 Å, andc = 117.6 Å. A ternary complex of HRPC, cyanide, and ferulic acid was prepared by adding 1 μl of 10 mm KCN to the equilibrated drops. The crystals were allowed to soak with KCN for 4 h. The space group of this complex was P212121, and the unit cell dimensions were a = 40.9 Å, b = 66.9 Å, and c = 119.0 Å at 100 K. Diffraction data for the HRPC-FA were collected at 120 K on a Rigaku R-axis IIC image plate system with a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode operated at 180 mA and 50 kV. The crystal to detector distance was 80 mm, and 90 successive frames of 1° oscillations were collected. The frame exposure time was 30 min. The HRPC-CN-FA diffraction data were collected at MAXLABII, University of Lund at beamline 711 at 100 K. A MAR345 image plate system was used for this data collection, which had a crystal to detector distance of 200 mm and an oscillation range of 0.75°. The 345-mm/150-μm scanner of the MAR345 was utilized. Auto-indexing and integration of intensities was achieved with Denzo (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277B: 319-343Crossref Scopus (1890) Google Scholar) for the HRPC-CN-FA structure. The occupancies of the FA molecules were refined within the limit 0–1 for the HRPC-FA complex but without restraining the sum of occupancies. The final occupancies of FA1, FA2, and FA3 were 0.36, 0.46, and 0.26, respectively. The only heme group restraints applied in the SHELX refinement was the restraining of chemically equivalent bonds to have equal bond length (SADI) (Table II). The FA molecules bonds and angles were restrained to values obtained from the small molecule data base, Cambridge Structural Database, and the Engh and Huber parameters (36Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2547) Google Scholar) were used to restrain the protein geometry in both complexes. Iron, calcium, and sulfur atoms were refined anisotropically in the SHELX-97 refinements. The SHELX refinement consisted of four rounds of conjugate gradient least square refinement and was completed by a blocked full-matrix refinement. Refinement statistics are listed in Table I. In addition to the FA molecule found in the active site of the HRPC-CN-FA complex, another well defined FA molecule is found in the HRPC-CN-FA crystal. In the HRPC-FA crystals, a poorly defined and not accounted for 2ς F o −F c electron density is observed in the same location. This FA molecule is positioned between symmetry related HRPC molecules, having <4.5 Å to the N-terminal (residues Asn13, Asn16, Ile17, and Asp20 in helix A) of one HRPC molecule and <4.5 Å to part of the loop forming the proximal Ca2+ site (residues Leu223, Arg224, Thr225, and Lys232) of a second HRPC molecule. Except Thr225, which is a proximal calcium ligand in class II and class III plant peroxidases, none of these contact residues are conserved among the plant peroxidase superfamily, and only crystal packing relevance and no enzymatic significance is ascribed to this interaction. Refinements include residues 1–305 of the HRPC-CN-FA complex and residues 1–306 of the HRPC-FA complex. An N-terminal methionine (Met0 originating from the recombinant expression (37Henriksen A.

The C-terminal serine and aspargine were omitted in the case of the HRPC-CN-FA complex, whereas the C-terminal aspargine was omitted from the refinement of the HRPC-FA complex because of missing or weak electron density. The residues Asn16, Ser89, Cys91, Arg178, Ser188, Thr200, Val219, Lys232, Gln240, Glu249, Ser265, Asn286, and Val304 of the HRPC-FA complex were refined in two alternate conformations, the relative occupancy of the two conformations were no refined but fixed at 0.5. In the HRPC-CN-FA complex residues Ser10, Asn16, Asn24, Arg27, Ile80, Cys91, Gln147, Ser151, Asn158, Ser161, Lys174, Arg178, Asp182, Thr200, Arg264, Ser265, and Ile297 were refined with alternate conformations. In this case, the relative occupancies were refined, but the sum of the occupancies was restricted to 1.0.Table IIGeometry of the cyanide bound hemeDistancesAnglesDihedralsÅdegreesdegreesFe-C (CN)1.99 (3)Fe-C-N159 (3)pyrrole N plane to pyrrole I5 (1)H42 NE-N (CN)2.67 (4)pyrrole NI-Fe-C83 (1)pyrrole N plane to pyrrole II6 (1)H170 NE-Fe2.08 (3)pyrrole NII-Fe-C82 (1)pyrrole N plane to pyrrole III9 (1)Fe-pyrrole N plane0.073 (5)pyrrole NIII-Fe-C90 (1)pyrrole N plane to pyrrole IV7 (1)C(CN)-N(CN)1.14 (5)pyrrole NIV-Fe-C96 (1)C-N-NE (His42)145 (3)The distances and angles are followed by standard deviation in parentheses.

Table III shows the measured second order rate constants for the oxidation of FA by HRPC compounds I and II. FA is notable because its reaction with compound II is remarkably fast, in comparison with the other substrates listed in Table III and up to 10 times faster than many other phenols. It is a candidate for one of the most reactive physiological substrates oxidized by HRPC. This suggests that the structure of any pre-electron transfer complex between compound II and FA is close to optimal.Table IIISecond order rate constants for the reduction of HRPC compounds I and II by ferulic acid and comparison with other substratesSubstrates for HRPC compounds I and IIBimolecular rate constants for compound I reduction (k 2)Bimolecular rate constants for compound II reduction (k 3)m−1s−1m−1 s−1Ferulic acid4.8 ± 0.2 × 1071.3 ± 0.01 × 107Indole-3-propionic acid6.6 ± 0.1 × 1034.0 ± 0.1 × 102p-Aminobenzoic acid6.5 ± 0.3 × 1034.9 ± 0.1 × 102Ferrocyanide1.4 ± 0.05 × 1072.1 ± 0.1 × 105All second order rate constants were determined with recombinant HRPC (63Smith A.T.

Schuller D.J. Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and of the HRPC-BHA complex (37Henriksen A. Schuller D.J. Meno K. Welinder K.G. Smith A.T. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8054-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The overall structure of HRPC is the same in all four structures with an overall root mean square deviation for Cα positions <0.4 Å in a pairwise superposition of the structures. The most significant side chain rearrangements close to the active site are found for residues Phe68, Asn135, Phe142, Phe143. and Phe179. The repositioning of Phe68 in the crystal structure of the HRPC-BHA complex effectively “closes the lid” on the substrate access channel optimizing the substrate-protein interactions for this unusual but nonphysiological tight binding substrate (37Henriksen A. Schuller D.J. Meno K. Welinder K.G. Smith A.T. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8054-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) (K d2.5 μm). Phe68 also contacts Asn135, which shows a significant adjustment when Phe68 alters conformation. In the HRPC-FA and the HRPC-CN-FA complexes, Phe68 is in an “open lid” orientation, but the residue is repositioned 1.6 Å relative to its position in the native HRPC structure (38Gajhede M. Schuller D.J. Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). A 0.8 Å reposition of Asn135 is a consequence of the Phe68reposition. In more general terms, it seems that the binding of substrate in the substrate access channel cause approaching of distal side residues toward the substrate (Phe68 > Asn135 > Asp132 > Leu131). The effect is more pronounced for BHA than for FA. Also side chain movements of 0.8 Å (Phe179), 0.7 Å (Phe142), and 0.4 Å (Phe143) are observed when comparing the structures of the HRPC-FA complexes with the structure of native HRPC. However, a closer spatial proximity of Ala140 and Phe142, Phe143 as observed by NMR when the HRPC-CN-BHA and the HRPC-CN complexes was compared (39De Ropp J.S. Mandal P.K. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) cannot be observed when comparing the x-ray structures of the HRPC-CN-FA complex and the native state of HRPC. The flexibility of the aromatic binding pocket of HRPC to accommodate small molecule substrates seems to be a characteristic feature of this site. The 2F o − F c simulated anneal omit (the FA molecules and residues within a 3.5 Å radius were omitted) difference electron density map in the active site of the HRPC-FA complex is shown in (Fig.1 A). The relative weaknesses of the substrate density and its extent suggest both partial occupancy and multiple binding sites or substrate orientations. The disorder in the electron density of the substrate does not allow us to model the orientation of FA unambiguously, but conclusions about substrate orientation can be drawn. The disordered density can be described by at least three FA binding modes (Fig. 1). The positions of the three possible binding modes are too close to represent more than one FA molecule bound in or close to the active site simultaneously (Fig.1 A). 3ς F o −F c electron densities was observed over the heme iron at the position of the FA carboxylic oxygens of FA3 (Fig.1 D), when the occupancies of the three FA models were refined. This excess electron density could be accounted for by modeling two partly occupied water molecules in these positions (Fig.1, B and C). The FA3 binding mode (Fig.1 D) (carboxylate facing inwards) is a direct consequence of the use of unesterified FA. In vivo, FA would be esterified to the hydroxyl groups of polysaccharides preventing the FA3 orientation from occurring. The ferryl oxygen of compounds I and II would sterically be in conflict with the FA3 binding mode, leading to the prediction that high FA concentrations in vitro might lead to substrate inhibition, by competitively slowing the reaction of the enzyme with hydrogen peroxide. This has been reported for certain substrates (40Childs R.E. Bardsley W.G. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 63: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but we are not aware of any detailed kinetic analyses of FA oxidation by HRPC. The FA1 and FA2 binding modes (Fig. 1,B and C) are the likely modes for productive interaction with compounds I and II in vivo. The positiveF o − F c difference electron density observed suggest that at least two water molecules are bound in the active site when the substrate binds in the FA1 or FA2 orientations. One of these water molecules is the molecule found between the heme iron and the distal histidine residue in the resting state structures of plant peroxidases (38Gajhede M. Schuller D.J. Henriksen A.

Polyisoprenol-linked sugars are involved in early stages of protein glycosylation as well as in the synthesis of bacterial cell walls and surface polysaccharides (1Bugg T.D. Brandish P.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 119: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sugars are normally available as soluble molecules in cytosolic compartments, while polyisoprenol lipids are associated with lipid membrane bilayers. Once assembled, polyisoprenol-linked sugar molecules must have a way to cross the lipid bilayer for further processing. Thus, transmembrane movement of phospholipids and glycolipids, including polyisoprenol-linked sugars, is a process of fundamental biological importance in all types of cells (1Bugg T.D. Brandish P.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 119: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2Higgins C.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 393-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the case of protein glycosylation in eukaryotes, a topological model has been proposed involving the transmembrane movement of dolichol-linked sugars across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (3Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 54: 63-87Crossref Scopus (443) Google Scholar). A similar model involving the transmembrane “flipping” of polyisoprenol-linked sugars has been proposed to explain the synthesis of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).1However, currently it is not known how lipid-linked carbohydrates are translocated from one leaflet of the lipid bilayer to the other. Using several different experimental strategies, it has been shown that the unassisted transbilayer movement of polyisoprenol-linked sugars in liposomes is extremely slow (4McCloskey M.A. Troy F.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Hanover J.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 254: 9237-9246Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), suggesting the need for protein-assisted translocation. LPS, a major component of the outer leaflet of outer membranes in Gram-negative bacteria, consists of lipid A, core oligosaccharide (OS), and in some microorganisms, O-specific polysaccharide or O antigen that is made of repeating OS subunits (6Nikaido H. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology.

The core OS is assembled on preformed lipid A by sequential glycosyl transfer of sugar components, while the O antigen is assembled on undecaprenylpyrophosphate (Und-P-P) (7Whitfield C. Valvano M.A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1993; 35: 135-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These pathways eventually converge by the ligation of the O antigen onto the lipid A-core OS acceptor, with the concomitant release of Und-P-P (7Whitfield C. Valvano M.A. Adv. Microb.

Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 178-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). At least two different mechanisms for biosynthesis and assembly of O antigens have been described. One of them involves the synthesis of O repeating subunits by the addition of subsequent monosaccharides at the nonreducing end of the molecule, a process that takes place on the cytosolic side of the cytoplasmic membrane (11Whitfield C. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 178-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). These subunits are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane, and they become polymerized by a mechanism involving the successive addition of the reducing end of the growing polymer to the nonreducing end of undecaprenylphosphate-linked subunits (Fig.1). The undecaprenyl-linked polymer is then ligated “en bloc” to the lipid A-core OS by reactions occurring on the periplasmic face of the membrane (12Marino P.A. McGrath B.C. Osborn M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3128-3133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13McGrath B.C. Osborn M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 649-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mulford C.A. Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This pathway, also referred to as the wzy(polymerase)-dependent pathway, occurs in the synthesis of the majority of O antigens, especially in those made of repeating units of different sugars (heteropolymeric O antigens) (15Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. Brade H. Morrison D.C. Vogel S. Opal S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 305-330Google Scholar). The second mechanism involves the formation of a polymeric O antigen by reactions taking place on the cytosolic face of the cytoplasmic membrane that are mediated by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases elongating the polysaccharide at the nonreducing end (16Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The nascent polysaccharide is transported across the cytoplasmic membrane by an ATP-binding cassette transporter (17Bronner D. Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and subsequently ligated to lipid A-core OS. This pathway has been observed especially in O antigens made of repeating units of the same sugar (homopolymeric O antigens) such as those from Escherichia coli O8 and O9 (11Whitfield C. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 178-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), as well as in group 2 and 3 exopolysaccharide capsules (16Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In bothwzy-dependent and wzy-independent mechanisms, the synthesis of the O subunit is initiated by the formation of a sugar phosphodiester linkage with undecaprenol phosphate. Various studies have recently shown that in most E. coli O-types, the initiating enzyme is a tunicamycin-sensitive UDP-GlcNAc:Und-P GlcNAc-1-P transferase (18Rick P.D. Silver R.P. Neidhardt F.C.

This enzyme is also involved in synthesis of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) (18Rick P.D. Silver R.P. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S.

Genetic and biochemical evidence strongly suggest that wecA(formerly rfe) is the structural gene encoding this enzyme (18Rick P.D. Silver R.P. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C.

C.1996: 104-122Google Scholar). In the most common Salmonella O antigens, the initiating sugar is galactose, a reaction mediated by the UDP-Gal:Und-P Gal-1-P transferase WbaP (formerly RfbP) (21Wang L. Liu D. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2598-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the wzy-independent O antigens, no obvious ABC transporters have been identified inwzy-dependent systems. It has been proposed that in these cases, undecaprenol-bound O subunits on the periplasmic face of the membrane arise by a process of transmembrane “flipping.” Allwzy-dependent O antigen clusters studied to date contain a gene that encodes a presumptive cytoplasmic membrane protein designated Wzx (formerly RfbX) that has been postulated as a candidate for the O unit flippase or translocase (22Liu D. Cole R.A. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2102-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wzx proteins share very little amino acid sequence similarity, and their genes have also very poor nucleotide sequence homology, to the point that they can be used as genetic markers for distinguishing among specific O antigens (23Marolda C.L. Feldman M.F. Valvano M.A. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,24Wang L. Reeves P.R. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3545-3551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on comparison of predicted hydrophobicity, Wzx proteins were recently classified within a family of integral membrane proteins with 12 predicted transmembrane helices (25Paulsen I.T. Beness A.M. Saier M.H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2685-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Liu et al. (22Liu D. Cole R.A. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2102-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that a strain carrying a wzx mutation of theShigella dysenteriae type 1 O antigen gene cluster accumulates Und-P-P-linked O subunits on the cytoplasmic membrane, but the evidence that accumulated O subunits are indeed on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane is less conclusive. Thus, the assignment of Wzx as a flippase is only tentative and awaits further confirmation as well as the elucidation of the biochemical mechanism involved in the presumed “flipping” activity. The lack of identifiable motifs in Wzx proteins, other than the presence of putative membrane-spanning domains, contrasts with the anticipated general nature of the translocation. One plausible hypothesis is that translocation of O antigen subunits is a highly specific process involving the recognition of unique O subunits in each individual microorganism. However, at the same time, the process of translocation should have common elements. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the translocation and assembly of O antigen from two perspectives. First, we investigated whether the formation of a complete O subunit is a prerequisite for translocation and ligation to the lipid A-core OS and also determined whether this process requires Wzx. Next, we examined the interchangeability of Wzx proteins from different sources, using a genetic reconstitution system in E. coli K12/O16 for ligation of O antigen components to the lipid A-core OS and a nonpolar mutation in the wzx gene of the O7 LPS biosynthesis cluster. In this work, we present genetic, biochemical, and structural data indicating that an incomplete O16 antigen subunit can be processed and assembled onto the lipid A-core OS. We also show that the Wzx translocase encoded by E. coliO7, O16, and Salmonella enterica LT2 O antigen clusters can complement a wzx gene defect in E. coli K-12/O16 and E. coli O7. Nevertheless, no complementation withE. coli K-12 or Rhizobium meliloti putative translocases involved in exopolysaccharide assembly was observed. Altogether, our data suggest a model for the processing of the O repeating unit that involves the recognition of Und-P-P-linked sugars not only by the translocase Wzx but also by a complex formed by translocase, polymerase (Wzy), and the O antigen ligase or WaaL. Unless otherwise indicated all chemicals were from Sigma. A nalidixic acid-resistant derivative ofE. coli K-12 strain W3110 (rph-1IN(rrnD-rrnE)1) was used in these studies. Strain CLM4 (26Marolda C.L. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 148-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is a recA derivative of SØ874 (27Neuhard J. Thomassen E. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a large deletion eliminating the genes for synthesis of colanic acid capsule and O16 LPS. CLM20 also derives from SØ874, and its construction is described below. E. coli DH5α was used as an initial host for the cloning experiments. Cells were generally grown at 37 °C in LB medium consisting of 10 g of NaCl, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of tryptone per liter. Antibiotics were added as needed at final concentrations of 100 μg/ml for ampicillin, 20 μg/ml for tetracycline, 40 μg/ml for kanamycin, 80 μg/ml for spectinomycin, 15 μg/ml for chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/ml for nalidixic acid. In some cases, a final sucrose concentration of 10% (w/v) was also added.

Recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli strains by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. Isolation of chromosomal DNA was conducted by the miniprep method of Owen and Borman (28Owen R.J. Borman P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Plasmids were purified as described previously (29Marolda C.L. Welsh J. Dafoe L. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When necessary DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using the Qiaquick kit (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Canada). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. PCR amplifications were carried out using PwoI andTaq DNA polymerases (Roche Diagnostics) as recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing performed using an ABI377 DNA sequencing apparatus (Perkin-Elmer) in the Robarts Research Institute DNA Sequencing Facility (London, Canada). A 1.9-kb fragment containing the glf gene and the contiguous region (Fig.2 A) was amplified by PCR with primers 85 (5′-CTGGTTGCTGGAATTAT-3) and 88 (5′-CGCATACGGCTGGATAA-3′) using pZY1018 as template. The amplification product was phosphorylated and then cloned in the HincII site of vector pGEM3 to obtain pMF1. This plasmid was used as a starting point to generate a mutatedglf by inserting the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene within its coding region. A DNA fragment containing the cat gene with its own promoter sequence, but lacking transcription termination signals, was amplified by PCR with primers 39 (5′-GATCACTTCGCAGAAT-3′) and 40 (5′-AATTACGCCCCGCCCT-3′) using pMAV3 as a template. The PCR product was phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase and inserted in a unique StyI site within the glf of pMF1. Following transformation, AmpR and CmR colonies were screened by PCR using primers 85 and 40 to determine the orientation of thecat gene. The resulting plasmid with the cat gene in the desired orientation (pMF2) was digested with SmaI andSphI. The 2.5-kb fragment containing theglf::cat gene was recovered by gel purification and ligated into the suicide vector pGP704 (AmpR) previously digested with SphI and EcoRV. The ligated mixture was transformed in the strain BW19610 (30Metcalf W.W. Jiang W. Wanner B.L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 138: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmid obtained was designated pMF9. A sacB-npt1cassette conferring kanamycin resistance and sucrose sensitivity was obtained from plasmid pUM24Cm (31Ried J.L. Collmer A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 57: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) by digestion with BamHI, recovered from the agarose gel, and ligated to the BglII site of pMF9. The resulting construct, named pMF10, was used for the gene replacement in W3110 as described elsewhere (30Metcalf W.W. Jiang W. Wanner B.L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 138: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). pMF10 was transformed into strain BW19851 (30Metcalf W.W. Jiang W. Wanner B.L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 138: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and mobilized by conjugation to the W3110 NxR recipient strain. Exconjugants were plated onto LB medium containing 10% sucrose, nalidixic acid, and chloramphenicol and screened for sensitivity to kanamycin and ampicillin. KanS AmpS colonies were screened by PCR using primer 39 within the cat gene and primer 98 (5′-TCAACGTAGCGTCATTTA-3′) in the wzy gene, located immediately downstream of glf (Fig. 2 A). The correct allelic replacement was further confirmed by Southern blot hybridization analysis, and the mutant strain was designated MFF1. wbbL, encoding the rhamnosyltransferase for O16 biosynthesis (Fig. 2 A), was amplified by PCR with primers 99 (5′-TGCTCGCGCCCTGGAATG-3′) and 100 (5′-GAACATTGAAATGGTAT-3′) using pPR1474 (32Liu D. Reeves P.R. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) as template andTaq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR product was ligated into pGEM-T-easy (Promega) to obtain plasmid pMF5, and this plasmid was digested with EcoRI in order to recover a fragment containing wbbL. The recovered fragment was ligated into the expression vector pEXT21 that was previously digested withEcoRI and treated with alkaline phosphatase. The resulting plasmid was named pMF19. The wecC::Tn10 (formerlyrffD::Tn10) insertion in strain 21566 (33Meier-Dieter U. Starman R. Barr K. Mayer H. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13490-13497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was transduced into SØ874 using bacteriophage P1 (34Provence D.L. Curtiss III, R. Gerhardt P. Murray R.G.E. Wood W.A. Krieg N.R. Methods for General and Molecular Bacteriology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 317-347Google Scholar). TetR colonies were purified, and the insertion of Tn10 in the correct gene was confirmed by PCR. One of these colonies, CLM5, was used to construct a derivative lacking the Tn10 transposon as described by Maloy and Nunn (35Maloy S. Nunn W. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1110-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting TetS colonies were examined for their ability to support expression of O7 LPS when transformed with pJHCV32 (36Valvano M.A. Crosa J.H. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 937-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since, the wecA gene but not wecD is necessary for O7 LPS expression (20Alexander D.C. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7079-7084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Marolda C.L. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5539-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), failure to express O7 LPS by these colonies indicated a deletion eliminating all or a portion of wecAthat is located upstream of wecD (Fig. 2 B). One of such colonies, designated CLM20 was examined further by PCR using primers 15 (5′-CATGACGAGCTTCGGACTGA-3′) and 62 (5′-TCGATGCAATGGAAT). A 9-kb fragment was obtained and cloned into the SmaI site of pMAV3, resulting in plasmid pCM206. The exact extent of the deletion was verified by DNA sequencing. All of these cloning experiments were conducted using the low copy number expression vector pEXT21. The coding regions of the cloned genes were placed under the control of the plac-inducible promoter. The copy number of pEXT21 is 3–4 copies per chromosome (38Dykxhoorn D.M. St Pierre R. Linn T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 177: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), ensuring a similar level of expression in all constructs. Construction of pMF21 containing thewzx EcO7 was described previously (23Marolda C.L. Feldman M.F. Valvano M.A. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Plasmid pZY1001 (39Yao Z. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4133-4143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a template to clonewzx EcK12/O16 using primers 5′-ATGGATCCTGCATGAATACGAATAAATTAC-3′ and 5′-TAAAGCTTAATCCTCAGCAAACCAG-3′ having BamHI andHindIII sites (underlined) in their 5′-ends. The PCR-amplified fragment containing the coding region ofwzx EcK12/O16 was digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated to pEXT21 digested with the same enzymes, resulting in pMF20. An identical strategy was used to clonewzxC from E. coli K-12 strain W3110,exoT from R. meliloti strain B399, andwzx SeLT2 from S. enterica serovar typhimurium strain LT2. In these cases, the PCR amplifications were from chromosomal DNA. The following primers were used: wzxC, 5′-ATGGATCCGATATGAGCTTACGTGA-3′ and 5′-TAAAGCTTAACCAGCAATCACCCCG-3′; exoT, 5′-ATGGATCCATGACCCCAACCGTTAACG-3′ and 5′-TAAAGCTTCTCTTTCTTCCGCAGTCG-3′; andwzx SeLT2, 5′-TAGAATTCTGCATAATGAAAGTTCAATTG-3′ and 5′-ATGTCGACGCATATGATTATCCCTTATTTG-3′, except that in this case the underlined bases correspond to EcoRI andSalI sites, respectively. The resulting plasmids were designated as pMF26 (wzxC), pMF28 (ExoT), and pMF24 (wzx SeLT2). Fresh cultures were induced with 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended to an absorbance at 600 nm of 1. 1.5-ml aliquots of the cell suspension were used to extract LPS as described previously (29Marolda C.L. Welsh J. Dafoe L. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For some experiments, large scale LPS preparations were made by the hot phenol method (40Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar) using 500-ml cultures. The concentration of LPS was measured by the KDO assay (41Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Duplicate 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels were run. One gel was stained with silver as described elsewhere (29Marolda C.L. Welsh J. Dafoe L. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Diagnostics) and processed as recommended by the supplier for application of digoxenin-labeled lectin in glycoconjugate analysis (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, the membrane was treated with the blocking reagent, washed several times with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and incubated with 7 μg/ml of digoxenin-labeled WGA.

SMF1-mediated Fe2+transport exhibited saturation kinetics (K m = 2.2 μm), whereas the Na+ flux did not, although both processes were electrogenic.

These data are consistent with the concept that uptake of divalent metal ions by SMF1 and SMF2 is essential to yeast cell growth. Na+ inhibited metal ion uptake mediated by SMF1 and SMF2 expressed in oocytes. Consistent with this, we found that increased sensitivity of yeast to EGTA in the high Na+ medium is due to inhibition of SMF1- and SMF2-mediated metal ion transport by uncoupled Na+pathway.

SMF1, SMF2, and SMF3 are yeast homologues of the Nramp proteins with 51–54% identity in amino acid sequence to each other and 33–36% identity to DCT1.

In analogy to HFE in mammalian cells, the product of the yeast BSD2 (bypass superoxide dismutase deficiency gene 2), localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, regulates metal ion absorption by exerting a negative control on SMF1 activity (21Liu X.F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4863-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, a functional characterization of SMF1 has not yet been reported. In the present study, we expressed SMF1, SMF2, and SMF3 inXenopus oocytes and used both a radiotracer approach and the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique to investigate the function of these proteins. We show that SMF1 mediates H+-dependent Fe2+ transport and uncoupled Na+ currents. SMF2 also mediates significant H+-coupled Fe2+ transport and uncoupled Na+ currents, which are much smaller than those mediated by SMF1. SMF3 exhibited no detectable activities when expressed in oocytes. Because Na+ inhibited metal ion uptake in oocytes expressing SMF1, we investigated the effect of Na+ on yeast growth. Yeast SMF1, SMF2, and SMF3 cDNAs were subcloned from pTLN2 into pNWP plasmid, and rat DCT1 cDNA was in pSPORT1. Capped SMF and DCT1 cRNAs were synthesized by in vitro transcription from their cDNAs. Oocytes were extracted from stage V–VI Xenopus laevis and were defolliculated using a Ca2+-free solution (90 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) containing 2 mg/ml collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) for ∼2 h at 18 °C. Oocytes were injected, on the same day (at least 4 h after defolliculation) or on the following day, with 50 nl of H2O containing 15 ng cRNA of SMF1, SMF2, or SMF3 or 25 ng of cRNA of DCT1. Equal amounts of H2O were injected into control oocytes. Injected oocytes were incubated at 18 °C using antibiotic Barth's solution containing 90 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)210 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.5. Uptake experiments were performed at 2–4 days following injection. Uptake solutions for radiotracer experiments contained 100 mm NaCl + choline-Cl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm KCl, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mml-ascorbic acid (freshly prepared), pH 5.5–7.5 by Tris-Base or HEPES. l-ascorbic acid was added to solutions to maintain iron in the 2+ form. 8–10 oocytes were incubated in 0.5 ml of solutions containing radioactive55FeCl2. Uptake lasted 30 min and was terminated by washing oocytes through six consecutive ice-cold uptake solution containing 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Experiments utilizing the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique (23Chen X.-Z. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tian W. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20972-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were performed as described (23Chen X.-Z. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tian W. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20972-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Resistance of microelectrodes filled with 3m KCl was 0.5–2 MΩ. In experiments involving voltage jumping or holding, currents and voltages were digitized at 0.3 or 200 ms/sample, respectively. After ∼3 min of membrane potential stabilization following microelectrode impalements, the oocyte was clamped to the holding potential (V h) of −50 mV. 100-ms voltage pulses between −160 and +60 mV, in increments of +20 mV, were then applied, and steady-state currents were obtained as the average values in the interval from 80 to 95 ms after the initiation of the voltage pulses. Solutions used in electrophysiology were the same as in tracer assay except that they contained nol-ascorbic acid when metal ions other than iron were present. Experimental results were expressed in the form of means ± S.E. (n), where n indicates the number of oocytes used. Data analysis was performed as described (23Chen X.-Z. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tian W. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20972-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Before starting tracer uptake, oocyte was clamped at −50 mV and perfused with substrate-free solution. Then the membrane potential was held at other test values (+10, −20, −50, −70, or −80 mV). After the perfusion was stopped, the uptake solution (200 μl) was added manually using a pipettor, which washed out the substrate-free solution. The uptake lasted 2–5 min in the chamber whose volume is about 200 μl and was terminated by perfusing (washing) the oocyte with the substrate-free solution. Currents were continuously measured during uptake. Oocyte was then dissolved in 250 μl of 10% SDS and mixed with 2.5 ml of scintillation mixture. The wild-type strain used in this study is Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303 (MATa/a trp1 ade2 his3 leu2 ura3). The other strains used are ΔSMF1 (MATa ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 SMF1::URA3), ΔSMF2 (MATa ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 SMF2::URA3), ΔSMF3(MATa ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 SMF3::URA3), andΔSMF1+2+3 (MATa ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 SMF1::URA3 SMF2::URA3 SMF3::URA3). During the preparation of the triple disruptant DSMF1+2+3, the URA3 gene was inactivated twice by 5-fluoroorotic acid treatment. Yeast (S. cerevisiae) cells were grown in a YPD medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, and 2% dextrose. The medium was buffered by 50 mmMes,1 and the pH was adjusted by NaOH (24Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 25Noumi T. Beltran C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Agar plates were prepared by the addition of 2% agar to the YPD buffer medium at the given pH. Yeast transformation was performed as described previously (26Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the transformed cells were grown on minimal plates containing a 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose, 2% agar, and the appropriate nutritional requirements. Gene knockout of the new strains was performed as follows. All or part of the target gene was replaced by a selectable marker (URA3, LEU2, or HIS4), leaving flanking DNA sequences of about 0.3 kilobase pairs. When polymerase chain reaction was used for the construct, the DNA fragments were cloned into the TA plasmid of pGEM-T Easy (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). For the disruption we cut the plasmid with the appropriate restriction enzymes and transformed the yeast strains with the plasmid DNA as described previously (26Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast strains were grown on minimal medium in the absence of the auxotrophic marker. Colonies that grew on the selective medium were selected, checked by polymerase chain reaction for homologous recombination, and analyzed for their phenotype. The intact genes containing 0.3 kilobase pair of flanking sequences were cloned by polymerase chain reaction into YPN2 plasmid (25Noumi T. Beltran C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed either using the method of Ito et al. (26Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or using a bench top method according to Elble (27Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Sensitivity to low metal ions in the medium was checked by the addition of different EGTA concentration to agar plates buffered by 50 mm Mes, pH 6, containing 0.25% yeast extract, 0.5% Bactopeptone, 0.5% dextrose, and 2% agar (1/4 YPD). The amounts of EGTA required to obtain growth arrest for the disruptant mutants and normal growth for the wild-type strain is dependent on the source and quality of the reagents. Therefore, each experiment was performed with three different EGTA concentrations. Xenopusoocytes expressing SMF1 exhibited significant increases in55Fe uptake compared with H2O-injected control oocytes (Fig. 1 a). The increase was higher in the absence of external Na+(Na+o) than in the presence of 100 mm Na+. At pH 5.5 and in the absence of Na+o, SMF1-mediated iron uptake was 30–40 times higher than control levels. Iron transport was saturable and followed the Michaelis-Menten relationship (Fig. 1 b). The apparent affinity for Fe2+ was high, with an apparent affinity constant (K m) of 2.2 ± 0.2 μm(n = 10). The H+ dependence of Fe2+ uptake (at 5 μm Fe2+) also followed the Michaelis-Menten relationship with a K mfor H+ of 0.62 μm (corresponding to pH 6.2; Fig. 1 c). This suggests that one H+ is coupled to the uptake of one Fe2+. Uptake of Fe2+ was completely inhibited by 1 mm Mn2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+, weekly inhibited by 50 μm Al3+, and was not inhibited by 1 mm La3+ or 50 μm Gd3+(Fig. 1 d). In addition, no increase in55Fe3+ uptake was observed in SMF1-expressing oocytes compared with control oocytes. These results indicate that various divalent but not trivalent metal ions are transported by SMF1. Despite the relatively low transport level of SMF1 inXenopus oocytes, these characteristics of SMF1 are similar to those of the mammalian homologue DCT1. Metal ion transport mediated by SMF1 was electrogenic and voltage-dependent (Fig. 2,a and b). Consistent with radiotracer experiments, both Fe2+ and Mn2+ generated currents. Interestingly, although Na+ inhibited iron uptake, Na+ applied in the absence of metal ions induced large SMF1-specific inward currents at −50 mV (Fig. 2 c). At pH 5.5 (but not at pH 7.5) and in the presence of 100 mmNa+, addition of Fe2+ apparently evoked a net outward current that is likely composed of Fe2+-inhibited inward Na+ current and Fe2+-stimulated H+-Fe2+ cotransport inward current, with the former being larger than the latter. In the absence of metal ions and in the presence of 100 mm Na+, a reduction in medium pH also apparently stimulated a net outward current, indicating that protons inhibit the Na+ current. Our results show mutual inhibition between the H+-Fe2+cotransport and Na+ permeation, suggesting that the observed Na+ fluxes are mediated by SMF1 and not by SMF1-stimulated endogenous Na+ pathways. In the absence of metal ions, a large conductance in oocytes expressing SMF1 was evoked by Na+o (Fig.3, a–d). The outward currents observed in the presence of external choline-Cl (Fig. 3 b) are likely due to effluxes of K+ and Na+, because SMF1 is also permeable to K+ (see below). The Na+ currents were voltage-dependent and exhibited no saturation by hyperpolarization (Fig. 3 e). They were not significantly affected by depletion of extracellular Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, or Cl−or by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ (through injection of 25 nl of 50 mm EGTA into the oocyte cytoplasm), indicating that they are uncoupled currents. Na+ currents were Na+- dependent but did not saturate at concentration up to 100 mm Na+o at any Vmtested (−160 to +60 mV) (Fig. 3 f). We also tested the functions of SMF2 and SMF3 by oocyte expression studies. Compared with SMF1, SMF2 exhibited lower (but significant) Fe2+ uptake and uncoupled Na+ currents (Fig.4). In contrast, SMF3 exhibited no detectable iron uptake or uncoupled sodium currents in oocytes. It is possible that SMF3 is primarily localized in intracellular membranes, in analogy to Nramp1 (28Searle S. Bright N.A. Roach T.I. Atkinson P.G. Barton C.H. Meloen R.H. Blackwell J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In oocytes expressing SMF1, Na+ currents were partially inhibited by application of 1 mm La3+ (Fig.5 and Table I). In contrast, Fe2+ uptakes were not inhibited by La3+ (Fig.2 d). La3+ also inhibited an outward current in oocytes expressing SMF1 (Fig.5 b) but not in H2O-injected oocytes (data not shown). In average (n = 5), 47% of the Na+current in oocytes expressing SMF1 was inhibited by 1 mmLa3+ (Fig. 5 c). Na+ currents in H2O-injected oocytes were not significantly inhibited by La3+, further supporting the concept that Na+currents are mediated by SMF1 but not through endogenous Na+ pathways. Taken together, our data indicate the presence of separate modes for La3+-sensitive uncoupled Na+ entry and La3+-insensitive H+-coupled Fe2+ entry by SMF1.Table IAlkaline cation-stimulated currents and inhibition by lanthanum in SMF1-expressing or H2O-injected Xenopus oocytesNa+Li+Rb+K+SMF1 −La165 ± 331-aMean ± S.E.192 ± 59259 ± 34264 ± 51 +La87 ± 1294 ± 14101 ± 14100 ± 10H2O −La8 ± 117 ± 780 ± 1550 ± 6 +La11 ± 212 ± 248 ± 131 ± 2Total currents were continuously recorded at V h of −50 mV in the presence of 2.5 mm La3+ (+La) or in its absence (−La).

Open table in a new tab Total currents were continuously recorded at V h of −50 mV in the presence of 2.5 mm La3+ (+La) or in its absence (−La). Currents shown in the table were the difference between total currents obtained in the presence of alkaline ions and in the presence of choline. Data presented are the average values (in nA) from four oocytes. To test the ion selectivity for the Na+ permeation pathway, Li+, Rb+, or K+ was used to replace Na+. SMF1 was permeable to all of these alkaline cations, which generated similar amplitudes at −50 mV (Fig. 5 d), indicating that the cation pathway is nonselective to monovalent cations. La3+ inhibited these currents as well and had lower inhibitory effects on the corresponding currents mediated by H2O-injected oocytes (Table I). Interestingly, SMF1 and SMF2 are also permeable to Ca2+(Fig. 6 a). The permeation of Ca2+ via SMF1 was partially inhibited by La3+and Na+ and was not driven by protons (Fig. 6). These data indicate that Ca2+ and monovalent cations share the same nonselective cation pathway. Although yeast SMF1 and its mammalian homologue DCT1 (Nramp2) are functionally similar and both mediate H+-driven Fe2+ uptake, DCT1 did not mediate uncoupled Na+ currents (data not shown). However, DCT1 is not merely a cotransport system. Based on a simultaneous measurements of Fe2+-elicited currents and 55Fe uptake under voltage-clamp conditions (Fig.7, a and b), the ratio of the Fe2+-evoked current to 55Fe uptake at Vm of +10 mV was close to 3:1, suggesting that the H+:Fe2+ stoichiometry is 1:1 at this membrane potential. However, this ratio increased substantially with hyperpolarization and was unexpectedly high at hyperpolarized potentials (Fig. 7, b and c). This indicates that Fe2+ evokes a stoichiometrically uncoupled and voltage-dependent current. The Fe2+-induced inward currents and the charge:Fe2+ ratios were not significantly affected by removing external cation Na+, Ca2+, or Mg2+, or depleting intracellular Cl− through overnight incubation in Cl−-free media (data not shown). Thus, the uncoupled currents of DCT1 are distinct from the SMF1-mediated Na+ currents. The nature of these uncoupled currents is currently under investigation. Uncoupled currents induced by expression of SMF1 in Xenopus oocytes could arise from factors not directly related to the functional properties of SMF1, including up-regulation of an endogenous Xenopus protein and conformational changes of SMF1 induced by abnormal lipid composition in the target membrane. Our electrophysiological data indicate that Na+ permeation is mediated directly by SMF1. To further validate this concept, we examined whether the observed Na+currents in oocytes expressing SMF1 can be verified in S. cerevisiae in vivo. For this purpose we constructed yeast disruptant mutants with each of SMF1, SMF2, and SMF3 genes individually inactivated and a mutant with all three genes inactivated. EGTA, which chelates vital metal ions such as Mn2+ and Cu2+is known to inhibit yeast cell growth (29Pinner E. Gruenheid S. Raymond M. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28933-28938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The yeast disruptant mutants exhibited higher sensitivities to EGTA than the wild-type yeast. The higher sensitivities and associated growth arrest could be suppressed by exposure to low concentrations of manganese or copper in the medium (20Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 30Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 321-330PubMed Google Scholar). We utilized these mutants to examine whether inhibition of SMF1-mediated Mn2+ or Cu2+transport by Na+ increases sensitivity to EGTA. Of note, FET3 and FET4 (not SMFs) constitute the main yeast iron transport systems, with high and low affinities, respectively (31Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas SMF1 and SMF2 mainly mediate uptake of Mn2+ and other metal ions. In the presence of 0.1 mm EGTA and 20 mmNa+, only the triple mutant ΔSMF1+2+3 failed to grow (Fig. 8). Among the individually disruptant mutants, only ΔSMF1 exhibited growth arrest in the presence of 0.5 mm EGTA. At 1 mm EGTA both ΔSMF1 and ΔSMF2 failed to grow. ΔSMF3 can grow at higher EGTA concentrations. 2A. Cohen, H. Nelson, and N. Nelson, unpublished data. These results are in agreement with our observation that oocytes expressing SMF2 exhibit lower activities (in both Fe2+ uptake and Na+ currents, Fig. 4) than SMF1-expressing oocytes and that SMF3-expressing oocytes exhibited no significant transport activities in oocytes. For all mutants the growth arrest was suppressed by addition of 5 μm Mn2+ or Cu2+ but not Zn2+. Thus, ΔSMF2 was the appropriate mutant to study the effect of Na+ on SMF1. Indeed, addition of 100 mm NaCl to the plates containing 0.5 mm EGTA caused growth arrest of ΔSMF2, consistent with our finding inXenopus oocytes that Na+ can effectively compete with other metal ions for their uptake by SMF1. The present studies demonstrate that SMF1, like its mammalian homologue DCT1/Nramp2, mediates proton-coupled metal ion transport when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Transport is saturable with increasing iron concentration and is not inhibited by La3+. SMF1 also exhibits uncoupled cation (Na+, K+, Rb+, Li+, and Ca2+) currents. Uncoupled Na+ currents were not saturable with increasing Na+ concentration and inhibitable by La3+. These results indicate that the cation permeation is a channel-like behavior of SMF1 and that H+-Fe2+ cotransport and Na+ permeation are mediated by SMF1 through distinct mechanisms. In analogy to DCT1, SMF1 mediates absorption of a variety of divalent metal ions, including Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+. However, although DCT1 is thought to play an essential role in intestinal absorption of both Fe2+ and other divalent metal ions, iron uptake in yeast is probably mediated by the specialized FET3 and FET4 iron uptake systems. Thus, the role of SMF in yeast is most likely to absorb other essential metal ions present in the soil such as Mn2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+. Our yeast studies show that SMF1 plays a major role in supporting cell growth in the presence of relatively low EGTA concentrations. Oocyte studies suggest that Na+ inhibition of yeast growth at low EGTA concentrations can be attributed to Na+ inhibition of metal ion uptake by SMF1. The physiological significance of this phenomenon can be explained by considering the growth conditions in nature. In the natural environment, yeast can be exposed to drastic changes in the salinity because of water evaporation. Under these conditions the concentration of metal ions in the extracellular environment can reach dangerous levels. Because yeast cells can tolerate NaCl concentrations of up to 0.9 m, competition of Na+ with metal ion uptake may prevent accumulation of metal ions to toxic levels. Several other transporters also exhibit uncoupled ion currents such as chloride currents in the glutamate transporters (32Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), Na+leak currents in the Na+-glucose transporters (33Chen X.-Z. Coady M.J. Jackson F. Berteloot A. Lapointe J.-Y. Biophys.

A. 1996; 93: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Uncoupled Na+ and Li+currents mediated by serotonin transporters were not saturable and exhibited channel-like behaviors (35Galli A. Petersen C.I. deBlaquiere M. Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3401-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The biological and physiological meaning of uncoupled cation-leak pathways in these transporters are still unclear. It was proposed that concomitant Cl− flow with glutamate cotransport through glutamate transporters act as a feedback mechanism to reduce neuronal cell depolarization that would result in toxic vesicular glutamate release (38Picaud S.A. Larsson H.P. Grant G.B. Lecar H. Werblin F.S. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 1760-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The identification of these new components of transporter-associated currents provides new tools to elucidate the interaction between the transporter substrates and ions and will help to elucidate the structure-function relationship of these transporters. Ca2+ flux via SMF1 was not driven by protons but rather through the uncoupled nonselective pathway. On the other hand, although the mammalian homologue DCT1 was not permeable to Ca2+, its H+-coupled cotransport was inhibited by Ca2+, indicating that Ca2+ can interact with DCT1 as well. Hence, SMF1 and DCT1, when expressed in oocytes, likely possess structural similarity at their Fe2+ and Ca2+ binding sites. Unlike Na+, Ca2+ (up to 70 mm) had no inhibitory effects on yeast growth (30Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 321-330PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the Ca2+ permeability of SMF transporters in yeast are not significant enough to interfere with cell growth. What is the physiological significance of the Na+permeability of SMF1? We have shown that the mammalian homologue DCT1 also mediates uncoupled currents that substantially increase with hyperpolarization. However, in contrast to yeast SMF1, these DCT1-mediated currents are metal ion-gated. Although SMF1 and DCT1 mediate different uncoupled currents, they may utilize these characteristics for similar purposes, that is to prevent from excessive metal ion loading. The Na+ permeation via SMF1 may provide a protection by the preferential uptake of Na+ over the excessive uptake of toxic metal ions. Influx of more than 10 positive charges per Fe2+ entry under physiological (negative) potentials would significantly depolarize the cells, which results in an inhibition of Fe2+ uptake. Further studies are needed to define the physiological significance of the anomalous behaviors of the SMF and DCT metal ion transporters. We thank P. Fong for kindly providing the pTLN2 oocyte expression vector and J.-Y. Lapointe and E. M. Wright for valuable discussions and suggestions."

J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) cells, the first mannose (Man1) is modified by EtNP at position 2. The second mannose (Man2) of mammalian and yeast GPIs can also be modified by EtNP (11Ueda E. Sevlever D. Prince G.M. Rosenberry T.L. Hirose S. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9998-10002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additions of EtNP to the second and third (Man3) mannoses are to position 6. Recently, yeast Gpi7p (YJL062W) was found to be involved in the addition of a side chain, probably EtNP, to Man2, which is not essential for growth but is important for the surface expression of α-agglutinin, which is GPI-dependent (12Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).GPI7 has two other homologues in the yeast genome,MCD4 (13Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and the gene YLL031C. A yeast mutant inmcd4, found in screening for morphogenic defects, is defective in GPI anchoring (13Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although its defective step has not been pinpointed, it may be in the modification of Man1 with a side chain EtNP. Mcd4p is essential for growth and consists of a hydrophilic N-terminal lumenal domain and multiple transmembrane domains (13Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The three homologous yeast proteins have similar domain organization and regions conserved in phosphodiesterases and nucleotide pyrophosphatases within the N-terminal lumenal domain (12Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol.

A terpenoid lactone compound, YW3548, a fungal product, inhibits modification of Man1 with EtNP and inhibits GPI anchoring and growth of yeast (8Sutterlin C. Escribano M.V. Gerold P. Maeda Y.

Riezman H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6374-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). YW3548 does not inhibit GPI synthesis in protozoa, such as Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania major andPlasmodium falciparum (14Sutterlin C. Horvath A. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. Wang Y. Dreyfuss M. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6374-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which is consistent with reports that their GPIs are not modified by EtNP on Man1(1). The compound also inhibits mammalian GPI synthesis (14Sutterlin C. Horvath A. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. Wang Y. Dreyfuss M. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6374-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is likely that Mcd4p and its mammalian homologue are targets of YW3548. Here, we report molecular cloning of a mouse MCD4 homologue termed phosphatidylinositol glycan-class N (Pig-n) and show that Pig-n is involved in the addition of EtNP to Man1 but that its modification is not essential for the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins. We also demonstrate that YW3548 acts at the same step as Pig-n and affects the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins on mammalian cells only slightly. Mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes.

YW3548 was provided by Novartis AG (Basel, Switzerland). BE49385A, the same compound as YW3548, was provided by Banyu Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). We searched the GenBankTM data base using BLAST software (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar) for sequences homologous to yeast Mcd4p (YKL165C) and found a mouseAA267602 sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence of mouse Mcd4p homologue was not a full coding sequence. To obtain a full sequence, we designed two primers, 5′-GGACTTCTTTGATGCTGCAAGAAACAAC (forward) and 5′-CCCAGTCTGTCATTCCATGGTCAGAGGT (reverse) on the basis of mouseAA267602 sequence and amplified a fragment from a mouse testis cDNA library. Sequences of PCR products were homologous to the humanMCD4 homologue. Using a forward primer designed in a vector and a reverse primer, fragments containing the 5′ region of mouseMCD4 homologue were amplified and cloned from the cDNA library. The longest clone was 1.2 kb long. Using a forward primer and a reverse vector primer, three fragments containing the 3′ region were cloned. Two gave longer fragments of a similar size, and the third gave a shorter fragment. The longest 5′ and longer 3′ fragments were ligated to generate a full-length cDNA. We termed the mouse MCD4homologue Pig-n. To obtain genomic clones of Pig-n, we screened 1 × 106 pfu of genomic λ FIXII library from a mouse 129/SvJ liver (Stratagene) using a 1.2-kb fragment containing the 5′ region ofPig-n cDNA as a probe. We obtained 14 positive clones and restriction-mapped and sequenced the regions around the exons. A 7.2-kbXhoI-EcoRI genomic fragment of Pig-n, containing exons 10–14, was transferred to pPNT (21Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmid was named pPNT-L. A 3-kbNotI-XbaI genomic fragment of Pig-ncontaining exon 7 and a 1.9-kb XbaI-XhoI fragment of PGKneo or a 1.8-kb XbaI-XhoI fragment of PGKpuro were ligated together in the XbaI-NotI site in pPNT-L. The resulting plasmids were used as the first and second targeting vectors to delete exons 8 and 9. The gene targeting strategy was followed as described (22Hong Y. Ohishi K. Watanabe R. Endo Y. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18582-18588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). F9 cells (2 × 107) were electroporated with 50 μg ofNotI-cut targeting vector at 230 V and 500 microfarads using a GenePulser (Bio-Rad) and seeded on plates coated with 0.1% gelatin. Positive selection was started with 380 μg/ml G418 or 2 μg/ml puromycin the next day. Three days later, negative selection with 2 μm gancyclovir was performed. 8–11 days after transfection, we screened colonies by PCR for recombinants, in which PCR primers, one in PGKneo or PGKpuro region and another inPig-n, were used. Positive colonies were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. To examine the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins, cells were stained with biotinylated anti-Thy1 G7 antibody (23Gunter K.C. Malek T.R. Shevach E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 716-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) for F9 cells, and anti-CD59 5H8 antibody (24Sugita Y. Ito K. Shiozuka K. Suzuki H. Gushima H. Tomita M. Masuho Y. Immunology. 1994; 82: 34-41PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-DAF IA10 antibody (25Kinoshita T. Medof M.E. Silber R. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 75-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) for JY25, followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Biomedica). They were analyzed in a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Biotinylated monoclonal rat IgG2c and mouse anti-HEL HybC2 (IgG1) antibodies were used as isotype controls. F9 cells (106) grown in a gelatin-coated six-well plate overnight were incubated for 1 h in a medium containing 20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 100 μg/ml glucose, 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml tunicamycin, and penicillin/streptomycin and then incubated in the same medium containing 40 μCi/ml [3H] mannose for 45 min (10Hirose S.

After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, lipids were extracted, followed by partition into n-butanol (10Hirose S. Prince G.M. Sevlever D. Ravi L. Rosenberry T.L. Ueda E. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16968-16974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the effect of YW3548/BE49385A on GPI synthesis in mammalian cells, cells were incubated overnight in a medium containing 10 μm YW3548/BE49385A, followed by mannose labeling and lipid extraction, as described above. Glycolipids were separated on Kiesel gel 60 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:water (10:10:3) and detected by a Fuji BAS1500 image analyzer (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan) or x-ray film. In some cases, the glycolipids were treated with GPI-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) (26Tsujioka H. Misumi Y. Takami N. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and jack bean α-mannosidase (Sigma) before TLC analysis. Microsomes were prepared from 2 × 107 cells treated with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 5 h. For this, cells were lysed hypotonically in 20 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4) and homogenized. Supernatant after 10,000 × g centrifugation were spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the membranes were resuspended in 50 μl of Buffer A (50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm TLCK and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and stored at −80 °C until use. The microsomes (50 μl) were incubated with 50 μl of reaction Buffer B (100 mmHEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 15 mmMgCl2, 15 mm MnCl2, 3 mm AMP, 30 μm palmitoyl CoA, 3 μg/ml tunicamycin, 0.2 mm TLCK, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) and 50 μl (2 μCi) of GDP-[3H]mannose (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h at 37 °C. A synthetic substrate, GlcN-PI(C8), was dissolved in 0.03% Triton X-100 (19Doerrler W.T. Ye J. Falck J.R. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27031-27038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and 100 ng was added to the reaction. Pig-n knockout F9 cells were stably transfected with a cDNA of GST-tagged Pig-n (22Hong Y. Ohishi K. Watanabe R. Endo Y. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18582-18588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of GPI in the transfectant cells was restored to normal, indicating that the tagged protein was functional. Transfectant cells (3 × 108) were lysed in a solution consisting of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm TLCK, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin by homogenization. After treatment with 1 μg/ml DNase I for 20 min on ice, unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were further separated into pellets (P10) and supernatants by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants after 10,000 × g centrifugation were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h and separated into pellets (P100) and supernatants (S100). Pellets were dissolved in 1% Nonidet P-40 and 150 mm NaCl. Nonidet P-40 was also added to S100 to 1%. GST-tagged Pig-n was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads and Western-blotted against anti-GST antibodies (22Hong Y. Ohishi K. Watanabe R. Endo Y. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18582-18588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In some experiments, P100 fractions were further separated with sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described. Membranes were collected from subfractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h and dissolved in 1% Nonidet P-40 and 150 mm NaCl. GST-tagged Pig-n was assessed as above. Subfractions were characterized by assaying membrane marker enzymes, alkaline phosphodiesterase I for the plasma membrane, α-mannosidase II for the Golgi, and dolichol phosphate mannose synthase for the ER, as described (27Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). pGal-MCD4 was constructed with the full-lengthMCD4 coding sequence (28Mondesert G. J. C.D. Reed S.I. Genetics. 1997; 147: 421-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) amplified from genomic DNA by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and the primers (upstream) 5′-CAAAGCATTCTAGAGCCTTAGG and (downstream) 5′-CAACAGGTAGCATGCCCCTGTC. Primer sequences included substitutions that incorporated restriction sites for XbaI and PaeI in the upstream and downstream primers, respectively. The PCR-generated fragment was subcloned into theXbaI-PaeI site of the vector pSEYC68 (pGal), which contains the GAL1/10 promoter cloned at theEcoRI-BamHI site. JKG cells (Gal +, leu2,ura3, trp1, his4) and JKG cells containing pGal-GPI10 (8Sutterlin C. Escribano M.V. Gerold P. Maeda Y. Mazon M.J. Kinoshita T. Schwarz R.T. Riezman H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or pGal-MCD4 were grown to saturation in either YGal medium (2% (w/v) galactose, 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 40 mg/liter each of adenine, uracil, leucine, tryptophan, and histidine) or YPAUD medium (5% (w/v) glucose, 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 40 mg/liter each of adenine, uracil, leucine, tryptophan, and histidine). Plates containing 10 ml of YGal or YPAUD medium in 2.0% agar were spread with indicated amounts of YW3548 in 200 μl of methanol. Serial 10-fold cell dilutions (5-μl spots containing 101–105 cells) were then applied to the plates. Growth was determined visually after 5 days of incubation at 30 °C, with survivorship scored as the greatest cell dilution exhibiting growth. We obtained a cDNA of Pig-n, a mouse Mcd4p homologue, from a testis library. The cDNA (4040 nucleotides not counting a poly(A) tract) encodes a 931-amino acid protein having the same number of amino acids as and 87% amino acid identity with human Mcd4p homologue (13Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It has 35% amino acid identity with yeast Mcd4p (13Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The GenBankTM accession number of Pig-n is AB030279. There was no information on chromosomal location of Pig-n in data bases, but human MCD4 homologue has been mapped to chromosome 18q21.2 (29Schuler G.D. et al.Science. 1996; 274: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). We then analyzed subcellular localization of Pig-n protein. For this, we transfected a cDNA of GST-tagged Pig-n into Pig-nknockout F9 cells. We used differential centrifugation to fractionate the cells into P10 (10,000 × g pellet), P100 (100,000 × g pellet), and S100 (100,000 ×g supernatant). GST-tagged Pig-n was detected mainly in P100, which contains plasma membrane, Golgi apparatus, and ER (Fig.1 A, lane 2). Only small amounts were found in P10 containing mitochondria and lysosomes (Fig.1 A, lane 1) and S100 containing cytoplasm (lane 3). After further fractionation of P100 by sucrose density centrifugation, GST-tagged Pig-n was detected mainly in an ER-containing subfraction of P100, fraction 5 (Fig. 1 B). Using the 5′ region of Pig-n cDNA as a probe, we obtained 14 genomic clones, mapped them, and sequenced around the exons (GenBankTM accession numbers for the genomic sequences areAB030308 to AB030316). They contained 14 exons spanning about 25 kb that corresponded to only one-third of Pig-n cDNA at the 5′ end, indicating that Pig-n gene has at least 15 exons (Fig. 2 B, center). The initiation codon was within exon 4. We constructed two targeting vectors to delete exons 8 and 9 (Fig. 2 A), because they contained a region bearing homology to phosphodiesterases and nucleotide pyrophosphatases. After two successive homologous recombinations in F9 cells, Southern blotting and PCR analyses of genomic DNAs showed complete deletion of these exons (Fig. 2,C and D). Because this disruption would cause a frameshift from exon 7, a double knockout mutant should not produce functional Pig-n protein. To test whether Pig-n knockout cells lack the ability to add EtNP to Man1, we used a synthetic substrate, GlcN-PI(C8). It was reported that incubation of GlcN-PI(C8) with CHO cell membranes in the presence of palmitoyl-CoA and GDP-mannose resulted in inositol-acylation and mannosylation of the GlcN, generating Man-GlcN-(acyl)PI(C8) (19Doerrler W.T. Ye J. Falck J.R. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27031-27038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When we incubated GlcN-PI(C8) with membranes of F9 cells in the presence of palmitoyl-CoA and GDP-[3H] mannose, GlcN-PI(C8) was converted to radiolabeled Man-GlcN-(acyl)PI(C8), termed H2(C8) (Fig.3 A, lanes 3 and 4) and further to a more polar product (marked H5(C8)). As shown in Fig.3 B, H2(C8) was sensitive to jack bean α-mannosidase, whereas H5(C8) was resistant (lanes 1 and 2), which was consistent with the idea that H2(C8) was further modified by EtNP on mannose, generating H5(C8). This idea was also consistent with reports that synthetic dipalmitoyl GlcN-PI was converted to EtNP-Man-GlcN-(acyl)PI in a similar cell-free system with HeLa cell membranes (30Sharma D.K. Smith T.K. Crossman A. Brimacombe J.S. Ferguson M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Smith T.K. Sharma D.K. Crossman A. Dix A. Brimacombe J.S. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6667-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When membranes of Pig-n knockout F9 cells were used, GlcN-PI(C8) was converted to H2(C8) but not to H5(C8) (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and 6). This H2(C8) was sensitive to α-mannosidase, as expected (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and4). Therefore, Pig-n knockout cells are defective in the transfer of EtNP to Man1. To aid identification of endogenous mannolipids, we used membranes of Lec35 cells. Lec35 cells accumulate GlcN-(acyl)PI due to a defect in usage of dolichol phosphate mannose (18Camp L.A. Chauhan P. Farrar J.D. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6721-6728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon incubation of the membrane with GDP-[3H]mannose, GlcN-(acyl)PI was efficiently converted to H2 (Man-GlcN-(acyl)PI), H4 (Man3-GlcN-(acyl)PI), and H5 (EtNP-Man-GlcN-(acyl)PI) (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and 2; see Fig.4 for structures). GlcN-PI(C8) was also converted to H2(C8) and H5(C8) with membranes of Lec35 cells (Fig.3 A, lane 2). Membranes of Pig-n knockout F9 cells accumulated more H2 and H4 than wild-type F9 membranes (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 5). These profiles of endogenous mannolipids were also consistent with our conclusion thatPig-n knockout cells are defective in the transfer of EtNP to Man1. We next analyzed the biosynthesis of GPI anchor precursors in Pig-nknockout F9 cells (Fig. 5). ThePig-n knockout F9 cells cultured in radiolabeled mannose had a different profile of mannolipids compared with wild-type F9 cells (Fig. 5, lanes 3 versus 5). Mannolipids seen in the wild-type F9 cells (Fig. 5, lane 3) were identified by comparing them with those in class B (lane 1) and class F (lane 2) mutant cells (15Puoti A. Desponds C. Fankhauser C.

The Gaa1 knockout F9 cells (lane 4) accumulated various GPI intermediates due to a lack of GPI transamidase (see Fig. 4 for structures of GPI intermediates). The wild-type F9 cells had two major mannolipids H3 and H8, and several minor species (Fig. 5, lane 3). H8 is a form of precursors of GPI anchor that can be transferred to proteins and has EtNP side chains on both Man1 and Man2 as well as the terminal EtNP on Man3. Unlike the wild-type cells, Pig-n knockout cells did not have H8, but instead had a major mannolipid with a higher mobility than H8 (Fig. 5, lane 5). We termed this H7′ because it was between positions of H8 and H7, another form of immediate precursors of GPI anchor bearing EtNP on Man1 and Man3. Below H7′, there was a minor new spot termed H7” (lane 5). The Pig-n knockout cells also had a prominent spot of H4 that was not seen in the wild-type cells (lanes 3 and 5). Upon stable transfection of Pig-n cDNA into Pig-nknockout F9 cells, accumulation of H4 and H7′ was greatly reduced, and H7” disappeared with the appearance of H8 (lane 6), indicating restoration of normal GPI biosynthesis. Incomplete disappearance of H4 and H7′ was probably due to the presence of some cells that expressed the drug resistance gene but not Pig-n. Mock transfection did not restore normal GPI biosynthesis (lane 7). To characterize H7′ and H7”, which appeared after disruption ofPig-n, we treated mannolipids from Pig-n knockout cells with GPI-PLD and jack bean α-mannosidase (Fig.6). As a reference, we similarly treated mannolipids from Gaa1 knockout cells. Both H7′ and H7” were sensitive to GPI-PLD, confirming that they are GPI species (Fig.6 A, lanes 3 and 4). Similarly, H7 and H8 seen inGaa1 knockout cells were sensitive to GPI-PLD (lanes 1 and 2). H7 and H8 were resistant to α-mannosidase, as was expected (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1 and 2) because their terminal mannoses bear EtNP. H7′ was also resistant (lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that its terminal mannose had EtNP. H3 and H4 were sensitive, consistent with their structures (Fig.6 B, lanes 2 and 4). H7”, although it was faint (lane 3), was also sensitive. Based on these results, we speculate that H7′ has three mannoses and EtNPs on Man 2 and Man3 but not on Man1, and that H7” has an extra mannose, Man4 (Fig. 4). These speculated structures of most polar GPI species in Pig-nknockout cells are consistent with the idea that these cells are defective in the addition of EtNP to Man1 but still capable of generating further modified GPI species. Next, we assessed the surface expression of Thy-1, a GPI-anchored protein on Pig-n knockout cells. Double knockout cells still expressed Thy-1 on the cell surface (Fig.7, right panel). The expression of Thy-1 on double knockout cells was lower than those on wild-type F9 (left panel) and single knockout (center panel) cells. Therefore, the cell surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins was only partially affected in the absence of EtNP on Man1.

More recently, JIP-1 was proposed to function as a scaffold protein by complexing specific components of the JNK signaling pathway, namely JNK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7, and mixed lineage kinase 3. We have identified the human homologue of JIP-1 that contains a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain in addition to a JNK binding domain and an Src homology 3 domain. To identify binding targets for the hJIP-1 PTB domain, a mouse embryo cDNA library was screened using the yeast two-hybrid system. One clone encoded a 191-amino acid region of the neuronal protein rhoGEF, an exchange factor for rhoA. Overexpression of rhoGEF promotes cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell rounding in NIE-115 neuronal cells. The interaction of JIP-1 with rhoGEF was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of these proteins from lysates of transiently transfected HEK 293 cells. Using glutathione S-transferase rhoGEF fusion proteins containing deletion or point mutations, we identified a putative PTB binding site within rhoGEF. This binding site does not contain tyrosine, indicating that the JIP PTB domain, like that of Xll α and Numb, binds independently of phosphotyrosine. Several forms of endogenous JIP-1 protein can be detected in neuronal cell lines. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis localized endogenous JIP-1 to the tip of the neurites in differentiated NIE-115 and PC12 cells.

PTB domains have since been found in several functionally unrelated proteins, including X11, Numb, and Disabled (4Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Structurally, the PTB domain is similar to the pleckstrin homology domain forming a β-sandwich capped by an α-helix (5Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and several amino acids within the domain have been found to be critical for interaction with the consensus binding motif (6Yajnik V. Blaikie P. Bork P. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1813-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Lai V.K. Stephens R.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The identification of additional PTB-containing proteins and their binding targets has revealed that phosphorylation of the tyrosine within this motif is not required by all PTB domains for their binding. For example, the PTB domain of the X11 family of proteins does not require phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within this motif found on the amyloid precursor protein (8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PTB domain of the mammalian Numb (mNUMB) protein has been shown to interact with the protein LNX (ligand of Numb proteinX) independent of tyrosyl phosphorylation (9Dho S.E. Jacob S. Wolting C.D. French M.B. Rohrschneider L.R. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9179-9187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereasDrosophila Numb (dNUMB) interacts with Numb-associated kinase (NAK) through a motif that does not contain tyrosine (10Chien C.T. Wang S. Rothenberg M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is apparent that the function of PTB domains is not restricted to interactions with tyrosine-phosphorylated partners but plays a more general role in the organization of protein complexes. To further analyze the role of PTB domain proteins in cellular signaling, we have cloned and characterized the human homologue of the JNK interacting protein-1 (JIP-1). The murine JIP-1 (mJIP-1) was initially reported to act as a cytoplasmic inhibitor of the JNK family of kinases (11Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). More recently, JIP-1 was found to interact with mitogen-activated protein kinase 7, mixed lineage kinase 3, or DLK, as well as JNK1 and JNK2 (12Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Coexpression of JIP-1 and JNK with mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 or mixed lineage kinase 3 increased JNK activation, presumably by facilitating formation of the JNK activating complex (12Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). An additional form of JIP-1 has been reported in mouse (JIP-1b) (12Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), rat (islet-brain 1) (13Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1843-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and human (14Mooser V. Maillard A. Bonny C. Steinmann M. Shaw P. Yarnall D.P. Burns D.K. Schorderet D.F. Nicod P. Waeber G. Genomics. 1999; 55: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which contains a 47-amino acid insertion completing a carboxyl-terminal PTB domain. The rat JIP-1, referred to as islet-brain 1, was found to be nuclear as well as cytoplasmic and to function as a transactivator of the GLUT2 gene (13Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1843-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid system to identify binding partners for the hJIP-1 PTB, we identified the protein rhoGEF. RhoGEF is highly expressed in neuronal tissues and specifically interacts with rhoA (15Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Activation of rhoA by stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid results in stress fiber formation and cytoskeletal contraction (16Symons M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar,17Machesky L.M. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In N1E-115 cells, activation of rhoA or overexpression of rhoGEF results in neurite retraction and cell rounding (15Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this study, we have defined the JIP-1 PTB binding site on rhoGEF. Similar to the binding site on the dNumb PTB binding partner NAK, the rhoGEF binding site is related to the traditional PTB Ψ-X-Asn-Pro-X-Tyr(P) motif but lacks a tyrosine residue at the 0 position. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis demonstrates that endogenous JIP-1 is localized to the tip of the neurite extensions in differentiated N1E-115 and PC12 cells. These results suggest that in addition to its interaction with members of the JNK signaling cascade, JIP-1 interacts with rhoGEF and may localize this complex in order to regulate neuronal morphology or function. The anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 and the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Several antibodies were generated to analyze JIP-1. Polyclonal antibodies 176 and 177 were generated against a carboxyl-terminal peptide with the sequence QFVEYTCPTEDIYLE and used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Polyclonal antibody 152 was generated against a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) JIP-1 Src homology 3 domain (amino acids 482–556) fusion protein. Antibody 152 was affinity-purified and used for immunofluorescence. Polyclonal antibody 187 was generated against a GST-rhoGEF (amino acids 1424–1615) fusion protein. pAS2–1 JIP-1 PTB used in the two-hybrid screen was constructed by PCR amplification of the JIP-1 PTB domain (amino acids 554–711) and subsequent cloning into theNcoI site of pAS2–1 to create a Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion protein. pAS2–1 JIP-1 PTBF691V was generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis from the wild-type pAS2–1 JIP-1 PTB. X11 α PTB was described in Ref. 8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar. Myc-JIP-1 was generated by PCR amplification of JIP-1 (encoding amino acids 307–711) using primers engineered with EcoRI sites to allow for cloning into an RK5-Myc vector (8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). HA-rhoGEF was kindly provided by Wouter Moolenaar and described in Ref. 15Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O.

GST-rhoGEF was constructed by digesting the rhoGEF containing prey plasmid pACT with NotI and cloning this fragment into pGEX 4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-rhoGEF deletion mutants were constructed by PCR amplification of the regions indicated and cloned into pGEX 4T1. All GST-rhoGEF point mutations were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. All constructs were sequenced using Sequenase, version 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corp.), or sequenced by the University of Michigan sequencing core. The yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out essentially as described in Refs. 18Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J.

Briefly, Y190 cells were transformed with pAS2–1 JIP-1 PTB, and yeast expressing the bait were selected for growth on medium lacking tryptophan. Y190 JIP-1 PTB yeast were subsequently transformed with a mouse embryo (day 9 and 10) two-hybrid library (kindly provided by Ann Vojtek, University of Michigan) (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Positive interacting clones were selected for growth on plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine supplemented with 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. Histidine-positive colonies were subsequently tested for β-galactosidase activity. To confirm specificity of the interacting plasmids, the β-galactosidase-positive clones were recovered and retransformed into Y190 expressing the wild-type JIP-1 PTB, JIP-1 PTBF691V, or X11 α PTB. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and mouse N1E-115 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 100 units of penicillin ml−1 and 100 μg of streptomycin sulfate ml−1 and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. N1E-115 cells were morphologically differentiated by growth in serum-free DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 2–3 days. PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM plus antibiotics, supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum and 2.5% horse serum. PC12 cells were differentiated by growth in DMEM plus antibiotics, supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor. For transfections, 293 cells were seeded the day before at approximately 106 cells/10-cm plate. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of DNA using the calcium phosphate method (21Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice in cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml and 10 μg of leupeptin/ml. For immunoprecipitations, lysates (4.5 mg) were incubated with anti-Myc (9E10), anti-HA (12CA5), or anti-JIP-1 (177) and protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed three times in HNTG (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100), boiled in 1× sample buffer, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Transfer to nitrocellulose and immunoblotting using anti-Myc, anti-HA, and horseradish peroxidase-anti-mouse antibody were performed as described elsewhere (22Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Nelson K. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4403-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Endogenous rhoGEF and immunoprecipitated endogenous JIP-1 were detected by immunoblotting with anti-rhoGEF (187, 1:1000) and anti-JIP-1 (176, 1:1000), respectively. Blots were visualized using chemiluminescence (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products). GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (22Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Nelson K. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4403-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated with GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with HNTG, boiled in 1× sample buffer, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Ponceau Red staining of the nitrocellulose membrane verified the presence of comparable amounts of GST fusion proteins. Differentiated and proliferating N1E-115 or PC12 cells were seeded on acid-washed coverslips. For PC12, cells the coverslips were coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) and matrigel (Collaborative Research). Cells were fixed to the coverslips with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× phosphate-buffered saline with 10 mm glycine. Coverslips were blocked in 100% goat serum for 1 h then incubated with affinity-purified anti-JIP-1 (152) in phosphate-buffered saline/glycine/2% goat serum (1:250 dilution) for 1 h in a humidified chamber. Coverslips were rinsed then incubated with goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:500 dilution, Molecular Probes) in 1× phosphate-buffered saline/glycine/2% goat serum for 1 h in a humidified chamber. Coverslips were mounted to slides with Prolong (Molecular Probes) and analyzed with an Olympus BX60 fluorescent microscope. Digital images were taken with a SPOT CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.). We first identified the PTB domain of human JIP-1 as an expressed sequence tag following a data base search for sequences similar to the PTB domain of Shc (4Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). JIP proteins have been identified from several species (11Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1843-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, we have identified a Caenorhabditis elegans JIP located on chromosome III, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for the JIP family of proteins. Fig.1 shows an alignment of the JIP family of PTB domains. Based on alignment, several highly conserved sequences (indicated by boxes) represent predicted regions of secondary structure important for the formation of the β sandwich motif of the PTB domain (5Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In order to further characterize the role of PTB-containing proteins in the organization of cellular signaling complexes, we sought to identify binding partners for the highly conserved PTB domain of JIP-1. The hJIP-1 PTB-Gal4 fusion protein was expressed in yeast and selected for growth on media lacking tryptophan. Yeast positive for the expression of the hJIP-1 PTB were subsequently transformed with a mouse embryo (day 9 and 10) two-hybrid library (20Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Positive interacting clones were selected for growth on plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and subsequently tested for β-galactosidase activity. To confirm the specificity of the interaction, we coexpressed positive clones with the wild-type hJIP-1 PTB, hJIP-1 PTBF691Vmutant, or X11α PTB domain. Phenylalanine 691 of JIP-1 represents a highly conserved amino acid in PTB domains that when mutated inhibits PTB domain function (5Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10381-10388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Only clones that specifically interacted with the wild-type hJIP-1 PTB but not the mutant PTB domain were analyzed. A total of 9 × 107 clones were screened. Four clones that specifically interacted with the wild-type JIP-1 PTB were identified, the strongest of which encoded a 191-amino acid region of the neuronal protein rhoGEF, an exchange factor for rhoA (15Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Yeast expressing the rhoGEF plasmid and each of the PTB plasmids grew on media lacking leucine and tryptophan (Fig.2, top panel), whereas positive interaction resulted in growth on −Leu/−Trp/−His plates (middle panel) and β-galactosidase activity (bottom panel). Interaction was only observed between the wild-type JIP-1 PTB and rhoGEF as demonstrated by expression of the histidine and β-galactosidase reporters. This indicates that the interaction of rhoGEF is specific for a functional JIP-1 PTB domain. We next evaluated the ability of JIP-1 and rhoGEF to interact when expressed together in the context of a eukaryotic cell. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 (vector control), rhoGEF containing an HA epitope tag, and/or a Myc-tagged form of JIP-1. Lysates were collected 48 h after transfection and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA (Fig. 3, top panel) or anti-Myc (bottom panel). Immunoprecipitation of the Myc-tagged JIP-1 with anti-Myc antibodies coimmunoprecipitated the HA-tagged rhoGEF (Fig. 3, top panel, right lane). Conversely, immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged rhoGEF resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of this Myc-JIP-1 (bottom panel, right lane). Initial characterization of the PTB domain found that this domain targeted sequences containing a Ψ-X-Asn-Pro-X-Tyr(P) (where Ψ is a hydrophobic residue) motif. This consensus motif was not present in the 191 amino acids of rhoGEF encoded by the yeast two-hybrid clone. RhoGEF contains several domains, including a leucine-rich region, a cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motif, and a Dbl-homologous domain next to a pleckstrin homology domain, all of which are commonly found in guanine nucleotide exchange factors (15Gebbink M.F.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid clone represents amino acids 1424–1615 of rhoGEF; this region contains the carboxyl-terminal end of a potential α-helical coiled-coil structure (15Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In order to define the location of the JIP-1 PTB binding site, deletions of this 191-amino acid region were generated and expressed as GST fusion proteins. The ability of these deletion and point mutants to interact with JIP-1 was analyzed. Fig. 4 A displays a schematic diagram of the GST-rhoGEF fusion proteins used in binding site localization analysis. Lysates from 293 cells transiently transfected with pRK5 (vector alone) or Myc-JIP-1 (amino acids 307–711) were incubated with GST, GST-rhoGEF 1424–1615, or deletion mutants 1424–1554, 1424–1489, or 1543–1615. Binding was observed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc. As expected, GST-rhoGEF 1424–1615 was able to bind Myc-tagged JIP-1 (Fig. 4 B); however, a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal one-third of this region (1424–1554) resulted in a loss of binding. A GST fusion protein of this carboxyl-terminal portion (1543–1615) was able to interact with JIP-1. To identify the exact binding site, we targeted asparagine residues within this carboxyl-terminal portion (1543–1615). The presence of an asparagine residue in the binding site has been shown to be critical for the binding of other PTB domains due to direct interaction of a conserved phenylalanine in the PTB domain with the asparagine residue (5Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). All of the residues subjected to site-directed mutagenesis are indicated in Fig. 4 A. These mutations were made in the context of the GST fusion protein rhoGEF 1424–1615. Fig. 4 C indicates that mutation of asparagine 1590 to alanine (N1580A) did not inhibit the binding of GST-rhoGEF to Myc-JIP-1; however, mutation of asparagine 1565 to alanine severely impaired the ability of rhoGEF to interact with JIP-1. Additional residues around asparagine 1565 were targeted for site-directed mutagenesis based on their position in respect to the previously defined Ψ-X-Asn-Pro-X-Tyr(P) motif or their conservation among other JIP-1 PTB interacting clones identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen. Fig. 4 Ddemonstrates that phenylalanines 1563 and 1568 were both critical for the binding of rhoGEF to JIP-1. Phenylalanine 1563 corresponds to the conserved hydrophobic residue at the −5 position in the Ψ-X-Asn-Pro-X-Tyr(P) motif, whereas phenylalanine 1568 corresponds to the tyrosine residue at the 0 position. Therefore, the JIP-1 PTB binding site on rhoGEF does not conform to the classical Ψ-X-Asn-Pro-X-Tyr(P) PTB binding site. Fig. 5 represents a list of PTB domains and some of their target binding sites. It is clear that several recently characterized PTB domains have binding sites that do not fit the original consensus Ψ-X-Asn-Pro-X-Tyr(P) motif yet are similar to this sequence. The binding site on rhoGEF is most closely related to the dNumb PTB binding site on NAK. In the case of the NAK and rhoGEF binding sites, a hydrophobic residue at the −5 position and the asparagine residue at the −3 position are still required; however, a phenylalanine residue can substitute for the tyrosine residue at the 0 position. Interestingly, the JIP-1 PTB domain is most closely related to the PTB domain of dNumb, suggesting that related PTB domains may fall into groups that target similar binding sites. When overexpressed in 293 cells, JIP-1 is cytoplasmic, consistent with previous findings (11Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). We were interested in investigating the subcellular localization of endogenous JIP-1. Although detected in several tissues, rhoGEF and JIP-1 are both predominately expressed in the brain (11Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 15Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Several forms of JIP-1 are detectable in neuronal cells (Fig.6 A). In the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-F1, endogenous JIP-1 can be detected migrating 115 kDa, consistent with the reported size for the pancreatic form of JIP-1, islet-brain 1 (13Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1843-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). No JIP-1 proteins were detected in undifferentiated PC12 cells; however, in differentiated PC12 cells two proteins were found to be immunoreactive with our anti-JIP-1 antibodies, including the previously reported 115-kDa form and an additional protein migrating at 180 kDa. In mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells JIP-1 proteins are detected in both differentiated and undifferentiated cells with differentiated cells displaying a new form, JIP-1*, which we have determined by phosphatase treatment to be a phosphorylated form of the 115-kDa JIP-1 protein (data not shown). These JIP proteins are specifically detected with two independent antibodies (152 and 177), and in the case of the peptide antibody (177), they can be specifically competed with the antigenic peptide (data not shown). The 200-kDa rhoGEF protein is expressed in both PC12 and N1E-115 cells, with a slight increase in protein expression in differentiated cells (Fig. 6 B). However, due to the relatively low level of expression of JIP-1 and rhoGEF in these cell lines, we have been unable to detect coimmunoprecipitation of endogenously expressed rhoGEF with JIP-1. In order to gain insight into the possible role that JIP-1 plays in neuronal cells, we investigated the localization of endogenous JIP-1 in N1E-115 and PC12 cells by indirect immunofluorescence. Endogenous JIP-1 was detected in N1E-115 and PC12 cells with an affinity-purified antibody raised against the Src homology 3 domain of JIP-1 and visualized by the use of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. Fig.7 shows that in proliferating N1E-115 and PC12 cells anti-JIP-1 displays diffuse cytoplasmic staining (A and D); however, upon differentiation, JIP-1 becomes concentrated at the tip of the extending neurites (B, C, E, and F). This staining is specific and can be competed using the antigen used to generate the antibody (152). In addition, a second antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal peptide from JIP yielded similar results (data not shown). JIP-1 was not detected in the nucleus. We have cloned the human homologue of JIP-1 and have identified rhoGEF as a binding target for the PTB domain. Using point mutants, we have identified the amino acids on rhoGEF involved in binding to the JIP-1 PTB. This binding site is similar to the consensus PTB binding site but does not require tyrosyl phosphorylation for binding. An evaluation of currently identified PTB-containing proteins reveals that PTB binding to phosphorylated targets may be a specialized function of a subset of PTB domains. The PTB domains of Shc and insulin receptor substrate-1 have been found to require phosphorylation of their binding targets (1Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The binding of the PTB domains of X11 α, Numb, and now JIP-1 all occur independently of tyrosyl phosphorylation (8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 9Dho S.E. Jacob S. Wolting C.D. French M.B. Rohrschneider L.R. McGlade C.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Of the PTB domains characterized to date, the PTB domain of JIP-1 is most similar to that of Numb (28% identical), suggesting that similar PTB domains may bind similar sequences. Northern blot analysis reveals that, like rhoGEF, JIP-1 is expressed in the brain (11Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 15Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and we have shown that endogenous JIP-1 is detected in both PC12 and N1E-115 neuronal cell lines. Sequence analysis of JIP-1 indicates that it lacks any known catalytic domains. Based on its subcellular localization in differentiated neurons, it is likely that one function of JIP-1 may be to localize rhoGEF either away from or into position to interact with its target rhoA. In N1E 115 cells, rhoA facilitates neurite retraction following cellular stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid or other G protein-coupled receptor agonists (25Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Postma F.R. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 247-255PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 27Postma F.R. Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2388-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in N1E 115 cells, rhoA translocates to the plasma membrane upon activation (28Kranenburg O. Poland M. Gebbink M. Oomen L. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2417-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). JIP-1 may localize a rhoA activation complex to the tip of the extending neurite so that it is poised to initiate neurite retraction upon the proper signaling cue. The small GTPases rac1 and cdc42, as well as rhoA, have all been implicated in the dynamic process of dendritic growth and remodeling, which requires neurite outgrowth and growth cone collapse in response to inhibitory or promoting cues (29Threadgill R. Bobb K. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar,30Kuhn T.B. Brown M.D. Wilcox C.L. Raper J.A. Bamburg J.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When JIP-1 alone or JIP-1 and rhoGEF, are overexpressed with rhoA in 293 cells, no effect on rhoA activation is observed. It is possible that JIP-1 plays solely a localization function that cannot be addressed in an overexpression system. Alternatively, a yet to be identified activation signal may be required for activation of the complex. JIP-1 has been reported to serve as a substrate for JNK (11Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) and has recently been reported to serve as a scaffolding protein for the organization of an activating JNK complex (12Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). It has been reported that treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor results in an increase in JNK activity in addition to the well documented increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (31Kobayashi M. Nagata S. Kita Y. Nakatsu N. Ihara S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Ui M. Iba H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saitoh I. Fukui Y. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Differentiation of PC12 by alternative methods, such as expression of constitutively active forms of the heterotrimeric Gq family members, microinjection of activated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, or staurosporine treatment, has also been reported to involve the JNK pathway (33Heasley L.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18261-18266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have observed the phosphorylation of JIP-1 expressed in 293 cells upon activation of the JNK pathway by either coexpression of activated DLK or treatment of the cells with anisomycin. 2D. Meyer and B. Margolis, unpublished observations. This phosphorylation does not influence the ability of JIP-1 to interact with JNK, DLK, or rhoGEF. It is possible that the phosphorylation of JIP-1 may serve as a signal for its translocation to extending neurites. In N1E 115 cells, we consistently see a phosphorylated form of JIP-1 upon differentiation. Interestingly, DLK, which has been reported to directly interact with JIP-1 (12Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), is also localized to the neurite extensions, as well as the nucleus, in differentiated NIE-115 cells. 3D. Meyer and L. Holzman, unpublished observations. The localization of endogenous rhoGEF in differentiated neurons could not be determined due to the lack of a rhoGEF antibody suitable for immunofluorescence. Further investigation is required to determine which form of JIP-1 is present at the neurite tips and what other JIP-1 interacting proteins may colocalize to this region. What might be the possible reason for the inclusion of rhoGEF in the JIP/JNK complex? Recently, two rhoA-specific exchange factors, mNET1 and Lfc, have been reported to activate the JNK signaling pathway (36Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,37Glaven J.A. Whitehead I. Bagrodia S. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2279-2285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The activation of JNK by an activated form of mNET1 occurred independently of rhoA activation. In the case of Lfc, activation of JNK appears to occur in the absence of rac activation although binding of Lfc to rac was observed. Because mNET1, Lfc, and rhoGEF are related rhoA-specific exchangers, it is possible that the binding of an activated form of rhoGEF to JIP may serve to enhance JNK activity. At this point, we have been unable to detect any effect of JIP-1 and/or rhoGEF on rhoA-mediated JNK activation in 293 or Cos cells. The p190 rhoGEF used in these studies is unactivated, which may result in a lack of effect on JNK activation. Due to its low level of expression, JIP-1 can interact with only a fraction of the JNK proteins available in the cell, and therefore, it is unlikely that JIP-1, when expressed at its normal levels, would inhibit JNK signaling. The role of JIP-1 is likely to be that of a localization molecule, serving to recruit members of a signaling complex to developing neurites. Future work will address the possible function of this specific localization in either neurite outgrowth and retraction or neuronal signaling.

PCB is produced in plasma via limited proteolysis of the zymogen, pro-PCB. In this report, we show that the K m (55 nm) for plasmin-catalyzed activation of pro-PCB is similar to the plasma concentration of pro-PCB (50–70 nm), whereas the K m for the thrombin- or thrombin:thrombomodulin-catalyzed reaction is 10–40-fold higher than the pro-PCB level in plasma. Additionally, tissue-type plasminogen activator triggers activation of pro-PCB in blood plasma in a reaction that is stimulated by a neutralizing antibody versusα2-antiplasmin. Together, these results show that plasmin-mediated activation of pro-PCB can occur in blood plasma.

The presence of UH in clots prepared with prothrombin-deficient plasma delays tissue-type plasminogen activator-triggered lysis; this effect of UH on clot lysis is blocked by a PCB inhibitor from potato tubers. These results show that UH accelerates plasmin-catalyzed activation of pro-PCB in plasma and PCB, in turn, stabilizes fibrin against fibrinolysis.

The zymogen of PCB, pro-PCB, is activated by limited proteolysis to expose carboxypeptidase activity directed at C-terminal Lys and Arg residues (3Hendriks D. Wang W. Scharpe S.

Partially degraded fibrin is decorated with C-terminal basic residues that serve to accelerate fibrinolysis by providing binding sites for tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen (Plg), and plasmin (5Suenson E.

The ability of PCB to release C-terminal Lys and Arg residues from partially degraded fibrin thereby exerts an antifibrinolytic effect. Thrombin was shown to activate pro-PCB albeit with low catalytic efficiency (4Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol.

Steady-state kinetics revealed that TM increased the turnover rate (k cat) of the Michaelis-Menten complex, but the Michaelis constant (K m) was essentially unchanged. Trypsin and plasmin were also reported to catalyze pro-PCB activation (4Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin plays a pivotal role in clot dissolution by catalyzing the proteolytic cleavage of fibrin. Plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis is subject to numerous regulatory controls to deter the bleeding diathesis that would accompany unrestricted clot lysis. In this report, we characterize a novel regulatory pathway that acts to suppress fibrinolysis. Activation of pro-PCB by plasmin to generate PCB is a negative feedback mechanism in which plasmin activity serves to dampen its familiar profibrinolytic effect. Furthermore, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were shown to increase markedly the rate of plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation and stabilize PCB activity against spontaneous inactivation. A breach in the integrity of the vasculature will serve to expose GAGs that are present in the extracellular matrix (8Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Hence, the GAG-mediated effects that augment the levels of PCB activity thus inhibiting fibrinolysis could possibly stabilize the clot at sites of vascular injury.

PCB activity was detected by a decrease in A 340 nm due to hydrolysis of FA-AR (13Plummer T.H. Kimmel M.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 108: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Pro-PCB (50 nm) was added to HBSP containing 2 mmCaCl2. Other additions (where indicated) included 10 nm thrombin ± 10 nm TM, 10 nmplasmin, and 10–100 units/ml UH (final volume = 200 μl). The reactions were performed at room temperature. Twenty-μl aliquots were removed at increasing times and quenched with concentrated Laemmli loading buffer (40 μl) containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 12 or 10–20% gradient Tris glycine SDS gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Novex). Membranes were blocked with non-fat dry milk and sequentially treated with sheep anti-pro-PCB IgG and rabbit peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep IgG (Organon Teknika Co., West Chester, PA). Pro-PCB bands were detected with the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Pro-PCB (500 nm) was activated with 25 nm thrombin and 25 nm TM for 40 min at 25 °C. The thrombin activity was subsequently quenched with 200 nm hirudin. The sample was diluted 5-fold in HBSP buffer with and without 200 units/ml UH. At various times, PCB activity was assayed with 720 μm FA-AR using a Shimazu UV-2101PC spectrophotometer. An exponential fit of each data set was used to derive a first-order rate constant (k inact). The half-life of inactivation (t 12) was calculated from the relationship t ½ = 0.693/k inact. Pro-PCB (2 μm) was activated with 500 nm plasmin or 500 nm thrombin + 120 nm TM for 1 h at room temperature in HBSP containing 2 mm CaCl2. Fifty-μl aliquots were removed and quenched with concentrated Laemmli loading buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 12% Tris glycine SDS gel and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Novex). The membrane was briefly stained with Coomassie Blue, and the 35-kDa bands were excised. The N-terminal sequences were determined with an Applied Biosystem Model 494 Protein Sequencer (Foster City, CA). Active-site blocked plasmin (FFR-Pln) was prepared by treating plasmin (10 μm) withd-Phe-l-Phe-l-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (200 μm) in HBSP buffer for 30 min at room temperature. FFR-Pln or plasmin (6 μm) was incubated with PCB (200 nm) at 37 °C in HBSP buffer. At increasing times, 50-μl aliquots were removed, and the PCB activity was quenched with 25 μl of Plummer's inhibitor (10 μm). Samples were lyophilized to dryness, resuspended in 10 μl of borate buffer (0.4 m, pH 10.2), and analyzed for Arg using a Hewlett-Packard Amino Quant II/M High Sensitivity System (which includes a Hewlett-Packard 1090 Liquid Chromatograph with a 2.1 × 200 mm HP Amino Quant column, a Hewlett-Packard 1046A Programmable Fluorescence Detector, and an HPLC Chemstation). Mobile phase A was 20 mm sodium acetate buffer containing 0.018% triethylamine, adjusted to pH 7.2 with 1–2% acetic acid, and 0.3% tetrahydrofuran. Mobile phase B was 20% 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, adjusted to pH 7.2 with 1–2% acetic acid, 40% acetonitrile, and 40% methanol. Primary amino acids in each sample (1-ml aliquots) were subjected to pre-column derivatization with o-phthaldehyde and subsequently detected by fluorescence using excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 450 nm, respectively. Arg eluted in this system at approximately 7.0 min. The amounts of released Arg were interpolated from Arg standard curves. Pro-PCB (500 nm) was activated with 20 nm thrombin and 20 nm TM for 60 min at 25 °C. The thrombin activity was subsequently quenched with 300 nm hirudin. PCB was diluted to 10 nm in HBSP containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 100 nmplasmin. After a 60-min incubation at 25 °C, the PCB activity was quenched with 5 μm Plummer's inhibitor. Ten nm plasmin ± PCB treatment was incubated at room temperature with 50 nm pro-PCB in HBSP buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 5 μm Plummer's inhibitor. Twenty five-μl aliquots were removed at increasing times and quenched with concentrated Laemmli loading buffer (50 μl) containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Twenty-μl aliquots were electrophoresed on a 12% Tris glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. PCB activation was monitored by Western blot analysis as described above. The developed blots were evaluated by densitometric scanning using an Arcus II Scanner (AGFA). Data were analyzed with Adobe Photoshop software and quantified with the NIH Image program (Macintosh version). Pro-PCB (15–1000 nm) was added to HBSP containing 2 mm CaCl2, 5–10 nmplasmin, ±200 units/ml UH, and 5 μm Plummer's inhibitor (50 μl final volume). The reactions were performed at room temperature. Samples with and without UH were quenched at 15 and 30 min, respectively, by adding 20 μl of 5-fold concentrated Laemmli loading buffer. Twenty-μl aliquots were electrophoresed on 12% Tris glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, and the 35-kDa PCB subunit was visualized by Western blot analysis. The developed blots were evaluated by densitometric scanning as described above. PCB that was generated from pro-PCB by thrombin:TM was used as the standard. Samples (50-μl final volume) containing 50 nm pro-PCB, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 nm plasmin, 0.5 mg/ml polysaccharides, and 5 μm Plummer's inhibitor in HBSP buffer were placed at room temperature for 15 min. PCB was assayed by Western blot analysis and densitometry as described above. Biotinylated PCI (Biot-PCI) was prepared with PCI and Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline. The concentration of Biot-PCI was estimated using ε280 nm = 1.27 × 104m−1 cm−1 as deduced from the primary sequence of PCI. Pooled citrated human plasma (700 μl) was mixed with 200 nm Biot-PCI (final volume = 1 ml). Samples were also run in the presence of UH (1 mg/ml) or anti-α2AP monoclonal IgG (150 μg/ml). Pro-PCB activation was triggered by adding t-PA (5 μg/ml), and the reactions were performed at 37 °C. Aliquots (200–300 μl) were removed at increasing times, quenched withd-Phe-l-Phe-l-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (200 μm), transferred to 100 μl of 400 nm Biot-PCI and 100 μl (1:1 slurry of beads:buffer) ofS-ultralink immobilized streptavidin plus beads (Pierce), and rotated at room temperature for 2 h. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were assayed for Plg activation by Western blot analysis using an anti-human Plg IgG. The pellets were washed with HBS, lyophilized, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and assayed for PCB formation by Western blot analysis using the anti-pro-PCB IgG. Samples (final volume = 210 μl) contained 100 μl of prothrombin-deficient citrated human plasma, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.01–0.05 μg/ml t-PA, 0–100 units/ml UH, and 10–100 nm PCI. Clotting was triggered by the addition of 0.5 μg/ml batroxobin. Clot formation and lysis was detected by turbidity changes at 405 nm in PEG-20,000 precoated 96-well microtiter plates (with antifogging agent-coated cover) at 37 °C using a ThermoMax plate reader. Treatment of 50 nm pro-PCB with 10 nm plasmin generates PCB activity as measured by hydrolysis of FA-AR (Fig.1, plot D). In contrast, 10 nm thrombin does not appear to activate pro-PCB during the 1-h treatment period (plot A). Thrombin-mediated activation of pro-PCB is markedly increased in the presence of 10 nmTM (plot H), as shown previously (7Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). TM does not augment plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation (plot E). Pro-PCB activation was also assessed by Western blotting analysis using anti-pro-PCB IgG (Fig. 2). Pro-PCB migrates as a single band with an M r of 60,000 (lane 1). Treatment of pro-PCB with 10 nmthrombin for 10 or 30 min does not alter the mobility of the pro-PCB band (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). However, exposure of pro-PCB to thrombin:TM for 10 and 30 min (lanes 4 and 5, respectively) results in the loss of the 60-kDa band and the concomitant appearance of a 35-kDa PCB subunit protein band. Treatment of pro-PCB with plasmin for 10 and 30 min (lanes 6 and 7, respectively) generates a PCB subunit band that co-migrates with that produced by thrombin:TM. N-terminal sequencing of the 35-kDa PCB subunits generated by thrombin:TM or plasmin was performed to map the actual cleavage sites. The first 7 amino acids obtained for the PCB subunit formed by the action of thrombin:TM (Ala-Ser-Ala-Ser-Tyr-Tyr-Glu) correspond to the sequence previously reported (4Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the thrombin-generated subunit. The plasmin-catalyzed PCB subunit yielded the same N-terminal sequence; hence, both plasmin and thrombin:TM cleave pro-PCB at Arg92-Ala93. The presence of UH (100 units/ml) during the incubation of pro-PCB and plasmin (along with FA-AR) increases the rate of hydrolysis of the PCB substrate (Fig. 1, plot F). UH does not promote thrombin-mediated pro-PCB activation (Fig. 1, plot B). The stimulatory effect of UH on plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation is blocked by histidine-rich glycoprotein, a heparin-binding protein, in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). UH does not alter the activity of PCB toward FA-AR (data not shown). The insensitivity of plasmin-catalyzed small substrate (S-2390) hydrolysis to the presence of UH (data not shown) together with the previously observed binding of UH to pro-PCB (14Broze Jr., G.J. Higuchi D.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3815-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are consistent with the view that binding of UH to pro-PCB increases the susceptibility of pro-PCB to plasmin-catalyzed activation. Western blot analysis provides direct evidence that UH increases the rate of plasmin-mediated processing of pro-PCB. Note the more abundant 35-kDa PCB subunit at 10 and 30 min in the presence of 10 units/ml UH (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 9, respectively) or 100 units/ml (lanes 10 and 11, respectively) when compared with the absence of UH (lanes 6 and 7, respectively). The rates of plasmin-mediated activation of pro-PCB are similar in the presence or absence of calcium, both with and without UH (data not shown). In contrast to this calcium-independent process, pro-PCB activation by thrombin:TM requires calcium (15Sakharov D.V. Plow E.F. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14477-14482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation was evaluated in the presence of increasing concentrations of UH up to 200 units/ml (Fig.3). The stimulatory effect of UH is dose-dependent and saturable. A prominent enhancement of pro-PCB activation is observed with as little as 5 units/ml of UH (plot C). Western blot analysis confirmed that the saturation kinetics does not reflect pro-PCB depletion at the higher UH concentrations (data not shown). Incubation of PCB at 25 °C leads to spontaneous loss of its catalytic activity (7Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 16Wang W. Hendriks D.F. Scharpe S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15937-15944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L.B. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The t 12 for this inactivation process is 74 min (Fig. 4). Thet 12 for the spontaneous inactivation of PCB is increased in the presence of UH (200 units/ml) by 2.3-fold to 170 min. This result suggests that PCB binds UH as does pro-PCB. Incubation of plasmin with catalytic amounts of PCB at 37 °C results in the release of Arg (Fig.5). Release of 1 eq of Arg was expected since Arg is situated at the C terminus of the plasmin A subunit; however, release of greater than stoichiometric amounts of Arg is observed. Release of Arg is slightly accelerated in the presence of UH. Incubation of PCB and active-site blocked plasmin, FFR-Pln, results in a markedly different Arg release profile: the amount of released Arg reaches approximately 0.7 mol of Arg per mol of FFR-Pln. These observations show that plasmin autoproteolysis (a process that should not occur with FFR-Pln) generates additional C-terminal Arg residues that are susceptible to PCB-mediated release. Western blot analysis shows that the rate of plasmin-catalyzed formation of the 35-kDa subunit from pro-PCB is decreased by approximately 3-fold upon pretreatment of the plasmin with PCB (comparelanes 1–5 and 6–10 in Fig.6 A, and the filledand open symbols in Fig. 6 B). Our data showing that PCB catalyzes the release of Arg from plasmin and compromises the ability of plasmin to process pro-PCB corroborate recent results from Nesheim and co-workers (17Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L.B. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Densitometric scanning of the 35-kDa PCB subunit on Western blots was used to derive the kinetic constants for the activation of pro-PCB by plasmin in the absence and presence of UH. The reactions were performed in the presence of the PCB inhibitor, Plummer's inhibitor, to block the inhibitory effect of PCB activity on plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation (as described above). TheK m, k cat, andk cat/K m values of plasmin for pro-PCB are 55 nm, 4.4 × 10−4s−1, and 0.008 μm−1s−1, respectively (Table I). Interestingly, the K m value of plasmin for pro-PCB is comparable to the plasma pro-PCB concentration, 50–70 nm (1Nesheim M.E. Wang W. Boffa M.B. Nagashima M. Morser J. Bajzar L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 18Bajzar M. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data listed in Table I also indicate that the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of plasmin toward pro-PCB is approximately 8-fold greater than that of thrombin alone. Moreover, UH produces a 16-fold increase in catalytic efficiency of plasmin-catalyzed processing of pro-PCB, due largely to an increase in the value of k cat.Table ICharacterization of steady-state kinetics of pro-PCB activationProteaseCofactorK mk catk cat/K mnms−1μm−1s−1ThrombinNone1-aData are from Bajzar et al.

Samples were quenched with concentrated Laemmli loading buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, electrophoresed on 12% Tris glycine SDS gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. PCB formation was measured by immunoblotting with anti-PCB IgG and densitometric scanning the 35-kDa subunit.1-a Data are from Bajzar et al. (7Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Plasmin (5–10 nm) was added to HBSP buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2, 5 μm Plummer's inhibitor, 0–200 units/ml UH, and various concentrations of pro-PCB for 15–30 min at room temperature. Samples were quenched with concentrated Laemmli loading buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, electrophoresed on 12% Tris glycine SDS gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. PCB formation was measured by immunoblotting with anti-PCB IgG and densitometric scanning the 35-kDa subunit. The propensity of UH to stimulate plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation is mimicked by LMWH, the UH derivative (M r = 4,400) that is prepared by controlled chemical degradation (Fig. 1, plot G). LMWH does not promote thrombin-mediated pro-PCB activation (Fig. 1, plot C). A variety of other polysaccharides were also evaluated for their effects on plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation (Fig.7). The final concentration of each agent was 0.5 mg/ml. All values are compared with that exhibited by UH (assigned a value of 100%). The two LMWH species (LMWH 4400 and LMWH 3000) display cofactor activities that are similar to UH. Chondroitin sulfate B (i.e. dermatan sulfate) is superior to both chondroitin sulfate A and chondroitin sulfate C. Dextran sulfate 5000 and 8000 display cofactor activities that are greater than UH. Heparan sulfate and keratan sulfate do not stimulate plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation at 0.5 mg/ml but do so at higher concentrations (data not shown). The apparent potency differences depicted in Fig. 7 may well reflect differences in the affinities of the polysaccharides for pro-PCB. PCB that is generated de novo in plasma can be detected by sequestration with Biot-PCI, capture of PCB:Biot-PCI by immobilized streptavidin, and Western blot analysis using the anti-pro-PCB IgG. The appearance of the 35-kDa band is indicative of pro-PCB activation. The addition of t-PA to Biot-PCI-spiked normal human plasma results in a progressive time-dependent accumulation of PCB (Fig.8 A, lanes 1–3). The extent of the pro-PCB activation is increased in the presence of UH (lanes 4–6). The accumulation of the 35-kDa band is markedly enhanced when the reaction is performed in the presence of a neutralizing antibody versus α2AP (lanes 7–9). Hence, these data reveal that de novo generated plasmin is responsible for pro-PCB activation in t-PA spiked plasma and that the reaction in plasma is accelerated by UH. The extent of Plg activation and concomitant plasmin formation in t-PA-spiked plasma was assessed by Western blot analysis using anti-Plg IgG (Fig. 8 B). Only a small fraction of Plg is converted to plasmin in t-PA-spiked plasma as judged by the formation of relatively low amounts of the plasmin-α2AP complex (Fig. 8 B, lanes 2–4). The presence of UH does not substantially influence the rate of Plg activation (lanes 5–7). This analysis reveals that relatively low amounts of de novo generated plasmin are able to activate pro-PCB in a plasma milieu. The presence of the anti-α2AP IgG causes a marked decrease in the intensity of the Plg band. The absence of a corresponding increase in the plasmin-α2AP complex is expected since this antibody neutralizes α2AP. The accelerated Plg activation observed in the presence of anti-α2AP IgG probably arises because the “longer lived” plasmin activity (due to neutralization of α2AP) converts Glu-Plg to Lys-Plg which is more readily activated by t-PA (19Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2912-2919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted antifibrinolytic effect due to UH-accelerated, plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation was explored in plasma clot lysis experiments. Plasma clot formation was triggered with batroxobin instead of thrombin because the latter is readily neutralized by antithrombin III in the presence of UH. Moreover, prothrombin-deficient plasma was used in order to assess the potential antifibrinolytic activity of UH without a confounding influence ofde novo generated thrombin. The addition of batroxobin to recalcified citrated prothrombin-deficient plasma containing a t-PA spike causes an increase in turbidity that is coincident with clot formation (Fig. 9). The time to reach maximal turbidity (T init) is approximately 30 min. In turn, plasmin that is generated by the action of t-PA on endogenous Plg lyses the plasma clot and decreases the turbidity. The time from maximal turbidity until 50% approach to base line (ΔT) is approximately 30 min. The T init is shortened from 30 to 10 min in the presence of 25 or 100 units/ml UH. Conversely, the ΔT values in the presence of 25 and 100 units/ml UH are prolonged from 30 to 90 and 130 min, respectively. The ability of UH to delay clot lysis is blocked by the PCB inhibitor, PCI, in a dose-dependent manner (compare the lysis profiles with 10 and 100 nm PCI in Fig. 9). PCI in the absence of UH has a much less pronounced stimulatory effect on the rate of clot lysis. This observation may reflect enhanced susceptibility of the uncross-linked fibrin I clot (formed by batroxobin) to plasmin digestion and/or markedly reduced conversion of pro-PCB to PCB in the absence of UH. The ability of PCI to suppress the UH-induced prolongation of clot lysis using prothrombin-deficient plasma shows that UH is stimulating pro-PCB activation in a thrombin-independent manner. The results described earlier indicated that de novo generated plasmin is mediating the activation of pro-PCB in t-PA-spiked plasma. Hence, our studies establish that plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis is suppressed by a negative feedback mechanism involving plasmin-catalyzed pro-PCB activation. PCB suppresses fibrinolysis by releasing C-terminal basic amino acids from partially degraded fibrin thereby down-regulating plasmin production. The UH-stimulated, plasmin-catalyzed activation of pro-PCB thus exerts a negative feedback effect that can limit plasmin formationin vivo. The potential physiological importance of plasmin as a pro-PCB activator is indicated by the steady-state kinetic parameters. The apparent K m values for plasmin-catalyzed activation of pro-PCB in the absence and presence of UH are 55 and 20 nm, respectively; both of these values are similar to the plasma concentration of pro-PCB, 50–70 nm(1Nesheim M.E. Wang W. Boffa M.B. Nagashima M. Morser J. Bajzar L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 18Bajzar M. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the apparent K m value for thrombin-catalyzed activation of pro-PCB, 0.5–2 μm, is 10–40-fold above the plasma concentration of pro-PCB (7Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 20Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine the relative contributions to thein vivo processing of pro-PCB by thrombin, plasmin, and their various macromolecular complexes. We postulate that the binding of UH to pro-PCB alters the conformation and/or charge of pro-PCB thereby making it a more favorable substrate for plasmin. The purported avidity of pro-PCB for UH is concordant with the use of heparin-Sepharose for pro-PCB purification (14Broze Jr., G.J. Higuchi D.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3815-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that UH does not facilitate thrombin-mediated pro-PCB activation. Pro-PCB contains a region (Trp210-Ser221; WKKMRMWRKNRS, where italics indicate basic residues) that is homologous to the heparin-binding sequences, -XBBXBX- (where B and Xrepresent basic and hydrophobic residues, respectively), in GAG-binding proteins (21Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UH may promote plasmin-mediated activation of pro-PCB via an interaction with this domain in pro-PCB. The antifibrinolytic effect of UH that stems from its ability to promote plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation could in theory compromise the pharmacologic utility of UH for thrombotic disorders. The intended anticoagulant effect of UH due to its propensity to serve as a cofactor for antithrombin III would be opposed by the ability of UH to work in concert with plasmin to promote pro-PCB activation. The typical efficacious anticoagulant plasma level of UH (22Hirsh J. Fuster V. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1449-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) is somewhat less than the threshold value, 5 units/ml, that exerts an unambiguous effect on plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation. Nevertheless, the potential impact of this clot-stabilizing effect of UH especially during aggressive anticoagulant therapy with UH is deserving of further investigation. Structural features of polysaccharides that promote plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation can be gleaned from the results shown in Fig. 7. Heparan sulfate which exhibits lower cofactor activity than heparin has fewer O- or N-linked sulfate groups. Dextran sulfate displays the greatest cofactor activity; it is highly decorated with sulfate groups. Keratan sulfate, which contains a galactose residue with a neutral 6-hydroxymethyl group, is a weaker stimulator than chondroitin sulfates A or B, which possess glucuronic acid sugar units with an anionic 6-carboxylate group. These comparisons suggest that the anionic character of the polysaccharide is an important structural determinant of the cofactor activity. The stereochemistry of the polysaccharide also appears to influence the cofactor activity. For instance, chondroitin sulfate B, which contains an iduronic acid with the 5R configuration, is a better cofactor than chondroitin sulfates A and C, which contain glucuronic acid residues with the 5S configuration. UH is a heterogeneous mixture of heavily sulfated, long chain acidic GAGs that is isolated from a variety of different tissue sources. In particular, GAGs are synthesized by endothelial cells and deposited both in the extracellular matrix and on the abluminal cell surface. We propose that plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation and its stimulation by GAGs plays a key role in clot stabilization at sites of vascular injury. Premature lysis of the hemostatic clot at a breach in the integrity of the vasculature must be deterred to avoid hemorrhage. Exposure of GAGs due to vascular damage may well provide a nidus for plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation and help satisfy this need. The GAG-stimulated, plasmin-dependent mechanism for pro-PCB activation is particularly relevant at injury sites where the endothelial cell surface is denuded and TM will be absent. On the other hand, it is desirable to suppress clot extension over adjacent “uninjured” regions that contain an intact endothelial cell surface. At these sites, plasmin-mediated pro-PCB activation may be latent due to the limited GAG exposure, and the fibrin deposited in this region would have a reduced stability. GAG-mediated enhancement of plasmin-catalyzed activation of pro-PCB could thus serve to modulate the life time of fibrin clots in accordance with their proximity to the extracellular matrix thereby promoting hemostasis.

To characterize this specificity we determined a 1.8-Å structure of an E257Q/D229N mutant cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase in complex with its product γ-cyclodextrin, which reveals for the first time how cyclodextrin is competently bound. Across subsites −2, −1, and +1, the cyclodextrin ring binds in a twisted mode similar to linear sugars, giving rise to deformation of its circular symmetry. At subsites −3 and +2, the cyclodextrin binds in a manner different from linear sugars. Sequence comparisons and site-directed mutagenesis experiments support the conclusion that subsites −3 and +2 confer the cyclization activity in addition to subsite −6 and Tyr-195. On this basis, a role of the individual residues during the cyclization reaction cycle is proposed. The enzyme cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase is closely related to α-amylases but has the unique ability to produce cyclodextrins (circular α(1→4)-linked glucoses) from starch. To characterize this specificity we determined a 1.8-Å structure of an E257Q/D229N mutant cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase in complex with its product γ-cyclodextrin, which reveals for the first time how cyclodextrin is competently bound. Across subsites −2, −1, and +1, the cyclodextrin ring binds in a twisted mode similar to linear sugars, giving rise to deformation of its circular symmetry. At subsites −3 and +2, the cyclodextrin binds in a manner different from linear sugars. Sequence comparisons and site-directed mutagenesis experiments support the conclusion that subsites −3 and +2 confer the cyclization activity in addition to subsite −6 and Tyr-195. On this basis, a role of the individual residues during the cyclization reaction cycle is proposed. cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase cyclodextrin B. circulansstrain 251 (3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid) maltose binding site 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol The α-amylase family, or glycosyl hydrolase family 13 (1Henrissat B.

Biol. 1997; 67: 67-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As an illustration, α-amylases hydrolyze α(1→4) glycosidic bonds to produce shorter α(1→4)-linked oligosaccharides. On the other hand, that same α(1→4) glycosidic bond is cleaved by isoamylase (8Katsuya Y. Mezaki Y. Kubota M. Matsuura Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and malto-oligosyltrehalose synthase (9Mukai K. Tabuchi A. Nakada T. Shibuya T. Chaen H. Fukuda S. Kurimoto M. Tsujisaka Y.

Janec̆ek) on the Internet.An especially interesting and unique family 13 enzyme is cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase).1 CGTase forms circular α(1→4)-linked oligoglucosides called cyclodextrins from linear α(1→4)-linked glucans via an intramolecular transglycosylation reaction known as cyclization (see Fig. 1). In addition, CGTase can perform hydrolysis (very poorly) and disproportionation reactions by using water or a free oligosaccharide as respective acceptors. Its ability to perform cyclization has led to the application of CGTases in the industrial production of cyclodextrins (4Pedersen S. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Jensen B.F. Jørgensen S.T. Chemtech. 1995; : 19-25Google Scholar).CGTases are typically 75-kDa proteins consisting of 5 domains (A-E) (10Klein C. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

Bond cleavage occurs between subsites −1 and +1 (see Fig. 1), resulting in an intermediate that is covalently linked to Asp-229 at subsite −1 (7Uitdehaag J.C.M. Mosi R.

During cyclization, CGTase circularizes the linear chain of this intermediate (7Uitdehaag J.C.M. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct.

There it is used as the acceptor sugar and becomes covalently linked to the C1 atom of the sugar at subsite −1 (see Fig.1). We denote this sugar transfer step circularization to distinguish it as a subprocess of cyclization. Astonishingly, circularization requires a 23 Å-movement of the linear chain end (13Strokopytov B.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies covering almost all sugar binding subsites show that specific residues at subsites +2, −3, and −6 contribute to cyclization (reviewed in TableI, see “Discussion”). Of particular importance is the centrally located residue Tyr-195, as was demonstrated in at least 6 different CGTases (Table I).

The complexity of the activities mediated by TGF-β is due, in part, to the complexity of its signaling pathways. Many studies have shown that TGF-β may have two distinct signaling pathways: one that leads to growth inhibition due to cell cycle arrest and another that regulates the expression of a diverse set of genes, including those involved in extracellular matrix regulation and cell-cell interactions. Both pathways are initiated through the binding of TGF-β to its cell-surface receptors, the type I and II receptors, which are transmembrane serine/threonine kinases (1Massague J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The TGF-β ligand directly binds to the type II receptor, which then associates with and phosphorylates the type I receptor. Upon phosphorylation, the type I receptor kinase becomes active and, in turn, phosphorylates a number of downstream effectors, including members of a family of proteins termed SMAD. After phosphorylation by the TGF-β receptor, SMAD2 and SMAD3 form heteromers with SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus to transactivate gene expression. In the majority of tissue types studied, TGF-β induces growth suppression associated with the increased expression or activities of several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, including p15INK4B (2Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar), p21WAF1/CIP1, and p27KIP1. TGF-β has been shown to play a role in many pathological states involving the central nervous system, including neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors. The astrocyte is an important source and target of TGF-β in the brain and plays a vital supportive role in normal brain function. Astrocytes secrete various isoforms of TGF-β in response to many forms of injury, including ischemia, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease (3Flanders K.C. Ren R.F. Lippa C.F. Prog. Neurobiol. ( N. Y. ). 1998; 54: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). TGF-β inhibits astrocyte growth (4Toru-Delbauffe D. Baghdassarian-Chalaye D. Gavaret J.M. Courtin F. Pomerance M. Pierre M. J.

The role of TGF-β in cancer is complex. TGF-β may act as a tumor suppressor in the early stages of tumorigenesis, but subsequently as a tumor stimulator by increasing the invasiveness and survival of tumors due to the effects of TGF-β on local immunosuppression (6Chang H.-L.

Several glioma lines were found to be negatively growth-regulated, whereas others demonstrated enhanced growth in the presence of TGF-β (17Helseth E. Unsgaard G. Dalen A. Randi V. J Neuro-oncol. 1988; 6: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,18Helseth E. Unsgaard G. Dalen A. Randi V. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1988; 26: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The loss of the growth inhibitory response to TGF-β1occurs as the grade of gliomas advances in malignancy (19Jachimczak P. Hessdorfer B. Faebel-Schulte K. Wismeth C. Brysch W. Schlingensiepen K.-H. Bauer A. Blesch A. Bogdahn U. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Jennings M.T.

In addition, the lack of responsiveness to exogenously administered TGF-β in combination with the fact that gliomas secrete TGF-β was considered evidence for the existence of an autocrine loop for growth stimulation. This autocrine mechanism may possibly be involved in the neoplastic transformation and maintenance of growth of glioma cells (19Jachimczak P. Hessdorfer B. Faebel-Schulte K. Wismeth C. Brysch W.

Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 2419-2424PubMed Google Scholar). Even with the research efforts discussed above, many questions remain unanswered about the complex role of TGF-β in the growth regulation of astrocytes and gliomas. Recent studies examined several components of the TGF-β signaling pathway, but failed to find a reliable molecular alteration related to the growth response. We now show that the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CdkI) p15INK4B appears to be an important component of the TGF-β-mediated antiproliferative response in primary astrocytes. SMAD3 appears to be a necessary but not sufficient member of the TGF-β pathway in the induction of p15INK4B. The loss of p15INK4B in gliomas appears to represent an important event in the loss of the growth inhibitory response to TGF-β. Rat and mouse astrocyte cultures were prepared as described previously (22Barnett S. Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 337-349Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Human astrocytes were purchased (Clonetics Corp.) and maintained in Astrocyte Growth Media (Clonetics Corp.). Confirmatory glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry was performed on the astrocytes as described previously (23Vick W.W. Wikstrand C.J. Bullard D.E. Kemshead J. Coakham H.B. Schlom J. Johnston W.W. Bigner D.D. Bigner S.H. Acta Cytol. 1987; 31: 815-824PubMed Google Scholar). The glial fibrillary acidic protein triple monoclonal antibody mixture and the M45.6 mouse IgG control (both generously provided by Carol Wikstrand, Duke University) were used at a concentration of 25 μg/ml. The cells were then treated sequentially with anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at a 1:500 dilution and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:300; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and then diaminobenzidine-stained. The cells were counterstained with hematoxylin. The human glioma cell lines U87MG, T98G, and U373MG were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. D. Bigner provided the human glioma cell lines D54MG, U251MG, D259MG, D270MG, D409MG, D423MG, D538MG, D566MG, and D645MG. The cell lines were maintained in an improved zinc option medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The HaCaT cell line was a gift of P. Boukamp and N. Fusenig (Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Heidelberg, Germany) and was maintained in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated on 12-well plates at a density of 2–3 × 104 cells/well and treated with various concentrations of TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 for the indicated times. The medium was generally supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were labeled for the last 4 h (glioma cell lines) or 6 h (astrocytes) with 4 μCi of [3H]thymidine, fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and lysed in 0.2 n NaOH. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into the DNA was measured with a scintillation counter. Each data point was performed in triplicate. R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) generously provided human TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 ligands. Rat astrocytes were plated on 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well and treated with 100 pmTGF-β1 or TGF-β2 for 24, 48, or 72 h. Cells were then trypsinized, fixed in 70% ethanol, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in RNase A (100 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (50 μg/ml). Samples were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Approximately 5 × 105 glioma cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 pm TGF-β1 for 12 h. Cells were trypsinized, and total cellular RNA was purified using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN Inc.) using the provided instructions. Fifteen μg of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gel and then transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The RNA membrane was UV-cross-linked with 1200 J, prehybridized for 12 h, and hybridized in Church's solution (0.5 mNa2HPO4, 7.5% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2)) with salmon sperm DNA (0.1 mg/ml) and α-32P-labeled probe (1–2 × 106 cpm/ml) at 62 °C overnight. The RNA blot was then washed twice for 20–25 min at 62 °C with 2× SSC and 1% SDS and then once with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS. cDNA inserts for the probe were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, recovered using Geneclean (Bio 101, Inc.), and labeled with [α-32P]dATP using an EZ-Strip DNA kit (Ambion, Inc.). Yue Xiong (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) provided cDNAs for MDM2 and p15INK4B. Harold Moses (Vanderbilt University) provided c-myc cDNA. Scott Kern (The Johns Hopkins University) provided Smad4 cDNA. Kevin Peters (Duke University) provided VEGF cDNA. All blots were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glioma cells were plated on 10-cm culture plates, and astrocytes were plated on 15-cm culture plates, both at a density of 5 × 105 cells/plate. Cells were incubated for various times with 100 pmTGF-β1 or TGF-β2. Plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined, and equal protein amounts of each sample were resolved on an SDS-8% acrylamide and 0.05% bisacrylamide gel for Rb and Cdc25a or an SDS-10–15% acrylamide and 0.05% bisacrylamide gel for all others. Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.). Blocking and antibody incubations were performed in 5% dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. Antibodies used for Western blots were as follows: anti-p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-19), anti-p15INK4B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-20), anti-p16 (Pharmingen 13251A and Santa Cruz Biotechnology M-256), anti-p27 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology F-8), anti-p14ARF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-18), anti-Cdk2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology M-2), anti-PDGF-A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology N-30), anti-PDGF-B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology N-30), anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-19), anti-Rb (Pharmingen 14001A), anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology I-19), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse (Bio-Rad), and rabbit anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Western blots were developed with the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rat astrocyte cells were plated and treated with TGF-β as described for Western blotting. Cdk2 histone H1 assays were performed by first immunoprecipitating Cdk2 with a anti-Cdk2 polyclonal antibody and then subsequently assaying the ability of the immunoprecipitates to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate (histone H1) as described previously (24Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Rat astrocytes were plated on 10-cm plates and infected with adenovirus containing either the cytomegalovirus promoter control (multiplicity of infection = 100) or both adenoviruses containing SMAD3 (multiplicity of infection = 100) and SMAD4 (multiplicity of infection = 500). The viruses were generously provided by Glaxo Wellcome. The cells were exposed to the adenoviruses for 1 h, and then the medium was changed. Cells were harvested at 0, 3, 6, and 12 h and then analyzed by Western analysis for SMAD3 and p15INK4B expression. The HaCaT and glioma cell lines were plated on 10-cm dishes and allowed to grow to confluence. Cells were trypsinized and incubated in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.8), 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% EDTA (pH 8.0), and 333 ng/ml proteinase K at 55 °C for 2 h. The DNA was then extracted by a series of phenol, phenol/chloroform, and chloroform extractions. The DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3 m NaOAc and washed in 70% ethanol. The DNA was digested overnight with HincII (New England Biolabs Inc.) and electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel. The gel was treated for 10 min in 0.25 n HCl and then 0.4 n NaOH and transferred to Hybond-N+ transfer membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was neutralized in 2× SSC and 0.5m Tris-HCl, UV-cross-linked, prehybridized, and then hybridized overnight in Church's solution. Hypermethylation assays were performed as described previously (25Herman J.G. Jen J. Merlo A. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 722-727PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cultures of glioma lines and Mv1Lu cells were incubated with 150 pm125I-labeled TGF-β for 3.5 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the cells were washed and cross-linked with 60 μg/ml disuccinimidyl suberate. The cells were lysed, and protein lysates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then subjected to autoradiography. This assay has been previously described (26Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of TGF-β on the normal precursor cell type of gliomas, we generated astrocyte cultures from newborn rats. Thymidine incorporation assays performed on these astrocytes showed significant growth inhibition upon treatment with either the TGF-β1 (Fig.1 A) or TGF-β2(Fig. 1 B) ligand. This growth arrest reached its maximum at ∼72 h and occurred with both ligands, although TGF-β2required a higher concentration to achieve maximal inhibition. Variation of the concentration of serum from 0.5 to 10% changed the absolute level of thymidine incorporation, but did not alter the percentage of inhibition caused by TGF-β treatment (data not shown). Flow cytometric analysis of astrocytes treated with TGF-β revealed a G1 cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1 C), although a mild increase in the rate of apoptosis was seen at 48 h (data not shown). We next attempted to define the potential molecular mechanisms through which the growth arrest occurs by initially analyzing the levels of several CdkIs. Induction of p15INK4B protein expression was seen by 1 h and reached its maximum at 24–48 h after treatment (Fig. 2 A), whereas the expression of other CdkIs (p16, p21, and p27) was not altered. The induction of p15INK4B was associated with a decrease in Cdk2 activity and maintenance of Rb protein in a hypophosphorylated state (Fig. 2, B and C). The levels of Cdc25a phosphorylation upon TGF-β treatment and expression of c-Myc, PDGF-A, and PDGF-B were not altered upon Western analysis (data not shown). The extracellular matrix protein PAI-1 is induced by TGF-β in some cell types, and this response was seen in astrocyte cultures (see Fig.6 A). Additionally, the angiogenic factor VEGF was induced in rat astrocyte cultures upon Northern analysis by 1 h of treatment (data not shown).Figure 6Endogenous gene responses of glioma lines to TGF-β. A, most glioma cell lines induced VEGF RNA expression in response to TGF-β. Northern analysis (15 μg of RNA/sample) was performed on glioma cell lysates after treatment with buffer control (−) or 100 pmTGF-β1 (+) for 12 h and probed with mouse VEGF cDNA. B, TGF-β induced PAI-1 secretion in most glioma cell lines. PAI-1 assays were performed either in buffer control (−) or 100 pm TGF-β1 (+) for 6 h, the last 2 h of which were in the presence of [35S]methionine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) SMAD3 has been shown to play a role in the induction of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter in a transcription assay (27Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We wished to examine the role of SMAD3 in the regulation of TGF-β growth inhibitory effects and p15INK4B expression in an endogenous setting. We created astrocyte cultures from Smad3null mice generated in our laboratory (28Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhaung Y. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thymidine incorporation assays of Smad3 −/− astrocytes treated with 100 pm TGF-β1 showed a significant loss of TGF-β-induced growth inhibition when compared withSmad3 +/+ cells.Smad3 −/− astrocytes had a mean 16.0 ± 9.2% inhibition (n = 8), whereasSmad3 +/+ astrocytes showed a 52.3 ± 3.2% inhibition (n = 8) (Fig.3 A). Correlated with this loss of TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, the induction of p15INK4B by TGF-β was lost in theSmad3 −/− astrocyte cultures in comparison with the Smad3 +/+ cultures (Fig. 3 B). Adenoviral co-infection of rat astrocytes with SMAD3 andSMAD4failed to induce an increase in p15INK4Bexpression compared with controls (data not shown), which implies an inability of SMAD3 to directly induce p15INK4Btranscription. We examined the TGF-β responsiveness of a broad range of human glioma cell lines using thymidine incorporation assays (Fig. 4) and found that there were three response groups. The first group (D54MG, U87MG, T98G, U251MG, D423MG, and D645MG) had a moderate response with 20–40% growth inhibition (Fig. 4 A); the second group (D259MG, D538MG, D409MG, and D566MG) was resistant to the growth inhibitory effects (Fig.4 B); and the third group (D270MG and U373MG) was growth-stimulated upon TGF-β treatment (Fig. 4 C). Even the most sensitive glioma cell lines showed less growth inhibitory response than the normal astrocytes. Like the astrocyte cultures, variation of the serum concentration affected only the absolute levels of thymidine incorporation, but not the degree of growth inhibition by TGF-β (data not shown). We subsequently sought the molecular explanation for the overall loss of growth inhibition in human glioma cell lines in response to TGF-β. The loss of TGF-β sensitivity has been found in several cancer types due to a variety of mechanisms, including loss of expression of TGF-β receptors (29Izumoto S. Arita N. Oshnishi T. Hiraga S.

As determined by the 125I-TGF-β binding cross-linking assay, expression of the type I and II TGF-β receptors was present in all the cell lines examined except D259MG (data not shown). Similarly, expression of SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 was present in all the lines as determined by Western and Northern analyses (data not shown). MDM2 was overexpressed only in D259MG (data not shown). Northern and Western analyses of c-Myc did not reveal overexpression in any of the cell lines (data not shown). Additionally, the induction of PDGF in response to TGF-β has been hypothesized to mediate the growth effects of TGF-β (20Jennings M.T. Maciunas R.J. Carver R. Bascom C.C. Juneau P. Misulius K.

The cell lines are grouped according to their growth response to TGF-β by thymidine incorporation assay. All inductions refer to the response of the cell line to 100 pm TGF-β1. We next turned to the analysis of the CdkI levels in response to TGF-β in those glioma cell lines. As shown in Fig.5 A, only T98G and D423MG, both of which were mildly growth-inhibited by TGF-β, had basal levels of p15INK4B protein expression and were further induced upon TGF-β treatment. Because of the lack of p15INK4Bexpression in the majority of the glioma cells lines, we performed Southern analysis of the genomic DNA derived from those lines and found that p15INK4B was homozygously deleted in all but three lines (T98G, D259MG, and D423MG) (Fig. 5 B). D259MG exhibited hypermethylation of the p15INK4B gene that may cause gene silencing (data not shown). Several cell lines expressed p21WAF1. Among them, four lines showed modest induction of p21 upon TGF-β treatment (D54MG, U87MG, D423MG, and D645MG). Taken together, all the glioma lines that showed induction of p15INK4B and/or p21WAF1 in response to TGF-β were also growth-inhibited by TGF-β (Fig. 4). No cell line showed an induction of p16INK4A, p14ARF, or p27KIP1 protein upon TGF-β treatment (data not shown). To determine if the TGF-β-mediated growth inhibitory pathway has been selectively altered in glioma cell lines while pathways leading to responses not associated with cell proliferation are retained, we investigated the effect of TGF-β on two known target genes, the extracellular matrix protein PAI-1 and the angiogenic factor VEGF, which has been shown to be overexpressed in many high-grade gliomas. As shown in Fig.6 A, PAI-1 was induced by TGF-β in all cell lines except U373MG and D259MG. Similarly, Northern analysis of VEGF showed that 9 of the 12 glioma lines could be induced to express VEGF mRNA when treated with TGF-β1 for 12 h (Fig. 6 B). Previous s"

K., and Verkman, A. S. (1998) J. Clin. Invest. 101, 2257–2267). To test whether mutant AQP2 proteins are misfolded, AQP2 folding was assessed by comparative detergent extractability and limited proteolysis, and AQP2 degradation kinetics was measured by label-pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation. In ER membranes from transfected CHO cells containing [35S]methionine-labeled AQP2, mutants T126M and A147T were remarkably detergent-resistant; for example wild-type AQP2 was >95% solubilized by 0.5% CHAPS whereas T126M was <10% solubilized. E258K, an NDI-causing AQP2 mutant which is retained in the Golgi, is highly detergent soluble like wild-type AQP2. The mutants and wild-type AQP2 were equally susceptible to digestion by trypsin, thermolysin, and proteinase K. Stopped-flow light scattering measurements indicated that T126M AQP2 at the ER was fully functional as a water channel. Pulse-chase studies indicated that the increased degradation rates for T126M (t 122.5 h) and A147T (2 h) compared with wild-type AQP2 (4 h) involve a brefeldin A-resistant, ER-dependent degradation mechanism. After growth of cells for 48 h in the chemical chaperone glycerol, AQP2 mutants T126M and A147T became properly targeted and relatively detergent-soluble. These results provide evidence that NDI-causing mutant AQP2 proteins are misfolded, but functional, and that chemical chaperones both correct the trafficking and folding defects. Strategies to facilitate protein folding might thus have therapeutic efficacy in NDI.

In the unstimulated state, water permeability across the collecting duct is low, permitting the passage of a dilute urine. After stimulation by the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin, collecting duct water permeability increases by 10–20-fold, resulting in osmotically driven water transport from the tubule lumen to the interstitium and formation of a concentrated urine (1Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F1-F12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brown D. Katsura T. Gustafson C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 273: F328-F331Google Scholar, 3Ward D.T. Hammond T.G. Harris H.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 683-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the increase in collecting duct water permeability is the cAMP-regulated trafficking of vesicles containing water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2)1 from an intracellular compartment to the cell apical plasma membrane. More than 20 mutations in the human AQP2 protein have been identified that cause the autosomal form of hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) (4Deen P.M.T. Verdijk M.A.J. Knoers N.V.A.M.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how an abnormal AQP2 genotype produces phenotypically defective cells with low water permeability. Some mutations in aquaporins, particularly at residues near the conserved NPA motifs (10Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), produce non-functional water channels; human NDI mutations R187C and C181W are in this category (5Deen P.M.T.

Heterologous expression experiments in Xenopus oocytes suggested that misrouting to the plasma membrane may account for the abnormal phenotype of some NDI-causing AQP2 mutants (5Deen P.M.T.

The only dominant negative AQP2 mutation, E258K, is retained in the Golgi (8Mulders S.H. Knoers N.V.A.M. van Lieburg A.F. Monnens L.A.H. Leumann E. Wuhl E. Schober E. Rijss J.P.L. van Os C.H.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2394-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). When wild-type AQP2 is coexpressed with E258K, oligomerization of the mutant with wild-type AQP2 in the Golgi prevents trafficking of functional water channels to the plasma membrane (11Kamsteeg E-J. Wormhoudt T.A.M. Rijss J.P.L. van Os C.H. Deen P.M.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2394-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We recently analyzed Xenopus oocytes and transfected mammalian cells expressing wild-type AQP2 and a series of NDI-causing AQP2 mutants (12Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes, AQP2 mutants T126M and A147T had approximately the same intrinsic water permeability as wild-type AQP2. However in transfected mammalian cells, these mutants were retained at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and degraded more rapidly than wild-type AQP2. Because these results suggest that AQP2 mutants might be functional if expressed at the plasma membrane, several maneuvers were tested to correct the defective trafficking phenotype. Although low temperature, as done to correct ΔF508 CFTR mistrafficking in cystic fibrosis (13Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), was unable to alter the cellular distribution of mutant AQP2 proteins, treatment with the “chemical chaperones” glycerol and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) corrected the ER retention and produced water-permeable cells (12Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The use of chemical chaperones for pharmacotherapy of some forms of NDI was proposed. However, no information is available on the physical state of the ER-retained AQP2 protein in NDI, nor is it understood how chemical chaperones rescue mutant AQP2 proteins. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that NDI-causing AQP2 mutants are misfolded and non-functional at the ER and that correction of defective trafficking by the chemical chaperone glycerol is associated with corrected folding. Two methods were adopted to assess AQP2 protein folding at the ER: extractability by detergents and comparative limited proteolysis. In addition, AQP2 degradation kinetics was analyzed by pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation, and AQP2 function in the ER was measured by stopped-flow light scattering. The principal findings were that ER-retained AQP2 mutants are remarkably more detergent-resistant than wild-type AQP2, that mutant AQP2 is fully functional at the ER, and that treatment with chemical chaperones results in apparent correction of AQP2 misfolding. Human AQP2 point mutants E258K, T126M, and A147T were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequence analysis. Epitope-tagged constructs were prepared which encoded fusion proteins consisting of the wild-type or mutant AQP2 cDNAs with 10 amino acids of the human c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) at the N terminus. Wild-type and mutated cDNAs were subcloned in plasmid pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) for transfection in mammalian cells. CHO-K1 (University of California, San Francisco Cell Culture Facility) cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. For immunostaining, cells were plated at a density of 104per 3.8 cm2 and transfected with 0.5 μg of cDNA in the presence of 3 μg of LipofectAMINE. In some experiments, 1m glycerol was added to the medium at 4 h after transfection. For metabolic labeling and subcellular fractionation, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well, and transfected with 1 μg of cDNA and 6 μg of LipofectAMINE per well. Transfected CHO cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunostaining was done with a polyclonal AQP2 antibody as described previously (12Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were carried out at 40 h after transfection when cells were ∼80% confluent. Cells were incubated in cysteine and methionine-free DME H-21 medium for 30 min at 37 °C, and then the medium was supplemented with [35S]methionine/cysteine (75 μCi/ml, DuPont) for 30 min (pulse labeling). Cells were then washed in medium containing 5 mm non-radioactive methionine and cysteine and placed in the methionine-containing medium (chase). At specified times, cells were washed in hypotonic buffer (25 mm sucrose, 1 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and homogenized by five passages through a 27-gauge needle in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.4. After pelleting debris, nuclei, and mitochondria (500 × g, 10 min), a post-nuclear microsomal membrane pellet was obtained by centrifugation of the supernatant (100,000 × g, 45 min). The membrane pellet was solubilized in PBS containing 100 mmβ-octylglucoside and incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted (100 × g, 1 min), and the supernatant was incubated with primary antibody (AQP2 or c-Myc) bound to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted (100 × g, 1 min) and washed four times in RIPA buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Proteins were released from the beads by incubation with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to fluorography and autoradiography. Band intensities were quantified by densitometry and normalized to the amount of AQP2 detected by immunoblotting. Steady-state35S-labeling was carried out at 36 h after transfection when cells were ∼80% confluent. Cells were incubated in cysteine and methionine-free DME H-21 medium for 30 min at 37 °C, and then the medium was supplemented with [35S]methionine/cysteine (75 μCi/ml, DuPont) for 16 h. In some experiments, brefeldin A (10 μg/ml) was included in the labeling medium. For detergent extraction studies, microsomal membranes were isolated as described above. [35S]-labeled proteins from transfected CHO cells treated with 10 μg/ml brefeldin A were incubated with PBS containing 50–100 mmβ-octylglucoside, 0.05–1% Triton X-100, or 0.1–5.0% CHAPS at 4 °C for 30 min. Detergent-insoluble proteins were pelleted at 100,000 × g for 45 min and resuspended in RIPA buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100. RIPA buffer was also added to the supernatant to give a final concentration of 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100. AQP2 was immunoprecipitated from both the supernatant (detergent-soluble) and the pellet (detergent-insoluble) fractions with a c-Myc monoclonal antibody as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to fluorography, autoradiography, and quantitative densitometry. Microsomes and ER membranes obtained from transfected CHO cells were resuspended at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in PBS. Membranes were incubated with pepsin, trypsin, thermolysin, or proteinase K (0–10 μg/ml) for 10 min on ice. In the case of thermolysin, proteolysis was carried out in the presence of 4 mm CaCl2. Proteolysis was terminated by addition of 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Pefabloc), 5 mm EDTA, and samples were denatured with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer at 50 °C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved on a 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to fluorography and autoradiography. Alternatively, proteins resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and proteolytic fragments were detected by immunoblotting with an AQP2 polyclonal antibody or a monoclonal c-Myc antibody. CHO cells (control or transfected) grown on 10-cm plates were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, removed using a rubber cell scraper, and pelleted in PBS (100 ×g, 10 min). Cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4) and homogenized as described above. The post-nuclear supernatant was fractionated by sedimentation on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient as described previously (12Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Each fraction was mixed with 4.5 ml of resuspension buffer (3 mmimidazole, 2 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4), and membranes were pelleted (100,000 × g, 30 min) and resuspended in a minimal volume of resuspension buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA colorimetric assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (2.0 μg) were electrophoresed on a 12% or 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in 10 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.4 for 2 h, followed by a 1-h incubation in AQP2 polyclonal antibody (1:500), c-Myc monoclonal antibody (1:300). Membranes were washed in the blocking solution containing 0.05% Tween, and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Osmotic water permeability in ER membranes was determined by stopped-flow light scattering (14Van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18267-18269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionated ER vesicles (0.25 mg protein/ml) were suspended in 150 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and subjected to a 150 mm inwardly directed sucrose gradient at 10 °C. The time course of scattered light intensity at 530 nm was measured. The ability of various detergents to extract wild-typeversus mutant AQP2 proteins was studied in microsomes isolated from transfected, brefeldin A-treated CHO cells. Microsomes were incubated with detergents as described under “Experimental Procedures,” supernatant (soluble) and pellet (insoluble) fractions were prepared by centrifugation, and total AQP2 was immunoprecipitated. Fig. 1 A shows that under identical detergent incubation conditions, wild-type AQP2 was remarkably more susceptible to detergent extraction than the AQP2 mutants T126M and A147T. In contrast, E258K was fully detergent-soluble. Greater than 90% of wild-type AQP2 and E258K were solubilized under the conditions shown in Fig. 1 A, whereas the mutants were poorly soluble particularly in CHAPS. Fig.1 B shows a detergent concentration dependence of AQP2 solubilization. Whereas solubility was nearly 100% at high detergent concentrations, the detergent potencies differed considerably for wild-type versus T126M AQP2 mutant. Control studies showed that the difference in extractability of wild-type versus mutant AQP2 was not related to differences in lipid environment or membrane integration. Fig.2 A shows immunofluorescence micrographs of transfected CHO cells expressing wild-type, T126M, and E258K AQP2. As reported previously (12Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), without brefeldin A treatment, wild-type AQP2 was distributed in a recycling endosome/plasma membrane pattern, whereas T126M and A147T (not shown) were localized to the ER. E258K expression showed a Golgi distribution. After brefeldin A treatment, which prevents vesicle traffic from the ER, the pattern of AQP2 localization was indistinguishable for the wild-type and mutant proteins. Fig. 2 B shows differential detergent extractability, as in Fig. 1 A, but for purified ER membranes isolated from the transfected CHO cells by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Again, wild-type AQP2 was remarkably more solubilized by detergents than the mutants. Fig. 2 C shows that neither wild-type nor mutant AQP2 could be extracted from microsomes by high pH, indicating that both proteins were fully integrated in the membrane. Comparative limited proteolysis was used to test for differences in the folding state of wild-type versus mutant AQP2 proteins in the ER. Experiments were carried out on ER-derived microsomes from transfected CHO cells expressing AQP2 proteins encoding a c-Myc tag at the N terminus. The N and C termini peptides were visualized by immunoblot analysis using c-Myc and AQP2 antibodies, respectively. Fig.3, top, shows representative immunoblots using an AQP2 antibody. Progressive proteolysis of wild-type and mutant AQP2 with thermolysin gave a decrease in the amount of the full-length protein. Proteolysis of wild-type and mutant AQP2 with proteinase K resulted in a decrease in the amount of the full-length protein with the appearance of smaller fragments. Quantitative concentration-dependent proteolysis data in Fig.3 B indicated that wild-type, E258K and T126M AQP2 mutants are equally susceptible to protease digestion. The concentration-dependent appearance of smaller fragments with proteinase K incubation showed a similar profile for wild-type and mutant AQP2. Multiple additional studies, which included c-Myc and AQP2 immunoblot analysis of proteolytic fragmentation patterns by trypsin and pepsin (data not shown), supported the conclusion that wild-type, E258K and T126M AQP2 mutants are equally susceptible to digestion by proteases. [35S]methionine pulse-chase experiments were carried out to quantify the kinetics of AQP2 degradation in CHO cells. Cells were depleted of methionine and labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine followed by chase in media containing excess unlabeled methionine. Fig.4 A shows representative autoradiograms, and Fig. 4 B gives a summary of the quantitative densitometry data. AQP2 mutants were degraded significantly more rapidly than wild-type AQP2. In brefeldin A-treated CHO cells, the degradation of wild-type AQP2 was significantly slowed, whereas the degradation of mutant AQP2 proteins was not affected. These results suggest an ER-dependent degradation mechanism for mutant AQP2 and a post-ER degradation mechanism for wild-type AQP2. Averaged t 12 values (time for 50% degradation) are summarized in Fig. 2 B, right. The degradation kinetics of mutant AQP2 was not affected by brefeldin A, lysosomotropic agents (NH4Cl), and an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway (MG132). Stopped-flow light scattering was done to determine whether the ER-retained AQP2 mutant T126M was functional as a water channel. Non-transfected (control) and transfected CHO cells were treated with brefeldin A, and ER membrane vesicles were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Osmotic water permeability was determined from the time course of vesicle shrinkage, as measured by light scattering, in response to a rapidly imposed 150 mm gradient of sucrose. The light scattering kinetics are shown on three contiguous time scales to visualize the full time course. ER membranes from cells transfected with wild-type AQP2 (Fig. 5,top curve) showed a highly water-permeable fraction of vesicles with a half-time for shrinking of ∼100 ms (curved time course seen on 0.3-s time scale). The corresponding osmotic water permeability coefficient (Pf) for these vesicles is ∼0.02 cm/s. Highly water permeable vesicles were not seen in ER membranes from control cells (Fig. 5, middle curve), which had a remarkably slower rate of shrinking. In ER membranes from T126M transfected cells, rapid shrinking was found as seen in the ER membranes containing wild-type AQP2. The similar amount of AQP2 protein in ER containing wild-type versus T126M AQP2 (Fig. 5,inset) suggests that the intrinsic water permeabilities of wild-type and T126M AQP2 are comparable. Thus, T126M AQP2 is fully functional even though it appears to be folded differently from wild-type AQP2 at the ER membrane (see “Discussion”). Detergent extraction experiments were carried out to test whether correction of mutant AQP2 mistrafficking is associated with correction of the apparent protein folding defect. Cells were grown in glycerol for 48 h prior to isolation of microsomes and detergent solubilization. As reported previously (12Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), growth of transfected CHO cells in glycerol for 48 h resulted in a redistribution of mutant AQP2 proteins from the ER to a recycling endosome/plasma membrane compartment. Fig. 6 A, top-panel, shows an ER intracellular distribution of AQP2 T126M. After glycerol treatment, the pattern became primarily endosomal (Fig. 6 A, panel 2); incubation of glycerol-treated cells with brefeldin A gave an ER staining pattern as expected (Fig. 6 A, middle panel 3). The Golgi distribution of E258K AQP2 was not changed by incubating cells in glycerol (Fig. 6 A, panels 4 and 5). There was no detectable effect of glycerol on the localization of wild-type AQP2, nor was there significant correction of the T126M AQP2 trafficking defect by a 6-h incubation in glycerol (not shown). Fig.6 B shows representative autoradiograms from the detergent extraction experiments using 1% CHAPS, a concentration in which there was a large difference in the nearly complete solubilization of wild-type AQP2 versus mutant AQP2 (see Fig. 1 B). After growth of cells in glycerol, there was no difference in the nearly complete solubilization of wild-type AQP2 by 1% CHAPS. However, a remarkably greater fraction of T126M and A147T became soluble in the detergent and were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant. Fig.6 C summarizes averaged solubilization data. We showed previously that several NDI-causing AQP2 mutants are retained in the ER of transfected mammalian cells (7Canfield M.C. Tamarappoo B.K. Moses A.M. Verkman A.S. Holtzman E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1865-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The present study was carried out to test the hypotheses that ER-retained AQP2 mutants are misfolded and non-functional, and that correction of defective trafficking by chemical chaperones gives the correctly folded protein. Analysis of the folding of an integral membrane protein trapped at the ER is challenging. The difficulty in expressing and purifying mutant AQP2 in its native state precludes the use of spectroscopic or crystallographic methods to study structure. In addition, analysis of wild-type versus mutant AQP2 requires a common membrane environment so that differences in results can be attributed to differences in AQP2 folding state. Our strategy was to use comparative detergent extractability and protease sensitivity as indicators of misfolding. ER-retained AQP2 mutants A147T and T126M, which were found previously to be functional as water channels inXenopus oocytes and glycerol-treated CHO cells (12Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), were significantly more resistant to detergent solubilization than wild-type AQP2. However, E258K, a mutant that undergoes normal trafficking from the ER to the Golgi, was readily detergent-soluble like wild-type AQP2. Although we expected to find significant changes in protease sensitivity of ER-retained AQP2 mutants, it was found that wild-type and mutant AQP2 in the ER were equally sensitive to degradation by proteases. Another unanticipated observation was that an ER-retained AQP2 mutant was fully functional at the ER. As discussed below, the resistance to detergent solubilization in the absence of a change in susceptibility to protease degradation, and the preservation of function of the mistrafficked mutant AQP2, make it unique among the known examples of membrane transport proteins that are retained in the ER. Several mutant proteins that cause human disease are thought to involve misfolding, including ΔF508 CFTR (15Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol.

In the case of ΔF508 CFTR, Prpsc, and the antitrypsin Z mutant, detergent insolubility has been thought to result from defective folding and aggregation of misfolded protein units. The data here show that, compared with wild-type AQP2, the NDI-causing ER-retained AQP2 mutants are remarkably more resistant to extraction by detergents. The simplest interpretation of this finding is that mutant AQP2 proteins are misfolded at the ER. Reduced detergent extractability could result from AQP2 misfolding, intramembrane aggregation, and/or interaction with molecular chaperones. Aggregation of the protein or binding to ER resident chaperones may result in ER retention of the protein. The similar detergent solubility of the E258K AQP2 mutant and wild-type AQP2, both of which exit the ER, suggests that binding of ER chaperones to misfolded AQP2 may contribute to detergent insolubility. It has been shown that AQP2 plasma membrane targeting is in part regulated by phosphorylation of residue Ser-256 at its polar C terminus (25Bai L. Fushimi K. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5171-5176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that this regulatory mechanism is involved in the ER-retention of AQP2 mutants because the phosphorylation probably controls post-ER endosome targeting and because the point mutations in AQP2 are far from its C terminus. The similar sensitivity of AQP2 mutants to protease digestion compared with wild-type AQP2 suggests that the extent of misfolding of the ER-retained AQP2 mutants is not severe enough to expose residues that are inaccessible in wild-type AQP2. Altered protease sensitivity has been shown for ΔF508 CFTR, the unassembled T cell receptor α subunit, and Prpsc (16Zhang F. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1997; 7: 113-122Google Scholar, 21Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In the case of Prpsc, the formation of misfolded Prpscaggregates has been shown to confer protection from digestion by proteinase K (21Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Alternatively, misfolded proteins can exhibit increased susceptibility to proteases. ΔF508 CFTR is more susceptible than wild-type CFTR to degradation by the proteases thermolysin, kallikrein, and trypsin (16Zhang F. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It was suggested that a protease-sensitive ER intermediate of ΔF508 CFTR is conformationally distinct from the protease-insensitive ER intermediate of wild-type CFTR and that the inability of ΔF508 CFTR to attain a mature folded conformation prevents its exit from the ER (16Zhang F. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the case of the unassembled T cell receptor α subunit, trypsin susceptibility of the misfolded intermediate has been attributed to incomplete membrane insertion of the protein (18Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1997; 7: 113-122Google Scholar). In the case of T126M AQP2, a subtle conformational change, which is not manifested as a change in susceptibility to proteases, may promote aggregation or allow recognition by molecular chaperones and cause ER retention. Misfolded proteins that are retained in the ER are often degraded by ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways including resident ER proteases such as ER60 protease, or ubiquitin and the cytosolic proteasome (26Bonifacino J.S. Lippincot S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 592-600Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 3: 592-600Google Scholar). Misfolded proteins that undergo ERAD include ΔF508 CFTR, the unassembled T cell receptor α subunit, and the antitrypsin Z mutant (18Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1997; 7: 113-122Google Scholar, 19Yu G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 23Le A. Ferrell G.A.

Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). The rate of degradation of these proteins is unaffected by inhibitors that block vesicle traffic from the ER. It is therefore inferred that these proteins are degraded by an ER-dependent degradation pathway. In the case of the ΔF508 CFTR and the unassembled T cell receptor α subunit, it was shown that the degradation involved ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis by the proteasome. It was shown that inhibitors of the proteasome cause an accumulation of ΔF508 CFTR and the unassembled T cell receptor α subunit in the ER (18Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1997; 7: 113-122Google Scholar, 19Yu G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 24Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). The misfolding and ER retention of AQP2 mutants A147T and T126M suggests an ERAD mechanism. The insensitivity of mutant AQP2 degradation rates to inhibitors of downstream vesicle traffic (brefeldin A) and lysosomal proteases further supports an ERAD mechanism. In contrast, the slowed degradation of wild-type AQP2 in the presence of brefeldin A indicates a post-ER degradation mechanism. These results suggest that the misfolded AQP2 mutant at the ER is recognized differently than wild-type AQP2 by resident ER proteases and components of the quality control machinery. The lack of inhibition by known ER-dependent protease inhibitors of mutant AQP2 degradation rates implicates a possible novel ER degradation mechanism that remains to be identified. Despite the apparent misfolding of NDI-causing AQP2 mutants at the ER and the dramatically different trafficking compared with wild-type AQP2, the T126M mutant was found to be fully functional as a water channel. This unanticipated finding is what has also been found for ΔF508 CFTR, where the CFTR chloride channel electrophysiological signature was found in single channel recordings of outer membranes of the nuclear envelope of CFTR-expressing CHO cells (28Pasyk E.A. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12347-12350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To our knowledge the functionality of other ER-retained proteins has not been studied. It appears that some point mutations can alter protein conformation in a manner that affects trafficking but not function. This finding has important implications in terms of strategies to correct some of the mistrafficked AQP2 mutants in NDI. Maneuvers that permit plasma membrane targeting should be sufficient to correct the cell phenotype, even if the perfect native conformation is not achieved. It is noted that glycerol treatment was found to restore the normal phenotype of CHO cells expressing T126M AQP2 (12Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), despite the finding here that glycerol only partially restored the native folding state. It was found previously that various chemical chaperones (glycerol, TMAO, Me2SO) facilitate the translocation of AQP2 mutants to the plasma membrane and endosomes, thereby restoring a normal cell phenotype of high plasma membrane water permeability. Glycerol has also been shown to correct the apparent cellular processing defect of ΔF508 CFTR (29Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Welch W.J. Cell Stress Chap. 1996; 1: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 30Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), Prpsc (21Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), p53 tumor suppressor protein, and temperature-sensitive mutants of E1 enzyme in the ubiquitination pathway (31Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Welch W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1432-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which chemical chaperones affect protein maturation in vivo has not been established, it has been proposed that these agents facilitate the correct folding of a nascent protein by physico-chemical interactions or by interfering with alternate folding pathways (32Qu B.-H. Strickland E.H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15739-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Other proposed mechanisms include glycerol-induced slowing of protein synthesis and processing to facilitate protein folding, and glycerol-protein binding to alter the energy barrier for formation of properly folded conformers (33Gekko K. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4677-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 34Welch W.J. Brown C.R. Cell Stress Chap. 1996; 1: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The results here show that correction of mutant AQP2 misprocessing by glycerol is associated with a pattern of detergent extractability that begins to resemble that of wild-type AQP2. It was found that correction of defective mutant AQP2 trafficking required more than 24 h of exposure to glycerol, a time much greater than the degradation half-time for wild-type or mutant AQP2 proteins. Therefore it is not possible to determine whether glycerol is able to rescue ER-retained AQP2 mutants that are already in an apparently misfolded state. Further, the need for prolonged glycerol exposure suggests that the correction of misfolded proteins involves slow adaptive changes in cell constituents, such as in the molecular recognition machinery; a direct effect of glycerol on mutant AQP2 folding should be manifest within the 4–6-h AQP2 turnover time. Further studies are needed to establish the cellular adaptive changes conferred by chemical chaperones. We thank Drs. Gergely Lukacs, William Skach, and William Welch for helpful advice and discussions on ER protein processing."

We have shown earlier that structural perturbation of α-crystallin can enhance its chaperone-like activity severalfold. The two subunits of α-crystallin have extensive sequence homology and individually display chaperone-like activity. We have investigated the chaperone-like activity of αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates against thermal and nonthermal modes of aggregation. We find that, against a nonthermal mode of aggregation, αB-crystallin shows significant protective ability even at subphysiological temperatures, at which αA-crystallin or heteromultimeric α-crystallin exhibit very little chaperone-like activity. Interestingly, differences in the protective ability of these homoaggregates against the thermal aggregation of βL-crystallin is negligible. To investigate this differential behavior, we have monitored the temperature-dependent structural changes in both the proteins using fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quench-ing by acrylamide shows that the tryptophans in αB-crystallin are more accessible than the lone tryptophan in αA-crystallin even at 25 °C. Protein-bound 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate fluorescence demonstrates the higher solvent accessibility of hydrophobic surfaces on αB-crystallin. Circular dichroism studies show some tertiary structural changes in αA-crystallin above 50 °C. αB-crystallin, on the other hand, shows significant alteration of tertiary structure by 45 °C. Our study demonstrates that despite a high degree of sequence homology and their generally accepted structural similarity, αB-crystallin is much more sensitive to temperature-dependent structural perturbation than αA- or α-crystallin and shows differences in its chaperone-like properties. These differences appear to be relevant to temperature-dependent enhancement of chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin and indicate different roles for the two proteins both in α-crystallin heteroaggregate and as separate proteins under stress conditions. α-Crystallin, a heteromultimeric protein made up of αA- and αB-crystallins, functions as a molecular chaperone in preventing the aggregation of proteins.

Studies over the past few years have shown that α-crystallin is expressed in several nonlenticular tissues such as heart, brain, and kidney, and its expression is enhanced severalfold during stress and disease conditions (1Iwaki T.

Demonstration of chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin has provided an excellent opportunity to investigate the mechanistic aspects of chaperone function in general and the role of α-crystallin under stress conditions in particular. It is possible that, in the lens, α-crystallin may chaperone the formation of the transparent and appropriately refracting ensemble and may also keep it that way by interacting with damaged proteins. α-Crystallin may have a similar function of interacting with aged or damaged proteins in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease brain (12Renkawek K. de Jong W.W.

Limbruno U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 97: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). αB-crystallin may even play a regulatory role in cytomorphological rearrangements during development (14Scotting P. McDermott H. Mayer R.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A mutation in αA-crystallin is known to lead to cataract (15Litt M. Kremer P. Dante M. Morticella M. Murphy W. Lovrien E. Welber R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Recently a missense mutation (R120G) in αB-crystallin was shown to cause desmin-related myopathy (16Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupert J. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 30-92Crossref Scopus (967) Google Scholar). To address the mechanistic aspects of the function of α-crystallin, we have used a nonthermal aggregation system and found that the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin is temperature-dependent (17Raman B. Rao Ch.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies with photoaggregation of γ-crystallin (17Raman B. Rao Ch.M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) together with the rapid refolding of crystallins (19Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao Ch.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19888-19892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the role of α-crystallin in these processes resulted in a hypothesis that sheds some light on the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin. These studies show that α-crystallin prevents the aggregation of nonnative structures by providing appropriately placed hydrophobic surfaces. A structural transition above 30 °C enhances the protective ability perhaps by increasing or reorganizing hydrophobic surfaces. We have recently shown that tertiary structural changes precede quaternary structural changes (20Raman B. Rao Ch.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23559-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21Rao C.M. Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rajaraman K. Ghosh D. Datta S. Trivedi V.D. Sukhaswami M.B. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 217-281Google Scholar). α-Crystallin is a heteroaggregate of two gene products, αA- and αB-crystallin. Both the subunits can homoaggregate and function as chaperones, albeit to different extents (11Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 22Sun T-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The roles of the two proteins and their contribution to the structural and functional properties of α-crystallin are not well understood. αA- and αB-crystallin have nearly 40% sequence homology with the heat shock proteins (9Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) and have 57% sequence homology among themselves (23Van der Ouderaa F.J. de Jong W.W. Hilderink A. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 49: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Small heat shock proteins such as Hsp25, Hsp27, as well as α-crystallin have been shown to have a similar function in refolding citrate synthase and β-glucosidasein vitro (24Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of αB-crystallin can be induced by heat shock (7Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), osmotic stress (25Dasgupta S. Hohman T.C. Carper D. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), or mechanical stress (26Mitton K.P. Tumminia S.J. Arora J. Zelenka P. Epstein D.L. Russel P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We set out to investigate the physiochemical properties of the individual subunits to understand their structural and functional contributions in α-crystallin. We have isolated αA- and αB-crystallins and generated the individual homoaggregates. We have investigated temperature-induced structural changes, chaperone-like activity as well as its temperature dependence, of the individual homoaggregates and the native α-crystallin heteroaggregate. Interestingly, we find that αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates do not differ at all in preventing the thermal aggregation of βL-crystallin but show a significant difference in protection against the nonthermal DTT-induced aggregation of insulin. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectoscopy, used to investigate the temperature-dependent structural changes in the homoaggregates, show interesting differences and explain the differential chaperone-like behavior. We believe these results indicate that relative stability or exposure of αA- or αB-crystallin subunits could modulate the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin, either directly or by inducing global changes in the arrangement/packaging of subunits. It is possible that structural alteration by temperature forms a part of a general mechanism of chaperone function, since chaperones function more effectively at nonpermissible temperatures. Calf lens α-crystallin was isolated and purified as described earlier (18Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The fractions corresponding to α-crystallin were pooled and concentrated at 4 °C using an Amicon ultrafiltration unit with anM r 30,000 cutoff. The concentrated solution of α-crystallin was stored in Tris-HCl buffer at 4 °C. α-Crystallin was used as the heteroaggregate of αA-and αB-crystallin. The ratio of αA-, to αB-crystallin is 3:1 (w/w) in this heteroaggregate. Separation of αA- and αB-crystallins and Generation of Homoaggregates—The subunits of α-crystallin can be separated by a variety of methods (11Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The subunits were separated on a C4 reverse phase column using a water-acetonitrile gradient containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. The peaks corresponding to αA- and αB-crystallin were pooled, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. The lyophilized samples were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 8m deionized urea and left overnight at 4 °C. αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates were generated from these samples by extensive dialysis against 300 volumes of the 50 mmTris-HCl buffer without urea, with 6 changes over a period of 36 h. The dialyzed proteins were concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration setup and then checked for any high molecular weight aggregate formation on a Superose-6 column. Their purity was checked by horizontal isoelectric focusing in the pH range 5–8. Insulin at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml (in 10 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl) in the presence or the absence of different amounts of α-, αA-, or αB-crystallin was equilibrated at the required temperature for 10 min with constant stirring in the cuvette using a Julabo thermostated water bath. The actual temperature in the cuvette was monitored with a Physitemp microthermocouple thermometer system. The reduction of insulin was initiated by the addition of 30 μl of 1M DTT to 1.5 ml of sample. The extent of aggregation was monitored by measuring the scattering at right angle in a Hitachi-4000 fluorescence spectrometer with both the excitation and emission monochromators set at 465 nm and excitation and emission bandpasses at 1.5 nm. Thermal aggregation of βL-crystallin was monitored in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mmNaCl at 60 °C. The buffer, containing α-, αA-, or αB-crystallin, was preincubated at 60 °C for 10 min before the addition of 60 μl of βL-crystallin to make a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. Aggregation was monitored by measuring the light scattering as described above. Results are expressed as percentage protection. Percentage protection is calculated as, (I t −I t+α)/I t, whereI t is the intensity of scattered light for target protein insulin or βL-crystallin, andI t+α is the intensity of scattered light in the presence of αA-, αB-, or α-crystallin. The CD measurements were carried out using a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter. Sample concentrations were 1.0 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl (moderate salt), except for temperature-dependent changes in the far UV-CD, where 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer without NaCl (low salt) was also used. The near and far UV-CD spectra were recorded using 1 cm and 0.01-cm path length cells, respectively. For the temperature-dependent CD measurements, water-jacketed sample cells of the mentioned path lengths were used, and the temperature was maintained using a Julabo thermostated water bath. The sample temperature was monitored using a Physitemp microthermocouple thermometer. Aliquots (7 μl) from a 7m acrylamide stock were added to the protein (0.2 mg/ml) in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 100 mmNaCl, and maintained at the required temperatures. The drop in fluorescence intensity was measured on a Hitachi-F4000 fluorimeter. The excitation and emission monochromators were set at 295 nm (5 nm bandpass) and 340 nm (3 nm bandpass), respectively. For the measurement of the temperature-dependent change in acrylamide quenching, the proteins were incubated with 0.35 macrylamide at the lowest starting temperature for 20 min, and the drop in fluorescence was measured at every subsequent temperature after a 5-min incubation period. Instrument parameters were as given above. The fluorescence intensity values were corrected for dilution and inner filter effect. For the temperature-dependent 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (ANS) fluorescence measurements, 10 μl of a 10 mm methanolic stock of ANS was added to 1 ml of 0.2 mg/ml protein solution and incubated at the starting temperature for 2 h. The temperature was maintained and monitored as mentioned above. The excitation monochromator was set at 365 nm(3 nm bandpass), and the emission monochromator was scanned from 400 to 530 nm(1.5 nm bandpass) in the correct spectrum mode to monitor the emission maximum of ANS. We showed earlier that the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin can be enhanced severalfold upon structural perturbation. To gain an insight into the chaperone-like activity and its enhancement with structural perturbation, we investigated the constituent subunits separately. The subunits were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C4 column and checked for purity by isoelectric focusing in the pH range 5–8. αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates were generated by dialyzing individual crystallins from 8 m urea against 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl. Such a slow refolding by removing the denaturant by dialysis (29Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1982; 34: 969-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or rapidly by dilution (18Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) results in native α-crystallin. The molecular mass of the refolded α-crystallin, however, may vary depending on conditions like ionic strength, pH, and temperature (30Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoenders H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The size of the homoaggregates thus obtained are comparable to refolded heteromultimeric α-crystallin (31Li L-K Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1973; 15: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoenders H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 91: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). αB-crystallin homoaggregates obtained in this way have a similar molecular mass as αB-crystallin homoaggregates isolated from nonlenticular tissue such as the heart (10Merck K.B. Groenen P.J.T.A. Voorter C.E.M. de Haard-Hoekman W.A. Horwitz J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol.

Fig. 1, A and B, compare the near and far UV-CD spectra of αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates with those of α-crystallin. The far UV-CD of αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates (Fig. 1 B) are similar with minima at 217-nm and 214-nm, respectively. The near UV-CD spectra of αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates, however, show differences in the 270–290-nm region, where Trp and Tyr contribute to the observed circular dichroism. The characteristic signals at 259 and 266 nm, contributed by phenylalanine are common to both αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates although different in intensity. The significant differences in the 270–290-nm region suggest differences in the packaging of aromatic chromophores. Both the near and far UV-CD spectra of αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates are comparable to those of the corresponding human recombinant proteins (21Rao C.M. Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rajaraman K. Ghosh D. Datta S. Trivedi V.D. Sukhaswami M.B. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 217-281Google Scholar). The molecular weights of the αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates and α-crystallin were determined by gel filtration on a Superose-6 column, calibrated as per the manufacturer's instructions, and found to be 600 kDa, 450 kDa, and 800 kDa, respectively. To gain insight into our earlier observation of temperature-dependent chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin, we investigated the chaperone-like activity against thermal (heat-induced βL-crystallin aggregation) and nonthermal (DTT- induced aggregation of insulin) modes of aggregation. Fig. 2 A shows the DTT-induced aggregation of insulin at 35 °C. Insulin starts aggregating, as seen by the increasing scattering, after the addition of DTT and levels off at about 20 min. α-Crystallin prevents this aggregation to a limited extent. αA-crystallin prevents this aggregation to a greater extent. Interestingly, αB-crystallin completely prevents this aggregation under similar conditions. It is interesting to note that both the constituent subunits individually display higher chaperone-like activity than the native heteroaggregate. The biological significance of this is not yet clear. Fig. 2 B shows a similar protection experiment with βL-crystallin. βL-crystallin aggregates with time when kept at 60 °C. All the three proteins, αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates and native α-heteroaggregate, offer comparable protection against heat-induced aggregation. The differences seen at 35 °C (Fig.2 A) are absent at 60 °C (Fig. 2 B). These experiments are carried out at a fixed concentration of α-crystallin, and the target protein. Fig.3 A shows the concentration dependence of protection against DTT-induced aggregation of insulin at 40 °C. αB-crystallin is able to completely prevent the DTT-induced aggregation of insulin even at a ratio of 0.1/1 (αB/insulin w/w), whereas αA- and α-crystallin protect to a comparable extent only beyond ratios of 0.3:1 and 0.5:1 (w/w), respectively. Thus αB-crystallin homoaggregate has a significantly higher protective ability than either αA-crystallin homoaggregate (about 3-fold higher) or α-crystallin (5-fold) at near physiological temperatures. Such a difference in the protective ability of αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates and α-crystallin is totally absent against a thermal mode of aggregation as shown in Fig. 3 B. The percentage protection offered by αA-and αB-crystallin homoaggregates and α-crystallin against thermal aggregation of βL-crystallin at 60 °C is comparable. Although at physiological temperatures αB-crystallin exhibits a substantially higher chaperone-like activity, at higher temperatures its protective ability is essentially the same as that of αA- and α-crystallin.Figure 3The concentration dependence of the protective ability of α-crystallin (○), αA- (▵), and αB-crystallin (▴) homoaggregates against DTT-induced insulin aggregation at 40 °C (A) and thermal aggregation of βL-crystallin at 60 °C (B). The concentrations of insulin and βL-crystallin were 0.2 mg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Earlier work from our laboratory suggested that α-crystallin undergoes a temperature-dependent structural perturbation, which results in an increase in its chaperone-like activity (16Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupert J. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 30-92Crossref Scopus (967) Google Scholar). It is possible that these changes are due to the reorganization of the subunits within the aggregate and/or small perturbation in the packing of domains within the subunits themselves. This structural perturbation above 30 °C and the resulting increase in chaperone-like activity seem to be physiologically relevant. We have therefore compared the temperature-dependent chaperone-like activity of αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates and α-crystallin between 25 °C and 42 °C. A fixed ratio of 1:0.5 w/w (insulin:chaperone) was used in these experiments. As Fig. 4 shows, under the given conditions, by about 40 °C all the three crystallins show almost complete protection against DTT-induced aggregation of insulin. At lower temperatures, however, the protective ability of αA- and α-crystallin declines rapidly between 35 °C and 30 °C, whereas αB-crystallin offers significant protection even at 25 °C. The data indicate that αB-crystallin displays significant chaperone-like activity at temperatures lower than physiological temperatures, unlike αA- or α-crystallin, which work efficiently only at or above physiological temperatures. α-crystallin in its native state is a hydrophobic yet highly soluble protein. It is known that a slight perturbation of its conformation by heat (16Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupert J. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 30-92Crossref Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 17Raman B. Rao Ch.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or chaotropic agents (16Vicart P.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) results in an increase in its hydrophobicity and, therefore, its substrate binding capacity. To check if the observed differences in protective abilities are due to differences in their hydrophobicities, we have probed the hydrophobic surfaces of αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates at 25 °C and 60 °C using the polarity-sensitive fluorescent dye ANS. ANS fluoresces weakly in aqueous solutions, and its fluorescence quantum yield increases in a hydrophobic environment; its λ emission maximum (λem max) is indicative of the apolarity of its environment. This property of ANS has been exploited to monitor the hydrophobic surfaces of proteins (36Cardamone M. Puri N.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 586-593Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar), polysaccharides (37Sivakama Sundari C. Raman B. Balasubramanian D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1065: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and folding/unfolding intermediates of proteins (38Semisotnov G.V. Rodinova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Grippas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). At 25 °C, the fluorescence intensity of ANS bound to αB-crystallin is higher than that bound to αA- or α-crystallin, indicating a greater extent of hydrophobicity of αB-crystallin (Fig.5 A). At 60 °C the difference in fluorescence intensities is much less (Fig.5 B) compared with that seen at 25 °C. Fig. 5 Cshows the shift in the λem max of ANS bound to αA-, αB-, and α-crystallin as a function of temperature. The λem max of ANS bound to αB-crystallin is marginally red-shifted compared with αA- and α-crystallin, suggesting that the ANS-bound hydrophobic surfaces of αB-crystallin might be slightly more solvent-accessible at 25 °C. The λem max of ANS bound to all the proteins increases with temperature, indicating a further temperature-dependent exposure of the hydrophobic surfaces to the solvent. At lower temperatures, the shift in the λem max of fluorescence from αB-bound ANS is more compared with αA- or α-crystallin. However, at higher temperatures, gradually αA- and α-crystallin become comparable to αB-crystallin.Figure 5The normalized fluorescence emission spectrum of ANS bound to α-crystallin (solid line), αA-crystallin (dotted line), and αB-crystallin (dashed line) at 25 °C (A) and 60 °C (B). The concentrations of ANS and the proteins were 100 μm and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively. C, the fluorescence emission maximum of ANS bound to α-crystallin (○), αA-crystallin (▴), and αB-crystallin (▵) as a function of temperature. The excitation and emission bandpasses were 3 nm and 1.5 nm, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further investigate the differences in the temperature-dependent structural changes of αA- and αB-crystallin, we recorded far (Fig. 6) and near UV-CD (Fig. 7) spectra between 25 °C and 65 °C. As can be seen from Fig. 6 A, the secondary structure of αA-crystallin does not show significant changes with temperature, except an enhanced CD signal at 207 nm at higher temperature. αB-crystallin, on the other hand, shows a significantly larger change. The far UV-CD spectra show a gradual increase in ellipticity at 217 nm with temperature. This increase in ellipticity at 217 nm is more for αB-crystallin than αA-crystallin and is dependent on both the protein (data not shown) and salt concentrations (Fig. 6 C). The observed change in ellipticity at 217 nm is larger at higher protein and salt concentrations. A similar increase in ellipticity has been observed for the native heteroaggregate of α-crystallin (39Maiti M. Kono M. Chakrabarti B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 236: 109-114Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 40Surewicz W.K. Olesen P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9655-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However the reports differ in the extent of this increase. These differences can be explained on the basis of our results on individual subunits. In the earlier reports, α-crystallin used was isolated from the lens cortex (39Maiti M. Kono M. Chakrabarti B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 236: 109-114Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or the whole lens (40Surewicz W.K. Olesen P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9655-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Since the composition of α-crystallin varies from the outer cortex to the nucleus, with αB-crystallin being higher in the cortex, differential composition of α-crystallin could lead to the observed differences. Above 60 °C, the signal at 207 nm increases. The extent of this increase at 207 nm is not dependent on salt concentration (Fig. 6 D). The observed increase in signal at 207 nm around 60 °C appears to correspond to the transition observed for α-crystallin by Ramar and Rao (20Raman B. Rao Ch.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23559-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), Surewicz and Olesen (40Surewicz W.K. Olesen P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9655-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and Walsh et al. (41Walsh M.T. Sen A.C. Chakrabarti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20079-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The changes in the tertiary structure of αA- and αB- crystallin homoaggregates between 25 °C and 65 °C, monitored by near UV-CD, show interesting differences (Fig. 7). αA-crystallin homoaggregate (Fig.7 A) shows significant alteration of tertiary structure only above 50 °C, whereas αB-crystallin homoaggregate shows considerable loss by 45 °C. This is evident from Fig. 7 C, which compares the change in chirality at 272 nm between 25 °C and 65 °C. The changes observed at 259 nm and 266 nm are similar but differ in intensity (data not shown). Taken together the near and far UV-CD spectra indicate that αB-crystallin loses its tertiary structure but retains significant secondary structure at about 50 °C, a characteristic of the molten globule state. At 65 °C, both the proteins exhibit extensive loss of tertiary structure but retain some secondary structure.Figure 7Temperature-dependent changes in the tertiary structure of αA-crystallin (A) and αB-crystallin (B) between 25 °C and 65 °C monitored by near UV-CD.

Alterations in this structure could lead to a change in their accessibility. We have investigated the accessibility of tryptophan(s) in αA- and αB-crystallin to the neutral quencher acrylamide. Fig.8 A shows the Stern-Volmer plot of quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by acrylamide at 40 °C. The tryptophan fluorescence from αB-crystallin is quenched at a lower acrylamide concentration than that from αA-crystallin. The two tryptophans in bovine αB-crystallin are at positions 9 and 60. The single tryptophan of bovine αA-crystallin is at position 9. As mentioned earlier, αA- and αB-crystallins undergo a change in structure with temperature. We have monitored the change in the accessibility of the tryptophans in αA- and αB-crystallin to a fixed amount of acrylamide as a function of temperature (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The change inF 0/F as a function of temperature reflects a change in accessibility. Fig. 8 B shows that even at 25 °C the accessibility of the tryptophans in αB-crystallin is more than that in αA-crystallin. Upto 45 °C the change in the accessibility of the tryptophans in both the proteins increases gradually. Above 45 °C the F 0/F value increases more significantly for αB-crystallin, indicating further change in structure. The F 0/F for αA-crystallin also increases above 50 °C, although not as sharply as in the case of αB-crystallin. All the above results suggest that despite being evolutionarily related and having a high degree of sequence homology, αA- and αB-crystallin show some remarkable differences in their structural stability and chaperone-like activity. At physiological temperatures, αB-crystallin is a better chaperone-like molecule than αA-crystallin. This difference is even more prominent at temperatures below 30 °C, where αA- and α-crystallin do not offer any significant protection against aggregation of target proteins. This appears to be due to its higher hydrophobicity and a greater exposure of these hydrophobic patches to the solvent at this temperature. This is perhaps also reflected in the greater accessibility of the tryptophans in αB-crystallin to acrylamide compared with that in αA-crystallin. However, our study does not address the question if differences in charge distribution on the surfaces of αA- and αB-crystallin or differences in their aggregate sizes may have any role in this process. Flexibility calculations by Bloemendal and Bloemendal (42Bloemendal M. Bloemendal H. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) show that αB-crystallin is more flexible than αA-crystallin. This property may indicate the easier loss of structure in αB-crystallin. Our results show that αB-crystallin is structurally less stable and shows significant structural alteration by 45 °C. In comparison, αA-crystallin shows significant changes above 55 °C. The thermal stability of α-crystallin can therefore be attributed to its subunit αA-crystallin. αB-crystallin has the greater chaperone-like activity but lower structural stability. αA-crystallin has lower chaperone-like activity but a greater structural stability. The properties of α-crystallin (heteroaggregate) is a compromise between structural stability and chaperone-like activity. Modulation of αA- to αB-crystallin ratio could shift the balance. The stability of αA-crystallin may be one of the reasons for its predominance in the eye lens, a tissue that does not show protein turnover. In fact, targeted disruption of the mouse αA-crystallin gene results in cataract and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing αB-crystallin (43Brady J.P. Garland D. Duglas-Tabor Y. Robinson W.G. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Since αB-crystallin is seen in many nonlenticular tissues and in pathological conditions, it may be this ability to offer greater protection and the ability to increase/up-regulate this level of activity under stress that makes it important. It is interesting to note that the composition of α-crystallin is different in the lens epithelial cells and the inner cortex. In the bovine lens, the ratio of αA- to αB-crystallin in the lens epithelial cells is 1:3, whereas that in the post-differentiated fiber cells is 3:1 (44Delcour J. Papaconstantinou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the lens, the presence of αB-crystallin in the α-crystallin heteroaggregate, by virtue of its sensitivity to structural change, could directly increase the chaperone-like activity or could do so by inducing global changes in the arrangement/packaging of subunits in the aggregate.

When activated, the intracellular death domain in Fas/APO-1 binds to FADD/MORT-1, which then recruits FLICE (caspase 8/MACHα1).

Synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal domain of p53 such as residues aa 363–393 bind directlyin vitro to wild-type p53 (17Muller-Tiemann B.F. Halazonetis T.D. Elting J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6079-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Binding experiments with p53 proteins that contain selected deletions indicate that binding of the free aa 363–393 peptide to p53 requires the presence ofboth C-terminal aa 363–393 and N-terminal aa 80–93 sequences in the p53 protein (17Muller-Tiemann B.F. Halazonetis T.D. Elting J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6079-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This observation suggests either that the free peptide may interact simultaneously with both regions or that the absence of either or both of these segments in p53 results in structural changes in the protein, lowering its affinity for the free peptide.Deletion of either or both of these regulatory regions, as well as various C-terminal modifications, stimulate specific DNA binding of p53in vitro (3Ko L.J. Prives C. Gene Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 18Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P.

Previous studies demonstrated that the addition of a chemically modified C-terminal p53 peptide restoredin vitro sequence-specific DNA binding function to mutant p53-273 (Arg to His). Furthermore, intranuclear microinjection of this peptide into SW480 colon carcinoma cells carrying an endogenous p53-273 His mutation restored transcriptional activation of a p53-responsive reporter construct (20Abarzua P. LoSardo J.E. Gubler M.L. Spathis R. Lu Y.A. Felix A. Neri A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2477-2482PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a p53 C-terminal 22-amino acid peptide (corresponding to residues 361–382), fused to theAntennapedia (Ant) homeobox domain (17 aa) to facilitate cellular uptake, suppressed growth, and induced apoptosis of SW480 cells (21Selivanova G. Iotsova V. Okan I. Fritsche M. Strom M. Groner B. Grafstrom R.C. Wiman K.G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of action of the fusion peptide and effects on nonmalignant cells are not known. In this study, we report the peptide mechanisms for inducing apoptosis in breast carcinoma cell lines carrying endogenous mutant p53 or overexpressed wt p53. Using conformational energy calculations to compute the low energy conformations for the N- and C-terminal regulatory domains, we find that these two domains can form a unique low energy complex, suggesting that a direct interaction can exist between them.RESULTSA number of peptides from the C-terminal region of p53 were tested for inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in various tumor cell lines. These peptides were fused to anAntennapedia-derived 17-aa domain for efficient intracellular uptake (29Brugidou J. Legrand C. Mery J. Rabie A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Similar to the peptide reported by Selivanova et al. (21Selivanova G. Iotsova V. Okan I. Fritsche M. Strom M. Groner B. Grafstrom R.C. Wiman K.G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), we found peptide p53 aa 361–382 to be most effective for inducing apoptosis when fused toAntennapedia. This peptide, referred to as Ant-p53pep hereafter, was chosen for further study. The mean IC50 for induction of apoptosis by Ant-p53pep in human breast tumor cells was found to be 30 μm, and this concentration was used throughout. The Antennapedia peptide alone displayed no cytotoxic effects when tested up to 500 μm (data not shown).Induction of Apoptosis by Ant-p53pepEffects of Ant-p53pep were tested using the MDA-MB-468 human breast carcinoma cell line, which contains an endogenous p53-273His mutant gene (30Nigro J.M. Baker S.J. Preisinger A.C. Jessup J.M. Hostetter R. Cleary K. Bigner S.H. Davidson N. Baylin S. Devilee P. Glover T. Collins F.S. Weston A. Modali R. Harris C.C. Jogelstein B. Nature. 1989; 342: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar). This mutation has been reported as one of the two most prevalent mutated spots in the p53 gene, accounting for up to 18% of all p53 mutations (3Ko L.J. Prives C. Gene Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The effect of Ant-p53pep on cell viability was initially examined by trypan blue exclusion. Cell viability counts showed a 10-fold decrease in viable cells after a 5-h treatment with 30 μm Ant-p53pep in MDA-MB-468 cells. In contrast, the peptide at 30 μmfor 5 h did not have any effect upon viability in the nonmalignant wt p53 breast epithelial cell line, MCF10-2A (data not shown).To investigate the mechanism of peptide-induced cytotoxicity, we determined whether cell death was due to apoptosis and whether the effect was specific for the peptide. The DNA content and integrity were measured by flow cytometry of propidium iodide stained cells (31Gorman A.M. Samali A. McGowan A.J. Cotter T.G. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A sub-G1 peak characteristic of apoptotic cells was detected at 5 h in MDA-MB-468 cells treated with 30 μmAnt-p53pep but not when treated with Antennapedia or p53pep alone at the same concentration and exposure time (Fig.1 A). The percentage of sub-G1 content cells was 30–40% in Ant-p53pep-treated MDA-MD-468 cells. We did not detect any other significant change in the cell cycle profile. Two other human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 carrying a p53 mutation at aa 280 (32Thor A.D Moore II., D.H. Edgerton S.M. Kawasaki E.S. Reihsaus E. Lynch H.T. Marcus J.N. Schwartz L. Chen L.C. Mayall B.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) and MCF7 overexpressing wt p53 were also induced into apoptosis by 30 μm Ant-p53pep (Fig. 1 A). To exclude the possibility of cytotoxic effects on nonmalignant cells, we tested MCF10-2A and 27sk, a normal skin fibroblast line. Growth and viability of MCF10-2A and 27sk cells, both expressing low levels of wt p53, were not affected by 30 μm of Ant-p53pep when observed over a period of 72 h (Fig. 1 A).Apoptotic cell death was further confirmed by binding of Annexin V to the externalized phospholipid phosphatidylserine. In many cell types, phosphatidylserine becomes exposed to the extracellular environment because of the loss of membrane asymmetry during the early phase of apoptosis (33Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4546) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with 30 μmof Ant-p53pep for various time periods and then incubated with Annexin V-FITC and analyzed by flow cytometry. Fig. 1 B shows approximately 35% of cells bound Annexin V following 30 min of exposure to Ant-p53pep (dotted line) compared with the untreated control (solid line). We have also observed Annexin V binding in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells but not in 27sk cells (data not shown). MDA-MB-468 cells showed characteristic morphological changes associated with apoptosis, including membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, and nuclear fragmentation. The morphology of peptide-treated MCF10-2A cells was similar to control cells (data not shown). Furthermore, treatment of a p53 null/null breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453, with Ant-p53pep, showed no accumulation of sub-G1 DNA content or Annexin V binding (Fig.1 C). Two other cell lines with null p53 status, H1299, a lung adenocarcinoma line, and Saos2, an osteosarcoma line, also were not induced into apoptosis by Ant-p53pep (data not shown).Mechanism of Apoptosis Induced by Ant-p53pepWe investigated possible mechanisms for peptide-induced apoptosis. The MDA-MB-468 cell line was selected for further studies because it contains a single copy of R273H mutation of p53. The R273 mutation is the most prevalent mutation in p53 that abolishes both DNA binding and transcriptional ability of p53 (2Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavetich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar, 34Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6698) Google Scholar). The p53-R273H mutant proteins have been shown to interact with p53-derived peptide in in vitro DNA binding studies (20Abarzua P. LoSardo J.E. Gubler M.L. Spathis R. Lu Y.A. Felix A. Neri A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2477-2482PubMed Google Scholar). The endogenous levels of p53 were determined by Western blot analysis in MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, and MCF10-2A cells after Ant-p53pep treatment for 3 h (Fig.2 A). As expected, MDA-MB-468 cells expressed a high level of mutant p53-273H, a very low level of wt p53 in MCF10-2A, and no expression of p53 in MDA-MB-453 cells. Levels of p53 were not altered after Ant-p53pep treatment. Interestingly, cycloheximide treatment of MDA-MB-468 cells prior to addition of Ant-p53pep did not block apoptosis (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that Ant-p53pep-induced apoptosis was not dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in expression levels of known apoptotic regulators such as Bax, Bak, and Bcl-XL in MDA-MB-468 cells following treatment with Ant-p53pep for up to 3 h as analyzed by Western blot (Fig.2 C). These data indicated that Bax, a direct transcriptional target of p53, is not induced by Ant-p53pep. There was also no induction of p21/WAF1 level as evidenced by lack of cell cycle arrest with Ant-p53pep treatment (Fig. 1 A). These data suggest that transcriptional activation function by p53, or at least induction of Bax, is not required for apoptosis of Ant-p53pep-treated MDA-MB-468 cells.Figure 2A, p53 expression in MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, and MCF10-2A cells. Cells were treated with 30 μm Ant-p53pep for 3 h. 100 μg of total lysate was analyzed by Western blot analysis using DO-1 p53 antibody.B, MDA-MB-468 cells were incubated with cycloheximide at 10 μg/ml for 18 h and then treated with or without 30 μm Ant-p53pep for 3 h and analyzed for sub-G1 content cells by flow cytometry as described for Fig. 1 A. C, expression of Bax, Bak, and Bcl-XL. MDA-MB-468 cells were incubated in the presence of Ant-p53pep for 3 h. 50 μg of total protein prepared from either untreated or treated cells were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis with anti-Bax, anti-Bak, or anti-Bcl-XL antibodies (Santa Cruz, CA). Proteins were detected using ECL Western blotting detection system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because peptide-induced apoptosis occurred very rapidly in the absence of new protein synthesis, possible changes in cell surface expression of Fas/APO-1 in MDA-MB-468 cells were examined by flow cytometry. Cells were incubated with Ant-p53pep and controls for various times and labeled with FITC-conjugated Fas antibody prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. In Fig.3 A, MDA-MB-468 cells showed ∼40% higher levels of extracellular Fas/APO-1 protein within 30 min of Ant-p53pep treatment at 30 μm, as determined by a shift of peak (black area). Neither p53pep norAntennapedia alone affected accumulation of extracellular Fas/APO-1 whose peaks coincided with the untreated control (white area, Fig. 3 A). Similarly, extracellular localization of FasL was also increased by about 30% in MDA-MB-468 cells incubated for 30 min with 30 μm Ant-p53pep (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, nonmalignant MCF10-2A and MDA-MB-453 p53 null cells did not show any increase in cell surface Fas/APO-1 by Ant-p53pep treatment (Fig. 3 B and data not shown, respectively). Total cellular level of Fas/APO-1 in Westerns was not altered by Ant-p53pep treatment in both MDA-MB-468 and MCF10-2A cells (data not shown). MCF10-2A cells, however, did undergo apoptosis in the presence of agonistic, apoptosis-inducing Fas IgM antibody at 500 ng/ml within 3 h, indicating that the Fas/APO-1 signaling death pathway was functional in these cells (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, treatment of MDA-MB-468 cells with 30 μm Ant-p53pep for 2 h generated the characteristic truncated active form of FLICE (p26) by Western blot (Fig. 4). These data suggest that the apoptosis in Ant-p53pep-treated MDA-MB-468 cells was mediated through the Fas/APO-1 signaling pathway and resulted in FLICE activation.Figure 3Increased extracellular localization of Fas/FasL. MDA-MB-468 (A) or MCF10-2A (B) were treated with 30 μm Ant-p53pep, Ant, p53pep, or no peptide for 1 h.

Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar). The processed, active CPP32 cleaves various substrates including PARP. The activity of CPP32 was measured in an in vitro assay using the fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrate, Ac-DEVD-AMC. Fluorescence produced from cleaved AMC is directly proportional to the amount of CPP32 activity present in cell lysates. Fig. 5 A shows measurements of CPP32 activity in lysates prepared from cells treated either with or without 30 μm Ant-p53pep for 2 h. CPP32 activity in MDA-MB-468 cells was increased by ∼6-fold above base line when treated with Ant-p53pep compared with the untreated control (Fig.5 A). In contrast, MCF 10-2A cell lysates showed no significant increase in CPP32 activity following treatment with the peptide (Fig. 5 A). Studies with control p53pep orAntennapedia alone showed no effect on CPP32 activity (data not shown). Ant-p53pep treatment did not alter ICE activity as measured with an ICE-specific fluorogenic substrate (Fig. 5 A).Figure 5A, Ant-p53pep increased CPP32 protease activity. CPP32 and ICE protease activities were measured in anin vitro assay using lysate prepared from cells treated (+) or untreated (−) with 30 μm Ant-p53pep for 2 h. The background level of fluorescence was subtracted from each measurement.B, cleavage of PARP. The [35S]methionine-labeled, truncated 48-kDa PARP was translated in vitro from reticulocyte lysates and incubated with 20 μg of lysates prepared from either Ant-p53pep-treated (2 h at 30 μm) or untreated MDA-MB-468, MCF10-2A, and MDA-MB-453 (null p53) cells. Cleaved product of PARP is indicated withasterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further assess the activation of the apoptotic cascade, a truncated 48-kDa form of PARP was translated in vitro and incubated with lysates prepared from either Ant-p53pep-treated or untreated MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, and MCF10-2A cells. As shown in Fig.5 B, a proteolytically cleaved [35S]-PARP fragment was detected only from lysates of MDA-MB-468 cells treated with 30 μm Ant-p53pep for 2 h but not in MCF10-2A or in a p53 null/null breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453 (Fig.5 B). Taken together, these data suggest that in these lines, Ant-p53pep activity is p53-dependent.Interaction of Ant-p53pep and p53 ProteinTo investigate whether peptide directly interacts with p53 protein and whether this interaction is important for peptide-induced apoptosis, we measured the interaction between Ant-p53pep and p53 protein. Mutant p53-273H and a truncated C terminus p53 fragment (p53-C; deletion in aa 1–359) werein vitro radiolabeled and incubated with a biotinylated Ant-p53pep conjugated to a streptavidin-agarose matrix. Fig.6 A shows binding of35S-labeled p53-273H to Ant-p53pep agarose but not to the streptavidin-agarose matrix alone. The truncated p53 C terminus fragment did not bind to Ant-p53pep (Fig. 6 A), suggesting that binding may occur outside the C terminus (aa 360–393) of p53. Furthermore, mutant p53-273H from extracts prepared directly from MDA-MB-468 cells also formed complexes with biotinylated Ant-p53pep (Fig. 6 B). Wild-type p53 protein from MCF10-2A also formed a complex with Ant-p53pep, although the amount was markedly lower than that in MDA-MB-468 extracts, possibly because of the low expression levels of p53 in nonmalignant MCF10-2A cells (Fig. 6 B), which did not undergo apoptosis when treated with Ant-p53pep (Fig.1 A).Figure 6Ant-p53pep binds to both wild-type and mutant p53 proteins. A, in vitro translated35S-labeled p53-273H or 35S-labeled truncated p53-C (Δaa1–359) were incubated with biotinylated Ant-p53pep conjugated to streptavidin-agarose beads (matrix) or matrix alone. Input represents 5% fraction of the total translated proteins.B, affinity precipitation of wt p53 and mutant p53-273H proteins by Ant-p53pep. Biotinylated Ant-p53pep affinity matrix was directly incubated with whole cell lysates from either MDA-MB-468 or MCF10-2A cells followed by Western blot as described under “Results.” Cell lysates were precleared with matrix alone prior to the binding experiments. The left panel indicates p53 proteins detected in 100 μg of total lysates with or without Ant-p53pep treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interaction of N- and C-terminal PeptidesOur finding that Ant-p53pep did not bind to the C terminus of p53, from which it was derived, suggested another possible interaction site on p53. One candidate region for the direct interaction of the C-terminal regulatory peptide is the N-terminal regulatory domain involving residues 80–93. To explore whether these two regions might interact with one another, we performed conformational energy calculations to generate the low energy conformations of each peptide. These low energy conformations of the central regions of each peptide were “docked” against one another to explore whether stable complexes could form. Using the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures,” we found a single lowest energy conformation for the 369–382 C-terminal sequence, an all α-helix consistent with other secondary structure predictions. 2Y. Zhang, personal communication. This structure was lower by 10 kcal/mol than the energy for the next competing structure. The lowest energy (global minimum) structure for the N-terminal (Ala-Pro)3 repeat sequence was, using the single letter conformational state code (36Zimmerman S.S. Pottle M.S. Nemethy G. Scheraga H.A. Macromolecules. 1977; 10: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), DADADC. This conformation was computed to have a probability of occurrence of 25%. The global energy minimum was found to have a total conformational energy that was over 5 kcal/mol lower than that of the next lowest energy structure. In this lowest energy structure, the helix axis of the DADADC conformation for (Ala-Pro)3 was aligned parallel to the helix axis of the 369–382 peptide as shown in stereo view in Fig.7. The two helices intercalate so that each of the Pro residues of (Ala-Pro)3 forms favorable contacts within grooves of the α-helix of the 369–382 sequence. The two helices are aligned such that most of the side chains of Lys residues, i.e. Lys370, Lys373, Lys381, and Lys382, of the 369–382 sequence point away from the face of this peptide that makes contacts with the (Ala-Pro)3 peptide. Several of the CH2 groups of the side chains of Lys372 and Arg379 contact the Pro residues, and the side chain CH3 group of Thr377 also contacts the second Pro residue. The complex therefore has amphipathic properties in which the interface between the two peptides tends to be nonpolar, whereas the hydrophilic Lys residues point away on the opposite face of the molecule. This unique lowest energy minimum suggests the possibility that p53aa84–89 might form a binding site within p53 for the Ant-p53pep.Figure 7Stereo view of computationally modeled interaction between the C-terminal p53aa369–382 and N-terminal p53aa84–89 peptides. The yellow peptide structure is a minimum energy conformation for p53aa369–382, and the bluepeptide structure is a minimum energy conformation for p53aa84–89. The peptides are viewed with the N termini at the top and the C termini at the bottom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThis study investigated mechanisms of apoptosis induced by p53-derived C-terminal peptide. Three human breast cancer cell lines, carrying either endogenously expressed mutant p53 or overexpressed wt p53, underwent rapid apoptosis after Ant-p53pep treatment. Peptide activity to induce apoptosis was not dependent upon de novoprotein synthesis. The transcription/translation-independent induction of apoptosis has been described in various systems in which a sequence-specific transactivation-defective p53 (Gln22/Ser23) mutant induced apoptosis in Saos2 osteosarcoma cells (37Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) and, similarly, in HeLa cells with a transcription-defective, truncated p53 (38Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). p53-dependent apoptosis also occurred in the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide through yet unknown mechanisms (5Caelles C. Heimberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that induction of apoptosis is mediated through Fas/APO-1 pathway in MDA-MB-468 cells and is p53-dependent because apoptosis was not observed in p53 null cell lines (MDA-MB-453, H1299, and Saos2). Moreover, mutant p53 was found to complex with Ant-p53pep. The mechanisms by which Ant-p53pep and p53 complex initiate the Fas/APO-1 signaling pathway are not clear. Bennett et al. (39Bennett M. Macdonald K. Chan S-W. Luzio P.J. Simari R. Weissberg P. Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) recently reported that p53-induced apoptosis involved increased surface expression of Fas/APO-1 in untransformed human vascular smooth muscle cells carrying wt p53 that occurred within 1 h upon p53 activation. They further showed that increased cell surface Fas/APO-1 was due to redistribution of Fas/APO-1 from the Golgi complex (39Bennett M. Macdonald K. Chan S-W. Luzio P.J. Simari R. Weissberg P.

In addition, however, the short and long toxins display three major differences. First, Asp-38 is important in Ea in contrast to the homologous Glu-38 in α-Cbtx. Second, all of the first loop is insensitive to mutation in α-Cbtx, whereas its tip is functionally critical in Ea. Third, the C-terminal tail may be specifically critical in α-Cbtx. Therefore, the functional sites of long and short curaremimetic toxins are not identical, but they share common features and marked differences that might reflect an evolutionary pressure associated with a great diversity of prey receptors. α-Cobratoxin, a long chain curaremimetic toxin from Naja kaouthia venom, was produced recombinantly (rα-Cbtx) from Escherichia coli.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11335-113447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Despite this overall structural homogeneity, curaremimetic toxins can be divided into at least two major subfamilies on the basis of both their amino acid sequences (1Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press Inc., Tarrytown, NY1991: 165-222Google Scholar) and functional properties (7Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P. Bertrand D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24279-24286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). One subfamily involves the long chain toxins with 66–74 residues and 5 disulfide bonds, which bind with high affinities to both muscular-type and α7 neuronal receptors (1Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press Inc., Tarrytown, NY1991: 165-222Google Scholar, 7Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P. Bertrand D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24279-24286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The other subfamily involves short chain toxins with 60–62 residues and 4 disulfide bonds, which bind with high affinity to muscular-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors only (AChRs).1 Several specific structural deviations differentiate toxins from both categories. Thus, the long chain toxins have a longer C-terminal tail, an additional small loop cyclized by a fifth disulfide bond located at the tip of the central loop and a shorter first loop. One of these deviations,i.e. the fifth disulfide bond, has been associated with the unique ability of long chain toxins to bind to α7 receptors with high affinities (7Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P. Bertrand D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24279-24286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, curaremimetic toxins isolated from theLaticauda colubrina venom do not fall into either of these two major subfamilies. Such toxins have the size of long chain toxins (69 residues) but lack the fifth disulfide bond and bind with high affinity to muscular-type AChRs only (7Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P. Bertrand D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24279-24286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, in contrast to what has been believed during the past 2 decades, curaremimetic toxins do not form a homogeneous family of proteins. This conclusion raises, therefore, the possibility that short and long chain toxins may not achieve their comparable binding to muscular-type AChR by identical means. To approach this question, the sites where both types of toxins bind to the same type of AChR need to be elucidated. Previously, mutational studies have been carried out with a view to understanding how short chain toxins recognize muscular-type AChRs. Initially, 10 residues were found to be important for erabutoxin a (Ea), a toxin from the sea snake Laticauda semifasciata, to bind to AChR from Torpedo (8Pillet L. Tremeau O. Ducancel F. Drevet P.

Boulain J.C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9362-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Among these, Lys-27, Trp-29, Asp-31, Arg-33, Glu-38, and Lys-47 are highly conserved in both short and long chain curaremimetic toxins, whereas Ser-8, Gln-7, Gln-10, and Ile-36 are more variable. In these studies, no attempt was made to identify the contribution of these functional residues to either one of the two toxin-binding sites. More recently, other studies also showed that the invariant residues Lys-27 and Arg-33, and to a lesser extent Lys-47, are important for a short chain toxin fromNaja mossambica mossambica to bind to mouse muscle AChR and contribute differently to the two toxin-binding sites (10Ackermann E.J. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12836-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Malany S. Ackermann E. Osaka H. Taylor P. J. Physiol. ( Paris ). 1998; 92: 462-463Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, the greater understanding of the functional sites of short chain toxins is emerging. In sharp contrast, and despite a number of preliminary studies based on numerous chemical modifications (12Martin B.M. Chibber B.A. Maelicke A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11178-11185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the functional sites of long chain toxins remain unclear. The aim of this paper was to identify residues that are important for α-cobratoxin (α-Cbtx), a long chain toxin from Naja kaouthia, in its binding to muscular-type AChR. To approach this question, we (i) constructed a cDNA encoding α-Cbtx; (ii) expressed it as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli; (iii) showed that the unfused recombinant toxin (rα-Cbtx) is indistinguishable from the venom toxin; (iv) performed 35 mutations at 29 different positions covering the whole loop I of α-Cbtx, part of loops II and III, and its C-terminal tail. The data demonstrate that α-Cbtx and the short chain Ea share both similarities and marked differences in binding to the same muscular-type receptor. A synthetic gene for α-Cbtx was designed by back-translating the primary amino acid sequence of native α-Cbtx and then optimizing the codon usage for expression in E. coli. To obtain optimal expression of the recombinant α-Cbtx, we used a ZZ fusion protein strategy with the pCP vector, a pET3a derivative plasmid previously described (19Drevet P. Lemaire C. Gasparini S. ZinnJustin S. Lajeunesse E. Ducancel F. Pinkasfeld S. Courcon M. Tremeau O. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Expression of ZZ fusion proteins is inducible in theE. coli host strain BL21(DE3) which contains the structural gene for the T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase under lacrepressor control. To create the desired synthetic gene, 10 oligomers ranging in length from 26 to 59 nucleotides were synthesized and purified by polyacrylamide/urea gel electrophoresis followed by elution in 0.5m ammonium acetate. Equimolar mixtures of sense and complementary oligonucleotides were annealed at 95 °C for 5 min and cooled to room temperature overnight, and the five double-stranded oligonucleotides were then ligated by T4 DNA ligase (Appligene Oncor) in three steps. A small quantity of the complete synthetic gene (213 base pairs) flanked by KpnI and BamHI restriction sites and containing the following sequence (sense strand) was obtained: 5′-ATCCGTTGCTTCATTACTCCTGATATCACCTCCAAGGACTGTCCGAACGGTCACGTTTGCTACACCAAGACTTGGTGCGATGCTTTCTGCTCCATCCGTGGAAAACGTGTTGACCTGGGATGTGCTGCTACCTGCCCGACCGTTAAAACCGGTGTTGACATCCAGTGTTGCTCCACTGATAACTGTAACCCTTTCCCTACTCGTAAGCGCCCT-3′. The final construct was amplified using standard polymerase chain reaction procedures with two oligonucleotides A (5′-GGCGCCGGCCGCGGTACCCATGATCCGTTGCTTCATTACT-3′) and B (5′-GGCGCGGGCCGCGGATCCTTATTAAGGGCGCTTACGAGTAGGG-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was isolated by low melting agarose electrophoresis and then digested with KpnI andBamHI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The doubly digested fragment was ligated into a KpnI/BamHI-digested pCP plasmid at 16 °C for 3 h. DH5α-competent cells were transformed with the ligation mixture, and single colonies were screened for insert by polymerase chain reaction using two oligonucleotides specific for pCP. Five clones were sequenced by double-stranded DNA sequencing (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech T7 SequencingTM Kit). Isolated plasmid (Promega, Wizard Plus Minipreps Kit) was used to transform the BL21(DE3)-inducible strain. The nucleotide sequences of the probes used for mutagenesis are available upon request. They were synthesized by Eurobio and purified by polyacrylamide/urea gel electrophoresis followed by elution in 0.5m ammonium acetate. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene. The mutated genes were determined using the ABI.PRISMTM A310 Genetic Analyses of Perkin-Elmer applied biosystems. The bacterial host used for cytoplasmic expression of ZZ-Cbtx hybrid wild-type and mutants wasE. coli BL21(DE3). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C to late log phase (A 600 = 0.6 to 0.8) in Luria broth (Difco) supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Bacteria were then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-β-d-thio-1-galactopyranoside (Eurobio) for 3 h. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma)) and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). After three freezing-unfreezing steps, 2 mg/ml protamine sulfate (Sigma) was added, and the solution was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was then applied to an IgG-Sepharose-6FF column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the hybrid was eluted with 0.5 m acetic acid, pH 3.4, and lyophilized. Protein concentration was estimated by UV absorption at 280 nm. The lyophilisate was resuspended with 0.1n HCl in the presence of a 100-fold excess of CNBr and incubated at room temperature for 6 h. The solution was then diluted 10-fold with water and lyophilized to stop the reaction. Treated sample at the concentration of 0.1 mg/ml was refolded in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 4 mm GSH and 2 mmGSSG (Sigma). The refolded α-Cbtx was purified by chromatography on a reverse phase HPLC column (Vydac, C4, 10 μm, 1 × 25 cm). The column was equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and elution was performed using an H2O/trifluoroacetic acid 0.1%, CH3CN gradient of 21–40% acetonitrile. The purity of wild-type and α-Cbtx mutants was assessed by (i) SDS-PAGE electrophoresis with silver staining, (ii) chromatography on an analytical reverse phase HPLC column (Vydac, C4, 5 μm, 0.46 × 25 cm), and (iii) electrospray mass spectroscopy. Dichroic spectra were recorded at 22 °C using a CD 6 Jobin-Yvon dichrograph to show that the toxins were correctly folded. The concentration of purified α-Cbtx was determined (i) by measuring the absorbance at 278 nm of a given solution of toxin and (ii) by using amino acid analysis. Competition experiments with AChR fromTorpedo marmorata, prepared as described previously (8Pillet L. Tremeau O. Ducancel F. Drevet P. Zinn Justin S. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. J. Biol.

Varying concentrations of wild-type or mutated α-Cbtx were incubated in 0.25 ml of Ringer buffer containing 4 nm toxin-binding sites and 6.4 nm3H-toxin α, for at least 5 h at 20 °C. The same results were obtained when the solutions were incubated overnight, indicating that our experiments were performed at equilibrium. The mixtures were filtered through Millipore filters (HAWP) that had been soaked in Ringer buffer. The filters were washed with 6 ml of Ringer buffer, dried, and after addition of 10 ml of scintillation solution (Lipoluma) counted on a Rackbeta counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding measurements were analyzed using the empirical Hill equation in order to define the Hill coefficient, which could be correlated to the presence of one (n H = 1) or two binding sites (n H less than unity). The functions describing competitive binding of rα-Cbtx mutants to either a single site or two independent sites were then fitted by nonlinear regression. Statistical improvement in the computer fit for a two-site model versusa one-site model was determined by the extra sum of squares principle (20Rodbard D. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1255-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) utilizing the F test. The two-site model was accepted when the statistical comparison between the two models gave a value ofp < 0.05. The IC50 values determined by nonlinear regression analysis were converted to apparent dissociation constants values (K d) as described by Cheng and Prusoff (21Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12329) Google Scholar). All these fits and the statistical analyses were performed using the Prism software (GraphPad). The experimental conditions were such that the minimal K i value that can be determined from competition data was not lower than about 6 pm. This value can be readily deduced from the equation by Cheng and Prusoff (21Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12329) Google Scholar), in which the dissociation constant of the radioactive ligand is equal to 20 pm (8Pillet L. Tremeau O. Ducancel F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9362-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the radioactive ligand concentration is 6.4 nm, and the concentration of binding sites 4 nm. As theK i value of the wild-type α-Cbtx was 58 pm (see below), our experimental conditions allowed us to show that a mutation could raise binding affinity by no more than about 9-fold (58/6 pm). However, as discussed below, such a situation was never encountered. By using a strategy that was previously successfully applied to the production of short chain curaremimetic toxins (19Drevet P. Lemaire C. Gasparini S. ZinnJustin S. Lajeunesse E. Ducancel F. Pinkasfeld S. Courcon M. Tremeau O. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the long chain α-Cbtx was produced in the cytoplasm of E. colifused to ZZ, a two IgG binding domain from protein A. The fusion protein was isolated by chromatography on an IgG-Sepharose 6FF column. The eluted fusion protein was produced with a yield of 30 mg/liter culture. Critical conditions were required for efficient cyanogen bromide cleavage of the fusion protein. The medium should be highly acidic (0.1 n HCl) to reduce the cleavage time to 6 h, at room temperature. Also, the fusion protein should not be re-oxidized before the cleavage treatment. These conditions constituted an appropriate compromise for the fusion protein to be cleaved without significant degradation of the cleaved moieties. The resulting material was refolded and purified. Fig. 1 shows SDS-PAGE of the recombinant toxin at different stages of production and purification, from the fusion protein to the purified refolded toxin. The final material migrated as a single band at the expected molecular weight, like α-Cbtx purified from venom. The recombinant material was chemically pure and comparable to the venom toxin as inferred from various lines of evidence. First, the recombinant toxin co-eluted with the native toxin in analytical reverse phase chromatography. Second, the recombinant and venom toxins have identical amino acid compositions and N-terminal amino acid sequences. Third, the far UV CD spectra of the venom and recombinant toxins were virtually superimposable (Fig.2). The two toxins have similar contents of β-sheet, the major structural component of α-Cbtx (5Walkinshaw M.D. Saenger W. Maelicke A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2400-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Betzel C. Lange G. Pal G.P. Wilson K.S. Maelicke A. Saenger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21530-21536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, electrospray mass analyses indicate the same mass value for both toxins: 7820.3, close to the theoretical value of 7821. Finally, the molar absorbance of the recombinant and folded toxin was 9670m−1·cm−1, a value identical to that determined for the venom toxin. The recombinant toxin therefore displays all the expected physicochemical characteristics of α-Cbtx. The final yield in toxin production was 1.2 mg/liter of culture.Figure 2Circular dichroism spectra of native and recombinant α-Cbtx. The CD spectra obtained for all the mutants, not presented in this figure, are highly homologous to those measured for the native or the recombinant toxins, confirming that these mutants are properly folded. rec, recombinant,View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Binding affinities of venom and rα-Cbtx to Torpedo AChR were determined on the basis of competition experiments, using3H-toxin α as a radioactive tracer. Typical competition binding curves obtained with the native and recombinant toxins are shown in Fig. 3. These data tally well with competition for a single class of binding sites. TheK d value deduced from these competition experiments indicates an equilibrium binding constant for rα-Cbtx equal to 58 ± 7 pm, a value that agrees with that obtained for the venom toxin, 39 ± 5 pm (Fig. 3 and TableI).Table IDissociation constants of toxin wild types and mutants on the Torpedo receptorCbtxK dK d′/K dΔΔGEaK dΔΔGpmkcal/molpmkcal/molCbtx native39 ± 50.67−0.24Cbtx rec58 ± 710Ea rec700F4A63 ± 61.10.05I5A36 ± 90.62−0.28T6A51 ± 160.87−0.08S8T750/83,3001.38/4.13P7A49 ± 60.85−0.09D8A50 ± 30.86−0.09Q10A933/36,6001.51/3.65D8R45 ± 120.77−0.15I9A40 ± 190.69−0.22T10A39 ± 120.68−0.22S11A56 ± 30.96−0.02K12E59 ± 110D13A67 ± 31.10.05Y21F69 ± 121.20.11K23E118 ± 31/1595 ± 3742/27.50.40/1.94K27E2200/24,5002/3.41W25F128 ± 402.20.46W29F47002.45W25H212 ± 433.60.75W29H6001.25W25A641 ± 160111.40D27N146 ± 122.50.53D31N1000.23D27R1806 ± 6231.12.00D31H110/19,9000.26/3.26A28G47 ± 90.81−0.12A28R58 ± 2110F29L720 ± 9412.41.47F32L4701.13F29W74.7 ± 21.290.15F29A175 ± 5930.64C26S/C30S70 ± 61.20.11S31A65 ± 21.10.05I32A47 ± 30.81−0.12R33E44,500 ± 52007673.87R33E830/48,3001.44/3.81K35A64 ± 151.10.05R36A432 ± 137.41.17D38L149 ± 772.60.55E38L17301.87T47A65 ± 61.10.05K49E181 ± 43/3052 ± 6543.1/52.60.66/2.31K47E1175/21,9001.64/3.35D53K39 ± 60.67−0.20F65A394 ± 666.81.11P66A63 ± 91.10.05The left part shows dissociation constants ± S.E. of wild-type and mutated α-Cbtx, as deduced from binding competition data.

We performed mutations K23E, W25H, W25F, W25A, D27N, D27R, R33E, D38L, and K49E. We also mutated Tyr-21 because its structural role has been often proposed (1Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press Inc., Tarrytown, NY1991: 165-222Google Scholar). The introduced mutations were Y21A and Y21F. Although the tertiary structures of both short and long toxins nicely superimposed on their second and third loops, no structural fit was seen between their first loops, the tip of their loop II, and in their C-terminal tails (Fig. 4). To study the role of the first loop in rα-Cbtx, we mutated all residues from Phe-4 to Asp-13 into Ala; only Lys-12 was changed into Glu. The role of the tip of the central loop was first explored by mutating all residues located within the disulfide bond Cys-26—Cys-30. Thus, in addition to mutations made at positions 27, we introduced the mutations A28G, A28R and F29W, F29L, F29A. Then, the two half-cystines of the fifth disulfide bond were mutated into serine, and the vicinal Ser-31, Ile-32, Lys-35, and Arg-36 were mutated into alanine. The role of the C-terminal tail was probed by mutating the highly conserved Phe-65 and Pro-66 into alanine. Finally, we mutated Thr-47 and Asp-53 as a result of their spatial proximity to the invariant Lys-49. 35 mutants were prepared in satisfactory yields, not much different from that observed for the wild-type toxi"

Sequence identity was particularly high with 12-oxophytodienoate 10,11-reductase (OPR) fromArabidopsis thaliana. The cDNA-encoded protein was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein inEscherichia coli and was purified from bacterial extracts. The protein was found to be a flavoprotein catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of the olefinic bond of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, including 12-oxophytodienoic acid. Thus, the tomato enzyme was termed LeOPR. The catalytic efficiency of LeOPR was highest withN-ethylmaleimide followed by 12-oxophytodienoic acid and maleic acid as substrates. Photoreduction of theLeOPR-bound FMN resulted in the formation of a red, anionic semiquinone prior to the formation of the fully reduced flavin dihydroquinone. Spectroscopic characterization of LeOPR revealed the formation of charge transfer complexes upon titration withpara-substituted phenolic compounds, a distinctive feature of the enzymes of the OYE family. The ligand binding properties were compared between LeOPR and OYE, and the findings are discussed with respect to structural differences between the active sites of OYE and LeOPR.

Old Yellow Enzyme charge transfer glutathione S-transferase 12-oxophytodienoic acid 12-oxophytodienoate 10,11-reductase Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE)1(EC 1.6.99.1) was initially isolated from brewer's bottom yeast and was the first enzyme shown to possess a flavin cofactor (1Warburg O. Christian W. Naturwissenschaften. 1932; 20: 688Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 2Warburg O. Christian W. Biochem. Z. 1933; 266: 377-411Google Scholar). Despite extensive biochemical and spectroscopic characterization, the physiological role of the enzyme has remained obscure. OYE has been described as a diaphorase catalyzing the oxidation of NADPH in presence of molecular oxygen. However, molecular oxygen is commonly viewed as an opportunist electron acceptor, and the physiological oxidant has not been identified (3Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of electron acceptors for reduced OYE are known including the olefinic bond of α,β-unsaturated ketones and aldehydes, suggesting that the physiological substrate may comprise such a structural feature (4Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A growing family of OYE homologs has been identified in organisms with both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins (4Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7Franklund C.V. Baron S.F.

Recently, the cloning and sequencing of a higher plant OYE homolog from Arabidopsis thaliana has been described (10Schaller F. Weiler E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28066-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of 12-oxophytodienoate (OPDA) to yield 3-oxo-2(2′(Z)-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid and was therefore termed 12-oxophytodienoate 10,11-reductase (OPR). The OPR-catalyzed reaction is part of the biosynthetic pathway to jasmonic acid, a compound with multiple hormonal activities in higher plants (11Weiler E.W. Laudert D. Schaller F. Stelmach B. Henning P. Romeo Phytochemical Signals and Plant-Microbe Interactions. Plenum Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Two isoforms of this enzyme (OPRI and OPRII) exist inArabidopsis and in Corydalis sempervirens (Rock Harlequin), only one of which (OPRII) reduces the 9S,13S enantiomer of OPDA, the precursor of biologically active 7-(epi) jasmonic acid (12Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Schaller F. Henning P. Weiler E.W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Biesgen C. Weiler E.W. Planta. 1999; 208: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, OPRI does not accept the isomers of OPDA with the 13S-configuration as substrates, and the physiological role of this isoform remains obscure (13Schaller F. Henning P. Weiler E.W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We describe here the molecular cloning and overexpression in E. coli of an OPR from tomato plants, the purification of the recombinant enzyme, and the characterization of its substrate specificity. One of the most salient features of yeast OYE is its ability to form charge transfer (CT) complexes with a variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds carrying an ionizable hydroxyl group. Formation of the CT complex results in a long wavelength optical transition in the absorbance spectrum. A positive correlation was observed between the absorbance maximum of the newly formed long wavelength transition and the Hammett para-constant of thep-substituted phenolic compounds, which can be considered as a measure of the phenolate ionization potential (15Massey V. Schopfer L.M. Dunham W.R. Bray R.C. Engel P.C. Mayhew S.G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1984: 191-210Crossref Google Scholar). This finding and the pH dependence of binding suggest that in the CT complex, the bound phenolate and the oxidized flavin act as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively. We report here on the spectral properties of the charge transfer complexes formed between recombinantLeOPR and phenolic ligands. This is the first detailed description of the properties of CT complexes formed by an OYE homolog isolated from a higher plant. All basic molecular techniques were adapted from Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or Ausubelet al. (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley, New York1987: 247-269Google Scholar). A cDNA library was constructed from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Castlemart II) shoot tissue in the yeast/E. coli shuttle vector pYES2 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The LeOPR cDNA was isolated serendipitously by transformation of a yeast reporter strain 2J. Straßner and A. Schaller, unpublished data. using a selection system for proteases that interact with the peptide systemin (18Pearce G. Strydom D. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. Science. 1991; 253: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence of LeOPR was determined on both strands using fluorescent dideoxy chain terminators in the cycle sequencing reaction (Perkin-Elmer) and the Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer. Oligonucleotide sequencing and polymerase chain reaction primers were obtained from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). The open reading frame of the LeOPR cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (Perkin-Elmer) (5′ primer, ATGGAAAATAAAGTCGTTGA; 3′-primer, GGGGTACCTCATGTCATGGTTTCTAGAA) and cloned into the StuI and KpnI restriction sites of pGEX-G (19Görlach J. Schmid J. Gene. 1996; 170: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), a derivative of pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This vector allows expression of LeOPR in fusion with glutathione S-transferase under control of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducibletac promoter. The expression construct was verified by sequence analysis and was transformed into E. coli BL21. A 200-ml culture was grown from a single transformant and used to inoculate a 12-liter airlift fermentor (Bioengineering, Zürich, Switzerland). After 3 h at 30 °C, expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were allowed to grow for another 6 h at 30 °C, when they were harvested by centrifugation and subsequently stored at −80 °C until purification of LeOPR. E. coli cells (10 g) were resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1 mg/ml DNaseI, 1 mg/ml lysozym, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 20 min at room temperature, cells were lysed by sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (25000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (6-ml bed volume) equilibrated in Buffer A. After extensive washing with Buffer A and Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), the fusion protein (GST-OPR) was eluted with Buffer B containing 5 mm reduced glutathione. Factor Xa (Factor Xa cleavage and removal kit; Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) was used at a molar ratio of 1:150 with respect to GST-OPR during 48 h at room temperature in order to cleave the fusion protein at the predetermined site, releasing LeOPR with the authentic N-terminal methionine residue. The progress of cleavage was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Processed LeOPR was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose as before to remove the GST protein. The final purification step involved anion exchange chromatography using a MonoQ column (1-ml bed volume) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), a linear gradient of NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and theÄkta Explorer chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The progress of protein purification was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels using the buffer system described by Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Gels were stained for proteins using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. RNA was isolated from different tissues of tomato plants using a phenol-based extraction procedure (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA (5 μg) was separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to standard protocols. LeOPR transcripts were detected on the RNA gel blots using the radiolabeled cDNA (Prime-It DNA labeling system, Stratagene) as a probe. The hybridization and washing conditions were as described (21Schaller A. Oecking C. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 263-272PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blots were evaluated using a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Genomic DNA was extracted from tomato leaf tissue using the Nucleon Phytopure DNA extraction kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ten μg of DNA were restricted using the enzymes indicated in the legend to Fig. 3 and were subjected to DNA gel blot analysis according to standard protocols (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA gel blots were hybridized with the radiolabeled cDNA and washed at temperatures estimated to be 20 and 12 °C below the calculated melting point of the DNA hybrids, respectively. The blots were evaluated as described for RNA gel blot analyses. Apparent steady state kinetic constants were obtained by following the oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm in a Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments AG, Zürich, Switzerland), systematically varying the substrate concentration. Assays were performed at 25 °C in 1 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, including 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μm NADPH. (GST)-LeOPR was added at concentrations ranging from 0.725 to 72.5 nm, depending on the reaction rate observed with the respective substrate. The concentration of (GST)-LeOPR was determined spectrophotometrically at 465 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of ε465 = 11600 m−1cm−1. The extinction coefficient was determined by a comparison of the absorption maximum at 465 nm of purified (GST)-LeOPR with that of FMN released from the enzyme upon denaturation in presence of 2% SDS. The reaction was started upon the addition of the substrate. Whenever possible, stock solutions of the substrate were prepared in assay buffer. Some substrates had to be added from ethanolic stock solutions. In these cases, the final concentration of ethanol in the assay mixture was kept constant (2%) over the entire range of substrate concentrations. Assays were done in presence of an oxygen-consuming system (20 mm glucose, 10 units of glucose oxidase). The software SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) was used for evaluation of the observed reaction rates. Titrations were performed for GST-OPR and LeOPR (6 nm each) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. Spectra were recorded between 300 and 850 nm using a Uvikon 933 double-beam spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments AG). Photoreduction ofLeOPR was done under anaerobic conditions in argon-saturated phosphate buffer. EDTA (5 mm) was used as the electron donor. For photoreduction, the cuvette was illuminated (750 μmol m−2 s−1) using a slide projector. A 1254-base pair cDNA was isolated from a tomato shoot cDNA library, and both strands were sequenced (Fig. 1, GenBankTMaccession number AJ242551). The cDNA encompasses an open reading frame of 1128 nucleotides (ATG in position 108) that is preceded by an in-frame stop codon (TAA, position 81), indicating that the cDNA comprises the entire protein coding region. However, the 3′-untranslated region following the stop codon (TGA in position 1236) is unexpectedly short. Possibly, the A12 stretch at the 3′-end does not represent the poly(A) tail of the mRNA but rather an oligo(A) stretch within its 3′-untranslated region. The amino acid sequence deduced from the open reading frame was found to be most closely related (71.4% identity) to that of OPR from A. thaliana (10Schaller F. Weiler E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28066-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, as long as its physiological substrate remains unidentified, we will refer to the cDNA-derived protein asLeOPR. Sequence identities of 67–72, 29–33, and 18–40% were observed with other OYE-like enzymes of plant, fungal, and bacterial origin, respectively. A sequence alignment of the amino acid sequence deduced from the tomato cDNA, of SaccharomycesOYEs 1–3, and of other plant-derived OYE-related sequences is shown in Fig. 2. Considerable sequence identity was observed over the entire lengths of the deduced protein sequences. Two of the three amino acid residues involved in substrate binding are conserved between the plant and yeast sequences (tyrosine 376 and histidine 192 (numbering refers to yeast OYE1 as shown in Fig. 2; the respective numbers are lower by 1 in Fig. 8 because the crystallized OYE lacked the N-terminal methionine residue)), whereas asparagine 195 is replaced by a second histidine residue in LeOPR as well as in most of the other plant-derived sequences. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3 A) revealed the presence of LeOPR transcripts within all analyzed tissues of tomato plants. Steady state transcript levels were highest in suspension-cultured cells and in roots and were lowest in flowers. The Southern blot analysis of tomato genomic DNA is shown in Fig.3 B. The hybridization pattern observed after restriction of the DNA with MunI revealed two intensely labeled bands and three bands of lesser intensity. The sizes of the intensely labeled bands observed for MunI-restricted DNA correspond to those predicted from the cDNA sequence, whereas weakly labeled bands point to the existence of at least one additional gene closely related to that of LeOPR per haploid genome in tomato.Figure 2Comparison of amino acid sequences betweenLe OPR , yeast OYEs, and plant OYE homologs. The sequences of Sacharomyces carlsbergensis OYE1 (GenBankTM accession number Q02899), Saccharomyces cerevisiae OYE2 and OYE3 (accession numbers Q03588 and P41816), and OYE homologs from A. thaliana (accession numbers Y10617and U92460), Catharanthus roseus (accession number 023777), and Vigna unguiculata (accession number P93699) are compared with that of LeOPR (accession number AJ242551). The alignment was generated with the software ClustalW. Shaded boxes highlight amino acid residues that are identical in the majority of sequences in a respective position. Amino acid residues involved in binding of phenolic ligand (●) and those potentially involved in the stabilization of the anionic flavin semiquinone (▪) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 8Comparison of the active site structures of OYE and Le OPR . Panel A shows the amino acids surrounding the redox-active cofactor FMN (bottom) and the bound phenolic ligand p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (HBA) (center) as elucidated by Fox and Karplus (27Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (Brookhaven data base entry loyeb). Based on this structure,panel B shows a model of the active site of LeOPR using the sequence alignment of Fig. 2. Conserved amino acids are shown in light gray, and amino acid exchanges are shown indark gray. In comparison to yeast OYE, the following amino acid replacements were found in LeOPR (numbering scheme ofLeOPR): at position 188, Ser → Gly; position 190, Asn → His; and position 247, Phe → Tyr. Note that amino acid Phe-296 in the yeast OYE structure has no counterpart in the plant homolog (see gap in the alignment shown in Fig. 2). The program Molscript was used to generate the structural representations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) LeOPR was cloned into the expression vector pGEX-G (19Görlach J. Schmid J. Gene. 1996; 170: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and overexpressed inE. coli in N-terminal fusion with glutathioneS-transferase. From 1 liter of E. coli culture, 64 mg of soluble GST-OPR were purified by affinity chromatography.LeOPR was cleaved from the GST moiety by proteolytic processing using factor Xa and was further purified by anion exchange chromatography. At this stage of purification, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of two polypeptides of 43 and 29 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4). The larger polypeptide constituted about 75% of the total protein, and its apparent molecular mass is in good agreement with the calculatedM r of 42,414 for LeOPR deduced from the cDNA sequence. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two polypeptides were determined (Fig. 1, underlined) and found to correspond to the N terminus and to an internal sequence ofLeOPR, respectively. Therefore, the smaller polypeptide represents a truncated form of LeOPR and is most likely a degradation product. OYE is known to be a homodimeric protein in its native state (22Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Kuby S.A. A Study of Enzymes. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1991: 247-269Google Scholar). Therefore, co-purification of LeOPR and its degradation product during affinity and anion exchange chromatography is likely to be due to the formation of heterodimers between the two polypeptides. LeOPR and the fusion protein GST-OPR were found to catalyze the oxidation of NADPH in presence of molecular oxygen. During the search for substrates of OYE, the C=C double bond in α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds was found to be an alternative electron acceptor (4Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Kuby S.A. A Study of Enzymes. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1991: 247-269Google Scholar). Likewise, we observed an accelerated rate of NADPH oxidation by LeOPR in presence of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. When monitoring the oxidation of NADPH spectrophotometrically, it is difficult to estimate the relative contribution of the unsaturated carbonyl substrates and the molecular oxygen to the observed reaction rates. Therefore, to exclude molecular oxygen as a potential electron acceptor, the determination of steady state rate constants with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl substrates was done in presence of an oxygen-consuming system (glucose/glucose oxidase, see “Experimental Procedures”). Apparent K m and k cat values were derived from steady state kinetic analyses for a selection of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and are summarized in TableI. GST-OPR was found to accept a wide range of structurally different α,β-unsaturated carbonyls. The highest catalytic efficiency was observed forN-ethylmaleimide (k cat/K m = 3.6 μm−1 × s−1). The planar five-member ring and its substitution pattern resemble the cyclopentenone structure found in 12-oxophytodienoate, which is the substrate of OPR, the OYE homolog in Arabidopsis. Likewise, 12-oxophytodienoate (1-cyclopentene-1-octanoic acid, 4-oxo-5-(2-pentenyl)-(1S-(1α,5α(Z))); Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) was reduced by LeOPR with a catalytic efficiency of 0.6 μm−1 × s−1. Maleic acid was found to be a fairly good substrate, whereas its geometric isomer fumaric acid was not accepted at all. The catalytic efficiencies were considerably lower for all other tested substrates (k cat/K m ranging from 0.0005 to 0.045 μm−1 × s−1). A comparison of trans-hex-2-enal,trans-dodec-2-enal, cinnamaldehyde, and fumaric acid indicates that the size and the hydrophobicity of the substituent at the β-C atom are relevant for substrate recognition.Table IKinetic properties of LeOPRSubstrateK Mk catk cat/K Mμms−1μm−1× s−1trans-Hex-2-enal1-aThe assay contained GST-OPR at a concentration of 72.5 nm.22004.60.002Cinnamaldehyde1-aThe assay contained GST-OPR at a concentration of 72.5 nm.5706.90.012trans-Dodec-2-enal1-aThe assay contained GST-OPR at a concentration of 72.5 nm.25011.30.045Cyclohex-2-enon1-aThe assay contained GST-OPR at a concentration of 72.5 nm.13100.70.001N-Ethylmaleimide1-b0.725 nm GST-OPR.829.03.63Maleic acid1-c7.25 nm GST-OPR.4713.80.2912-Oxophytodienoic acid1-d30 nm GST-OPR., 1-eNR, no reaction.1515.50.62Fumaric acid1-aThe assay contained GST-OPR at a concentration of 72.5 nm.NRNRCoumarin1-aThe assay contained GST-OPR at a concentration of 72.5 nm.NRNRApparent kinetic constants were derived from steady state kinetic analyses.

The software Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific) was used for the evaluation of the data. LeOPR and GST-OPR were titrated with a series of para-substituted phenols in order to investigate the propensity of the protein to form CT complexes similar to those reported for OYE (23Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A representative titration experiment is shown in Fig. 5. Upon addition of para-chlorophenol to LeOPR, a long wavelength absorbance with a maximum at 608 nm developed as a function of ligand concentration. Simultaneously, spectral perturbations in the 380–500 and 320–370 nm ranges of the flavin absorption spectrum were observed. The formation of charge transfer transitions typically results in reciprocal changes in the absorbance of the interacting chromophores. The spectral characteristics of the CT complexes formed between para-substituted phenols and (GST)-LeOPR, as well as their dissociation constants, are summarized in TableII. Although the dissociation constants of the CT complexes were generally lower for LeOPR in comparison to GST-OPR, both yielded similar long wavelength absorbance maxima. A linear relationship was observed between the absorbance maxima of the long wavelength transition and the Hammettpara-constant (ςp) (Fig.6). Furthermore, the dissociation constant of the CT complex could be correlated to the phenolic pK a (Table II), indicating that it is the phenolate that binds to the enzyme and that within the complex, the phenolate and the flavin act as the charge donor and acceptor, respectively.Table IITitration of LeOPR and GST-OPR with para-substituted phenolsLigandpK a2-aPhenolic pK a, as reported by Abramovitz and Massey (23).ςp2-bHammett para-constant ςp, as reported by Jaffe (32) and Hausch et al.

https://openalex.org/W1997481880,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major mediator of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis both during development and in pathological conditions. VEGF has a variety of effects on vascular endothelium, including the ability to stimulate endothelial cell mitogenesis, and the potent induction of vascular permeability. These activities are at least in part mediated by binding to two high affinity receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. In this study we have made mutations of mouse VEGF in order to define the regions that are required for VEGFR-2-mediated functions. Development of a bioassay, which responds only to signals generated by cross-linking of VEGFR-2, has allowed evaluation of these mutants for their ability to activate VEGFR-2. One mutant (VEGF0), which had amino acids 83–89 of VEGF substituted with the analogous region of the related placenta growth factor, demonstrated significantly reduced VEGFR-2 binding compared with wild type VEGF, indicating that this region was required for VEGF-VEGFR-2 interaction. Intriguingly, when this mutant was evaluated in a Miles assay for its ability to induce vascular permeability, no difference was found when compared with wild type VEGF. In addition we have shown that the VEGF homology domain of the structurally related growth factor VEGF-D is capable of binding to and activating VEGFR-2 but has no vascular permeability activity, indicating that VEGFR-2 binding does not correlate with permeability activity for all VEGF family members. These data suggest different mechanisms for VEGF-mediated mitogenesis and vascular permeability and raise the possibility of an alternative receptor mediating vascular permeability.

VEGF (also called VPF for vascular permeability factor) was originally described as a factor responsible for the accumulation of plasma protein-rich fluid in the ascites of tumor patients due to an ability to induce vascular hyperpermeability (5Senger D.R. Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Perruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F. Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Studies of VEGF have demonstrated that it has a permeability enhancing capability, on a molar basis, 50,000 times greater than that of histamine (6Yeo K.T. Wang H.H. Nagy J.A. Sioussat T.M.

Structurally, VEGF exists as a dimeric glycoprotein ofM r 34–42,000 and is related to the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family of molecules, having a conserved cystine knot motif in each monomer (7McDonald N.Q.

Although VEGF is the product of a single gene, differential RNA splicing produces at least five isoforms in the human (8Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N.

VEGF mediates its effects via at least two receptors, Flt-1(VEGFR-1) and Flk-1(VEGFR-2), both of which have been shown to have high affinity binding sites for VEGF (16Damert A. Machein M. Breier G.

A. 1993; 90: 7533-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The responses of these receptors to VEGF are quite different. VEGFR-2 displays ligand-dependent phosphorylation in intact cells and mediates mitogenesis and chemotaxis when transfected into porcine endothelial cells (20Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, VEGFR-1 shows minimal tyrosine phosphorylation in response to VEGF, and binding of VEGF does not lead to a mitogenic signal (20Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar). The phenotypes of VEGFR-1- and VEGFR-2-deficient mice are consistent with the critical importance of these receptors to the development of the vascular system (22Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar, 23Fong G.-H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). Mice carrying germ-line mutations in either VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 die before embryonic day 10 (E10) due to a failure to organize the vasculature in the case of VEGFR-1 or a complete failure to develop endothelial cells in the case of VEGFR-2. Recent studies have identified neuropilin-1 (NP-1), a receptor of the collapsin/semaphorin family, as an isoform-specific VEGF receptor (24Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). NP-1 is structurally unrelated to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 and plays a role in neural cell guidance, suggesting a broader role for VEGF in non-endothelial cells. The signaling mechanism by which VEGF mediates vascular permeability remains essentially uncharacterized, although recent work has shown that nitric oxide may play a role (25Murohara T. Horowitz J.R. Silver M. Tsurumi Y. Chen D. Sullivan A. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1998; 97: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 26Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4220-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, some studies have suggested that VEGFR-2 is the receptor responsible for the permeability activity (25Murohara T. Horowitz J.R. Silver M. Tsurumi Y. Chen D. Sullivan A. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1998; 97: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 27Joukov V. Kumar V. Sorsa T. Arighi E. Weich H. Saksela O. Alitalo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6599-6602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The permeability induced by VEGF is transient and reversible, is not associated with mast cell degranulation or infiltration of inflammatory cells, and is not inhibited by antihistamines (5Senger D.R. Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Perruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F. Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar, 28Dvorak H.F. Orenstein N.S. Carvalho A.C. Churchill W.H. Dvorak A.M. Galli S.J. Feder J. Bitzer A.M. Rypysc J. Giovinco P. J. Immunol. 1979; 122: 166-174PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that VEGF increases microvascular permeability within tumors by induction of clusters of small vesicles and vacuoles within the cytoplasm. These structures have been termed vesicular-vacuolar organelles (VVO) (29Kohn S. Nagy J.A. Dvorak H.F. Dvorak A.M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 596-607PubMed Google Scholar,30Feng D. Nagy J.A. Hipp J. Dvorak H.F. Dvorak A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). They span the cytoplasm and can form channels to connect the endothelial lumen to the tissue space, thereby allowing a point of exit for plasma and plasma proteins. The receptor signaling pathway that mediates formation of VVOs is at present not clear, nor are the roles of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, or NP-1 in this process. Other recent studies have suggested that VEGF can alter the tight junctions of endothelial cells, which may provide an additional mechanism for VEGF permeability (31Kevil C.G. Payne D.K. Mire E. Alexander J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15099-15103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar,32Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. Hollinger L.A. Wolpert E.B. Gardner T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23463-23467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In this study we have used site-directed mutagenesis to determine the residues of mouse VEGF important for mediating functions via VEGFR-2 and to determine their effect on endothelial mitogenesis and vascular permeability. We found that mutations that mapped to the third variable (V3) domain of VEGF had the most profound effect on VEGFR-2 binding. A mutant that had this region substituted with the V3 domain from human placenta growth factor (PlGF) showed reduced binding to VEGFR-2 and an inability to induce mitogenesis or activation of a VEGFR-2 bioassay. Nevertheless, this mutant was found to be equivalent to wild type VEGF when evaluated for its ability to induce vascular permeability in a Miles assay. Furthermore, another member of the VEGF family, VEGF-D, was shown to be incapable of inducing vascular permeability, even though it has the ability to bind and activate VEGFR-2. These data imply that the two biological effects of VEGF, mitogenesis and vascular permeability, are mediated by different mechanisms and that permeability may be signaled through a receptor other than VEGFR-2. Transfected CHO cells were grown in Glasgow modified Eagle's medium (without l-glutamine and NaHCO3, Cytosystems, Castle Hills, New South Wales, Australia) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, non-essential amino acids, nucleosides, glutamate, asparagine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 25 μmmethionine sulfoxide (MSX) in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. COS cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 5 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C and a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Ba/F3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, 5 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 10% WEHI-3D conditioned medium in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. 293EBNA cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, 5 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. mAbs to the extracellular domain of the tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase are described elsewhere (33Koblizek T.I. Runting A.S. Stacker S.A. Wilks A.F. Risau W. Deutsch U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). mAb 4H3 to the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 was used in the bioassay and for flow cytometry analysis. A rabbit antiserum made to mouse VEGF is described below. Wild type VEGF, PlGF, and mutant VEGF constructs were transiently expressed in COS cells using the DEAE-dextran transfection protocol as described (34Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) or 293 cells using a lipid-mediated transfection (Fugene, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Conditioned media were collected from COS cells on day 6–7 post-transfection (24–48 h for 293 cells), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation prior to testing or affinity chromatography. VEGFR-2/EpoR bioassay cells were washed and resuspended in PBS/BSA to a concentration of 106 cells per ml. Cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies to VEGFR-2 and tie2 (control) according to methods described elsewhere (35Stacker S.A. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 648-655PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates, purified VEGF, or mutant VEGFs were combined with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (with or without β-mercaptoethanol), boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The proteins were then transferred to membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation in 3% BSA, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20. Blots were then incubated with a 1/2000 dilution of the anti-mouse VEGF serum for 2 h at room temperature. After washing in buffer (3% BSA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20) the blots were incubated with 0.5 μCi of 125I-protein A for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the signal was detected by autoradiography using XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Alternatively, blots were probed with anti-rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase conjugate instead of the protein A and developed using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A cDNA clone encoding mouse VEGF164 was isolated by polymerase chain reaction using mouse colon mRNA as the template. After subcloning, the full-length sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing to be identical to that previously reported (37Breier G. Albrecht U. Sterrer S. Risau W. Development. 1992; 114: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fragment, containing the entire open reading frame of VEGF, was subcloned into the expression vectors pCDM8 and pcDNA1/Amp and transiently expressed in COS cells (34Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium from day 6–7 transfected COS cells specifically induced vascular permeability in the Miles assay (38Miles A.A. Miles E.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1952; 118: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), bound to purified VEGFR-2 extracellular domain immobilized on a biosensor (BIAcore, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and specifically activated the VEGFR-2 bioassay described below (38Miles A.A. Miles E.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1952; 118: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This VEGF cDNA was then subcloned into the expression vector pEE6 and was stably transfected into CHO K1 cells. Expressing clones were selected in the presence of 25 μm MSX. The mutant VEGF0 was also subcloned into the pEE6 vector and expressed in CHO cells. Mouse VEGF and VEGF0 were purified from media conditioned with a CHO cell line transfected with VEGF164 (CHO-VEGF164) or VEGF0 (CHO-VEGF0) cDNA. Conditioned media (250–500 ml) were subjected to anion exchange chromatography on a 5-ml Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the flow-through was then loaded onto a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column (heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After washing, the bound material was eluted in 1 mNaCl/20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Further purification was achieved by reversed phase liquid chromatography on a Brownlee RP-300 column (30 × 21 mm internal diameter, Applied Biosystems, CA) equilibrated with 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted using a linear 60-min gradient to 60% CH3CN, 0.125% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Purified material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions and corresponded to the reported molecular weight for VEGF164 and VEGF0. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis confirmed its identity. Amino acid analysis was also used to confirm the identity and concentration of the purified material. Purified mouse VEGF (75 μg) was combined with Freund's complete adjuvant (CSL, Melbourne, Australia) and used as a primary immunogen for raising antibodies in rabbits (in collaboration with Dr. Peter Rogers, Monash University). Further immunizations were carried out using Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Rabbits were test bled after the third immunization, and the titer and specificity of the anti-VEGF response were evaluated by inhibition of VEGF-mediated proliferation of the VEGFR-2/EpoR bioassay cells (effective at a dilution of 1/20,000), and Western blotting, respectively. To obtain constructs encoding the VEGFR-2 extracellular domain, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to generate specific in-frame restriction enzyme sites within the clone. The full-length clone of mouse VEGFR-2 (Nyk/Flk-1 receptor (39Oelrichs R.B. Reid H.H. Bernard O. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar)) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA1/Amp (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) using the BstXI restriction enzyme site. Single-stranded UTP+ DNA was generated using the M13 origin of replication and used as a template to generate VEGFR-2 cDNA containing specific restriction enzyme sites. A BglII site was introduced just 3′ of sequences encoding the final β strand of the seventh Ig-like domain to produce a VEGFR-2 construct containing the entire extracellular domain (VEGFR-2-EX). An oligonucleotide linker sequence encoding the FLAG marker peptide and a termination codon (IBI/Kodak; 5′-GATCTGACTACAAGGACGACGACGATGACAAGTGAATCGATA-3′ encoding (N)Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-STOP(C)) was inserted at theBglII site of the mutant VEGFR-2 cDNA at the junction of the regions encoding the extracellular domain and the transmembrane domain. The VEGFR-2-EX-FLAG insert was then subcloned into theXbaI site of the pEE6 CHO cell expression vector for large scale protein production as described above. This construct was transfected into CHO-K1 cells and positive clones selected in medium containing 25 μm MSX. Clones expressing VEGFR-2-EX-FLAG were identified by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled cells with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, IBI/Kodak) and analysis by SDS-PAGE. Mutants of mouse VEGF were generated by oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis according to the methods of Kunkel (40Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar) using the expression vector pcDNA1/Amp (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Mutants are designated by the single letter amino acid code denoting the original amino acid first, then the relevant position in the mature VEGF polypeptide (without leader sequence), followed by the amino acid resulting from the mutation (e.g. I90Y, denotes isoleucine at position 90 changed to a tyrosine). The following mutants containing single amino acid substitutions were produced Q36D, D40S, E43S, Y44H, K47S, E66H, E72T, K83A, H85G, Q86D, I90Y, and G91V. An additional mutant (VEGF0) was produced, which had sequence in the V3 domain of VEGF substituted with the corresponding V3 sequence of human PlGF (RIKPHQSQHIGE to RIRSGDRPSIGE; see Fig.1). Mutant VEGF cDNAs were sequenced to ensure no additional mutations had been introduced. Proteins were produced by transient expression in COS cells and 293EBNA cells or by stable expression in CHO cells. Conditioned medium was either tested directly or concentrated by affinity chromatography as described below. VEGFR-2-EX-FLAG was purified from conditioned medium by affinity chromatography on M2 (anti-FLAG) gel. Conditioned medium (200 ml) was passed over the M2 column before washing with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20) and then 50 mm triethylamine, pH 10.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20, and a further 10 column volumes of wash buffer. Bound material was then eluted with 25 μg/ml FLAG peptide (N-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-C) in wash buffer. Elution with FLAG peptide gave about 90–95% pure VEGFR-2-EX-FLAG by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. For immunizations and coupling to the sensor chip for analysis with a biosensor, these proteins were further purified by ion exchange chromatography (MonoS, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to a single homogeneous species corresponding to VEGFR-2-EX-FLAG. Conditioned media containing VEGF or VEGF mutants were concentrated on heparin-Sepharose-CL4B (5 ml of conditioned medium/100 μl of beads; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by incubation at 4 °C for 4–16 h with rotation. The beads were then washed with 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and the bound protein was eluted with buffer containing 800 mm NaCl. Eluates were then buffer exchanged into PBS using Centricon 10 concentrators or diluted such that the salt concentration was reduced to 150 mm in an appropriate buffer for use in the bioassay. VEGF and VEGF mutants that had been concentrated by affinity chromatography were quantitated using a competitive radioimmunoassay with 125I-VEGF. Purified mouse VEGF was iodinated using either the Chloramine T or IODO-GEN protocols as described previously (41Kabrun N. Bühring H.-J. Choi K. Ullrich A. Risau W. Keller G. Development. 1997; 124: 2039-2048PubMed Google Scholar). 96-well microtiter plates were coated with a 10 μg/ml solution of protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed with PBS, and nonspecific binding sites blocked by incubation with 3% BSA in PBS. The plates were then incubated with a 1/400 dilution of anti-mouse VEGF rabbit antiserum for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by extensive washing with buffer (PBS 3%, BSA 0.02%, Tween 20). The plates were then incubated with a dilution of the sample containing VEGF or VEGF mutants and 2 × 105 cpm of 125I-VEGF. In addition, dilutions of a known concentration of purified mouse VEGF derived from CHO cells (previously quantitated by OD280 and amino acid analysis) were also combined with 125I-VEGF and used to generate a standard curve to enable accurate determination of the amount of VEGF present in the samples. VEGF mutants were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to confirm the results generated by the competitive radioimmunoassay. A bioassay was established in which Ba/F3 cells were stably transfected with a chimeric molecule containing the extracellular domain of the mouse VEGFR-2 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the mouse erythropoietin receptor (EpoR; kindly supplied by Dr. D. Hilton, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia). The chimera was made by introducing a BglII restriction enzyme site at the junction of the regions encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domain of the mouse EpoR cDNA (subcloned into pcDNA1/Amp) using site-directed mutagenesis. Prior to this, a silent mutation was introduced into the EpoR cDNA in a region encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR to eliminate a naturally occurring BglII site. The fragment of the EpoR encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was then ligated to VEGFR-2-BglII to give a cDNA encoding a fusion protein consisting of the VEGFR-2 extracellular domain and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of EpoR. This construct was subcloned into the expression vector pBOS and co-transfected into the Ba/F3 cell line withpgk-Neo at a ratio of 20:1. Transfected cells were selected in G418, and VEGFR-2 expressing cell lines selected by FACS analysis using mAb 4H3, which was directed to the VEGFR-2 extracellular domain. Cell lines expressing higher levels of VEGFR-2-EpoR were selected by growing the cells in either 5 μg/ml mAb 4H3 (an activating mAb) or 25 ng/ml recombinant VEGF. Cells expressing the VEGFR-2-EpoR chimera (VEGFR-2 bioassay cells) were washed three times in PBS, and once in complete medium lacking 10% WEHI-3D conditioned medium to remove residual IL-3. Cells (104) were aliquoted into 96-well microtiter plates containing dilutions of either WEHI-3D conditioned medium, 4H3 mAb, VEGF, VEGF mutants, PlGF, or medium alone. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. Cell proliferation was quantitated by the addition of 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h prior to harvesting. Incorporated [3H]thymidine was determined using a cell harvester (Tomtec®, Orange, CT) and β counting (LKB 1205 liquid scintillation β counter, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Constructs encoding the extracellular domain of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 were used for binding assays. VEGFR-1- and VEGFR-2-Ig cDNA (kindly supplied by K. Alitalo, E. Korpelainen & Y. Gunji, Helsinki) were expressed in 293EBNA cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing either low Ig serum or 0.2% BSA. The fusion proteins were then immunoprecipitated from the conditioned medium using protein A-Sepharose beads. These beads were then combined with 900 μl of medium from CHO-VEGF or CHO-VEGF0 cells biosynthetically labeled with35S-Cys/Met and 100 μl of 5% BSA, 0.2% Tween 20, 10 μg/ml heparin. The Sepharose beads were then washed twice with binding buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.02% Tween 20, 1 μg/ml heparin) at 4 °C, once with PBS, and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer before resolving the proteins by SDS-PAGE. The purified extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 (VEGFR-2-EX-FLAG) was coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran layer of the sensor ship using standard NHS-EDC chemistry for analysis of binding using an optical biosensor (BIAcore2000) (42Nice E. Lackmann M. Smyth F. Fabri L. Burgess A.W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1994; 660: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The residual activated ester groups were blocked by treatment with 1 methanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5, followed by washing with 10 mm diethylamine to remove non-covalently bound material. Samples for analysis were diluted in HBS (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20). The viability of the bound VEGFR-2-EX-FLAG was assessed by binding of the anti-VEGFR-2 extracellular domain 4H3 mAb and purified VEGF. The VHD of VEGF-D, VEGF-DΔNΔC, was purified using M2 affinity chromatography as described previously (14Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mä"

A specific signal corresponding to OH⋅ generation and an increase in oxidative DNA lesions such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine and 1,2-dihydro-2-oxoadenine were detected in the strain deficient in sodA sodB fur. We showed that iron metabolism deregulation in fur mutant produced a 2.5-fold iron overload. The sodA sodB fur strain was about 100-fold higher mutability than the wild-type strain. The mutation spectrum in the strain was found to induce GC → TA and AT → CG transversions predominantly. The hypermutability of the strain was suppressed by the tonB mutation which reduces iron transport. Thus, excess iron and excess superoxide were responsible for OH⋅ generation, oxidative DNA lesion formation, and hypermutability in E. coli.

The genetic materials such as DNA, RNA, and their precursors in nucleotide pools are important targets of reactive oxygen species (3Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar, 4Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 5Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species produces a large number of DNA lesions including 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-G), 1,2-dihydro-2-oxoadenine (2-oxo-A), thymine glycol and strand breaks, and also oxidizes nucleotides to form 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine 5′-triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP) (4Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) and 2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate (2-oxo-dATP) (6Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). To reduce such mutagenic and cytotoxic effects caused by oxidative DNA lesions, Escherichia coli have evolved DNA repair enzymes and a clean-up enzyme. The former includes DNA glycosylases for 8-oxo-G (encoded by mutM), for adenine at 8-oxo-G:A mispairing site (encoded by mutY) and for thymine glycol (encoded bynth and nei), and the latter contains a hydrolase for 8-oxo-dGTP in the nucleotide pool, 8-oxo-dGTPase (encoded bymutT) (7Yamamoto K. Uraki F. Yonei S. Yukawa O. J. Radiat. Res. 1997; 38: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 8Michaels M. Miller J.H. J.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in mutM andmutY, and in mutT lead E. coli cells to be spontaneously hypermutagenic (10–100-fold higher than wild-type), predominantly inducing GC → TA and AT → CG transversions, respectively (8Michaels M. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6321-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). These results suggest the importance of these enzymes in minimizing oxidative DNA lesions and in keeping spontaneous mutation rate as low as 10−8-10−9. A long-standing proposal for the mechanism of the first step of oxidative mutagenesis is the reaction of bases in DNA or nucleotides in the pool with OH⋅, a highly reactive reactive oxygen species, which can be generated during the Harber-Weiss/Fenton reaction that consists of an iron reduction step by O·̄2 and an OH⋅generation step via the Fenton reaction, Fe(III)+O·̄2→Fe(II)+O2Equation 1 H2O2+Fe(II)→OH·+OH−+Fe(III)Equation 2 It has been suggested that these reactions may enable endogenous oxidants to continually damage the DNA of aerobic organisms. The reactions have been confirmed, at least in model systems in vitro (11Brawn K. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 12Akasaka S. Yamamoto K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Akasaka S. Yamamoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For in vivo mutagenesis, several reports have suggested the importance of iron and O·̄2. For example, iron metabolism deregulation due to lack of the Fur protein, a negative regulator of iron uptake in E. coli, produces iron overload, leading to oxidative stress sensitivity and mutator phenotype (14Touati D. Jacques M. Tardat B. Bouchard L. Despied S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, it has not yet been demonstrated whether increases in levels of O·̄2 and iron lead to generation of OH⋅ under normal growth conditions and whether the generated OH⋅ is involved in production of oxidative DNA lesions that can lead in mutagenesisin vivo. It is also not clear whether O·̄2 can act as a reductant of iron(III) to iron(II) in vivo, which involves catalysis of the production of OH⋅ in the presence of H2O2 by the Fenton reaction. There are other cellular reductants such as glutathione or NADH, which are capable of reducing free iron (15Imlay J.A. Chin S.M. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar) and are far more abundant than O·̄2(16Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6957-6965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, incorporated iron(III) cannot necessarily be reduced by O·̄2. On the other hand, it has recently been proposed that O·̄2 in vivo oxidatively liberates iron(II) from iron storage proteins and from a group of dehydratases containing [4Fe-4S] cluster (17Keyer K. Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6782-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 18Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, we monitored OH⋅ generation in vivo inE. coli strains deficient in both SODs (MnSOD and FeSOD) and Fur during normal aerobic growth using an electroparamagnetic resonance (EPR)-based technique with a spin-trapping system. We also chemically measured the contents of various oxidative lesions in genomic DNA in the mutant strain using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with a selected ion monitoring method (GC/MS-SIM). We observed a specific signal corresponding to OH⋅ generation in the strain deficient in SOD and Fur. Chemical analysis indicated formation of oxidative DNA bases such as 8-oxo-G or 2-oxo-A in genomic DNA from the SOD Fur-deficient cells. This is the first direct observation of in vivo generation of OH⋅, followed by formation of oxidative DNA lesions in cells grown aerobically. The bacterial strains used in this study were all derivatives of E. coliK-12. The strains GC4468 (F−Δ(argF-lac)U169 rpsL), QC1726 (ΔsodA3 sodB::MudPR (Cmr)), QC1732 (fur::kan), and QC1736 (ΔsodA3 sodB::MudPR fur::kan) were provided by Dr. D. Touati (14Touati D. Jacques M. Tardat B. Bouchard L. Despied S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). SY54 (ΔkatE katG::Tn10) was constructed as follows. SY5 (20Kobayashi M. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Kaneko M. Hayakawa H. Sekiguchi M. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26394-26399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), an F factor-negative derivative of JM107, was infected with P1 phage carrying the katE12::Tn10 allele and selected for the tetracyclin-resistant phenotype. The Tn10 transposon was then eliminated according to Bochneret al. (21Bochner B.R. Huang H.C. Schieven G.L. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 926-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting strain, SY52 (as SY5, but ΔkatE), was once again infected with P1 phage carryingkatG17::Tn10 and selected for tetracyclin resistance. The resultantkatE - katG − phenotype was confirmed by catalase activity gel (data not shown) and was named SY54. E. coli strains UM120 (katE12::Tn10) (22Loewen P.C. Triggs B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 668-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and UM197 (katG17::Tn10) (22Loewen P.C. Triggs B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 668-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. A. Nishimura. TN52 and TN542 are Δfur::kan derivatives of SY5 and SY54, respectively. E. coli colicinogenic strain CA18 carrying a colicin B factor was used for preparation of colicin plates (23Kitamura K. Torii Y. Matsuoka C. Yamamoto K. Jpn. J. Genet. 1995; 70: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For selection of E. coli supF mutations, strain KS40 (lacZam rpsL gyrA) harboring pOF105, which carries the gyrAam and rpsLam genes in the pACYC184 plasmid, was used (24Obata F. Nunoshiba T. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Yamamoto K. J. Radiat. Res. 1998; 39: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTN89 carries the E. coli supF gene, ampicillin resistance marker, f1 replication origin, and SV40 T antigen (24Obata F. Nunoshiba T. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Yamamoto K. J. Radiat. Res. 1998; 39: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. LB plates and phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) used have been described previously (25Akasaka S. Yamamoto K. Mutat. Res. 1991; 254: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol, tetracyclin, kanamycin, streptomycin, ampicillin, and rifampicin were added, if necessary, to LB broth and LB plates at concentrations of 30, 10, 50, 50, 50, and 100 μg/ml, respectively. Hydroxyl radical (OH⋅) formation inside E. coli cells was detected with an EPR-based spin-trapping system containing 10 mmα-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butyl-nitrone (4-POBN; Sigma) and 170 mm ethanol as described previously (19McCormick M.L. Buettner G.R. Britigan B.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 18 0: 622-625Crossref Google Scholar). To avoid interference of the EPR signals by extracellularly generated OH⋅, bovine liver catalase (Sigma) was added to LB broth. LB broth containing 70 units/ml catalase, 10 mm 4-POBN, and 170 mm ethanol was inoculated with 1 × 107 cells/ml of culture of E. coli strains. The cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C for 17 h. EPR spectrum was obtained at room temperature with a JEOL ESR spectrometer, model JES-TE100. The magnitude of the EPR signal observed is directly proportional to the amount of spin adducts in the sample. Instrument settings were as follows: modulation frequency, 100 kHz; microwave power, 16 mW; sweep width, 5 millitesla; modulation amplitude, 0.05 millitesla; receiver gain, 1 × 1000; time constant, 1 min; sweep time, 8 min. The number of cells was determined by plating each overnight culture onto LB agar plates. E. coli strains were grown aerobically in 10 ml of LB broth in 100-ml flasks overnight with shaking at 150 rpm. The cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer, resuspended in 200 μl of a solution of lysozyme (5 mg/ml in 0.25m Tris HCl, pH 8), and incubated on ice for 15 min. The genomic DNA was extracted with a DNA Extractor WB Kit according to the manufactures protocol (WAKO, Tokyo). After precipitation of genomic DNA with ethanol, the pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA), and treated with RNase at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for 1 h. The sample was again purified with a DNA Extractor WB Kit to remove RNase, and the precipitated genomic DNA was dissolved in phosphate buffer. A portion of the extracted DNA (100 μg) was digested to nucleosides by nuclease P1 (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo) and alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) for quantification of the DNA/RNA ratio. DNA samples with RNA contamination of less than 5% were used for measurement of oxidative DNA lesions. We quantified oxidative DNA lesions according to a slight modification of the method described previously (26Mori T. Tano K. Takimoto K. Utsumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, 7 nmol of 2,6-diaminopurine and 100 nmol of [α,α,α,6-2H4]thymine (27Djuric Z. Luongo D.A. Harpwe D.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were added as internal standards to aliquots of DNA samples, which were lyophilized and subsequently hydrolyzed with 0.5 ml of 88% formic acid in evacuated sealed glass tubes at 110 °C for 45 min. After hydrolysis, samples were lyophilized again. The samples were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 50% ethanol and DNA bases including internal standards were collected by passage through a semi-preparative HPLC column for purification of the hydrolyzed DNA samples. After evaporation and lyophilization, the samples were trimethylsilylated with 0.1 ml ofN,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide/acetonitrile (4/1, v/v) mixture at 90 °C for 45 min in poly(tetrafluoroethylene) screw-capped vials under argon. The derivatized samples were analyzed by GC/MS-SIM with a JEOL mass spectrometer Model JMA-DX-303 operated in the EI mode. The concentrations of modified bases in DNA were calculated from the calibration curves obtained from aliquots of mixtures of known concentrations of the modified bases and internal standards. Overnight cultures of E. coli strains in LB broth were diluted 105-fold in phosphate buffer, 0.1-ml aliquots (103 cells) were inoculated into 5 ml of LB broth with appropriate antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Rifampicin-resistant colonies were scored by plating the cultures on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml rifampicin after a 2-day incubation at 37 °C. The number of total viable cells was scored by plating a portion of the cells at appropriate dilutions on LB plates (without rifampicin), and counted after overnight incubation at 37 °C. E. coli cells in overnight cultures prepared as described above were washed three times with phosphate buffer, and resuspended in the same volume of ultrapure H2O (Kanto Chemical Co. Inc., Tokyo). The iron concentrations in the cell suspension were directly measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometric analysis (ICP-AES) at 259.9 nm emission, and calculated from the standard curves. The numbers of cells in cell suspensions were determined by colony formation on LB plates. The iron content was calculated by normalization with the cell number in the sample. Spontaneously occurring tonB mutants were isolated from QC1736 (sodA sodB fur) by selecting colicin B-resistant colonies as described previously (23Kitamura K. Torii Y. Matsuoka C. Yamamoto K. Jpn. J. Genet. 1995; 70: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the mutations were characterized by DNA sequencing. A DNA fragment containing the mutant tonB gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with genomic DNA as a template, which had been extracted from each colicin B-resistant isolate, and primers tonB-A, 5′-AAACGTGCTAAATGTGCCGGAC-3′, and tonB-B, 5′-CGATGTGGTGTGCTGCTATGC-3′ (28Kanbashi K. Wang X. Komura J. Ono T. Yamamoto K. Mutat. Res. 1997; 385: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was treated with 5 units of exonuclease I (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) and 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase (U. S. Biochemical) at 37 °C for 30 min, incubated at 80 °C for 20 min to inactivate these enzymes, and diluted to appropriate concentrations with distilled H2O for dye-terminator DNA sequencing. The DNA sequencing for characterization of the mutations was carried out as described previously (28Kanbashi K. Wang X. Komura J. Ono T. Yamamoto K. Mutat. Res. 1997; 385: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Individual cultures of GC4468, QC1726, and QC1736 cells containing pTN89 were grown in 5 ml of LB broth with appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C overnight. Plasmid pTN89 was extracted and subsequently introduced into the competent indicator strain KS40/pOF105. For selection of mutantsupF plasmid, we used an improved method in which only cells containing the mutant supF plasmids can give rise to colonies due to their resistance to nalidixic acid and streptomycin (24Obata F. Nunoshiba T. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Yamamoto K. J. Radiat. Res. 1998; 39: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Selection of the mutant supF, calculation of mutation frequency, and DNA sequencing were carried out as described previously (29Akasaka S. Takimoto K. Yamamoto K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Incubation of LB broth containing 4-POBN and ethanol withoutE. coli cells at 37 °C for 17 h produced the strong signal for the 4-POBN-C·H(CH3)OH spin adduct (a N = 15.8 G, a H = 2.8 G), which is in good agreement with the published values (19McCormick M.L. Buettner G.R. Britigan B.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 18 0: 622-625Crossref Google Scholar), indicating OH⋅ formation. LB broth constituents, such as metals and H2O2 appeared to serve as catalysts for OH⋅ formation. Addition of 70 units/ml catalase to LB broth, however, completely inhibited these background EPR signals (data not shown). Aliquots of 1 × 107 cells/ml of the overnight culture of QC1736 (sodA sodB fur) cells were inoculated into LB broth supplemented with catalase, 4-POBN, and ethanol, followed by incubation at 37 °C overnight, and 4-POBN-C·H(CH3)OH spin signal was observed (Fig.1 D). When E. colimutants QC1726, QC1732, SY54, TN52, and TN542 as well as their parental strains, GC4468 and SY5, were incubated in the 4-POBN-C·H(CH3)OH spin-trapping system, there was no evidence of spin adducts (Fig. 1). These results were highly reproducible. We also observed 4-POBN-C·H(CH3)OH spin signal in exponentially growing QC1736 (data not shown). Thus, spontaneous increases in OH⋅ level occur continuously under normal aerobic growth conditions in E. coli cells lacking both SOD and Fur. These results further indicated that superoxide dismutases are involved in in vivoiron-dependent OH⋅ formation. Both iron(II) and iron(III) transport pathways in E. coli are negatively regulated by the Fur protein (30Bagg A. Neilands J.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5471-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Therefore, iron assimilation must be constitutive in fur mutants. This was confirmed by measuring intracellular iron content using ICP-AES in cell suspension of QC1736 (sodA sodB fur) (Table I). Iron content of QC1736 was 2.4-fold higher than those offur + strains, indicating that constitutive iron uptake due to the fur mutation results in iron overload in SOD-deficient strains which facilitates iron-dependent OH⋅ formation.Table IIron content of E. coli lacking sodAB and furFe concentration1-aThe data presented are averages obtained from three independent samples with standard errors.Viable cells (/ml)Fe content1-bThe ratios are shown in the parentheses.ppm109/mlppm/109 cellsGC4468 (wild-type)0.36 ± 0.0023.1 ± 0.030.12 (1)QC1726 (sodA sodB)0.28 ± 0.0122.8 ± 0.050.10 (0.83)QC1736 (sodA sodB fur)0.23 ± 0.0038.0 ± 0.030.29 (2.4)1-a The data presented are averages obtained from three independent samples with standard errors.1-b The ratios are shown in the parentheses. Open table in a new tab To determine whether the intracellular generation of OH⋅ causes oxidative DNA lesions, genomic DNA was prepared from overnight cultures of GC4468, QC1726 (sodA sodB), and QC1736 (sodA sodB fur), and were analyzed the oxidative DNA lesions by GC/MS-SIM. The contents of OH⋅-induced base modifications such as 8-oxo-G, fapyG, 2-oxo-A, and fapyA in SOD Fur-deficient cells were increased by 2–3-fold compared with those in the parent strain (Fig.2). As a control, the content of xanthine, which is not related to oxidative stress, was essentially the same in the three strains (Fig. 2). The findings shown in Figs. 1 and 2and Table I strongly suggested that increases in both intracellular O·̄2 and iron stimulate the Fenton-type reaction in E. coli, and thus enhance OH⋅ formation leading to production of oxidative DNA lesions. We examined mutagenesis in QC1736 (sodA sodB fur) strain by measuring the frequency of rifampicin resistance. Fig.3 A shows that the mutation frequency was 141-, 85-, and 24-fold higher in QC1736 as compared with GC4468, QC1732 (fur), and QC1726 (sodA sodB), respectively. On the other hand, the frequency in the TN542 (katE katG fur) was only 3-fold higher than that in SY5 (wild-type) and SY54 (katE katG) (Fig. 3 B). Thus, increased mutagenesis was O·̄2 and iron overload-dependent. The hypermutability was suggested to be due to intracellular generation of OH⋅ by a Fenton-type reaction in vivo, which leads to high content of oxidative DNA lesions (Figs. 1 and 2). We introduced tonB mutations into QC1736 to determine whether increased intracellular amounts of iron were the cause of rifampicin-resistant mutagenesis. The tonB gene of E. coli is a key protein in the Fur-regulated iron transport systems and serves as an energy transducer to couple cytoplasm membrane energy to high affinity active transport for iron(III) (31Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2019-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, even in the presence of the fur mutation, tonB mutants cannot uptake iron into the cells. Nine independent tonBmutants were isolated by plating 9 independent overnight cultures of QC1736 on colicin B plates. The resulting sodA sodB fur tonBmutants were named CR1 to CR9. The frequencies of spontaneous mutation of the rifampicin-sensitive to resistant phenotype in CR1 to CR9 were 2 × 10−8 to 4 × 10−7, lower than the frequency in QC1736 of 1.7 × 10−6 (Fig.4). The observation that blockage of iron transport due to tonB mutation suppressed the strong mutator phenotype of QC1736 suggested an important role of intracellular iron concentration in rifampicin-resistant mutagenesis. We next characterized the mutant tonB genes from CR1 to CR9 by direct sequencing. Three one-base frameshifts, 3 single-base substitutions causing nonsense mutations, and 3 single-base substitutions causing missense mutations were identified (Fig.5). The frameshift mutations and single-base substitutions causing nonsense mutations were predicted to result in truncated proteins of TonB. These truncated TonB proteins can cause stronger blockage of iron transport than missense TonB proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, the extent of mutagenesis suppression by thetonB mutations was directly correlated with the characteristics of tonB mutations; tonB mutants with frameshifts or nonsense mutations caused stronger suppression of mutagenesis than those mutants with missense mutations. These observations strongly suggested that the TonB-dependent iron transport system is required for the mutator phenotype in the SOD Fur-deficient strain. It may be noteworthy that the five single-base substitutions among six found in the spontaneous tonB mutants derived from QC1736 were GC → TA and AT → CG (Fig. 5). As these tonB mutants were originally isolated as spontaneous mutations of the SOD Fur strain, we assumed that this predominance was due to mutations specifically occurring in QC1736. We examined the specificity of spontaneous mutation in the E. coli supF gene. The plasmid pTN89 was extracted from individual overnight cultures of GC4468 (wild-type), QC1726 (sodA sodB), and QC1736 (sodA sodB fur), and supFmutants were selected using KS40/pOF105 (24Obata F. Nunoshiba T. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Yamamoto K. J. Radiat. Res. 1998; 39: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We analyzed about 50supF mutants by DNA sequencing. Spontaneous mutation frequencies of supF plasmids propagated in GC4468, QC1726, and QC1736 were 2.4 × 10−7, 4.8 × 10−7, and 8.2 × 10−7, respectively. The details of the mutations analyzed are summarized in Tables II and III. The spontaneous mutations were comprised of four types, i.e. base substitutions, insertions, deletions, and frameshifts (Table II). GC → CG transversion was predominant in GC4468 (43%) and QC1726 (24%) as described previously (29Akasaka S. Takimoto K. Yamamoto K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas it accounted for only 10% of those in QC1736 (Table III). On the other hand, the predominant mutation in QC1736 was GC → TA (49%), followed by AT → CG (24%), consistent with the observations in the tonBmutations (Fig. 5). Oxidative lesions 8-oxo-G and 2-oxo-dATP can induce GC → TA transversion, and 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-oxo-A can induce AT → CG transversion (32Kamiya H. Kasai H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11125-11130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Inoue M. Kamiya H. Fujikawa K. Ootsuyama Y. Murata-Kamiya N. Osaki T. Yasumoto K. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11069-11074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the predominance of GC → TA and AT → CG transversions in QC1736 was due to increased amounts of 8-oxo-G and 2-oxo-A in DNA (Fig. 2) as well as 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-oxo-dATP in the nucleotide pool, increase of which have not yet been determined.Table IIDistribution of the spontaneous supF mutants by classClass of changeNumber detected (% of total mutants examined)GC4468 (wild-type)QC1726 (sodA sodB)QC1736 (sodA sodB fur)Base substitution28 (59)33 (72)41 (79)Insertion sequence15 (31)7 (15)4 (8)Deletion2 (4)1 (2)1 (2)Frameshift3 (6)5 (11)6 (11) Total484652Mutation frequency2.4 × 10−74.8 × 10−78.2 × 10−7 Open table in a new tab Table IIITypes of base substitution among spontaneous supF mutantsType of mutationNumber detected (% of total mutants examined)GC4468 (wild-type)QC1726 (sodA sodB)QC1736 (sodA sodB fur)Transition G:C → A:T5 (18)7 (22)2 (5) A:T → G:C2 (7)0 (0)1 (2)Transversion G:C → T:A3 (11)6 (18)20 (49) G:C → C:G13 (46)11 (33)4 (10) A:T → T:A2 (7)6 (18)4 (10) A:T → C:G3 (11)3 (9)10 (24)Total283341 Open table in a new tab The results of the present study indicated that E. colicells defective in superoxide dismutases and iron-uptake regulator, thus leading to excess levels of superoxide and iron overload, show elevated levels of OH⋅ production (Fig. 1), base damage such as 8-oxo-G or 2-oxo-A (Fig. 2), and mutagenesis (Fig. 3). A previous study established that killing of E. coli by H2O2 can be blocked by iron chelators, confirming the occurrence of the Fenton reaction in vivo(15Imlay J.A. Chin S.M. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). We therefore proposed that the base damage seen in the sodA sodB fur strain is a consequence of Haber-Weiss/Fenton reaction occurring on or near DNA, generating highly reactive species such as OH⋅, which is then an effector of DNA damage (34Imlay J.A. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We reported here that mutations in sodA sodB fur caused both intracellular generation of OH⋅ and typical oxidative base damage such as 8-oxo-G and 2-oxo-A. These observations suggested the importance of SODs in reducing intracellular concentrations of O·̄2 to safe levels and of Fur for well controlled iron uptake to maintain oxidative stress as low as possible. On the other hand, increases in frequency of spontaneous mutations in QC1736 (Fig. 3) depended on OH⋅ generation and increases in oxidative lesions in DNA. The fur mutation leads to a permanent influx of iron, which overwhelms the iron storage capacity of the cells leading to an intracellular overload of iron. Inhibition of siderophore-mediated iron(III) transport by a tonB mutation suppressed mutagenicity of the sodA sodB fur strain (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, we concluded that imported iron(III) was responsible for OH⋅ generation and increases in 8-oxo-G and 2-oxo-A in DNA as well as mutagenesis. We observed 3- and 7-fold increases in spontaneous mutation in mutants lacking Fur and SOD, respectively, and a more than 100-fold increase insodA sodB fur strain as compared with the wild-type control (Fig. 3). This synergistic effect due to deficiencies in Fur and SOD may be explained by the recently proposed role of O·̄2 (Fig.6). In the Fur-deficient cells, imported iron may be stored in iron-storage proteins such as bacterioferritin and ferritin, and in iron-containing proteins such as a group of hydrates containing [4Fe-4S] clusters. The increased level of O·̄2 liberates iron(II) from O·̄2-sensitive enzymatic [4Fe-4S] clusters, followed by continual deposition of iron from the iron-storage proteins into the cluster by the cluster reconstituting process (35Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Miller T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16053-16067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 36Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cycling of O·̄2 attack and [4Fe-4S] reconstitution can allow a single enzymatic [4Fe-4S] cluster to release large amounts of free iron(II) during aerobically growth. This results in excess amounts of iron(II) in or near DNA. The possibility, however, that O·̄2 liberates iron(II) from iron-storage proteins cannot be excluded. O·̄2 can also become H2O2 through disproportionation and stabilize H2O2 by direct inactivation of catalase (38Kono Y. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5751-5754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, the increases in internal levels of both iron(III) and O·̄2 in SOD Fur-mutant cells may accelerate the cycling and amplify the impact of oxidative stress probably by continuous generation of OH⋅. When spontaneous mutagenesis was examined with an E. colistrain lacking catalases, the frequency in the katE katG furstrain was 3-fold higher than those of parental and katE katG strains (Fig. 3). Thus, excess H2O2had no effect on the formation of OH⋅ under Fur-deficient condition. As described above, excess iron alone has no effects on the rate of the Fenton reaction since such iron is in the form of iron-storage protein. If the levels of O·̄2 increase, O·̄2 can attack [4Fe-4S] to liberate iron(II). On the other hand, even if the levels of H2O2 are increased, iron(II) cannot be liberated. Thus, catalase cannot control the level of OH⋅ formation. In other words, our results showed that iron(II), and not H2O2, is rate-limiting in OH⋅ formation by Fenton reaction. Mutation spectrum analysis indicated that deficiencies in sodA sodB fur predominantly induce base substitutions of GC → TA and AT → CG transversions (Tables II and III). These transversions are typical mutations caused by oxidative stress and were observed in mutants lacking mutM, mutY, and mutT(8Michaels M. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6321-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Recently, GC → TA transversion was reported to be not only induced by misincorporation of dATP opposite 8-oxo-G in DNA, but also to be induced by misincorporation of 2-oxo-dATP from the nucleotide pool opposite guanine in DNA (33Inoue M. Kamiya H. Fujikawa K. Ootsuyama Y. Murata-Kamiya N. Osaki T. Yasumoto K. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11069-11074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In fact, we observed higher contents of these oxidative lesions in DNA prepared from the sodA sodB fur mutant strain (Fig. 2). All our results, therefore, strongly indicate that increases in internal levels of both iron and O·̄2due to deficiencies in both SOD and Fur stimulate OH⋅generation, followed by oxidative lesions in DNA as well as in the nucleotides pool, resulting predominantly in GC → TA and AT → CG transversions.

With these antibodies, phosphorylation of desmin was observed specifically at the cleavage furrow in late mitotic Saos-2 cells. We then found that treatment of the interphase cells with calyculin A revealed phosphorylation at all the three sites of desmin. We also found that an antibody, which specifically recognizes vimentin phosphorylated at Ser-71 by Rho kinase, became immunoreactive after calyculin A treatment. This calyculin A-induced interphase phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser-71 was blocked by Rho kinase inhibitor or by expression of the dominant-negative Rho kinase. Taken together, our results indicate that Rho kinase is activated not only in mitotic cells but also interphase ones, and phosphorylates intermediate filament proteins, although the apparent phosphorylation level is diminished to an undetectable level due to the constitutive action of type 1 protein phosphatase. The balance between intermediate filament protein phosphorylation by Rho kinase and dephosphorylation by type 1 protein phosphatase may affect the continuous exchange of intermediate filament subunits between a soluble pool and polymerized intermediate filaments.

Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). It was also reported that Rho kinase is colocalized with the vimentin filament in serum-starved fibroblasts, and when activated, it translocates to cell peripheral regions (34Sin W.-C. Chen X.-Q. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6325-6339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Rho kinase may be active at cell-cell and cell-substrate contact regions in interphase cells. This hypothesis is supported by several lines of experiments showing the Rho kinase-mediated regulation of ezrin, radixin, and moesin proteins (35Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M.

In the present work, we newly developed site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibodies for the three Rho kinase phosphorylation sites of desmin in order to analyze the physiological significance of desmin phosphorylation by Rho kinase. Using these antibodies, we found that all the three sites were phosphorylated specifically at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. This evidence strongly supports our proposal that Rho kinase acts as a cleavage furrow kinase for IF proteins. Although various kinases are activated spatiotemporally during the cell cycle and phosphorylate IF proteins, it has been suggested that protein phosphatase is also important for maintenance of the filament structure and plasticity because the IF structure is immediately altered when the cells are treated with protein phosphatase inhibitors (38Eriksson J.E.

We also investigated novel functional aspects of Rho kinase on desmin and vimentin in interphase cells, using the phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A (CA) and ocadaic acid (OA). Rho kinase is active to some extent in interphase cells, as well as mitotic cells, although the phosphorylation is apparently masked due to effects of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1). Our data allow for a new proposal regarding dynamic exchange of type III IF subunits between a soluble pool and the polymerized IFs: Rho kinase- and PP1-mediataed IF protein phosphorylation and deposphorylation, respectively, may influence steady state equilibrium. Recombinant desmin was prepared and purified from Escherichia coli, as described (33Inada H. Goto H. Tanabe K. Nishi Y. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Human osteosarcoma Saos2 cells (a gift from Dr. H. Saya, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan), MDCK cells and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Saos2 cells were seeded on coverslips in six-well plates at 1 × 105cells/well, and the next day, cells were transfected with pEF-BOS-Myc-RhoK-CAT, using LipofectAMINE Plus™ (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were fixed for immunocytochemistry. In some experiments, Saos-2, MDCK, and NIH3T3 cells were seeded on 100-mm plates at 1 × 106cells/plate or 24-well plates at 1 × 104 cells/well; the next day, the cells were treated with various concentrations of CA or OA, and then cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis or were fixed for immunocytochemistry. Cells fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, followed by treatment with methanol for 10 min at −20 °C, were stained with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (α-PD16, α-PD75, α-PD76, α-desmin, α-Rho kinase, and GK71) and mouse monoclonal antibodies (9E10 and α-vimentin) for 2 h at 37 °C. The immunoreactivities were visualized by incubation with AlexaTM 488 goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) and with FluoroLinkTMCyTM2 labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the samples were examined under a confocal microscope (Olympus, LSM-GB200). For immunoblotting, lysate of 1 × 105 CA- or OA-treated cells were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylide difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membranes were then incubated with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, as described above, for 2 h at room temperature, and visualized by making use of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the ECL immunoblotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, quantification of the phosphorylation level was done using laser densitometry, and the level was expressed in arbitrary optical density units. In cell suspension experiments, NIH3T3 cells were detached from culture dishes by trypsin treatment. Cells were then once washed by centrifugation, resuspended in the medium, and treated with various concentrations of CA or OA followed by immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses. NIH3T3 cells were seeded on 100-mm plates at 1 × 106 cells/plate or 24 well plates at 1 × 104 cells/well; next day, the cells were preincubated with various concentrations of HA1077 or Y-27632 for 30 min, and then CA was added (final concentration, 20 nm). After treatment with CA for for 15 min, the cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis or were fixed for immunocytochemistry. For microinjection, NIH3T3 cell were seeded on 13-mm glass coverslips at 1 × 104 cells/slip. The next day, pEF-BOS-Myc-RB/PH(TT) (0.1 mg/ml) or pEF-BOS-Myc-COIL (0.1 mg/ml) was microinjected into the nuclei of the cells. Twenty-four h after injection, the cells were treated with 20 nm CA for 15 min and were fixed for immunocytochemical analysis. We reported that desmin is phosphorylated by Rho kinase at Thr-16, Thr-75, and Thr-76 in vitro (33Inada H. Goto H. Tanabe K. Nishi Y. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate the phosphorylation of desmin by Rho kinase during the cell cycle, we developed three rabbit polyclonal antibodies (α-PD16, α-PD75, and α-PD76) against the synthetic phosphopeptides PD16, PD75, and PD76, respectively (Fig.1 A). The reactivity of α-PD16, α-PD75, and α-PD76 to desmin phosphorylated at Thr-16, Thr-75, and Thr-76 was investigated by immunoblotting. In Fig.1 B, α-PD16, α-PD75, and α-PD76 reacted with the phosphorylated desmin by Rho kinase but not unphosphorylated desmin. As shown in Fig. 1 C, inhibition assays were carried out using synthetic peptides to analyze the epitope specificity of these antibodies. The immunoreactivity of α-PD16 was prevented by preincubation of phosphopeptide PD16 but not nonphosphopeptide D16 or other phosphopeptides/nonphosphopeptides, such as PD75, D75, PD76, D76, and PD75–76. Likewise, the reaction of α-PD75 was blocked by preincubation with phosphopeptide PD75. The immunoreactivity of α-PD76 was blocked by preincubation with PD76 and partly blocked with PD75–76. Thus, α-PD16 and α-PD75 specifically recognized the phosphorylation of desmin at Thr-16 and Thr-75, respectively. On the other hand, α-PD76 was found to recognize double phosphorylation at Thr-75 and Thr-76 as well as the monophosphorylation of desmin at Thr-76. To investigate the phosphorylation of desmin by Rho kinase in cells, we asked whether Rho kinase could phosphorylate Thr-16, Thr-75, and Thr-76 of desmin in Saos-2 human osteoblast cells ectopically expressing the constitutively active version of Rho kinase (Fig. 2). Cells were transiently transfected with pEF-BOS-Myc mammalian expression vector encoding the constitutively activated catalytic domain of bovine Rho kinase (RhoK-CAT). The cells were double-stained with monoclonal antibody 9E10 for the Myc epitope-tagged RhoK-CAT and α-Des (Fig.2 A), α-PD16 (Fig. 2 B), α-PD75 (Fig.2 C), or α-PD76 (Fig. 2 D). Immunocytochemical analyses revealed that phosphorylation of Thr-16, Thr-75, and Thr-76 of desmin occurred in cells expressing RhoK-CAT (Fig. 2, B–D). As is the case with vimentin (23Goto H. Kosako H. Tanabe K. Yanagida M. Sakurai M. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11728-11736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of desmin by Rho kinase induces collapse, a dynamic change of desmin-IF organization (Fig. 2, A–D). This phosphorylation was not detected in the cells expressing the catalytic domain mutated at the ATP-binding site (CAT-KD; K121G) (data not shown), indicating that the kinase domain is essential for the desmin phosphorylation we observed. These results show that the constitutive active form of Rho-kinse phosphorylates all three in vitro Rho kinase phosphorylation sites of desmin in cells. In the next set of experiments, based on the foregoing biochemical and immunocytochemical observation that Thr-16, Thr-75, and Thr-76 of desmin are in vivo phosphorylation sites by Rho kinase, the spatial and temporal distribution of the three phosphorylated sites in Saos-2 cells was analyzed using α-PD16, α-PD75, and α-PD76. Under the conditions used, all the immunoreactivity of α-PD16, α-PD75, and α-PD76 was detected only in late mitotic cells and specifically at the cleavage furrow (Fig. 3) but not in interphase cells (Fig. 4 A) or in early mitotic cells, such as prometaphase or metaphase (data not shown). When desmin was stained with α-Des, which reacts with phosphorylated and unphosphorylated desmin, the filamentous structures were observed in mitotic daughter cells (Fig. 3) and in interphase cells (Fig.4 A). In late mitotic Saos-2 cells, Rho kinase also accumulates specifically at the cleavage furrow, as illustrated in Fig.3, findings that strongly suggest a direct interaction of the kinase with desmin. From these results, we conclude that Rho kinase acts as desmin kinase at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. On the basis of the in vitro observation that phosphorylation of desmin by Rho kinase inhibits filament formation (33Inada H. Goto H. Tanabe K. Nishi Y. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we propose that desmin filaments are phosphorylated by Rho kinase and depolymerized at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, and hence the segregation of desmin into daughter cells is efficient.Figure 4Phosphorylation of desmin by Rho kinase in response to CA in Saos-2 cells. A, Saos-2 cells were treated with 20 nm CA for 20 min (right panels). Control cells (left panels) were untreated. Cells were fixed and stained with α-desmin, α-PD16, α-PD75, or α-PD76.Scale bars, 10 μm. B, cells were untreated (control) or treated with 20 nm CA for 20 min (CA) and analyzed by immunoblotting. Desmin (D) is indicated by the arrowhead.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Phosphorylation of IF proteins may play a role in IF structural organization. Rho kinase was found to be co-localized with IF filament in interphase cells (34Sin W.-C. Chen X.-Q. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6325-6339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the possible function(s) of Rho kinase in IF reorganization, we next analyzed the activation state of Rho kinase on desmin in interphase cells. Intact interphase cells showed a characteristic network of desmin filaments spanning the cytoplasm, determined using an anti-desmin antibody (Fig. 4 A, α-Des, left panel). After treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor CA (20 nm) for 20 min, cells began to round up, the organization of desmin filament was altered, and the IF network collapsed to form a desmin-containing arc near the perinuclear region (Fig. 4 A, α-Des, right panel). All the immunoreactivity of α-PD16, α-PD75, and α-PD76 appeared in interphase cells treated with CA (Fig. 4 A, right panels). Although the staining patterns varied, the filamentous structure was clearly disrupted and the desmin filaments had collapsed. To confirm that Thr-16, Thr-75, and Thr-76 of desmin were phosphorylated in response to CA, immunoblot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 4 B, α-PD16, α-PD75, or α-PD76-immunoreactive band was observed when interphase cells were treated with CA. Taken together, it is most likely that Rho kinase is to some extent activated even in interphase cells, and an unidentified CA-sensitive phosphatase causes the rapid phosphate turnover on IFs. Because we determined that Ser-71 of vimentin is a specific site for Rho-kinse, and Ser-33, Ser-55, and Ser-82 residues of vimentin are sites specific for PKC, cdc2 kinase, and CaMKII, respectively (29Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar), vimentin is a suitable substrate to verify that Rho kinase, rather than other kinases, phosphorylates IF proteins and regulates their structure and plasticity in interphase cells. We next examined phosphorylation states of vimentin, widely expressed in culture cells, in response"

Although mizoribine has been used clinically as an immunosuppressant, immunophilins of the agent have not yet been fully understood. We investigated their specific binding proteins using mizoribine affinity column chromatography and porcine kidney cytosols. By increasing mizoribine in the eluant from the column, two major proteins (with molecular masses of 60 and 43 kDa) were detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Based on the amino acid sequence analysis of these proteins, 60- and 43-kDa mizoribine-binding proteins were identified with HSP60 and cytosolic actin, respectively. A considerable amount of actin was also eluted from the affinity column by nucleotides, but a very low quantity of HSP60 was eluted under the same conditions. On the other hand, HSP60 was eluted as a major protein in the eluant that was eluted preferentially, with nucleotide followed by mizoribine. Actin was also detected in the eluant, but the quantity of the protein was very low. These results indicated that HSP60 has high affinity to mizoribine, and the interaction was also observed on surface plasmon resonance analysis. Although HSP60 or GroE facilitated refolding of citrate synthase in vitro, mizoribine interfered with the chaperone activity of HSP60.

These immunosuppressant-specific binding proteins are called immunophilins. Some immunophilins bind to molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP90 (for review, see Ref. 1Galat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the immunophilins of cyclosporin A are cyclophilins-A–D, cyclophilin-40, actin, and HSP70 (for review, see Ref. 1Galat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The immunophilins of rapamycin and FK506 are the same and they are FKBP12, FKBP13, FKBP25, and FKBP52 (2Fruman D.A. Burakoff S.J. Biere B.E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In these immunophilins, FKBP52 binds to the 90-kDa molecular chaperone HSP90, and the complex is involved in steroid hormone receptors (3Tai P-K.K. Albers M.W. Chang H. Faber L.E. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1315-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). On the contrary, HSP70 and HSP90 bind directly to an immunosuppressant deoxyspergualin (4Nadler S.G. Tepper M.A. Schacter B.

Mizoribine (4-carbamoyl-1-β-d-ribofuranosylimidazolium-5-olate) is a purine nucleotide analog isolated from Eupenicillium brefeldianum (6Mizuno K. Tsujino M. Takada M. Hayashi M. Atsumi K. Asano K.

Tsukagoshi S. Sakurai Y. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1098-1102PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of these reports, mizoribine has been used clinically as an immunosuppressant after renal transplantation (8Tajima A. Hata M. Ohtani N. Ohtawara Y. Suzuki K. Aso Y.

The mechanisms of the immunosuppressive effects of mizoribine demonstrated that mizoribine is phosphorylated by adenosine kinase (10Koyama H. Tsuji M. Biochem.

The inhibition of the enzymes results in the depletion of intracellular guanine nucleotides as shown in both murine and human systems (12Turka L.A. Dayton J. Sinclair G. Thompson C.B. Mitchell B.S.

There are many reports on drug evaluation or the clinical effects of mizoribine, but no report has been shown for mizoribine-specific binding proteins. Until now, the immunophilins of mizoribine have not yet been understood. In the present study, we have tried to search mizoribine-binding proteins using mizoribine affinity columns prepared on different types of affinity gels. We identified two proteins, with molecular masses of 43 and 60 kDa, and will discuss their physiological implications and possibilities of their function. Porcine liver HSP60 or bovine brain HSP70 was purified, and an antibody against each HSP was produced as described previously (13Itoh H. Kobayashi R. Wakui H. Komatsuda A. Ohtani H. Miura A.B.

An immunosuppressant mizoribine (4-carbamoyl-1-β-d-ribofuranosylimidazolium-5-olate) was obtained from Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The chemical constitution of mizoribine is shown in Fig.1. Mizoribine-Sepharose was prepared using mizoribine and different types of affinity gels, activated epoxy-Sepharose 6B, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, or activated CH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instruction manual. Porcine kidneys (200 g) were homogenized with three volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and followed by centrifugation at 105,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained from ultracentrifugation was used as porcine kidney cytosol in the present study. Porcine kidney cytosols were applied to the column, equilibrated in the same buffer, and washed with 20 column volumes of the buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl. After washing the column, binding proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of mizoribine (0–10 mm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The binding proteins were also eluted from the columns with nucleotides. 5 mm AMP, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm GTP, or 10 mm mizoribine. Otherwise, proteins were eluted preferentially, with nucleotide followed by mizoribine; 5 mm AMP followed by 10 mm mizoribine, 5 mm ATP followed by 10 mm mizoribine, or 5 mm GTP followed by 10 mm mizoribine. 50% trichloroacetic acid solution (w/v) was added to each fraction at a final concentration of 5% (w/v) and kept on ice for 30 min. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE1 (12.5% gel) (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar), stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue (w/v), and destained with 25% isopropyl alcohol (v/v) and 10% acetic acid (v/v) or by immunoblotting (16Towbin H. Staephlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44935) Google Scholar) using an anti-HSP60 antibody and alkaline phosphatase anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Mizoribine-binding proteins were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel). After staining the gel with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue (v/v) and destaining with 25% isopropyl alcohol (v/v) and 10% acetic acid (v/v), protein bands were excised and digested using lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries; Osaka, Japan) as described previously (13Itoh H. Kobayashi R. Wakui H. Komatsuda A. Ohtani H. Miura A.B. Otaka M. Masamune O. Andoh H. Koyama Y. Sato Y. Tashima Y. J. Biol.

The peptides were purified by the reverse phase column that was connected to an HPLC apparatus. A column of Wakopak (Wakosil 5C18; Wako Pure Chemical Industries; Osaka, Japan) was connected to an HPLC apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech high performance liquid chromatographer equipped with two model 2150 pumps, a model 2150 HPLC controller, and a model 2158 Uvicord SD UV detector was used for purification of the peptides). The peptide was applied onto the column, which was pre-equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–64% acetonitrile (v/v) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The purified peptides were detected at 206 nm as described previously (13Itoh H. Kobayashi R. Wakui H. Komatsuda A. Ohtani H. Miura A.B. Otaka M. Masamune O. Andoh H. Koyama Y. Sato Y. Tashima Y. J.

Amino acid sequencing of the purified peptides was performed with 491 Procise® protein sequence system (Perkin-Elmer). The BIAcore apparatus was from BIAcore (Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Porcine liver HSP60 or GroEL was covalently linked to the surface of a flow cell on a research grade CM5 sensor chip using an amine-coupling kit from BIAcore (Uppsala, Sweden). The flow was 5 μl/ml throughout the derivatization procedure. The derivatized sensor chip was washed extensively with HBS-P buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20). The binding kinetics of mizoribine to immobilized HSP60 was determined by increasing mizoribine (0.15625–2.5 μm) in HBS-P buffer (running buffer) at a flow rate of 20 μl/ml. The sensor chip surface was regenerated by 1.5m NaCl in HBS-P buffer at a flow rate of 20 μl/ml. Unspecific binding was evaluated using flow cells on the chip with either underivatized surface or surface derivatized with bovine brain HSP70, because HSP70 had no interaction with mizoribine during this analysis. The kinetic parameters of the binding reactions were determined using BIAevaluation version 3.0 software. The dissociation rate constant (kd) was determined from a plot of ln(R 0/R) versus time, withR being the surface plasmon resonance signal at timet; the association rate constant (ka) was determined from a plot of ln(abs(dR/dt))versus time. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant was calculated from the kinetic constant KD =kd/ka. Chaperone activity of mammalian HSP60 or GroEL/GroES was measured using citrate synthase as described (18Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmidt F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 19Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, citrate synthase was denatured (at a concentration of 15 μm) in a buffer containing 6 mguanidine hydrochloride, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol. Renaturation was initiated by diluting the denatured citrate synthase 100-fold into a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 2 mm ATP at 20 or 35 °C. Details for individual experiments are given in the legend to Fig. 7. To search mizoribine-binding proteins, we analyzed them using a mizoribine affinity column (prepared using activated epoxy-Sepharose 6B). Porcine kidney cytosols were applied onto the column, and a thorough washing with a buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl was carried out to avoid nonspecific binding proteins. After washing, the binding proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of mizoribine (0–10 mm), and eluted proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE. We detected two major protein bands (with molecular masses of 60 and 43 kDa) on the gel (Fig. 2). Some minor proteins (with molecular masses of 40, 50, 55, and 80 kDa) were also detected by faint bands on the gel. In the present study, we focused on these two major proteins. To identify the mizoribine-binding proteins, we investigated the amino acid sequence of these two proteins using a protein sequencer. Next the proteins were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands were excised and digested with lysyl endopeptidase. The digested peptides were purified using a C18 reverse phase column connected to an HPLC. Fig. 3 A shows a peptide map obtained from the 60-kDa kidney protein that was eluted from a mizoribine affinity column. One peptide (fraction 60) was sequenced by a protein sequencer. The sequence contained three peptides, and the 35 amino acid residues obtained from the peptide (fraction 60) completely coincided with human HSP60, the amino acid sequence of which was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA (20Jindal S. Dudani A.K. Singh B. Harley C.B. Guputa R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2279-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows the sequence obtained from the peptide and the position of human HSP60. On the basis of molecular mass and amino acid sequence data, HSP60 with a molecular mass of 60 kDa was one of the major binding proteins to the mizoribine affinity column. We also investigated the amino acid sequence of another 43-kDa mizoribine-binding protein. Fig.4 A shows a peptide map of the protein. The two peptides (fractions 57 and 66) were sequenced, and 15 amino acid residues were obtained from each peptide (Fig.4 B). The sequence of these peptides has complete homology to human cytoplasmic actin (G-actin) (21Erba H.P. Eddy R. Shows T. Kedes L. Gunning P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1775-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the 43-kDa mizoribine-binding protein is actin. As shown in Fig. 1, mizoribine is a purine nucleotide analog. We investigated the influence of nucleotides on mizoribine and their binding proteins, because the chemical structures of mizoribine and the nucleotides resemble each other. In this study, we used a mizoribine affinity column prepared with activated epoxy-Sepharose 6B. Porcine kidney cytosols were applied to the column and washed with 20 column volumes of the buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl to avoid nonspecific binding proteins. After washing the column extensively, the binding proteins were eluted using AMP, ATP, GTP, or 10 mm mizoribine. The remaining proteins were further eluted by using mizoribine from each affinity column, and the eluants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.5 A, many protein bands were detected in the eluants from nucleotide alone (AMP, ATP, and/or GTP). The purine structure or mono- and triphosphate of nucleotides affected slight differences in the eluted proteins. Among those with molecular masses of 80–90 kDa, proteins were eluted by ATP, but none or few of these proteins were eluted by AMP. This might be an effect of the number of phosphates, and these proteins might be eluted by ATPase. On the contrary, the 10-kDa protein was one of the major proteins eluted by GTP. The protein was detected as a faint protein band in the eluant from AMP or ATP. The protein was affected by the difference of the purine structure of the nucleotide. In the eluants, the 43-kDa protein, actin, was detected as a major protein from these nucleotides. The density of actin in these eluants was the same as in the eluant from mizoribine. However, the protein was also detected in the eluants from nucleotides followed by mizoribine as very faint protein bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. On the contrary, HSP60 was eluted from the affinity column by nucleotides, with a minor protein detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 5 B). The quantity of HSP60 was highest in the eluant from mizoribine. During immunoblotting analysis, the protein bands were detected to some extent in the eluant from nucleotides followed by mizoribine, and the density of HSP60 protein bands in the eluant was higher than that of the protein bands in the eluant from nucleotides only (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that HSP60 has high affinity to mizoribine among these two major mizoribine-binding proteins. A sensorgram of the interaction of an HSP60 and mizoribine is shown in Fig.6. Using BIAcore evaluation software, the kinetic parameters of ka,kd, and KD were measured. The binding curves were fitted to a simple bimolecular binding algorithm with x 2 = 0.332. The results of the surface plasmon resonance analysis with immobilized HSP60 and soluble mizoribine were ka (1/m·s) = 1.21 × 10−5, and kd(1/s) = 6.67 × 10−2. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was calculated from these kinetic constants, and the KD value obtained was 5.53 × 10−7m. During the analysis, the same data were obtained from GroEL and HSP60 (data not shown). Citrate synthase refolding was analyzed under permissive conditions (20 °C), where spontaneous reactivation could occur, or under nonpermissive conditions (35 °C), where spontaneous reactivation could not occur, as described (19Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7, citrate synthase was partitioned to its native state in a chaperonin-independent folding reaction under permissive conditions. Mizoribine did not influence the reaction. On the contrary, spontaneous renaturation of citrate synthase was not observed under nonpermissive conditions. Under these conditions, the recovery of active citrate synthase was about 63% in the presence of the complete chaperonin system (including HSP60, GroES, and ATP). Mizoribine interfered with the refolding reactions of citrate synthase even in the presence of the complete chaperonin system. These results indicated that the interaction between HSP60 and mizoribine may be physiologically significant. We investigated the functional groups of mizoribine for these binding proteins. In the present study, we prepared the mizoribine affinity column using three different types of affinity gel matrices (CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, activated CH-Sepharose 4B, and activated epoxy-Sepharose 6B). In these affinity gel matrices, both CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and activated CH-Sepharose 4B coupled with the NH2 group of ligands. The different mechanisms of these two affinity matrices are as follows. Activated CH-Sepharose 4B has a spacer of carboxyl-hexyl chain (C6) and is coupled with the NH2 group of ligand, but it does not have CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. On the contrary, epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B coupled directly with the OH group of sugar or carbohydrates. As shown in Fig. 8, we investigated the proteins (that bind to mizoribine affinity gels) prepared with different types of affinity gel matrices as described above. SDS-PAGE could detect no protein bands in the eluant from all control affinity gels (Fig. 8 A). Furthermore, protein bands were also not detected in the eluant from mizoribine affinity gels prepared with either CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B or activated CH-Sepharose 4B. On the contrary, HSP60 and actin were detected only in the eluant from the mizoribine affinity column prepared with activated epoxy-Sepharose 6B. The same data were obtained by immunoblot analysis using an anti-HSP60 antibody (Fig. 8 B). These results indicated that HSP60 and/or actin are binding proteins to mizoribine, and they recognize the NH2 group of mizoribine (but not OH groups of the agent). Based on these results, we determined that the NH2 group of mizoribine may act as a functional group. Mizoribine has been used clinically as an immunosuppressant. This agent is a competitive inhibitor of inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and acts to inhibit de novo purine synthesis by inhibition of IMPDH (22Halloran P.F. Clin. Transplant. 1996; 10: 118-123PubMed Google Scholar). Mizoribine also inhibits GMP synthase (11Kusumi T. Tsuda M. Katsumata T. Yamamura M. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1989; 7: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The inhibition of these enzymes results in the depletion of the intracellular guanine nucleotide. The depletion of the guanine nucleotide causes Gi/s blockage in human T cells (12Turka L.A. Dayton J. Sinclair G. Thompson C.B. Mitchell B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although immunophilins have been investigated for immunosuppressants cyclosporin A, FK506, rapamycin, and deoxyspergualin, immunophilin specific for mizoribine has not yet been investigated. Molecular chaperones HSP70 or HSP90 associate with the immunophilins of cyclosporin A or FK506 and/or rapamycin (23Moss M.L. Palmer P.E. Kuzmic P. Dunlap B.E. Henzel W. Kofron J.L. Mellon W.S. Royer C.E. Ritch D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22054-22059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both molecular chaperones bind directly to immunosuppressant deoxyspergualin (4Nadler S.G. Tepper M.A. Schacter B. Mazzucco C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 5Nadeau K. Nadler S.G. Saulnier M. Tepper M.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2561-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). HSP70 and/or HSP90 interact with the immunosuppressant as directly or indirectly as does immunophilin. Among the molecular chaperones, only these two HSPs have been reported as immunophilin or immunophilin-associated proteins, but there have been no reports that the other molecular chaperones, including HSP60, act as immunophilins or their binding proteins. In the present study, we have identified two mizoribine-binding proteins, HSP60 and actin, by using a mizoribine affinity column. Through affinity column chromatography and surface plasmon resonance analysis we could confirm that HSP60 has high affinity to mizoribine. HSP60 recognized the NH2 group of the agent. The binding properties of HSP60 to mizoribine are the same to immunosuppressant deoxyspergualin as those of HSP70 and HSP90, because these proteins also bind to the agent directly and may act as immunophilins in the cells. The binding of mizoribine to HSP60 resulted in the interference of chaperone activity of HSP60 in vitro. It has been reported that mammalian mt-cpn60 is only able to interact with mammalian mt-cpn10 in contrast with other species of cpn10 (24Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Bergmeier W. Weiss C. Kessel M. Goloubinoff P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 203-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). There is a discrepant result in an in vitro folding assay. We used wild type HSP60 that was purified from porcine liver cytosol in the assay (13Itoh H. Kobayashi R. Wakui H. Komatsuda A. Ohtani H. Miura A.B. Otaka M. Masamune O. Andoh H. Koyama Y. Sato Y. Tashima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13429-13435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). One possibility for achieving the discrepant results may be the difference between recombinant mt-cpn60 and wild type HSP60. This difference may result in discrepancies during in vitrofolding assay. These results indicated that the interaction between HSP60 and mizoribine may be significant. Prokaryotic chaperonins (such as HSP60) have been well characterized (25Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar, 26Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of the asymmetric GroEL-GroES-(ADP)7 chaperonin complex has been shown by Xuet al. (27Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The bacterial chaperonin GroEL and its co-chaperonin GroES are coexpressed from a common operon (GroE) in Escherichia coli. GroEL contains 14 identical subunits of relative molecular weight of 58,000 that are assembled as two heptameric rings stacked back to back. GroES contains seven identical 10,000-dalton subunits assembled as one heptameric ring. Both chaperonins are essential for protein folding under all cell conditions. Chaperonins seem to provide kinetic assistance to the process of folding newly translated or newly translocated polypeptides. Conversely, difficult purification of mammalian HSP60 results in few reports being made about the protein. Mammalian HSP60 was first cloned and sequenced by Guputa and co-workers (20Jindal S. Dudani A.K. Singh B. Harley C.B. Guputa R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2279-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) as a mitochondrial P1 protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of P1 shows strong homology to GroEL and the 65-kDa major antigen of mycobacteria. It has been shown that the possibility of involvement of the P1 protein in certain autoimmune diseases is because of high homology between P1 and the mycobacterial antigen (20Jindal S. Dudani A.K. Singh B. Harley C.B. Guputa R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2279-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). We have purified and identified mammalian HSP60 from porcine liver cytosol or porcine kidney mitochondria (13Itoh H. Kobayashi R. Wakui H. Komatsuda A. Ohtani H. Miura A.B. Otaka M. Masamune O. Andoh H. Koyama Y. Sato Y. Tashima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13429-13435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although both proteins exhibit molecular chaperone activity in vitro, there were some differences between cytoplasmic HSP60 and mitochondrial HSP60; the former has a signal sequence in the NH2 terminus of the protein (1–26 amino acid residues), but the latter does not. The protein is localized in cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nuclei during immunoblotting or electron microscopic immunohistochemistry (13Itoh H. Kobayashi R. Wakui H. Komatsuda A. Ohtani H. Miura A.B. Otaka M. Masamune O. Andoh H. Koyama Y. Sato Y. Tashima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13429-13435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The functional HSP60 in the cytoplasm may be transported into the mitochondria, and the protein may be processed to mitochondrial HSP60 in the organelle. The physiological functions of mammalian HSP60 are not yet fully understood. Important physiological roles of the proposed HSP60 have been raised. It has been reported that HSP60 associates with p21ras (28Ikawa S. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2012-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and that the protein is a major target for modification duringS-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-l-cysteine-induced nephrotoxicity (29Bruschi S.A. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Guputa R.S. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23157-23161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown here that HSP60 binds directly to the immunosuppressant and that the protein may act as an immunophilin. These findings represent the first demonstration of HSP60 as an immunophilin. Further studies are needed to clarify the physiological implications of the binding of HSP60 to mizoribine. As mentioned above, mizoribine is a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH and acts to inhibitde novo purine synthesis by inhibition of IMDPH (22Halloran P.F. Clin. Transplant. 1996; 10: 118-123PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that human but not bacterial HSP60 can contribute to suppression of arthritis by the stimulation of regulatory suppressive T cell activity (30van Roon J.A. van Eden W. van Roy J.L. Lafeber F.J Bijlsma J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mizoribine has been used clinically as an immunosuppressant for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (31Shiokawa Y. Honma M. Shichikawa K. Miyamoto T. Hirose S. Nobunaga T. Mizushima Y. Sugawara S. Warabi H. Kondo H. Ogawa H. Ensho. 1991; 11: 375-396Crossref Google Scholar). The binding of HSP60 to mizoribine may enhance the inhibitory activity of IMPDH or stimulate regulatory suppressive T cell activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2030457887,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) represent a superfamily of proteins that mediate the function of neurotransmitters and peptide hormones and are involved in viral entry and perception of light, smell, and taste. GPCRs are characterized by the presence of seven transmembrane domains (TMs). We demonstrate here that structural analogs of individual TMs of GPCRs can serve as potent and specific receptor antagonists. Peptides derived from the transmembrane regions of CXCR4 and CCR5 chemokine receptors specifically inhibited receptor signaling and the in vitro replication of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) at concentrations as low as 0.2 μM. Similarly, peptides mimicking the TMs of cholecystokinin receptor A, were found to abolish ligand binding and signaling through the receptor. Negative charges positioned at the extracellular termini of peptide antagonists appeared to be important for correct spontaneous insertion of the compounds into the cell membrane and for their activity. Targeting of the specific interactions between transmembrane domains of GPCRs is suggested as a general sequence-based method to disrupt receptor function for application in drug design and for structure-function studies of the receptors.

Although targeting the external ligand binding sites of GPCRs is the generally accepted strategy in designing antagonists, we have elected to pursue an alternate approach based on the disruption of receptor structure. The amino acid sequences of the members of GPCR superfamily indicate a highly conserved presence of seven hydrophobic domains that are suggested to be transmembrane helices. Transmembrane domains (TMs) are believed to be arranged in a barrel-like structure with a tightly packed core (2Pebay-Peyroula E. Rummel G. Rosenbusch J.P. Landau E.M.

Specifically, coexpression of polypeptides generated by splitting the muscarinic receptor in either the extracellular or the intracellular loops resulted in assembly of the molecules, which exhibited receptor-like function (6Maggio R.

Finally, a peptide derived from the sixth TM of β2-adrenergic receptor was found to inhibit receptor activation and dimerization (13Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G.

Hence, it appears highly probable that TMs of GPCRs interact in a specific way in the assembly of receptor molecules. However, these interactions are unlikely to lead to rigid structures, because flexibility is required to allow for conformational changes during signaling from the cell surface to the intracellular domains. To transmit the signal from one part of the protein to another, the protein needs to have allosteric properties, which implies flexibility in the systems. Together, these observations led us to suggest that targeting intramembrane interactions of GPCRs with designed molecules may allow for specific regulation of receptor function. Thus, it may be possible to create a molecule that can specifically disrupt interaction of transmembrane domains of a particular receptor, which would render the receptor molecule nonfunctional (Fig. 1). The peptides were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis on 432A or 433A Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizers equipped with conductivity monitoring units utilizing Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acid derivatives. The synthesis was performed with conditional blocking of unreacted amino groups with acetic anhydride for easier purification of the resulting peptides. To overcome aggregation that frequently occurs during the synthesis of hydrophobic peptides and leads to the blockage of the growing peptide chain, NovaSyn TGA resins (Nova Biochem, San Diego, CA) were used. The peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column in a gradient of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, water and acetonitrile. The purity of the peptides was assessed by reverse phase HPLC on C18 and C4 columns, and the structures were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry as described (14Tarasova N.I.

The measurements were carried out in Fura-2/AM-treated cells utilizing the Attofluor digital imaging system as described (15Tarasova N.I. Stauber R.H. Choi J.K. Hudson E.A. Czerwinski G. Miller J.L.

Stock solution of antagonists (5–10 mm) in dimethyl sulfoxide were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and added to the cells preloaded with Fura-2/AM. Stimulation with an agonist was carried within seconds after application of an antagonist. CXCR4-positive cells were stimulated with 50 nm stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1α; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and cholecystokinin receptor type A (CCKAR) receptor-mediated response was triggered by 10 nm sulfated CCK-8 (Research Plus Inc., Bayonne, NJ). Subsequent stimulation of the cells with total bovine serum was used as a positive control to verify cell viability and efficient loading with calcium indicator. The minimal concentration required for complete inhibition of signaling was determined by consecutive 2-fold dilutions. Further validation of the minimal effective concentrations was performed by applying 10% incremental changes in antagonist concentration. Each test was performed in triplicate. U87 cell stably expressing CXCR4 or CCR5 were obtained from NIH AIDS Research and Reference Program (16Bjorndal A. Deng H. Jansson M. Fiore J.R. Colognesi C. Karlsson A. Albert J. Scarlatti G.

Cells were rinsed three times with medium and observed under the microscope using identical parameters for all concentrations. The images were stored on an optical disc and analyzed with Zeiss LSM software. A minimum of 10 images for each concentration were quantitated. The effects of various TM peptides on HIV-1 replication were determined with CEM-SS cells infected with HIV-1RF utilizing the XTT (2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide) cell assay as described previously (27Rice W.G. Bader J.P. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 33: 389-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The hypothesis for this research was that an externally added peptide corresponding to one of the putative transmembrane domains of a GPCR was able to disrupt the function of the receptor by interfering with the proper association of the TM domains. To test this hypothesis, we first synthesized peptides corresponding to all seven predicted transmembrane regions of CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) (17Loetscher M. Geiser T. O'Reilly T. Zwahlen R. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 232-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tested their ability to inhibit signaling through the receptor. In the antagonist nomenclature used throughout the paper, the first number after the receptor name refers to the transmembrane domain from which the peptide was derived, and the second number corresponds to the order in which the peptides were synthesized. Potential antagonist activity of the peptides was evaluated by measurement of the inhibition of ligand-induced intracellular Ca2+ release in cells stably expressing CXCR4; SDF-1α was used as a ligand at a concentration of 50 nm (K d = 6 nm). In the preliminary screen, peptides corresponding to the second and sixth TMs were found to abolish SDF-1α-induced signaling through CXCR4 receptor (Table I).Table IActivity of synthetic peptides corresponding to predicted transmembrane domains of CXCR4 in inhibition of SDF-1α-induced intracellular calcium releasePeptideConcentration required for complete inhibition of [Ca2+]i releaseCXCR4-1-5: DDIFLPTIYSIIFLTGIV-NH2>30 μmCXCR4-2-1: LLFVITLPFWAVDAVANWYFGN-OH 5 ± 1 μmCXCR4-3-1: KAVHVIYTVNLYSSVLILAFISL-NH2>50 μmCXCR4-4-1: KVYVGVWIPALLLTIPDFIF-OH>50 μmCXCR4-5-1: HIMVGLILPGIVILSCYCIII-NH2>50 μmCXCR4-6-1: VILILAFFACWLPYYIGISID-OH10 ± 1 μmCXCR4-7-1: ALAFFHCCLNPILYAFLGAK-NH2>100 μmChanges in intracellular concentration of Ca2+ were studied in Fura-2/AM-treated U87 cells stably expressing CXCR4.

The cells were stimulated by the addition of 50 nm SDF-1α in the presence of varying antagonists concentrations. To further understand the structural requirements for a successful antagonist, structure-activity studies were conducted on the peptides corresponding to the second TM domain of CXCR4 (TableII). The most potent antagonist thus far obtained, a 24-amino acid residue peptide CXCR4-2-2, completely blocked signal transduction at 0.2 μm. Terminal anionic residues appeared to be important for antagonist activity, as elimination of two C-terminal Asp residues (CXCR4-2-1) decreased antagonist potency more than 10-fold, and substitution of Asp residues with positively charged Lys residues (CXCR4-2-3) resulted in a 100-fold decrease in antagonist activity. It is assumed that the charge distribution provides for a proper orientation of the peptides during penetration into the cellular membrane (18Sato M. Hresko R. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The results obtained from structure-activity studies with TM2 were applied to other domains and allowed the identification of antagonists derived from all but the first, third, and fifth TM domains (Table III, Fig.2). Peptides derived from the first and the fifth domains imposed significant synthetic difficulties because of aggregation and turned out to be very poorly soluble. In the case of the peptides corresponding to the fourth and seventh TM domain, the positioning of the negatively charged residue at the intracellular terminus of the peptide instead of extracellular terminus or substitution of extracellular Asp with Lys residues abolished the antagonist activity, as had been observed with TM2.Table IIStructure-activity relationships in peptides derived from the second transmembrane domain of CXCR4: HLSVADLLFVITLPFWAVDAVANWYFGNFLCK (the predicted intramembrane portion is underlined)PeptideConcentration required for complete inhibition of [Ca2+]i releaseCXCR4-2-1: LLFVITLPFWAVDAVANWYFGN-OH5 ± 1 μmCXCR4-2-2: LLFVITLPFWAVDAVANWYFGNDD-OH0.2 ± 0.1 μmCXCR4-2-8: LLFVITLPFWAVDAVANWYFGNKK-OH20 ± 2 μmCXCR4-2-4: VITLPFWAVDAVANWYFGNKK-OH>50 μmCXCR4-2-5: LLFVITLPFWAVDAVANDD-OH10 ± 1 μmAcCXCR4-2-5: AcLLFVITLPFWAVDAVANDD-OH10 ± 1 μmCXCR4-2-6: LSVADLLFVITLPFWAVDAVANDD-OH20 ± 2 μmRhod-CXCR4-2: AcLLFVITLPFWAVDAVANWYFGNDDK(Rhod)D-OH8 ± 1 μmThe measurements were carried out in Fura-2/AM-treated U87 cell stably expressing CXCR4.

The antagonist potency of CXCR4–2-2 did not depend on the concentration of SDF-1α in a range between 50 and 300 nm. The activity of the compound was tested in U87 cells stably transfected with CXCR4, in HeLa cells that naturally express the receptor, and in HeLa cells stably expressing CXCR4 tagged with green fluorescent protein (25Tarasova N.I. Stauber R.H. Michejda C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15883-15886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). All tests produced basically the same results, suggesting that variations in the density of receptor molecules that are within the natural levels of receptor expression do not affect the potency of the antagonist. The specificity of the TM domain interaction was demonstrated by the fact that all peptides derived from CXCR4 appeared to be selective for that receptor and had no influence on signaling through CCR5, which is the other major chemokine receptor involved in HIV-1 entry. Similarly, a peptide derived from the second TM of CCR5, CCR5-2-1 (Table III) completely abolished agonist (RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed))-induced CCR5 signaling in U87 cells at 0.5 μm but had no effect on signaling of CXCR4. Interestingly, an equimolar mixture of two peptides CXCR4-6-1 and CXCR4-7-3 was an order of magnitude more potent than the most active of the two and completely inhibited signaling at 1 μmconcentration (Table III). Other pairs of peptides failed to show improved potency compared with single components, likely due to nonoptimal combinations and/or nonoptimal structures. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that the synergistic effect produced by a pair of TM derivatives may be a general phenomenon. Consequently, overcoming the entropy factor by linking two TM analogs may result in significantly increased affinity, and thus, appropriate pairs of TM analogs may produce very potent antagonists. To further generalize the approach, we have synthesized the peptides derived from the TMs of the rat CCKAR. CCKAR was selected for this study because the pharmacology, signaling, and trafficking characteristics of the receptor are well documented (19Wank S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G628-G646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although CCKAR belongs to the same rhodopsin family of GPCRs as CXCR4, its sequence is only 15% identical to that of CXCR4. The degree of identity in transmembrane parts is only 27%. None of CCKAR-derived peptides served as antagonists of chemokine receptors. The abilities of these TM domain peptide analogs to inhibit signaling through the receptor were compared with the ability to prevent agonist binding (Table IV). Inhibition of signaling was assessed by measurement of the ligand-induced intracellular calcium release in CHO cells stably transfected with rat CCKAR, following administration of the CCK-8 ligand (15Tarasova N.I. Stauber R.H. Choi J.K. Hudson E.A. Czerwinski G. Miller J.L. Pavlakis G.N. Michejda C.J. Wank S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14817-14824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) at 10 nmconcentration. Inhibition of ligand binding was measured via direct observation of binding of a fluorescently tagged agonist (RG-CCK-8) using quantitative confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Fig.3) (15Tarasova N.I. Stauber R.H. Choi J.K. Hudson E.A. Czerwinski G. Miller J.L. Pavlakis G.N. Michejda C.J. Wank S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14817-14824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Peptides derived from the first and the second TMs (CCKAR-1-1 and CCKAR-2-1, respectively (Fig. 4)) demonstrated comparable potencies in inhibition of ligand binding and signaling, whereas the peptide equivalent to the sixth TM domain, CCKAR-6-1, effectively inhibited signaling but only modestly affected binding of RG-CCK-8 to the cells. The effects of CCKAR-1-1 and CCKAR-2-1 on ligand binding are in agreement with mutational research, suggesting the direct involvement of TM1 and TM2 and the adjacent extracellular regions of GPCRs in agonist binding (21Silvente-Poirot S. Escrieut C. Wank S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly, the intracellular loop connecting TM5 and TM6 of GPCRs is implicated in signaling through interactions with intracellular G-proteins (22Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Thus, it was not unexpected that that the disturbance of receptor structure in the area adjoining TM6 (by CCKAR-6-1) interfered with signaling. However, the fact that the region adjacent to TM6 of CCKAR is less important for ligand binding could not be predicted, taking into consideration the allosteric nature of interactions within the receptor molecule.Table IVThe activity of CCKAR-derived TM peptides in the inhibition of CCK-8-induced intracellular calcium release and RG-CCK-8 bindingPeptideConcentration required for complete inhibition of signalingIC50 in inhibition of RG-CCK-8 bindingTested with 10 nm CCK-8Tested with 1 μm CCK-8CCKAR-1-1: DDEWQSALQILLYSIIFLLSVGNTLVITV50 ± 5 μm>100 μm20 ± 2 μmCCKAR-2-1: FLLSLAVSDLMLCLFCMPFNLP2 ± 0.5 μm>100 μm0.5 ± 0.12 μmCCKAR-4-1: VIAATWCLSFTIMTPYPIYSNLVPFTDD>50 μmND>50 μmCCKAR-5-1: DDQTFLLLILFLLPGIVMVVAYGL>50 μmND>50 μmCCKAR-6-1: IVVLFFLCWMPIFSANAWRAYDTVDD5 ± 1 μm5 ± 1 μm>50 μm10 nm sulfated CCK-8 was used to evoke calcium release in Fura-2/AM-treated CHO cells stably expressing CCKAR (B max = 1.75 ± 0.29 × 105CCKAR/cell) (15Tarasova N.I.

When the concentration of CCK-8 used to test antisignaling activity of the antagonists was increased from 10 nm to 1 μm, the potency of CCKAR-1-1 and CCKAR-2-1 was significantly reduced, and concentrations required to abolish signaling were found to be above the solubility limits of the peptides (100 μm) (Table IV). Thus the natural ligand, CCK-8, appeared to be able to compete out the binding of these two antagonists. However, the antisignaling potency of CCKAR-6–1 remained unchanged when the agonist concentration was increased 2 orders of magnitude. The major purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the ability of externally added molecules to compete for the interactions between TM domains of GPCRs. Implicit in this idea was that the GPCR structure, even in properly folded molecules, is flexible enough to be disrupted in this fashion. A similar approach was used to inhibit coupling of GPCRs to intracellular signaling molecules, adenylate cyclase, (23Anand-Srivastava M.B. Sehl P.D. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19324-19329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and G-proteins (24Merkouris M. Dragatsis I. Megaritis G. Konidakis G. Zioudrou C. Milligan G. Georgoussi Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 985-989PubMed Google Scholar) by peptides corresponding to the intracellular loops of the receptors. Those studies were conducted primarily to provide an understanding of molecular mechanisms of receptor function and could not be applied directly for drug design because of the difficulties in intracellular delivery of the inhibitors. The hydrophobic nature of the transmembrane peptides makes their penetrations into the cell membrane bilayer highly probable, and orientation inside the membrane can be controlled by the addition of charged residues to the extracellular termini. Because the TM2 peptides of CXCR4 were the most effective antagonists identified, we next evaluated the intracellular distribution of these peptides using a fluorescent derivative of CXCR4–2-2 that was prepared by attachment of a rhodamine B moiety to the extracellular terminus. Rhod-CXCR4-2 was 40 times less potent than the parent CXCR4–2-2 peptide (see Table II) but still was able to disrupt receptor function. Localization of the peptide was characterized by confocal laser-scanning microscopy using HeLa cells that stably express a green fluorescent protein-labeled CXCR4 (see Fig.5) (25Tarasova N.I. Stauber R.H. Michejda C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15883-15886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Rhod-CXCR4-2 was observed in the cellular membrane within minutes after application, and saturated endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum were observed within 15 min of incubation. These observations confirm the ability of the new TM domain analogs to insert spontaneously into the cellular membranes, thus enabling interactions with the receptor in all cellular compartments where the receptor molecules are present. After the fluorescent antagonist was removed from the incubation medium, it was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the endosomes for several hours. This observation suggests that the transmembrane peptides may be able to interact with newly synthesized receptor molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum and, thus, have prolonged inhibitory effects on the treated cells. It is unlikely however, that the endoplasmic reticulum is the only site of action of the inhibitory peptides, since it is clear from the present data that fully assembled receptor molecules in the plasma membrane are also disrupted. The evidence for this comes from the complete inhibition of signaling within seconds after addition of the peptides (see “Experimental Procedures”). The studies with CXCR4, CCR5, and CCKAR clearly demonstrate the ability of TM domain analogs of GPCRs to disrupt ligand binding and signaling through the receptor. However, our interest was to extend the observation to other biological functions of the receptors. CXCR4 and CCR5 are involved in the fusion of HIV-1 to host cells. Importantly, an indication that TM peptide analogs inhibit CXCR4-dependent functions might be applicable to drug design efforts. Given that CXCR4 represents one of the principal coreceptors for HIV-1 cell entry (reviewed in Ref. 26Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) and that the TM domain peptides of CXCR4 interfere with receptor functions, we tested TM peptide analogs (corresponding to TM domains 2, 4, 6, or 7) as possible inhibitors of HIV-1RF replication in a cell-based cytoprotection assay (27Rice W.G. Bader J.P. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 33: 389-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Table III, the most potent peptide, CXCR4-4-2, inhibited infection at concentrations below 1 μm(IC50 ≈ 300 nm) (see also Fig.6), whereas peptides CXCR4-2-2 and CXCR4-7-3 inhibited in the 2–3 μm range. None of CCKAR-derived peptides inhibited HIV-1 infection, and none of the peptides caused cell toxicity at concentrations of up to 100 μm (higher concentration could not be tested due to limitations of solubility). These data clearly establish that TM peptide analogs of CXCR4 can inhibit HIV-1 replication, and this approach may be applied to CCR5 and other chemokine receptors that participate in HIV-1 entry into host cells. We propose that the observed disruption of GPCR function by TM peptide analogs is due to competition of the peptides for interaction between intramembrane helices (Fig. 1). In the presence of an excess of the peptide the majority of receptor molecules will be inactive because the synthetic peptides occupying the place of the corresponding receptor domain lack the necessary extramembrane components. It should be noted that the antagonistic potency of the peptides may depend not only on the interaction with the target receptor but also on the efficiency of membrane insertion of externally added molecules. Thus, the poor activity of some peptides may be partially attributed to their weak ability to enter the plasma membrane. Indeed, different transmembrane domains of CCKAR were previously shown to have varying abilities to insert into membranes (28Bayle D. Weeks D. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19697-19707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The detailed characterization of the competence of different TM analogs to insert into the membranes and interact with each other in a specific manner as well as the participation of discrete residues of peptides to interact with receptor domains is ongoing in our laboratory. We suggest that information from these studies can be utilized to construct more efficient TM inhibitors. Screening of combinatorial libraries of peptides can also assist in selection of more potent antagonists. Peptidomimetics have been successfully applied for construction of analogs of helical peptides and, thus, can be used to obtain antagonists demonstrating enhanced pharmacokinetic properties (29Kieber-Emmons T.

In conclusion, we suggest that peptides, peptidomimetics, or even small molecules can be utilized as novel classes of antagonists to target the TM regions of GPCRs and disrupt receptor function. TM antagonists would not only be useful in the development of new drug candidates but would also facilitate the study of GPCR function and three-dimensional structures. In addition, effective antagonists might be designed based solely on amino acid sequences, and thus, the approach also should be useful for targeting orphan receptors. Finally, the TM-targeting approach need not be restricted to GPCR molecules but might also be applied to multimembrane-spanning proteins of other classes, since specific interactions between TM domains are vitally important for the functions of a diverse set of surface proteins.

Although the mechanism by which the conversion engenders a pathogenic event is unclear, there is increasing evidence to suggest that this may depend on the function of the prion protein in preventing oxidative damage. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the interrelationship between redox-sensitive cysteine, glycosylation, and prion metabolism. Cells were treated with a thioreductant, dithiothreitol, to assess the effect of the cellular oxidation state on the synthesis of the prion protein. This change in redox balance affected the glycosylation of the prion protein, resulting in the sole production of glycosylated forms. The role of the single disulfide bridge in mediating this effect within the prion protein was confirmed by mutating the cysteine residues involved in its formation. These data suggest that conditions that increase the rate of formation of the disulfide bridge favor formation of the unglycosylated prion protein. Thus, since the presence of glycans on the prion protein is protective against its pathogenic conversion, a change in the redox status of the cell would increase the risk of developing a prion disease by favoring the production of the unglycosylated form.

The normal function of PrPCremains unclear, although roles in synaptic function, regulation of circadian rhythms, and copper transport have been proposed. Supporting the latter function, the region between codons 50 and 91, comprising one nona- and four octapeptide repeats, specifically binds copper (4Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem.

One consequence of altered redox balance on proteins is to affect formation of disulfide bridges. In the latter instance, the proximity of the glycosylation sites to the disulfide bridge in PrPCled us to consider a possible interrelationship between the two. The prion protein is present at the cell surface as three species that differ in their degree of glycosylation. The unglycosylated (5%) and monoglycosylated (25%) isoforms of the prion protein are minor cell-surface components, whereas the diglycosylated form is dominant (70%) (2Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D.

In this study, we examined the effect of the cellular redox balance on the ratio of the three PrPC glycoforms. The importance of PrPC glycoforms in the development of prion pathology was suggested in scrapie and confirmed in the human disease (10Monari L. Chen S.G. Brown P. Parchi P. Petersen R.B. Mikol J.

The ratio between the glycoforms differs between PrPC and PrPSC, suggesting that glycosylation can modulate the conversion of PrPC into PrPSC as was observedin vitro (13Kocisko D.A. Come J.H.

We found that treating cells overexpressing PrPC with the reducing agent DTT results in the production of almost entirely diglycosylated PrPC that reaches the cell surface. In contrast, although elimination of the disulfide bridge by mutagenesis of a single cysteine residue also resulted in the exclusive synthesis of diglycosylated PrPC, the protein was retained in the ER. Removal of both cysteine residues resulted in diglycosylated PrPC that reached the cell surface, but failed to recycle. These findings demonstrate a relationship between PrPCprocessing and redox balance and suggest a mechanism whereby oxidative stress could play a role in prion disease pathogenesis. M-17 human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with the episomal vector CEP4β containing a prion coding sequence (3Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The inserted prion protein coding sequence, under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was either normal or mutated at cysteine 179 or 214 or both. We created mutant PrP using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (3Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with the primer 5′-GCACGACGCCGTTAATATC-3′ (Cys-to-Ala mutation at codon 179) or 5′-GAGCAGATGGCCATCACCCAG-3′ (Cys-to-Ala mutation at codon 214), where boldface indicates the mutant codon. The primers were used together to produce the double mutant. Transfected cells were grown as bulk selected hygromycin-resistant cultures in Opti-MEM with 5% calf serum supplement (iron-enriched; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 500 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). For each experiment, cells were removed from the flask with trypsin and counted, and identical numbers of cells (3.4 × 106 or 9 × 106) were seeded onto 6- or 10-cm plates, respectively, and grown overnight to ≈95% confluence. Cells were washed and then preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in methionine-deficient minimum Eagle's medium (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) to deplete the endogenous pool. For the DTT experiments, the plates were also preincubated for 5 min in methionine-deficient minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm DTT (Sigma). This concentration was empirically determined to minimize inhibition of protein synthesis. Cells were then pulsed for the appropriate time with 0.5 mCi of Tran35S-label (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.) with or without DTT in methionine-deficient minimum Eagle's medium. A 0–120-min chase in Opti-MEM, with or without DTT, followed. For the DTT-treated cells, 10 min before lysis, iodoacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 20 mm to prevent oxidation. Iodoacetic acid was also added to the lysis buffer. Cells were then washed once with Opti-MEM and incubated in Opti-MEM ± PI-PLC (59 ng/ml) for the last 30 min of the chase at 37 °C. The medium was collected, centrifuged at 290 × g for 10 min to remove any cells, and processed for immunoprecipitation. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed for immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 2100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cell debris. The prion protein was immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1%N-lauroylsarcosine, and fresh 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by rocking at 4 °C for 16 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads were used to collect the complexes. The beads were washed six times with ice-cold wash buffer (150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and 0.1%N-lauroylsarcosine with 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), suspended in sample buffer (6% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8), and boiled for 5 min.

Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated using 4 volumes of methanol. Protein pellets were treated with Endoglycosidase-H (100 units; New England Biolabs Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After a standard pulse-chase, the cells were lysed in 1% digitonin and immunoprecipitated with anti-PDI, anti-grp57, anti-calnexin, anti-calreticulin, anti-KDEL, or anti-grp94 antibody. Following protein A-agarose recovery of the immune complexes, the beads were washed three times with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and once with phosphate-buffered saline. The immune complexes were released by boiling in 2% SDS and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with the 3F4 antibody to recover PrP that was present in complexes with the chaperones. The protein A-Sepharose recovery of the PrP·3F4 complexes and washing of the beads were performed as described under “Pulse-Chase.” This protocol was also run in reverse, using the anti-PrP antibody first and the anti-chaperone antibodies second, to confirm the findings. Protein samples (whole cell lysates from ∼25,000 cells or double quantity for surface or secreted PrP) in sample buffer were separated on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore Corp.) for 2 h at 60 V. The membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and probed with the appropriate antibody. The immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on Kodak X-Omat film. Proteins were separated on 14% acrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide). The gels were treated as described previously (3Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), dried, and exposed to film. Films were analyzed by densitometry using a PDI 4200 scanner. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. DTT has been used to inhibit oxidation and folding of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (18Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Specifically, DTT has been used to inhibit the formation of disulfide bonds in newly synthesized proteins by altering the redox state of the cell (19Tatu U. Braakman I. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The single disulfide bridge in the prion protein surrounds the two sites of non-obligatoryN-glycosylation. The influence of the disulfide bridge on the glycosylation of PrPC was demonstrated by treating cells with the reducing agent DTT. In the first experiment (Fig.1 A), cells expressing PrPC were labeled in the presence or absence of DTT and chased for 0–120 min, followed by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody 3F4. Whereas untreated cells synthesized unglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and diglycosylated forms, only the fully modified, diglycosylated form was observed in DTT-treated cells (comparelanes 4 and 8; note that the band seen after treatment with DTT (lane 5) at time 0 comigrated with the unmodified diglycosylated form (lane 1) at time 0 in the control). When samples were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with or without β-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer, under reducingversus nonreducing conditions, the migration of the samples from the DTT-treated cells was unaltered, indicating that DTT treatment did in fact prevent disulfide bridge formation (data not shown). Thus, when cells were treated with DTT, both N-glycosylation sites were occupied, indicating that a redox change can alter core glycosylation of the prion protein. Although treatment with DTT has been reported to lead to protein retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (19Tatu U. Braakman I. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we found that PrPC reached the cell surface under this condition (Fig.1 B) and could be released by cleavage of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor with the cell-impermeant enzyme PI-PLC. Whereas all three glycoforms (unglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and diglycosylated) reached the cell surface in untreated cells, only the diglycosylated form was present at the cell surface after DTT treatment. From this experiment, we conclude that the change in redox state induced by DTT does not prevent prion protein transport to the cell surface. To further demonstrate that the effects of DTT on glycosylation were mediated by the disulfide bridge in PrPC, we specifically mutated the cysteine residues involved in the disulfide bridge using site-directed mutagenesis. The constructs used in this study employed alanine replacement of cysteine at residue 179 alone (C179A (−Cys1)), residue 214 alone (C214A (−Cys2)), or residues 179 and 214 together (C179A/C214A (−Cys1+2)) (Fig.2 A). The effect of these replacements was assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 B). Mutation of either or both cysteine residues to alanine resulted in a shift to the production of only diglycosylated PrPC. In all cases, substitution of the cysteine residues resulted in the synthesis of an unmodified diglycosylated isoform, which differs from the corresponding modified glycoform of the control (Fig.2 B). To assess the maturation of the glycans, we digested the mutant and control PrPC proteins with the enzyme Endoglycosidase-H, which cleaves only unmodified, high-mannose core glycans (20Thotakura N.R. Bahl O.P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and found that only the glycans of mutant PrP were released (Fig.3). The same result was obtained when we digested the C214A and C179A/C214A mutants (data not shown). Unmodified, high-mannose glycans are indicative of proteins retained in the pre-medial Golgi region, probably in the ER. Thus, whereas both DTT treatment and cysteine replacement resulted in almost exclusive production of diglycosylated PrPC, only treatment with DTT allowed transport to the cell surface, and mutation of each of the individual cysteine residues blocked transport of the mutant protein. Therefore, the substitution of cysteine with alanine not only blocks the formation of the disulfide bridge, but also results in the retention of PrP in the cell. To investigate whether mutant PrP was retained in complexes with the chaperones responsible for disulfide bridge formation or protein folding (21Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22Puig A. Lyles M.M. Noiva R. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19128-19135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed immunoprecipitated control and mutant PrP proteins under reducing or nonreducing conditions. The mutant lacking a single cysteine residue was involved in reduction-sensitive complexes, probably by virtue of the free cysteine (data not shown). However, this was not the sole retention mechanism since the addition of DTT during a pulse-chase experiment did not allow transport of mutant PrP to the cell surface (Fig. 4 A). We determined which chaperones were present in these complexes by employing two sets of double immunoprecipitation experiments. After pulse labeling cells followed by lysis in the presence of digitonin, we isolated chaperone-associated PrPC by immunoprecipitating with an anti-chaperone antibody (PDI, calnexin, calreticulin, BiP, or grp94) followed by immunoprecipitation with the 3F4 antibody (Fig.4 B). An experiment was also carried out in which the anti-chaperone and 3F4 antibodies were reversed in order (data not shown). Immediately after a 10-min labeling period, we detected interaction of control PrPC with all the chaperones tested (Fig. 4 B). At this time point, only immature forms of PrPC were present. After a 2-h chase, however, these interactions were no longer detectable (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that there is brief, transient interaction between PrPC and the major chaperones involved in ER folding and assembly. Thus, the naturally occurring prion protein appears to be processed in the conventional secretory pathway and is dependent on the known chaperones to achieve a properly folded state. However, with mutant PrP and the same battery of antibodies, it was apparent that C179A mutant PrP was principally retained in complexes with PDI and calnexin, both at the initial time point and after the 2-h chase (Fig.4 B). In contrast, the double mutant (C179A/C214A) demonstrated a stable interaction principally with grp94(Fig. 4 B). Since the two mutant proteins were retained by different systems, we next investigated whether the two systems were equally efficient. The half-life of the double mutant appears to be shorter than those of both the control and the single mutant. After a 90-min chase, the double mutant appeared to be present in a smaller amount (27.2 ± 6.8%) than the single mutant (76 ± 5.3%) (Fig.5). However, a significant fraction of C179A/C214A reached the cell surface or was secreted. In both locations, diglycosylated PrP was the major form present, as in the DTT experiment, confirming that the lack of the disulfide bridge leads to virtually complete occupancy of the two sites of glycosylation in PrP. We examined whether the normal metabolism of the protein is maintained in the absence of the disulfide bridge since this post-translational modification has been highly conserved through evolution and PrP does not require the disulfide bridge to reach the cell surface, as demonstrated by the DTT experiment. After PrP is synthesized and transported to the cell surface, it reenters the cell via the endocytic pathway. At 60-min intervals, the protein is internalized into an endocytic compartment and then returned to the cell surface (23Shyng S.L. Huber M.T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15922-15928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During each passage, ∼5% of the protein is cleaved at position 112, yielding an 18-kDa fragment (24Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), which then returns to the cell surface. As demonstrated above, the C179A/C214A mutant reached the cell surface. We wondered whether the mutant protein is recycled after reaching the surface. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether the mutant protein was able to produce the truncated 18-kDa fragment. The 18-kDa fragment was not detectable in cells after a 2-h chase (Fig.6 A) or at steady state on an immunoblot (Fig. 6 B), indicating that this mutant is not recycled like normal PrP. Although we did not see any extra or different fragments, an alternative explanation of this finding is that the mutation could result in altered cleavage of PrP or in recycling without cleavage. PrP is oxidized, folded, and modified by the non-obligatory addition of two N-linked glycans located within the span of the single disulfide bridge in the ER (2Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D. Buchmeier M.J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These co/post-translational modifications are highly regulated, such that the sequences flanking the two cysteine residues, the distance between these two residues, and the position of the N-glycosylation sites relative to the two cysteine residues involved in the disulfide bond are evolutionarily conserved from mouse to man. PrP is transported through the secretory pathway and ultimately anchored to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (25Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8879-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). PrP is present at the cell surface as three species that differ in their degree of glycosylation. The unglycosylated (5%) and monoglycosylated (25%) isoforms of the prion protein are minor cell-surface components, whereas the diglycosylated form is dominant (70%) (2Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D. Buchmeier M.J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Glycosylation of proteins facilitates their folding by providing solubility-enhancing polar surface groups that prevent aggregation of folding intermediates as well as by enhancing interactions with ER enzymes and chaperones (26Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 27Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The two N-linked glycosylation sites in PrP have been preserved through ∼150 million years of evolution, and although the three glycoforms of PrPC are synthesized in essentially equal quantities in pulse-chase experiments (see Fig. 1, lane 1), the unglycosylated isoform accounts for only 5% of cell-surface PrPC. This suggests that the regulated glycosylation of PrP has biological significance. Although not unprecedented, it is unusual for a glycoprotein to be expressed as multiple glycoforms. In this study, we found that the disulfide bridge, a second highly conserved element of PrPC, regulates the degree of core glycosylation and therefore the creation of multiple glycoforms. When disulfide bridge formation is blocked by the addition of DTT or by mutating the cysteine residues, PrP becomes completely diglycosylated. Since the addition of the core glycans and the formation of the disulfide bridge are believed to occur simultaneously, the multiple glycoforms of PrP must result from these two competitive processes. Why is the disulfide bridge conserved? Transport of PrPC to the cell surface is not inhibited by lack of the disulfide bridge caused by DTT treatment, in contrast to other proteins (28Allen S. Naim H.Y. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4797-4804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The transport of PrP in the presence of DTT and when both cysteine residues are mutated suggests that the disulfide bridge is not required for the prion protein to pass through the quality control check points. Other proteins, such as chromogranin B, which also contains a single disulfide bridge, are transported through the secretory pathway in the presence of DTT, although mis-sorting may occur (29Krömer A. Glombik M.M. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Glombik M.M. Krömer A. Salm T. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The importance of the disulfide bridge in prion disease is underlined by the finding that the disulfide bridge is required for the conversion of PrPC to PrPSC (31Herrmann L.M. Caughey B. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2457-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Another study suggested that the disulfide bridge might feature in the conversion of the α-helical form to the β-sheeted form of the prion protein (32Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). What then is the role of the disulfide bridge under physiological conditions? Our results suggest that the normal metabolism, not only glycosylation but also recycling of PrPC, could be dependent on the presence of the disulfide bridge. Although the lack of the disulfide bridge caused by the addition of DTT did not have an effect on PrPC transport to the cell surface, PrP with a single cysteine was entirely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. This observation is consistent with the effect of free thiols in ER retention (33Isidoro C. Maggioni C. Demoz M. Pizzagalli A. Fra A.M. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26138-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that retention of mutant PrP is mediated through the formation of stable complexes with the ER resident chaperones PDI and calnexin. The retention by a thiol-mediated mechanism, as shown for our single cysteine mutants, is associated with a long half-life of mutant PrP and could cause accumulation of mutant PrP in the ER. Different retention mechanisms, as shown for our double mutant, conferring a shorter half-life to the protein would preclude this accumulation. Independent deletions of two α-helices in PrPC, which coincidentally cause the deletion of a single cysteine residue, have been made in transgenic mice. These mutations resulted in accumulation of mutant PrP and the early death of the animals overexpressing the protein (34Muramoto T. DeArmond S.J. Scott M. Telling G.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our data suggest a mechanism in which the accumulation of mutant PrP is the result of retention in the ER mediated by the exposed thiol group rather than by deletion of the α-helices. In contrast, the pathogenic threonine-to-alanine mutation at residue 183 (35Nitrini R. Rosemberg S. Passos-Bueno M.R. da Silva L.S. Lughetti P. Papadopoulos M. Carrilho P.M. Caramelli P. Albrecht S. Zatz M. LeBlanc A. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which causes destabilization of mutant PrP (36Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), also results in retention in the ER, but not in a storage disease either in an animal model (37DeArmond S.J. Sanchez H. Yehiely F. Qiu Y. Ninchak-Casey A. Daggett V. Camerino A.P. Cayetano J. Rogers M. Groth D. Torchia M. Tremblay P. Scott M.R. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B.

Papadopoulos M. Carrilho P.M. Caramelli P. Albrecht S. Zatz M. LeBlanc A. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The present findings also provide a mechanism whereby the redox balance in a cell can affect the risk of developing a prion disease. The redox state of the cell can modify the rate of disulfide bridge formation, which in turn regulates core glycosylation of the prion protein. Disulfide bond formation in the prion protein has an inverse relationship with the addition of core glycans. Thus, under oxidizing conditions, the rate of disulfide bond formation would be increased, which would in turn favor the synthesis of unglycosylated PrP. The unglycosylated isoform converts more readily to a pathogenic form in a cell-free system (13Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the human disease, there is preliminary evidence that unglycosylated PrP is more represented in brain regions with the lowest amount of PrPSC accumulation and no pathology, which is thought to mirror the earliest stages of the disease process, suggesting that this is the first isoform to convert. 2S. Capellari, unpublished data. Moreover, PrP lacking one or both of the glycosylation sites is more insoluble and has increased resistance to protease digestion (38Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21479-21487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, the available evidence suggests that the unglycosylated form is the most pathogenic. Although the pathogenic transformation of PrPC to PrPSC is individually deleterious, it is a rare event, whereas the beneficial effect of a shift to the synthesis of unglycosylated PrP may be critical to cell survival. Furthermore, we cannot know whether the PrPC glycoforms have different properties that make the unglycosylated form beneficial under some conditions. For example, different glycoforms of a protein may be targeted to different cellular locations. In transgenic mice expressing PrPC where one or both of the glycosylation sites were destroyed, PrP within the central nervous system was distributed in aberrant neuroanatomic topologies (37DeArmond S.J. Sanchez H. Yehiely F. Qiu Y. Ninchak-Casey A. Daggett V. Camerino A.P. Cayetano J. Rogers M. Groth D. Torchia M. Tremblay P. Scott M.R. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1337-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Since one of the proposed functions of the prion protein is protection from oxidative stress (7Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1997; 15: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it is intriguing that redox state changes can affect the processing of PrPC. Perhaps the change in the glycoform ratio reflects a direct response by the cell to differing oxidative/reductive challenges and offers protection from those stresses. Until the role of the prion protein in the cell is elucidated, questions such as these will remain unanswered."

Promoter activity assays performed with a series of deletion mutants revealed that the promoter region from −149 to −2 (+1 = transcription start site) confers full-length promoter activity in response to forskolin (10 μm). Four consensus cis-elements were identified within this region, including an E-box, ATF/CRE, C/EBP, and AP2 site. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the E-box was required for PGHS-2 promoter activity, that disruption of the C/EBP element decreased forskolin inducible activity by 29%, whereas point mutation within the ATF/CRE and AP2 element had no inhibitory effect. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) performed with the −149/−2 fragment and granulosa cell nuclear extracts obtained before (0 h) and after (18 and 20 h) human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) revealed the regulation of multiple DNA-protein complexes. The 0-h extract generated four complexes at the E-box, whereas only one complex was produced at this site with the 18-h extract. Supershift EMSAs identified that upstream stimulatory factor-1 and -2 (USF-1 and -2) were part of these complexes. Interestingly, the presence of the amino-terminal truncated USF-2, which lacks the transcription activation domain, was detected in the 0-h extract, but not in extracts prepared post-hCG. Supershift EMSAs also indicated high levels of C/EBPβ binding to its cis-element in the 0-h extract, which contrasts with results previously reported in rats. Thus, high levels of amino-terminal truncated USF-2 and C/EBPβ in bovine granulosa cells prior to hCG treatment could repress gene expression, and be involved in the delayed induction of PGHS-2 in species with a long ovulatory process.

The enzyme carries two sequential catalytic functions, a cyclooxygenase reaction responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2, and a peroxidase reaction involved in the conversion of PGG2 to PGH2 (1Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar). PGH2 is the common precursor for the synthesis of all prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes (1Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar,4Smith W. DeWitt D. Semin. Nephrol. 1995; 15: 179-194PubMed Google Scholar). Two isoforms of PGHS have been characterized. The first isoform, designated PGHS-1 or COX-1, was isolated more than 20 years ago from ovine and bovine seminal vesicles (5Miyamoto T. Ogino N. Yamamoto S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

Chipman J.G. Robertson D.L. Erikson R.L. Simmons D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar, 9Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W.

The two isoforms share similarities at the protein level: they are approximately the same size (600–604 amino acids) and have conserved structural and functional domains. However, they are derived from separate genes encoding different size mRNAs (11Xie W. Merrill J.R. Bradshaw W.S. Simmons D.L. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1994; 221: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the two isoforms differ markedly in their expression and regulation. PGHS-1 is present in a variety of tissues and is often referred to as the constitutive isoform (3Williams C.S. DuBois R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G393-G400PubMed Google Scholar, 14DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Smith W.L. Am. J. Med. 1993; 95: 40S-44SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast, PGHS-2 is undetectable in most tissues but can be induced by several agonists, and is generally referred to as the inducible form (3Williams C.S. DuBois R.N. Am. J.

The obligatory role of PGHS-2 expression during the ovulatory process was highlighted in female PGHS-2-deficient mice, which proved to be infertile because of ovulation failure and other impaired reproductive processes (25Lim H.

Interestingly, comparative studies using human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to induce ovulation identified a marked difference in the time course of PGHS-2 induction in species with a short versus a long ovulatory process (20Sirois J.

In rats, a species with a short ovulatory process (12–14 h post-hCG), PGHS-2 induction is very rapid and occurs within 2–4 h post-hCG (20Sirois J. Simmons D. Richards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11586-11592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, induction of PGHS-2 in species with a long ovulatory process like cows (28 h post-hCG) and mares (39–42 h post-hCG) is remarkably delayed and occurs only at 18- and 30 h post-hCG, respectively (21Sirois J.

This marked difference among species in the control ofPGHS-2 gene expression could be involved in the control of the mammalian ovulatory clock (27Richards J.S.

Thus far, regulation of the PGHS-2 promoter in granulosa cells has been studied only in rats (29Sirois J. Levy L. Simmons D.L. Richards J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21931-21938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion mutant analyses have revealed that the proximal region of the promoter plays a central role in cAMP-dependent regulation (29Sirois J. Levy L. Simmons D.L. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12199-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis has shown that an E-box is essential for PGHS-2 promoter activity in rat granulosa cells, and that the upstream stimulatory factor (USF) is binding to this element (34Morris J.K. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16633-16643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, regulation of USF proteins has not been observed in response to hCG, leaving the mechanisms of gonadotropin-dependenttrans-activation unclear.Although progress has been achieved on our understanding of the rapid activation of PGHS-2 gene expression in rat granulosa cells, there has been no attempt to unravel the molecular basis for the delayed induction of PGHS-2 in species with a long ovulatory process. Such studies are important as they will likely be relevant to humans, a species with a long ovulatory process (36 h post-hCG) (40Yen S.S.C. Jaffe J.B. Yen S.C.C. Jaffe J.B. Reproductive Endocrinology. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 200-236Google Scholar). Therefore, the general objective of the present study was to develop a model to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the delayed induction of PGHS-2 in species with a long ovulatory process. The specific objectives were to clone and characterize the bovine PGHS-2gene and promoter, to study the regulation of PGHS-2 in primary cultures of bovine granulosa cells, and to characterize the hormonal control of the bovine PGHS-2 promoter in vitro.DISCUSSIONThis study is the first to focus on the molecular mechanisms involved in the delayed induction of PGHS-2 in granulosa cells of a species with a long ovulatory process. Previous investigations have identified a marked difference in the time course of follicular PGHS-2 induction in species with a short versus a long ovulatory process, ranging from 2 to 4 h in rats (20Sirois J.

Interestingly, this gradual delay in PGHS-2 induction in species with longer ovulatory processes was proposed as a determinant of the mammalian ovulatory clock (27Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4047-4048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, the remarkable variation in the control of PGHS-2 induction across species is intriguing, considering that it involves the same cell type (granulosa cells) and the same agonist (hCG). The present model in vitro appears to parallel the pattern of PGHS-2 induction observed in vivo (21Sirois J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Liu J. Carriere P. Dore M. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), as levels of PGHS-2 mRNA and protein became maximal only at 24 h post-hCG. This is in sharp contrast with studies in rats which showed that maximal induction occurs 5–7 h post-hCG (20Sirois J. Simmons D. Richards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11586-11592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Hedin L. Gaddy-Kurten D. Kurten R. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, maximal reporter gene activity in bovine granulosa cells with −1574/−2PGHS.LUC was observed after 24–36 h of forskolin. In contrast, comparable studies in rats indicated that maximal PGHS-2 promoter activity was induced after 6 h of forskolin stimulation (29Sirois J. Levy L. Simmons D.L. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12199-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of PGHS-2 in the bovine model was paralleled by an increase in prostaglandin synthesis, as evidenced by the rise in PGE2. We predict that PGF2α is also increased by forskolin in bovine granulosa cell cultures, since the induction of PGHS-2 in vivo has been associated with a significant increase in PGE2 and PGF2α (21Sirois J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Liu J. Carriere P. Dore M. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 47Liu J. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the delayed induction of PGHS-2 in bovine granulosa cellsin vitro provides a valuable model to study the regulation of PGHS-2 gene expression in species with a long ovulatory process.Distinct cis-acting promoter elements and/ortrans-activating factors were considered as potential regulators of delayed PGHS-2 induction in this species. Deletion analysis of the bovine PGHS-2 promoter revealed that, as observed in rats (29Sirois J. Levy L. Simmons D.L. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12199-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a proximal region of the promoter was sufficient to confer basal and forskolin inducible activities, suggesting that the same region is involved in both species. The proximal regions of the bovine and rat PGHS-2 promoters are relatively conserved (63% identity in nucleotide sequence), and contain four putativecis-elements, including an AP2, C/EBP, ATF/CRE, and E-box. Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that the E-box was essential for full promoter activity in bovine granulosa cells. Mutation of the C/EBP element resulted in a moderate reduction (29%) in forskolin induced activity, whereas mutation of ATF/CRE and AP2 elements had no inhibitory effect. The central role played by the E-box in the bovine system is in keeping with findings in rats (34Morris J.K. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16633-16643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, results of promoter activity assays did not provide evident clues on potential mechanisms responsible for the marked difference in the time course of PGHS-2 induction between species.One important finding of this study is the regulation of multiple complexes involving USF proteins and the E-box. USF-1 (43 kDa) and USF-2 (44 kDa) are ubiquitous proteins that belong to the Myc family of transcription factors (49Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 50Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). They are characterized by highly conserved basic helix loop helix and leucine zipper domains which are responsible for dimerization and DNA binding. USF proteins interact with DNA as homodimers and heterodimers, and are known to affect the expression of various genes (51Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Casado M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21944-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 52Ghosh A.K. Datta P.K. Jacob S.T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 53Sirito M. Lin Q. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3758-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that overexpression of USF-1 and USF-2 homodimers acts as repressor of ribosomal RNA gene transcription, whereas overexpression of USF-1/USF-2 heterodimers acts as activator, suggesting that the relative amount of each form of dimers could play a key role in gene expression (52Ghosh A.K. Datta P.K. Jacob S.T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, an amino terminus truncated form of USF (also called mini-USF) has been reported (50Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Mini-USFs (18 kDa) lack the transcription activation domain but have the dimerization and DNA-binding domains, and would function as a dominant negative mutant (50Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Expression of amino-truncated USF was used to demonstrate the role of the transcription factor in the regulation of the L-type pyruvate kinase promoter (54Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2640-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), but the natural occurrence of mini-USF has remained elusive. The present study identifies a physiological event during which putative mini-USF-2 could serve as repressor of gene expression. Supershift EMSAs and immunoblot analyses provided complementary evidence for the presence of amino terminus truncated USF in granulosa cells isolated prior to hCG (0 h), and their disappearance after hCG treatment. Thus, removal of repressive mini-USF could serve as an initial step in delayed PGHS-2 induction in species with a long ovulatory process. These results contrast with those in rats where, although granulosa cell extracts were shown to contain USF proteins binding to the E-box, there was no evidence of mini-USF (34Morris J.K. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16633-16643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, hCG had no effect on protein complexes binding to the E-box, and on levels of USF proteins in rats (34Morris J.K. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16633-16643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, major differences exist in the nature and regulation of protein/DNA binding activities at the E-box between species with a rapid versus delayed induction of PGHS-2, and the putative repressor role of mini-USF in species with a delayed PGHS-2 induction is attractive and will require further studies.Another important difference between the two species involves the distinct regulation of C/EBPβ in preovulatory follicles. High levels of C/EBPβ protein were present in bovine granulosa cells at 0 h post-hCG, and gonadotropin treatment was associated with a slight decrease in C/EBPβ. In contrast, a previous study showed that there is no C/EBPβ in rat granulosa cells prior to hCG (0 h post-hCG), but there is a rapid induction of its mRNA and protein after gonadotropin treatment (39Sirois J. Richards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21931-21938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of C/EBPβ in the regulation of the PGHS-2 promoter in granulosa cells remains unclear. In rats, recent site-directed mutagenesis experiments performed in the context of the full proximal PGHS-2 promoter revealed that the C/EBP element was not required for promoter activation in granulosa cells (34Morris J.K. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16633-16643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This result is supported by the fact that the gonadotropin-dependent induction of PGHS-2 in granulosa cells is not compromised in C/EBPβ-deficient mice (55Sterneck E. Tessarollo L. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2153-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). However, there was no down-regulation of PGHS-2 mRNA subsequent to induction by luteinizing hormone/hCG in C/EPBβ null mice, prompting the authors to speculate that C/EBPβ induction in rodents is involved in the repression of PGHS-2 expression in normal animals (55Sterneck E. Tessarollo L. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2153-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Overexpression of C/EBPβ in vascular endothelial cells was shown to suppress PGHS-2 promoter activity (35Inoue H. Tanabe T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 407: 139-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the relatively high levels of C/EBPβ in nuclear extracts of bovine granulosa cells prior to gonadotropin could serve to repress promoter activation in species with a delayed PGHS-2 induction. Also, the presence of high levels of putative amino-terminal truncated C/EBPβ (20 kDa; also called LIP for liver enriched inhibitor protein (56Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar)) prior to hCG could be of functional significance. Liver-enriched inhibitor protein, which contains the dimerization and DNA-binding domains but lacks the amino-terminal activation domain, acts as a transcriptional repressor (56Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). A transient decrease in full-length and amino-terminal truncated C/EBPβ levels after gonadotropin treatment could allow activation of gene transcription through the recruitment of additional factors.Lastly, this study characterizes the primary structure of the bovinePGHS-2 gene. The intron/exon organization of the bovinePGHS-2 gene is very similar to that of the human (13Kosaka T. Miyata A. Ihara H. Hara S. Sugimoto T. Takeda O. Takahashi E. Tanabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), mouse (28Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and equine genes (26Boerboom D. Sirois J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The overall size of the bovine gene compares with that of other species, and the length of internal exons 2–9 and of the coding region of exons 1 and 10 are identical among bovine, murine, human, and equine PGHS-2 (13Kosaka T.

https://openalex.org/W2009145423,"Abstract The influence of mRNA localization on metallothionein-1 protein distribution was studied by immunocytochemistry. We used Chinese hamster ovary cells that had been transfected with either a native metallothionein-1 gene construct or metallothionein-1 5′-untranslated region and coding sequences linked to the 3′-untranslated region from glutathione peroxidase. The change in the 3′-untranslated region caused the delocalization of the mRNA with a loss of the perinuclear localization and association with the cytoskeleton. Clones were selected which expressed similar levels of metallothionein-1 protein, as assessed by radioimmunoassay. The results showed that loss of metallothionein-1 mRNA localization was associated with a loss of metallothionein-1 protein localization, most notably with a lack of metallothionein-1 protein in the nucleus of synchronized cells which were beginning to synthesize DNA. This indicates that the association of metallothionein-1 mRNA with the cytoskeleton around the nucleus is essential for efficient shuttling of the protein into the nucleus during the G1 to S phase transition. This is the first demonstration of a physiological role for perinuclear mRNA localization and we propose that such localization may be important for a wide range of nuclear proteins, including those that shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm in a cell cycle dependent manner."

This sugar moiety linked to carbohydrate chains of glycolipids and glycoproteins plays a key role in many important biological events mediated by carbohydrate-protein interactions (1Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar). Sialic acids are also found in linear homopolymers (polysialic acid) ofN-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc)1 andN-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) joined by α2,8-, α2,9-, or α2,8/α2,9-ketosidic linkages (2Troy F.A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The degree of polymerization can extend beyond 200 sialic acid residues (3Rohr T.E. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2332-2342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby constituting a structurally unique group of carbohydrate polymers which covalently modify cell-surface glycoconjugates (4Troy F.A. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1990; 2: 430-449Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Polysialylation of the mammalian neural cell adhesion molecules, for example, affects the cell-cell adhesive interactions during embryogenesis, including neurite fasciculation and neuromuscular interactions (5Edelman G.M.

Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) displays a homopolymer of -9-NeuAcα2- linkages. On the other hand, the polysialic acid capsular antigens of neuroinvasiveE. coli K92 are composed of poly(-8NeuAcα2,9NeuAcα2-) residues (10Egan W. Liu T.-Y. Dorow D. Cohen J.S. Robbins J.D. Gotschlich E.C. Robbins J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3687-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Alternating linkages of α2,8NeuAc- and α2,9NeuAc- could not be found in mammalian systems, and therefore could be utilized to elicit immunological response. In fact, the heteropolymer from K92 strain of E. coli is being imployed as a carbohydrate vaccine in the clinical trial of patients suffering from acute meningitidis (11Devi S.J. Robbins J.B. Schneerson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7175-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The sialyltransferases that catalyze the addition of sialic acid to form such diverse carbohydrate recognition molecules fall into at least two families. While 13 clones have been obtained from mammalian systems (12Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), only 4 have been cloned from bacterial systems to date (13Weisgerber C. Hansen A. Frosch M. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Vimr E.R. Bergstrom R. Steenbergen S.M. Boulnois G. Roberts I. J.

Recent cloning of both mammalian and bacterial sialyltransferases showed that these two gene families evolved differently. The polysialyltransferase encoded by neuS in E. coliuses CMP-sialic acid as a donor and catalyzes a sequential addition of sialic acid to the nonreducing end of an acceptor (3Rohr T.E. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2332-2342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kundig F.D. Aminoff D. Roseman S. J. Biol.

In a detailed study using the pathogenic strain of E. coli K1, the gene coding for CMP-Neu5Ac:poly-α2,8-sialosyl sialyltransferase, termed neuS, has been cloned. This gene was found to be clustered in the kps region which is implicated in the initiation, polymerization, and possibly translocation of polysialic acid chains across the inner membrane (13Weisgerber C. Hansen A. Frosch M. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Weisgerber C. Troy F.A. J. Biol.

A similar gene has been identified by hybridization to the K92 strain of E. coli, the capsule of which contains poly(-8NeuAcα2,9NeuAcα2-) (10Egan W. Liu T.-Y. Dorow D. Cohen J.S. Robbins J.D. Gotschlich E.C. Robbins J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3687-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The complete nucleotide sequence of this K92 neuS gene showed that this gene product differs by 70 amino acids from the K1neuS gene product (14Vimr E.R. Bergstrom R. Steenbergen S.M. Boulnois G. Roberts I. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5127-5131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although an in vitrostudy indicated that the neuS from E. coli K1 coding for a 47-kDa protein has polysialyltransferase activity, no such activity has yet been clearly demonstrated for the neuSproduct from E. coli K92. In this study, we have cloned theneuS gene from the K92 strain of E. coli by PCR using the primers described previously (14Vimr E.R. Bergstrom R. Steenbergen S.M. Boulnois G. Roberts I. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5127-5131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expressed the gene in E. coli, and shown that the enzyme from this gene catalyzes the synthesis of polysialic acids with both α2,8- and α2,9-linkages in vitro and in vivo.DISCUSSIONWhile sialic acid is ubiquitous in eukaryotes, particularly in mammals (12Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not detected in prokaryotes other than some pathogenic bacteria. These include some E. coli strains, some N. meningitidis strains and bacteria of the O serotype including Salmonella (35Barry G.T. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1965; 47: 529-533.34PubMed Google Scholar, 36Barry G.T. Abbot V. Tsai T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1962; 29: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Glode M.P. Robbins J.B. Liu T-Y. Gotschlich E.C. Orskov I. Orskov F. J. Infect. Dis. 1977; 135: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the presence of polysialyltransferase activity in E. coli was reported earlier by Roseman et al. (17Kundig F.D. Aminoff D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2543-2550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the nature of the gene and its product was not clearly demonstrated until recently. The clonedneuS gene from K1 showed that its product has similar size but no sequence homology to any of the mammalian sialyltransferases. Expression of the K1 neuS gene indicates that this 47-kDa protein synthesizes polysialic acid in vitro (13Weisgerber C. Hansen A. Frosch M. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A similar gene was cloned from the K92 strain of E. coli, the capsule of which was shown to contain heteropolysialic acid (-8NeuAcα2, 9NeuAcα2-) (10Egan W. Liu T.-Y. Dorow D. Cohen J.S. Robbins J.D. Gotschlich E.C. Robbins J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3687-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This gene product differs by 70 amino acids when compared with that of the neuS gene product of the K1 strain (14Vimr E.R. Bergstrom R. Steenbergen S.M. Boulnois G. Roberts I. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5127-5131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the observed amino acid replacements, 36 were conservative. On the basis of such homology, it was postulated that the K92 gene evolved from neuS of K1 (14Vimr E.R. Bergstrom R. Steenbergen S.M. Boulnois G. Roberts I. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5127-5131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By complementation assay, the K92neuS gene was shown by this group (23Steenbergen S.M. Wrona T.J. Vimr E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to express polysialyltransferase activity yielding a product that was recognized by meningitidis C antiserum in vivo, suggesting that this gene might produce sialoside with alternating α2,8/2,9-polysialyl linkages. However, because meningitidis C antiserum interacts with both homopolysialic acid (-9-NeuAcα2-) from N. meningitidisGroup C and heteropolysialic acid (-8Neu Acα2,9NeuAcα2-) from the K92 strain of E. coli (38Pelkonen S. Curr. Microbiol. 1990; 2 1: 23-28Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), structural identification of the cell-free reaction product(s) was warranted. Previously, the expression of the K92 neuS gene was not clearly demonstrated, nor was it shown that this gene product catalyzes the synthesis of heteropolysialic acid (-8NeuAcα2,9NeuAcα2-) in vitro.The polysialyltransferase encoded by neuS in E. coli uses CMP-sialic acid as a donor and catalyzes sequential sialylation at the 9-position of the nonreducing end of appropriate acceptors. Using K1 neuS, the polymerase activity was detected in vitro with sialyloligomers (designated colominic acid) or with certain gangliosides, such as GD3 (13Weisgerber C. Hansen A. Frosch M. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as substrates. However, it was shown previously that this gene product could not initiate de novo polysialic acid synthesis (23Steenbergen S.M. Wrona T.J. Vimr E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a requirement for an as yet undefined in vivoprimer. This primer, or polymerization initiator, does not appear to be colominic acid, since this polymer was neither elongated efficientlyin vitro (18Steenbergen S.M. Vimr E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) nor the elongated product detected in vivo (39Clementz T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9687-9696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using K92 neuS, we have found that colominic acid is not an acceptor. In fact, among the acceptors tested, only sialic acid and certain gangliosides were found to be good acceptors. The real substrate specificity, however, remains to be investigated using the purified enzyme.In conclusion, this report describes for the first time that theneuS gene product from E. coli K92 exhibits α2,8/2,9-polysialyltransferase activity both in vitro andin vivo. Apparently a single polypeptide (as judged by the Western blot) for this polysialyltransferase catalyzes the synthesis of polysialic acid with alternating α2,9- and α2,8-linkages. Previously, bacterial KDO-transferase was shown to possess such dual linkage specificity (40Lee Y-L. Chen J.C. Shaw J-F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, enzymes capable of forming multiple different linkages may not be uncommon in nature. A recent report on the study of a crude preparation of polysialyltransferase from K92 indicates that the enzyme recognizes an α2,8-glycosidic linkage of sialic acid at the nonreducing end (41Chao C.-F. Chuang H.-C. Chiou S.-T. Liu T.-Y J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18206-18212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), consistent with our finding. It also indicates that the α2,9-linked homopolysialic acid or the α2,8/α2,9-linked heteropolymer of sialic acid with α2,9-linkage at the nonreducing end is not acceptable (41Chao C.-F. Chuang H.-C. Chiou S.-T. Liu T.-Y J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18206-18212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the enzyme may catalyze the sequential transfer of a preformed α2,8-linked dimer to the 9-position of the acceptor, a novel mechanism which remains to be proven. Work is in progress to purify the enzyme and to define the substrate specificity and mechanism. The 9-carbon 5-amino-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galactononulosonic acids or sialic acids, comprise a family of neuraminic acid derivatives which are widely spread in nature, ranging from bacterial to human origin. This sugar moiety linked to carbohydrate chains of glycolipids and glycoproteins plays a key role in many important biological events mediated by carbohydrate-protein interactions (1Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar). Sialic acids are also found in linear homopolymers (polysialic acid) ofN-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc)1 andN-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) joined by α2,8-, α2,9-, or α2,8/α2,9-ketosidic linkages (2Troy F.A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The degree of polymerization can extend beyond 200 sialic acid residues (3Rohr T.E. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2332-2342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby constituting a structurally unique group of carbohydrate polymers which covalently modify cell-surface glycoconjugates (4Troy F.A. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1990; 2: 430-449Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Polysialylation of the mammalian neural cell adhesion molecules, for example, affects the cell-cell adhesive interactions during embryogenesis, including neurite fasciculation and neuromuscular interactions (5Edelman G.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 877-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J. Murray B.A. Prediger E.A. Brackenbury R. Edelman G.M. Science. 1987; 236: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). While the neuroinvasive bacteria Escherichia coli K1 contain a homopolymer of -8-NeuAcα2- (7Troy F.A. McCloskey M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7377-7387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Neisseria meningitidisGroup C (8Liu T.-Y. Gotschlich E.C. Donne F.T. Jonssen E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4703-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vann W.F. Liu T.-Y. Robbins J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) displays a homopolymer of -9-NeuAcα2- linkages. On the other hand, the polysialic acid capsular antigens of neuroinvasiveE. coli K92 are composed of poly(-8NeuAcα2,9NeuAcα2-) residues (10Egan W. Liu T.-Y. Dorow D. Cohen J.S. Robbins J.D. Gotschlich E.C. Robbins J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3687-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Alternating linkages of α2,8NeuAc- and α2,9NeuAc- could not be found in mammalian systems, and therefore could be utilized to elicit immunological response. In fact, the heteropolymer from K92 strain of E. coli is being imployed as a carbohydrate vaccine in the clinical trial of patients suffering from acute meningitidis (11Devi S.J. Robbins J.B. Schneerson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7175-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The sialyltransferases that catalyze the addition of sialic acid to form such diverse carbohydrate recognition molecules fall into at least two families. While 13 clones have been obtained from mammalian systems (12Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), only 4 have been cloned from bacterial systems to date (13Weisgerber C. Hansen A. Frosch M. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Vimr E.R. Bergstrom R. Steenbergen S.M. Boulnois G. Roberts I. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5127-5131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gilbert M. Cunningham A.-M. Watson D.C. Martin A. Richards J.C. Wakarchuk W.W. Eur. J.

Recent cloning of both mammalian and bacterial sialyltransferases showed that these two gene families evolved differently. The polysialyltransferase encoded by neuS in E. coliuses CMP-sialic acid as a donor and catalyzes a sequential addition of sialic acid to the nonreducing end of an acceptor (3Rohr T.E. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2332-2342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kundig F.D. Aminoff D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2543-2550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Steenbergen S.M. Vimr E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In a detailed study using the pathogenic strain of E. coli K1, the gene coding for CMP-Neu5Ac:poly-α2,8-sialosyl sialyltransferase, termed neuS, has been cloned. This gene was found to be clustered in the kps region which is implicated in the initiation, polymerization, and possibly translocation of polysialic acid chains across the inner membrane (13Weisgerber C. Hansen A. Frosch M. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Weisgerber C. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1578-1587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Steenbergen S.M. Vimr E.R. Glycoconjug. J. 1991; 8: 145Google Scholar). A similar gene has been identified by hybridization to the K92 strain of E. coli, the capsule of which contains poly(-8NeuAcα2,9NeuAcα2-) (10Egan W. Liu T.-Y. Dorow D. Cohen J.S. Robbins J.D. Gotschlich E.C. Robbins J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3687-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The complete nucleotide sequence of this K92 neuS gene showed that this gene product differs by 70 amino acids from the K1neuS gene product (14Vimr E.R. Bergstrom R. Steenbergen S.M. Boulnois G. Roberts I. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5127-5131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although an in vitrostudy indicated that the neuS from E. coli K1 coding for a 47-kDa protein has polysialyltransferase activity, no such activity has yet been clearly demonstrated for the neuSproduct from E. coli K92. In this study, we have cloned theneuS gene from the K92 strain of E. coli by PCR using the primers described previously (14Vimr E.R. Bergstrom R. Steenbergen S.M. Boulnois G. Roberts I. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5127-5131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expressed the gene in E. coli, and shown that the enzyme from this gene catalyzes the synthesis of polysialic acids with both α2,8- and α2,9-linkages in vitro and in vivo. DISCUSSIONWhile sialic acid is ubiquitous in eukaryotes, particularly in mammals (12Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not detected in prokaryotes other than some pathogenic bacteria. These include some E. coli strains, some N. meningitidis strains and bacteria of the O serotype including Salmonella (35Barry G.T. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1965; 47: 529-533.34PubMed Google Scholar, 36Barry G.T. Abbot V. Tsai T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1962; 29: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Glode M.P. Robbins J.B. Liu T-Y. Gotschlich E.C. Orskov I. Orskov F. J. Infect. Dis. 1977; 135: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the presence of polysialyltransferase activity in E. coli was reported earlier by Roseman et al. (17Kundig F.D. Aminoff D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2543-2550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the nature of the gene and its product was not clearly demonstrated until recently. The clonedneuS gene from K1 showed that its product has similar size but no sequence homology to any of the mammalian sialyltransferases. Expression of the K1 neuS gene indicates that this 47-kDa protein synthesizes polysialic acid in vitro (13Weisgerber C. Hansen A. Frosch M. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A similar gene was cloned from the K92 strain of E. coli, the capsule of which was shown to contain heteropolysialic acid (-8NeuAcα2, 9NeuAcα2-) (10Egan W. Liu T.-Y. Dorow D. Cohen J.S. Robbins J.D. Gotschlich E.C. Robbins J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3687-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This gene product differs by 70 amino acids when compared with that of the neuS gene product of the K1 strain (14Vimr E.R. Bergstrom R. Steenbergen S.M. Boulnois G. Roberts I. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5127-5131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the observed amino acid replacements, 36 were conservative. On the basis of such homology, it was postulated that the K92 gene evolved from neuS of K1 (14Vimr E.R. Bergstrom R. Steenbergen S.M. Boulnois G. Roberts I. J.

https://openalex.org/W2047929370,"We recently found that a thioether analog of K vitamin (Cpd 5) inhibited the activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) and induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in a human hepatoma cell line (Hep3B). We have now examined the structural requirements for induction of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and PTPase inhibition by several K vitamin analogs. Thioether analogs with sulfhydryl arylation capacity, especially those with a hydroxy (Cpd 5) or a methoxy group at the end of the side chain, induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, but non-arylating analogs, such as those with an all-carbon or O-ether side chain, did not. Among the receptor-tyrosine kinases, epidermal growth factor receptors were tyrosine-phosphorylated by treatment with thioether analogs, whereas insulin and hepatocyte growth factor receptors were not. An increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinase was also observed. The activity of purified T cell PTPase was inhibited only by the thioether analogs, but not by non-arylating analogs. Furthermore, the epidermal growth factor receptor dephosphorylation activity of Hep3B cell lysates was inhibited by Cpd 5 treatment. A similar induction of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation by Cpd 5 was seen in other human hepatoma cell lines together with growth inhibition. However, one cell line (HepG2), which was relatively resistant to growth inhibition by Cpd 5, did not increase its phosphorylation levels upon Cpd 5 treatment. These results suggest that cell growth inhibition by thioether analogs is closely associated with inhibition of PTPases by sulfhydryl arylation and with tyrosine phosphorylation of selected proteins.

These results suggest that cell growth inhibition by thioether analogs is closely associated with inhibition of PTPases by sulfhydryl arylation and with tyrosine phosphorylation of selected proteins. compound or compounds protein-tyrosine phosphatase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 epidermal growth factor EGF receptor hepatocyte growth factor phospholipase-Cγ The synthetic vitamin K3 (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone or menadione) has been reported to inhibit growth of many cell types both in vitro and in vivo (1Prasad K.N.

To further investigate the mechanisms and to generate more potent growth inhibitory compounds, we previously synthesized several K vitamin analogs with a thioether, O-ether, or all-carbon side chain at position 3 of the naphthoquinone nucleus of vitamin K3and found that thioether analogs, particularly a thioethanol analog (Cpd1 5), are potent growth inhibitors for Hep3B cells derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma (13Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F.M. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. Wang M. Kar S. Finn F. Dowd P. Zheng Z.B. Kerns J. Naganathan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28304-28310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cell growth inhibition by the thioether analogs in vitro was almost completely antagonized by exogenous thiols, but not by any non-thiol antioxidants tested, suggesting the importance of sulfhydryl arylation rather than oxidative stress in mediating the growth inhibition (14Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. Wang M. Kar S. Finn F. Dowd P. Zheng Z.B. Kerns J. Naganathan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28304-28310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Because the active site of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) contains a cysteine residue, which is essential in the catalytic process of tyrosine dephosphorylation (15Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), we have proposed that Cpd 5 might arylate the critical cysteine and inactivate PTPases (13Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F.M. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), perturbing protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, which is known to play a crucial role in many cellular processes (17Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar, 18Hunter T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We recently found that Cpd 5 indeed inhibited the activity of purified T cell PTPase and induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in Hep3B cells (19Ni R. Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9906-9911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), as well as in cultured rat hepatocytes (20Ni R. Carr B.I. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 559Google Scholar). It was thought to be unlikely that Cpd 5 induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation by activation of tyrosine kinases, because the increased protein-tyrosine phosphorylation was not affected by treatment with tyrphostin 23 or genistein, well described tyrosine kinase inhibitors (19Ni R. Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9906-9911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the structural requirements for induction of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition of PTPase using several vitamin K analogs (Fig. 1) and have compared the patterns of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation induced by vitamin K analogs with those of a well studied PTPase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate. Our results demonstrate a close relationship between growth inhibition and induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of selected proteins in human hepatoma cell lines, as well as with inhibition of PTPase activityin vitro by the thioether analogs. Thus, cell growth inhibition by thioether analogs is closely associated with protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. Cpds 1, 2, 3, and 5 were synthesized as described previously (13Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F.M. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cpd 34(2-(2-ethanolamine)-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) was generated by addition of ethanolamine to menadione in ethanol. Cpd 27(2-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, phthiocol) was generated from vitamin K3 by the reaction with Na2CO3 and hydrogen peroxide. Cpd 38(2-(2-mercaptoethanol-O-methylether)-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) was generated from the mercaptoethanol methylether and menadione oxide (21Chapman J.H. Owen L.N. J. Chem. Soc. 1950; 249: 579-585Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) by addition of tributylphosphine to a solution of menadione oxide and 2-methoxyethyl disulfide in methylene chloride. Purification was achieved by silica gel chromatography. The structures are shown in Fig.1. Human hepatoma cell lines (Hep3B, Huh7, Hep40, PLC/PRF/5, and HepG2) were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For the growth inhibition assay, the cells were plated at approximately 2 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates. 24 h after plating, the medium was replaced with a medium containing test compounds. Two days after treatment, the medium was removed and the plates were stored at −80 °C until the day of assay. Cell number was estimated by a DNA fluorometric assay using the fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 (22Rago R. Mitchen J. Wilding G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Confluent cells on 12-well plates were treated with various compounds or cytokines. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 50 μl RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 158 mm sodium chloride in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5)) containing protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, leupeptin, antipain, benzamide hydrochloride, and aprotinin). Aliquots of samples were used for measurement of protein concentration using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Treated cell lysates (20 or 40 μg of protein/lane) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using 10% polyacrylamide gels. For two-dimensional electrophoresis, cells were lysed with urea solubilization buffer and subjected to isoelectric focusing before SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (300 μl containing 125 or 250 μg protein) were incubated with antibodies (250 or 500 ng) for 1 h on ice and immunoprecipitated with 15 μl of protein A/G plus agarose slurry. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking the membrane with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST; 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0)) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (for the detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins) or 5% skim milk (for the detection of other proteins), the membrane was incubated with various primary antibodies, then washed with TBST, and incubated with anti-mouse or rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primary antibodies used were anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:200, Oncogene Research Products, Calbiochem), anti-epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz), anti-insulin receptor antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz), anti-hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (c-Met) antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz), anti-ERK2 antibody (1:5,000; Transduction Laboratories), and anti-phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz). Detection was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (NEN Life Science Products). Membranes were treated with stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8)) at 50 °C for 30 min before sequential reprobing with different antibodies. PTPase activities were measured using a PTPase assay kit from New England Biolabs, Inc. Myelin basic protein, a substrate for PTPase, was phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues with Abl protein-tyrosine kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and then dialyzed overnight to remove residual ATP. The assay was done in 25-μl reactions. Prior to adding the substrate, purified T cell PTPase (5 ng/reaction) was preincubated with compounds at 30 °C for 30 min. They were then incubated with γ-32P-labeled myelin basic protein (∼1.5 μg/reaction) at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were then centrifuged, and the radioactivity in the supernatants was counted using a scintillation counter. Activated (tyrosine-phosphorylated) EGFR was prepared by incubating Hep3B cells with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate 30 min before the addition of 20 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody, and the EGFR immunoprecipitates were used as substrates for EGFR dephosphorylation assays. Hep3B cell lysates were pre-cleared of EGFR by incubation with anti-EGFR antibody. Equal amounts of EGFR immunoprecipitates were incubated with pre-cleared Hep3B cell lysates, treated with or without Cpd 5 for 60 min, in 1× phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol) for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2× sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The dephosphorylation of EGFR was examined by Western blotting using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The cell growth inhibitory activity of various K vitamin analogs (Fig. 1) was evaluated (Fig. 2). Hep3B cells were treated with various concentrations of analogs for 48 h, and cell numbers were estimated by the DNA fluorometric assay. Thioether analogs showed strong growth inhibitory activity, with 50% inhibitory doses (ID50) less than 20 μm (Fig. 2 A). Analogs with a hydroxy group (Cpd 5) or methoxy group (Cpd38) at the end of the side chain were more potent growth inhibitors than those without (Cpds 2 and 3). As compared with thioether analogs, the analogs with an all-carbon side chain (Cpd 1), O-ether side chain (Cpd6), hydroxy group (Cpd 27), ethanol amine adduct (Cpd 34), were less potent in cell growth inhibition, with ID50 22.4 μm to >80 μm (Fig.2 B). To test possible cytotoxicity of the compounds, we performed a lactate dehydrogenase assay on supernatants of Cpd5-treated Hep3B cells and found that lactate dehydrogenase release was minimum, indicating that cell growth inhibition was not due only to cytotoxic effects of the compounds (data not shown). We reported that a thioethanol derivative (Cpd5) induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in Hep3B cells (19Ni R. Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9906-9911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To examine the significance of sulfhydryl arylation in the induction of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, we treated Hep3B cells with various analogs and analyzed tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by Western blotting (Fig. 3). In control (nontreated) cells, there were several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, among which a group of ∼100 kDa proteins were most prominent (Fig. 3 A). However, treatment with thioether analogs (Cpds 2, 3, 5, and38) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins, especially, approximately 170-, 75-, and 55-kDa proteins (Fig.3 A). Thioether analogs with a hydroxy (Cpd 5) or a methoxy (Cpd 38) group at the end of the side chain had the most potent action on protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas those without such modifications (Cpds 2 and 3) were much less potent (Fig. 3 A). Although Cpd 3,which has a longer side chain than Cpd 2, did not induce protein-tyrosine phosphorylation at 50 μm for 30 min (Fig. 3 A), it did induce protein-tyrosine phosphorylation at more than 100 μm (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to thioether analogs, Cpds 1, 6, 27, and34 did not induce protein-tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.3 A), even by longer treatments at higher concentrations (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that sulfhydryl arylation is crucial in inducing protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. We compared protein-tyrosine phosphorylation induced by the thioether analog, Cpd 5, with that induced by EGF, which is known to induce autophosphorylation of EGFR (∼170 kDa), as well as with that induced by sodium orthovanadate, which is known to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins by inhibition of PTPases (Fig. 4 A). EGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including 170-, 75-, and 55-kDa proteins, which were also hyperphosphorylated following treatment with thioether analogs, such as Cpd 5 (Fig.4 A). Sodium orthovanadate strongly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins (Fig. 4 A). We then compared the time course of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation induced by treatment with Cpd 5, EGF, and sodium orthovanadate by a densitometric analysis of the 170-kDa band on phosphotyrosine Western blots (Fig. 4 B). Cpd 5-induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation started within 10 min, peaked after 120 min, and then decreased to baseline by 360 min. By contrast, EGF-induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation peaked after 1 min and then rapidly decreased. Sodium orthovanadate induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation steadily over a period of hours (Fig.4 B). To examine the profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced by Cpd 5 and sodium orthovanadate, we performed phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels (Fig.5). Although several proteins, including the 170-kDa protein, were phosphorylated by both Cpd 5 and sodium orthovanadate, there were striking differences in the intensity and pattern of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation induced by these agents (Fig. 5). To examine whether the 170-kDa protein is EGFR, we performed EGFR Western blot analysis using the same blot used in Fig. 5 after stripping of the antibodies. The protein spots recognized by anti-EGFR antibody exactly corresponded to the tyrosine-phosphorylated spots in the phosphotyrosine Western blot in Cpd 5-treated cells (Fig. 6 A, lower panels). In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR was not present in nontreated control cells (Fig. 6 A, upper panels). This tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR was confirmed by EGFR immunoprecipitation and subsequent probing with phosphotyrosine or EGFR antibodies (Fig. 6 B, top panel). Sodium orthovanadate also induced EGFR phosphorylation, but Cpd 1(all-carbon), a non-arylator, did not (Fig. 6 B). To examine tyrosine phosphorylation of other receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, we performed immunoprecipitation analysis of insulin receptors and HGF receptors (c-Met). Neither Cpd 5 nor Cpd1 affected the tyrosine-phosphorylation status of these receptors, but sodium orthovanadate induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both, although the effect on insulin receptors was slight (Fig.6 B, middle and lower panels). We then examined the effects of Cpd 5 on tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase) which is phosphorylated on both tyrosine and threonine residues when activated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and has been shown to have a key role in EGF signal transduction. The two-dimensional gel blots used in Figs. 5 and 6 A were again probed with anti-ERK2 antibody (Fig. 7 A). ERK2 Western blots revealed two distinct protein spots of approximately the same size (42 kDa) with different pI, and only the spots with lower pI (left) contained phosphotyrosine (Fig. 7, arrows), suggesting that the spots with lower pI were tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK2 and those with higher pI were nonphosphorylated ERK2 (Fig.7 A). This difference in pI was probably caused by an increased negative charge on proteins after phosphorylation. In nontreated control cells, nonphosphorylated ERK2 was predominant, whereas in Cpd 5-treated cells, the proportion of phosphorylated ERK2 to nonphosphorylated ERK2 increased (Fig.7 A), indicating that Cpd 5 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2. We also examined the effect of Cpd5 on tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ, which is known to be tyrosine-phosphorylated by EGF (23Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In control cells, as well as Cpd 5-treated cells, PLC-γ was barely phosphorylated, whereas it was strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated by sodium orthovanadate treatment (Fig. 7 B). We previously reported that Cpd 5 inhibited the activity of purified T cell PTPase (19Ni R. Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9906-9911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To examine the significance of thiol arylation in the inhibition of PTPase activity, we compared the effects of arylators and non-arylators on the inhibition of T cell PTPasein vitro. All the thioether analogs inhibited PTPase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.8 A). Cpd 5 and Cpd38, which were potent growth inhibitors and tyrosine phosphorylation inducers, were also particularly potent inhibitors of PTPase activity. In contrast, non-arylating analogs did not inhibit PTPase activity (Fig. 8 B), just as they did not induce protein-tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A andB). Because it has been shown that Cpd 5 inhibits the activity of PTPases, we considered the possibility that EGFR phosphorylation by Cpd5 was caused by PTPase inhibition. To examine this hypothesis, we measured the dephosphorylation of EGFR by Cpd5. Activated EGFR was prepared from Hep3B cells treated with 20 ng/ml EGF for 5 min, and whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody. Separately, other Hep3B cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with EGFR antibody to remove the endogenous EGFR and treated with Cpd 5 in doses from 0 to 80 μmfor 1 h. When activated EGFR was incubated with Hep3B cell lysates, which were precleared with anti-EGFR antibody, we found that EGFR was completely dephosphorylated by untreated cell lysates, and this dephosphorylation was inhibited by lysates that had been treated with Cpd 5 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.9). To study how the effects of Cpd 5 on cell growth inhibition and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation are cell type-dependent, we also examined other human hepatoma cell lines, Huh7, Hep40, PLC/PRF/5, and HepG2 cells. Although Cpd 5 exerted growth inhibitory effects for these cell lines, HepG2 cells were more resistant to Cpd 5 than other cell lines (Fig.10 A). There were significant (p < 0.01) differences of ID50 between HepG2 and other cell lines by analysis of variance. Cpd 5(50 μm) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in Huh7, Hep40, and PLC/PRF/5 cells, but the effect was not seen in HepG2 cells (Fig. 10 B). Cpd 5 did not induce protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in HepG2 cells even at 100 μm (data not shown). We have previously shown that thioether analogs of vitamin K were potent growth inhibitors for Hep3B cells (13Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F.M. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. Wang M. Kar S. Finn F. Dowd P. Zheng Z.B. Kerns J. Naganathan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28304-28310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and the most potent growth inhibitory analog, a thioethanol derivative, named Cpd5, induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, probably due to the inhibition of PTPases by sulfhydryl arylation (19Ni R. Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9906-9911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To further investigate the significance of sulfhydryl arylation in the induction of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and PTPase inhibition by K vitamin analogs, in this study, we have compared thioether analogs (arylators) with several analogs that do not have the site for sulfhydryl arylation (non-arylators) and found that only arylators induce protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in Hep3B cells and inhibit the activity of purified PTPase. Our data suggest that sulfhydryl interaction of the thioether analogs with the critical cysteine residue of PTPases (15Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) caused inhibition of the enzyme activity and resulted in an increased level of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. An addition-elimination mechanism has been proposed for the interaction of the thioether analogs with thiols (13Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F.M. Carr B.I. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The substitution of the sulfur atom of Cpd 5 with a nitrogen atom (Cpd 34) resulted in a loss of effects on protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and PTPase inhibition, indicating the importance of the sulfur atom for the interaction with thiols (Figs. 1and 3). Sodium orthovanadate, the prototype PTPase inhibitor (24Swarup G. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 25Nelson R.L. Branton P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), has also been shown to interact with the cysteine residue within covalent bond distance (26Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Peroxovanadate (a mixture of orthovanadate and hydrogen peroxide) oxidizes the cysteine by forming cysteic acid (26Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), whereas alendronate forms sulfonic acid with the cysteine (27Skorey K. Ly H.D. Kelly J. Hammond M. Ramachandran C. Huang Z. Gresser M.J. Wang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22472-22480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and aromatic disulfides (28Pregel M.J. Storer A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23552-23558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and nitric oxide (29Caselli A. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pazzagli L. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24878-24882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) form disulfides and inactivate the enzyme activity. Sodium orthovanadate acts as a competitive inhibitor for PTP1B, whereas peroxovanadate irreversibly inhibits the PTPase activity (26Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Several chemical modifications in the side chain of the analogs altered their effects on protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and PTPase inhibition. We found that an increase in the side chain length decreased the effects, suggesting the presence of the size limit in sulfhydryl interaction of the side chain and the cysteine residue in the active site pocket. Addition of a methoxy group at the end of the side chain generated an analog, Cpd 38, as potent as Cpd5, that has a hydroxy group at the end of the side chain instead. Because both hydroxy and methoxy groups are known to act as hydrogen bond acceptors, they may interact with hydrogen bonds present among the amino acid residues in the active site. This suggests that the interaction of inhibitors with non-cysteine residues is also important. Interestingly, a structure designed to bind to both active site and non-catalytic site of a PTPase has been demonstrated to be a very effective inhibitor (30Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13420-13425Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). EGFR was strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated by arylating K vitamin analogs. After ligand binding, EGFR molecules are dimerized, autophosphorylate their tyrosine residues, and are thereby activated for subsequent signal transduction (18Hunter T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The status of EGFR phosphorylation is also controlled by PTPase-mediated dephosphorylation of the receptor. EGFR has been shown to associate with and be dephosphorylated by T cell PTPase (31Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was effectively inhibited by arylating analogs in this study. PTP1B is also known to associate with and interact with EGFR (32Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 33Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, EGFR phosphorylation by arylating analogs might be due to inhibition of PTPases, which regulate the phosphorylation status of EGFR. The results of our EGFR dephosphorylation assay support this hypothesis. EGFR phosphorylation has also been shown to occur by inhibition of dephosphorylation by radiation, oxidants, and alkylating agents (34Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Other examples of the association of protein-tyrosine kinases and PTPases have also been demonstrated, such as the interactions between insulin receptor and PTP1B (35Bandyopadhyay D. Kusari A. Kenner K.A. Liu F. Chernoff J. Gustafson T.A. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1639-1645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), c-Src and PTP1C (36Falet H. Ramos-Morales F. Bachelot C. Fischer S. Rendu F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and JAK tyrosine kinases and SHP-2 (37Yin T. Shen R. Feng G.-S. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional gel analysis showed differences in the profiles of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins between Cpd 5- and orthovanadate-treated cells. Cpd 5 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, but not insulin receptor or HGF receptor (c-Met), whereas sodium orthovanadate induced phosphorylation of all of these receptor tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, PLC-γ was phosphorylated by treatment with sodium orthovanadate, but not with Cpd5. These results suggest that Cpd 5 is more selective in phosphorylation of cellular proteins than sodium orthovanadate. Peroxovanadate has also been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, insulin receptor, c-Met, and multiple signaling proteins in mouse liver and kidney in vivo (38Ruff S.J. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1263-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cpd 5 and other thioether analogs may inhibit a selected class of PTPases. Because these K vitamin analogs have the common basic chemical structure 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, which is larger than orthovanadate, the interaction with the critical cysteine residue may not be possible for all PTPases, dependent on their active site structures. Recently, relatively modest chemical modifications in modular side chains have been shown to change the substrate specificity of other classes of tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatase inhibitors (39Rice R.L. Rusnak J.M. Yokokawa F. Yokokawa S. Messner D.J. Boynton A.L. Wipf P. Lazo J.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15965-15974Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cpd 5 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2, which is phosphorylated by MEK and has a pivotal role in the signaling pathways of receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR (40Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). It is possible that Cpd 5-induced EGFR phosphorylation may activate the EGFR signaling pathways without ligand binding, as shown in the case of peroxovanadate (41Zhao Z. Tan Z. Diltz C.D. You M. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22251-22255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, Cpd 5 did not affect the phosphorylation status of PLC-γ, which is known to be phosphorylated and thus activated following EGFR activation (23Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Cpd5 may activate only a part of the EGFR signaling pathways. Cpd 5-mediated ERK2 phosphorylation could be independent of EGFR activation, because it has been demonstrated that kinase-negative EGFR can mediate ERK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (42Coker K.J. Staros J.V. Guyer C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6967-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43Selva E. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2250-2254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that ERK2 can be autophosphorylated (44Seger R. Ahn N.G. Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Panayotatos N. Radziejewska E. Ericsson L. Bratlien R.L. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6146-6162Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It is also possible that Cpd5 inactivates dual specificity phosphatases that dephosphorylate ERK2, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKP)-1, MKP-2, MKP-3, and PAC1 (45Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 46Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), thereby inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2. Peroxovanadate-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation has been shown to be MEK-independent (47Band C.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 138-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Arylating K vitamin analogs inhibited cell growth more strongly than non-arylating analogs. Among the arylating analogs, those that had stronger effects on protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and PTPase inhibition were more potent cell growth inhibitors. Furthermore, a hepatoma cell line (HepG2), which was relatively resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of Cpd 5, did not increase its protein-tyrosine phosphorylation levels upon Cpd 5treatment. These data suggest that cell growth inhibition by the arylating analogs is related to increased protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and PTPase inhibition. However, it is important to note that non-arylating analogs can also inhibit cell growth, although at higher concentrations, indicating the presence of unidentified growth inhibitory mechanisms that are independent of increased protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. Although protein-tyrosine phosphorylation has been generally supposed to mediate positive cellular events, such as cell signaling associated with growth stimulation, increased levels of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation have also been reported to be associated with cell growth inhibition and cell death in several cell types (48Beckwith M.

S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). It has been well established that many tumor cell lines stop cell growth in the presence of EGF at high concentrations (52Gulli L.F. Palmer K.C. Chen Y.Q. Reddy K.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 173-178PubMed Google Scholar, 53Bromberg J.F. Fan Z. Brown C. Mendelsohn J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 505-512PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that PTPase inhibition itself might inhibit cell growth, because some PTPases have been demonstrated to act as positive regulators of cell growth (54Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Interestingly, arylating K vitamin analogs induced sustained phosphorylation of EGFR, whereas EGF caused very rapid and transient EGFR phosphorylation. This different intensity and duration of phosphorylation of EGFR might be responsible for the growth inhibitory activities. In neuronal PC 12 cells, transient ERK phosphorylation induced by EGF is associated with cell proliferation, whereas sustained ERK phosphorylation induced by nerve growth factor is associated with growth inhibition and cell differentiation (55Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the mechanistic significance of transient or prolonged activation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that seem to correlate with cell growth inhibition. We appreciate helpful discussions with Drs. Siddharta Kar, Runzhou Ni, and Shinji Osada and the excellent technical help of Meifang Wang during these experiments."

The detailed post-embryonic expression pattern of the cyp-3 transcript is unusual, peaking during early larval development. The spatial expression pattern was examined via reporter gene analysis demonstrating that thecyp-3 transcript is exclusively expressed in the single anterior excretory cell. Recombinant cyclophilin 3 has been purified, crystallized and solved to a resolution of 1.8 Å. The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of CYP-3 has been characterized against the substrateN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, and gives a k cat/K m value of 2.4 × 106m−1s−1. The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A binds and inhibits CYP-3 with an IC50 value of 16 nm, comparable with the range of values found for human cyclophilin A. The x-ray structure shows that the overall fold and active site geometry is similar to other cyclophilin structures. There are however a number of distinctive features, and we use this structure and amino acid sequence alignment analysis to identify a subgroup of “divergent-loop cyclophilins”. This subgroup has a number of uniquely conserved features: an additional loop between residues 48 and 54 (KSGKPLH); two cysteine residues (Cys40 and Cys168) that are in close proximity but remain in the unoxidized form, and two other conserved residues, His54 and Glu83. We suggest that these features are functionally important for the role played by this class of cyclophilins during cellular responses to stress caused by changes in the redox environment or by up-regulation of cellular activity.

Metcalfe S.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 67-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The first protein to be discovered was the abundant cytosolic protein cyclophilin A (CypA),1isolated by its high affinity binding to the natural fungal cyclic undecapeptide cyclosporin A (2Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar, 3Harding M.W. Handschumacher R.E. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8547-8555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An 18-kDa protein independently isolated (4Fischer G. Wittmannliebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar) showed peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity and was subsequently shown to be identical to CypA. In vitro,cyclophilins accelerate the rate-limiting cis/trans PPIase steps in the folding pathway of peptide and protein substrates (5Lang K. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Nature. 1987; 329: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 6Takahashi N. Hayano T. Suzuki M. Nature. 1989; 337: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar), especially in proline-rich proteins (7Bachinger H.P. J. Biol.

It has also been suggested that cyclophilins affect the dynamics of protein-protein interactionsin vitro by preventing aggregation of early folding intermediates of protein substrates (9Freskgard P.O. Bergenhem N. Jonsson B.H. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Science. 1992; 258: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In vivo, several lines of evidence point to a role for cyclophilins in protein folding, transport, and assembly (1Galat A. Metcalfe S.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 67-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 10Stamnes M.A. Shieh B.H. Chuman L. Harris G.L. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 219-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The best characterized example of cyclophilin function in vivo is the 26-kDa photoreceptor cyclophilin ninaA fromDrosophila melanogaster. The ninaA gene product has been shown to be essential for the proper folding and intracellular transport of isoforms of the photopigment rhodopsin, RH1 and RH2, from the rough endoplasmic reticulum through the cytoplasm to the cell surface (11Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4886-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 12Ondek B. Hardy R.W. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Shieh B.H. Zuker C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16460-16466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for other cyclophilin functions is growing and includes, for single domain cyclophilins, the requirement for functional PPIase activity of CypA to produce functional expression of homo-oligomeric α7-neuronal nicotinic and type 3 serotonin receptors in Xenopus oocytes (13Helekar S.A. Patrick J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5432-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PPIase activity of the cyclophilin from Bacillus subtilis has also been shown to be necessary to allow growth of the organism under starvation conditions (14Gothel S.F. Scholz C. Schmid F. Marahiel M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13392-13399Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In cooperation with Hsp 70 and Hsp 60, cyclophilins are a component of the mitochondrial protein-folding machinery in Neurospora crassa(15Rassow J. Mohrs K. Koidl S. Barthelmess I.B. Pfanner N. Tropschug M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2654-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the larger cyclophilin 40 proteins induce conformational changes in the transcriptional factor c-Myb which allows the C-terminal negative regulatory domain of c-Myb to interact with and inhibit its N-terminal DNA binding domain (16Leverson J.D. Ness S.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Duina et al. (17Duina A.A. Kalton H.M. Gaber R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18974-18978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) also suggest a requirement for a Cyp 40-type cyclophilin (Cpr 7) in the negative regulation of the heat shock response under both stress and nonstress conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cloning and characterization of eleven cyclophilin genes fromC. elegans (18Page A.P. Macniven K. Hengartner M.O. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) provides an excellent opportunity to study the various biological roles played by representatives of all the cyclophilin subfamilies present within this system. The immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A has been shown to have an effect on parasitic helminth worms, causing structural tegumental damage. A possible mechanism for this antiparasitic effect is the inhibition of proper cyclophilin activity (19Chappell L.H. Wastling J.M. Parasitology. 1992; 105: S 25-S 40Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Page A.P. Kumar S. Carlow C.K.S. Parasitol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11545-11550Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) resulting in production and accumulation of misfolded protein. Detailed structural information on the nematode cyclophilins may therefore provide useful targets for the design of new families of antiparasitic drugs. In this study we have fully characterized both the x-ray structure and enzymatic activity of CYP-3 and also monitored its expression pattern throughout the post-embryonic life cycle of C. elegans. The expression pattern analysis of CYP-3, when considered together with emerging structural and sequence data, provides an insight into the possible roles played by cyclophilins in multicellular organisms. Thecyp-3 reporter gene recombinant plasmids were constructed using the C. elegans lacZ promotorless reporter gene expression vector pPD95.03 (a kind gift from Andy Fire and co-workers, Carnegie Institute). The plasmid encodes a nuclear localization signal amino-terminal to the lacZ gene and an N-terminal multi-intron intervening sequence. The potential upstream regulatory region of cyp-3 was identified from an unfinished yeast artificial chromosome clone (Y75B12, GenBankTM accession number AL022301), identified on chromosome V by the C. elegans genome project. The translationally “in-frame” 1026-base pair 5′ untranslated region of the cyp-3 gene was amplified from genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) withTaq polymerase (Applied Biotechnologies). The PCR primers contained an artificial restriction site (underlined) to allow directional subcloning into the multiple cloning site of the vector pPD95.03; cyp3pfxba 5′-gcgtctagagaagtccaaattactgtcaac-3′ (sense, XbaI); cyp3prbam 5′-gcgggatccctcattgttgaggcaagaataggga-3′ (antisense,BamHI). This construct permitted an in-frame translational fusion to the lacZ with the first two amino acids of CYP-3. PCR products were sequentially digested with XbaI andBamHI, gel purified, and ligated into similarly digested vector pPD95.03. Miniprep DNA was prepared using a Qiagen miniprep kit, and sequencing was performed to confirm the identity and the translational context of the insert. Transformation of adult hermaphrodite C. elegans was performed by microinjection of plasmid DNA into the syncytial gonad and was carried out using the standard methods as described previously (22Page A.P. Winter A.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transformed nematodes were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (22Page A.P. Winter A.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The semi-quantitative RT-PCR methods including the generation of synchronous nematode cultures for staged mRNA and subsequent cDNA are described in detail elsewhere (23Johnstone I.L. Shafi Y. Majeed A. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The staged cDNA samples were supplied by Iain Johnstone (Wellcome Centre for Molecular Parasitology, The University of Glasgow). The gene combinations (cyp-3 and the control gene ama-1, which encodes the large subunit of RNA polymerase II) were amplified from the staged cDNA samples representing pooled mRNA samples corresponding to the different post-embryonic developmental stages, using conditions which allowed reactants to remain in excess (94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90 s for 25 cycles in 25 μl of final volume). Primers were designed to span introns so as to distinguish between cDNA and possible genomic DNA signals, and combinations used were as follows: cyp-3, cyp3F/Nde and cyp3R/EcoRI ama-1, ama1f 5′-ttccaagcgccgctgcgcattgtctc-3′ and ama1r 5′-cagaatttccagcactcgaggagcgga-3′. The PCR reactions were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and Southern blotted; blots were then probed with corresponding gene-specific (cyp-3, and the control gene ama-1) dAT-32P randomly labeled inserts, which were generated by PCR using the above conditions and purified by gel extraction (QiaQuick gel extraction kit). After autoradiography, the bands corresponding to the respective genes were excised and counted by scintillation. The relative abundance of the test genes were reproducibly determined by comparing their signal with that of the control gene ama-1. cyp-3 was cloned from cDNA using a RT-PCR method as described previously (18Page A.P. Macniven K. Hengartner M.O. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(A)+ mRNA was obtained using the Micro-Fast Track Kit (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using a cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK). RT-PCR conditions were as follows: 10 pmol of each primer (cyp3F/Nde and cyp3R/EcoRI) 5 mm MgCl2, 6.7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4.4 μm EDTA (pH 8), 1 mm of each dNTP, 113 μg/ml nonacetylated bovine serum albumin, 2 μl of mixed stage cDNA and 1 μl of Taqpolymerase (Advanced Biotechnologies), cycled 20× at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min in 100 μl. The primers included engineered restriction sites (NdeI andEcoRI) that, after restriction digestion, allowed directional subcloning into similarly digested pET-5a expression vector (Promega). Ligation and transformation protocols of the Promega pET-5 technical manual were followed. Plasmid DNA was isolated (Plasmid Kit, Qiagen), and the insert was sequenced in both directions by thermal cycle sequencing on an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer to validate that no mutations had been generated by the RT-PCR procedure. The plasmid DNA was then transformed into competent BL21(DE3 pLysS) cells (Promega) for subsequent recombinant protein expression. Recombinant CYP-3 was expressed following a 4 h induction with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C, defrosted on ice, and solubilized in lysis buffer (10% w/v) containing 50 mm HEPES, 5 mmbenzamidine, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5. Lysozyme (ICN/FLOW) was added to 0.1% w/v and incubated on ice for 1 h. An equal volume of deionized water at 4 °C was added, and the cell suspension mixed. Resulting supernatant was frozen at −20 °C, defrosted slowly on ice and the pH adjusted to 6.8. Protein extract was purified to homogeneity using two purification steps: SP-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography with the following buffers: Buffer A, 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8, and Buffer B, Buffer A + 0.5m NaCl (pH 6.8). Column fractions were tested on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and fractions containing the protein of interest were dialyzed overnight against Buffer A. Protein solution was filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and applied to Resource S resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CYP-3 was eluted from this resin with the following buffers: Buffer A, 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, Buffer B, Buffer A + 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing CYP-3 were pooled and concentrated to 20 mg/ml as estimated by the Bradford assay. Dynamic light scattering showed the protein was essentially monodisperse and stable with an estimated molecular mass of 20 kDa (results not shown). Purified recombinant CYP-3 was assayed for PPIase activity essentially as described by Fischer et al.(4Fischer G. Wittmannliebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar), with the suggested substrate solvent application as described by Kofron et al. (24Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colonbonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This assay determines the rate of conversion of cis to trans of a proline-containing peptide, working on the principle that chymotrypsin will cleave the peptide only when it is in the transconformation, resulting in the release of chromogenic dye. The peptide substrateN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Bachem) was dissolved in trifluroethanol with 470 mm LiCl to give 100 mm stock solution, which was diluted to 4 mm immediately before use. The experimental setup was as follows: CYP-3 was diluted into 50 mm HEPES, 86 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 (PPIase Buffer), to give a 2,000 nm stock. In a 1-ml cuvette, 10 μl of protein (20 nm final concentration) was added to 860 μl of PPIase buffer and incubated on ice for 1 h. Chymotrypsin (100 μl of a 6 mg/ml solution) was added to the cuvette followed by transfer of the cuvette to a thermostatted Peltier cell holder by which the reaction temperature was maintained at 5 °C. The sample was allowed to equilibrate until a steady baseline was established. The reaction was started by the addition of 30 μl (120 μm) of peptide substrate followed by rapid mixing. The absorbance change at 400 nm due to the release of p-nitroaniline was recorded using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 20 spectrophotometer with data collected every 0.1 s over a 2-min time period. A number of protein concentrations were tested using the above method. Analysis of the data was carried out using a double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burke plot, which gives an intercept at 1/V max on the y axis, and 1/[S] = −1/K m on the x axis. The slope of the line isK m/V max. Cyclosporin A inhibition assays were carried out essentially as described above except that the samples were preincubated for a minimum of 60 min with varying amounts of CsA (kindly provided by Novartis AG). Two crystal forms were grown from the protein isolated above using the standard hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystal forms were tetragonal bipyramid and thin plates. 4-μl hanging drops consisted of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 15.5% w/v methoxypolyethylene glycol 5000 (MPEG 5000). Protein concentration was 3.5 mg/ml. The drop was suspended over the well containing 100 mm sodium citrate, 31% MPEG 5000 at 18 °C. Conditions for producing tetragonal crystals were refined, crystals grew in a narrow concentration range of MPEG 5000 (28–32%) with the optimum pH for crystal growth being 5.6. 4-μl hanging drops consisted of 50 mm citric acid/sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 13% MPEG 5000. Protein concentration was 21 mg/ml. The drop was suspended over a well containing 100 mm citric acid/sodium citrate, pH 6.0, and 26% MPEG 5000 at 4 °C. X-ray data were also collected from the thin plate crystal. These crystals were orthorhombic and diffracted to 1.9 Å in one direction, with unit cell dimensions of a = 58.9 Å, b = 67.5 Å, c = 76.4 Å. No further studies were carried out using this crystal form as they were severely anisotropic. Crystals were transferred from the hanging drop using an appropriately sized cryo-loop into a cryoprotectant solution containing mother liquor plus 20% glycerol. Crystals were removed from the cryoprotectant solution after 5 s and mounted in a cryo-loop (Hampton Research) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected at 100 K (Oxford cryosystems) using a MAR image plate and processed using DENZO (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38252) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE (26Navaza J.

There is one molecule in the asymmetric unit, with V m = 3.118 A3/Da and 60.6% solvent. 145,422 observations were measured to give 22,053 unique data, 14,736 with I > 3ς (I). The merging R-factor is 8.3%, and the data is 97% complete to a resolution of 1.8 Å. Results of the final refinement are summarized in Table I.

Fig. 1 shows the alignment of the cyclophilin domains from a number of cyclophilins against human CypA. The overall architecture of CYP-3 is similar to that of known x-ray and NMR cyclophilin structures (28Braun W. Kallen J. Mikol V. Walkinshaw M.D. Wuthrich K.

The CYP-3 structure is very highly conserved when compared with the structure of human cyclophilin A, the best characterized member of the family (30Kallen J. Spitzfaden C. Zurini M.G.M. Wider G.

The eight labeled strands are shown in purple, the two helices are shown in green, and ceCYP3 loop structure is shown in orange. The human CypA loop (in blue) contrasts with the shape adopted by the divergent loop, which is formed mainly by 7 additional residues (48KSGKPLH54) in the CYP-3 sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The active site of CYP-3 is also very similar to that found in human CypA, all 13 residues important in binding to cyclosporin A being conserved (32Pflugl G.M. Kallen J. Jansonius J.N. Walkinshaw M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 385-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The only significant structural difference seen is in the conformation adopted by Arg62, which places the corresponding side chain atoms 0.7 Å apart. This fits with the similar enzymatic activity and inhibition by CsA as is found for human CypA. The very close structural similarity of the active site region also suggests that the possible natural cellular substrates are also similar between C. elegans and mammals. The most distinctive structural feature distinguishing CypA and CYP-3 is the additional insert of 7 residues48KSGKPLH54, which forms a protruding loop located above the active site of CYP-3 (Fig.4). This feature has also been observed in the Bm-CYP-1 cyclophilin structure (33Taylor P. Page A.P. Kontopidis G. Husi H. Walkinshaw M.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Mikol V. Ma D. Carlow C.K.S. Prot. Sci. 1998; 7: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) from the filarial nematode Brugia malayi (Fig. 1). The loop is held in place by a very specific network of hydrogen bonds from the side chain of Glu83. The carboxylic group of Glu83 forms two strong hydrogen bonds with amide main chain nitrogen atoms of Lys48 and Ser49 (Fig. 4). All cyclophilin homologues with additional loops (including human/bovine cyclophilin 40 and some parasite and plant cyclophilins) have a conserved glutamate in a homologous position. Thus the role of Glu83 in these divergent loop structures is to both lock and tether the loop into a particular conformation. The loop provides a distinctive recognition feature of this subfamily of cyclophilins, which may prove to be important in protein-protein interactions. Loop structures do however show some divergence as can be seen on comparing the structures from CYP-3 and B. malayi. The presence of inserts of 6–8 residues has been described previously in a number of members of this protein family, including many plant species (35Chou I.T. Glasser C.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 873-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and is a particularly common feature of the nematode cyclophilins, being found in 7 of the 11 characterized cyclophilins from C. elegans (18Page A.P. Macniven K. Hengartner M.O. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A consensus sequence for this additional loop based on multiple sequence alignments is (**GK*LH). It is interesting to note that this loop also contains part of a conserved ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (A/G-X4-G-K-S/T) (36Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation of this inserted sequence over diverse species suggests the loop structure and its locking mechanism are an important functional part of the protein whose role remains to be elucidated, rather than a neutral addition. CYP-3 shares with all divergent loop cyclophilins, including Bm-CYP-1, two highly conserved cysteines (Fig. 1). The sulfur atoms of Cys40 and Cys168 are well defined in the electron density and are separated by 5.38 Å and are present in the structure as reduced cysteine residues (Fig. 5). Torsion angles of the 2 residues are N-Cα-Cβ-S = 53° for Cys168 and −72° for Cys40. The sulfur atom of Cys168 is 3.74Å away from nitrogen Ne2 of His54, 3.2 Å from the carbonyl oxygen of Cys40and 3.5 Å away from the backbone NH of Lys56. Molecular modeling has shown that a simple rotation about the Cα-Cβ cysteine side chain bonds enables a disulfide bond to form. (N-Cα-Cβ-S = −167° for Cys168 and N-Cα-Cβ-S = −134o for Cys40). These changes from the original staggered conformation to an alternatively favored staggered conformation results in an S-S distance of 2.1 Å, with no other short nonbonded interatomic contacts. The role of these conserved residues is unknown. The unexpected presence of the reduced form of these cysteine residues suggests the intriguing possibility that this feature may provide a signaling mechanism in response to oxidative stress. The formation of an S-S bond in an oxidizing environment may provide a dynamic signal inducing conformational change(s). Alternatively, the sulfhydryl group of the reduced Cys168 and Cys40 along with the imidazole side chains of His54 may provide a metal ion coordination site. Interestingly, His54 (or equivalent) is conserved in all these divergent loop cyclophilins (Fig. 1) and may also be an important part of this putative redox signaling mechanism. Representative spectral progress curves showing the formation of the trans-isomer of the model substrate tetrapeptide can be seen in Fig. 6 a. CYP-3 clearly accelerates the rate of isomerization of the tetrapetide substrate relative to the uncatalyzed thermal isomerization rate and the catalysis is inhibited by addition of the cyclophilin binding drug cyclosporin A. The enzyme reaction was found to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the velocity of the reaction (v) increasing with substrate concentration [S] as shown in Fig. 6 b. First order rate kinetics were observed and a double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burke plot of 1/v against 1/[S] gave values ofk cat = 860 s−1,K m = 350 μm, which corresponds to a value of k cat/K m of 2.4 × 106m−1 s−1. These values are similar to the published values for human CypA, which hask cat = 12,700 s−1,K m 870 μm andk cat/K m = 14.6 × 106m−1 s−1 (24Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colonbonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The spectral curves produced from the in vitrochymotrypsin-coupled peptide assay clearly shows CsA inhibition of the rate of CYP-3 catalyzed isomerization (Fig. 6 a). A concentration of 16 nm CsA was required to inhibit 50% of the CYP-3 PPIase activity (IC50). This value is comparable with the IC50 val"
https://openalex.org/W2020077886,"Exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) sequences are important for the recognition of adjacent splice sites in pre-mRNA and for the regulation of splice site selection. It has been proposed that ESEs function by associating with one or more serine/arginine-repeat (SR) proteins which stabilize the binding of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) auxiliary factor (U2AF) to the polypyrimidine tract upstream of the 3′ splice site. We have tested this model by analyzing the composition of splicing complexes assembled on an ESE-dependent pre-mRNA derived from the doublesex gene of Drosophila. Several SR proteins and hTra2β, a human homolog of theDrosophila alternative splicing regulator Transformer-2, associate with this pre-mRNA in the presence, but not in the absence, of a purine-rich ESE. By contrast, the 65-kDa subunit of U2AF (U2AF-65 kDa) bound equally to the pre-mRNA in the presence and absence of the ESE. Time course experiments revealed differences in the levels and kinetics of association of individual SR proteins with the ESE-containing pre-mRNA, whereas U2AF-65 kDa bound prior to most SR proteins and hTra2β and its level of binding did not change significantly during the course of the splicing reaction. Binding of U2AF-65 kDa to the ESE-dependent pre-mRNA was, however, dependent on U1 snRNP. The results indicate that an ESE promotes spliceosome formation through interactions that are distinct from those required for the binding of U2AF-65 kDa to the polypyrimidine tract.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 2Burge C. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R. Cech T. Atkins J. RNA World II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies have provided evidence that over 50 proteins are required for constitutive splicing, many of which are highly conserved between yeast and mammals. In metazoans, a large number of non-snRNP protein splicing factors have been identified which contain domains rich in alternating serine and arginine residues (RS domains)1 (3Fu X.-D.

A subgroup of these proteins, the SR family, contain one or two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs and a phosphorylated C-terminal RS domain. SR family proteins include SRp20, ASF/SF2, SC35, 9G8, SRp30c, SRp40/HRS, SRp55, SRp75, and a more distantly related protein, p54. These proteins promote general splicing activity and also function in regulated pre-mRNA splicing. SR proteins interact with each other and also with snRNP-associated proteins that contain RS domains and these interactions are mediated by phosphorylated RS domains (7Wu J.Y. Maniatis T.

These protein-protein interactions are important for promoting the recognition and pairing of splice sites and for subsequent steps in spliceosome assembly.The assembly of spliceosomes involves an ordered association of snRNPs and non-snRNP protein factors with the pre-mRNA (1Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). At an early stage in assembly, U1 snRNP binds to sequences at the 5′ splice site and promotes the binding of U2 snRNP to the intron branch site (13Barabino S.M.L. Blencowe B.J. Ryder U. Sproat B.S. Lamond A.I. Cell. 1990; 63: 293-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,14Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 59: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The stable binding of U2 snRNP to the branch site also requires the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF), which consists of two subunits, U2AF-65 kDa and U2AF-35 kDa (15Ruskin B. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 207-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). U2AF-65 kDa contains a short N-terminal RS domain followed by three RRMs and U2AF-35 kDa contains a short C-terminal RS domain (16Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 17Zhang M. Zamore P.D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lamond A.I. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8769-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). U2AF binds through the 65-kDa subunit to the polypyrimidine tract located between the branch site and 3′ splice site (18Zamore P.D. Green M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Following the assembly of a U2 snRNP-containing pre-splicing complex, U4/U6 and U5 snRNPs enter the assembly pathway as a pre-formed tri-snRNP particle which, together with additional protein factors, form an assembled spliceosome.In higher eukaryotes, the sequences specifying splice sites and the branch site are weakly conserved and are often surrounded by many cryptic splice sites that are not selected. Moreover, many pre-mRNAs in metazoan cells contain alternative splice sites that must be recognized in a regulated fashion to generate specific mRNA variants (reviewed in Refs. 19Wang J. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and 20Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Additional sequence elements within a pre-mRNA are important for splice site recognition and one type of element is the exonic splicing enhancer (ESE). One or more SR proteins bind to ESEs and promote the recognition of adjacent splice sites (reviewed in Refs. 3Fu X.-D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 4Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Manley J. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar and 21Chabot B. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). ESEs are often purine-rich although recent studies employing SELEX procedures have demonstrated that diverse sequences can function as enhancers in conjunction with different SR proteins (22Liu H.-X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 23Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1705-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that the splicing coactivator SRm160/300 (complex of SR-relatedmatrix proteins of 160kDa and300kDa) is required for ESE-dependent splicing (24Blencowe B.J. Issner R. Nickerson J.A. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 996-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The association of SRm160/300 with an ESE-dependent pre-mRNA requires U1 snRNP, factors bound to the ESE, and is stabilized by U2 snRNP. Independently of pre-mRNA, SRm160/300 interacts specifically with U2 snRNP and hTra2β, a human homolog of the Drosophila alternative splicing regulator Transformer-2 that binds to purine-rich ESEs (26Tacke R. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Manley J.L. Cell. 1998; 93: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It was proposed that SRm160/300 functions in ESE-dependent splicing by mediating critical interactions between ESE-bound components and the snRNP machinery of the spliceosome. However, the mechanism by which SRm160/300 and other SR proteins promote spliceosome formation during ESE-dependent splicing is not understood.In previous studies it was proposed that one or more SR proteins bound to an ESE promote splicing by stabilizing the binding of U2AF-65 kDa to the polypyrimidine tract through protein-protein interactions mediated by U2AF-35 kDa (7Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 27Wang Z. Hoffmann H.M. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have tested this model by comparing the SR protein and U2AF-65 kDa composition of splicing complexes assembled on an ESE-dependent pre-mRNA derived from the doublesex gene ofDrosophila. We provide evidence that an ESE functions through interactions that are distinct from those required for the binding of U2AF-65 kDa to the polypyrimidine tract.DISCUSSIONThe results in the present study provide evidence that a purine-rich ESE is important for the stable association of hTra2β and several SR family proteins with the dsx pre-mRNA, but not U2AF-65 kDa. Instead, binding of U2AF-65 kDa is promoted by U1 snRNP. This indicates that an ESE promotes the formation of splicing complexes through interactions that are separate from those required for the binding of U2AF-65 kDa to the polypyrimidine tract. These findings are in contrast to those of previous studies in which it was reported that cross-linking of U2AF-65 kDa to pre-mRNAs containing suboptimal polypyrimidine tracts is increased in the presence of an ESE (27Wang Z. Hoffmann H.M. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar, 43Lavigueur A. Branche H.L. Kornblihtt A. Chabot B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2405-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar,44Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15169-15176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, in these studies the level of U2AF-65 kDa cross-linking was not found to correlate with increased splicing activity promoted by the ESE. In another study employing recombinant factors in the absence of nuclear extract, it was observed that efficient cross-linking of U2AF-65 kDa to the dsx pre-mRNA required the addition of a single SR family protein and U2AF-35 kDa (28Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the present study, binding of U2AF-65 kDa to the dsx pre-mRNAs was assayed in splicing reactions containing total nuclear extract without added factors. It is possible that the experimentally defined levels of SR proteins and U2AF subunits in the previous study resulted in the promotion of interactions that do not normally occur in splicing reactions. The present findings are consistent with a very recent report demonstrating that cross-linking of U2AF-65 kDa to two different ESE-dependent pre-mRNAs occurs with equal efficiency in the presence or absence of an ESE, and that immunodepletion of U2AF-35 kDa does not prevent ESE-dependent splicing in vitro (45Kan J.L.C. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has also been reported recently that the RS domain of the Drosophila homolog of U2AF-35 kDa, which was proposed to mediate interactions with ESE-bound SR proteins (7Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), is dispensable for viability and also the regulation of dsxpre-mRNA splicing (46Rudner D.Z. Breger K.S. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).An ESE consisting of six GAA repeats was sufficient for promoting the association of several SR proteins and hTra2β with the dsx pre-mRNA. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that SR proteins of these sizes can associate specifically with short RNAs consisting only of GAA repeats (23Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1705-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 34Yeakley J.M. Morfin J.P. Rosenfeld M.G. Fu X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7582-7587Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the present study these proteins were detected on the dsx(GAA)6pre-mRNA at different times during the splicing reaction, with the stable binding of “SRp75” appearing earlier than the 55-kDa, 40-kDa hTra2β, and 30-kDa SR protein(s). This indicates that different SR proteins and hTra2β may associate with the dsx pre-mRNA individually rather than as a pre-assembled complex. The increased detection over time of a slower migrating 30-kDa protein(s) detected by mAb104 on the dsx(GAA)6 pre-mRNA could reflect the recruitment of a distinct 30-kDa SR protein, or else the modification of one or more 30-kDa SR protein(s) already bound to this substrate. The latter case would be consistent with the previous observation that phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 is important for ESE-dependent splicing (12Xiao S.H. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The results in the present study demonstrate that the SR protein composition of complexes formed on the dsx pre-mRNA undergoes dynamic changes during ESE-dependent splicing.We have demonstrated recently that the level of binding of U1 snRNP to the dsx pre-mRNA substrate in the present study is approximately equivalent in the presence and absence of the ESE (25Eldridge A.G.

It was therefore unexpected that only minor levels of SR family proteins and hTra2β were detected on the dsx pre-mRNA in the absence of the ESE, since previous reports have indicated that SR proteins such as ASF/SF2 promote the binding to U1 snRNP to the 5′ splice site (8Kohtz J.D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, as in the previous U2AF binding studies cited above (28Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), these earlier studies assayed binding of U1 snRNP in reactions containing added purified components, whereas we have assayed binding in splicing reactions without added purified proteins. Although the low levels of SR proteins detected on the dsxΔE pre-mRNA could represent a population that functions in promoting the binding of U1 snRNP, the present results, taken together with those of Eldridgeet al. (25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), indicate that the increased SR protein and hTra2β association with the dsx pre-mRNA promoted by the ESE does not significantly influence U1 snRNP binding.We also demonstrated recently that U1 snRNP is strongly required for the association of both U2 snRNP and the SRm160/300 splicing coactivator with the dsx(GAA)6 pre-mRNA (25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the presence of U1 snRNP, but absence of the ESE, these components bound weakly to this substrate. Taken together with the results of the present study, we propose that U1 snRNP promotes two distinct sets of interactions during ESE-dependent splicing. One set involves ESE-independent interactions that are required for the binding of U2AF-65 kDa to the polypyrimidine tract, which then promotes partial binding of U2 snRNP to the branch site. This set of interactions likely involves previously proposed cross-intron interactions mediated by the branch site-binding factor SF1/mBBP, which interacts with U2AF-65 kDa and is also required for the stable binding of U2 snRNP to the branch site (47Kramer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4545-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 48Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The other set of interactions promoted by U1 snRNP simultaneously requires the ESE and functions to further stabilize the binding of U2 snRNP to the branch site, and also promotes the association of SRm160/300 with the pre-mRNA (25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This set of interactions does not influence the binding of U2AF to the pre-mRNA. Although depletion of SRm160/300 or U2 snRNP weakens but does not prevent the association of the other component with the dsx(GAA)6 pre-mRNA, these two components interact specifically (25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, instead of promoting splicing complex formation through interactions mediated by the U2AF heterodimer, one or more ESE-associated components, including the SRm160/300 splicing coactivator, may promote splicing by interacting directly with the snRNP machinery of the spliceosome. Pre-mRNA splicing requires the assembly of a large multisubunit complex, the spliceosome, which consists of four small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2 U4/U6, and U5 snRNPs) and numerous non-snRNP protein factors (1Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 2Burge C. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R. Cech T. Atkins J. RNA World II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies have provided evidence that over 50 proteins are required for constitutive splicing, many of which are highly conserved between yeast and mammals. In metazoans, a large number of non-snRNP protein splicing factors have been identified which contain domains rich in alternating serine and arginine residues (RS domains)1 (3Fu X.-D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 4Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Manley J. Tacke R.

Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A subgroup of these proteins, the SR family, contain one or two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs and a phosphorylated C-terminal RS domain. SR family proteins include SRp20, ASF/SF2, SC35, 9G8, SRp30c, SRp40/HRS, SRp55, SRp75, and a more distantly related protein, p54. These proteins promote general splicing activity and also function in regulated pre-mRNA splicing. SR proteins interact with each other and also with snRNP-associated proteins that contain RS domains and these interactions are mediated by phosphorylated RS domains (7Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 8Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Lührmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L.

Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These protein-protein interactions are important for promoting the recognition and pairing of splice sites and for subsequent steps in spliceosome assembly. The assembly of spliceosomes involves an ordered association of snRNPs and non-snRNP protein factors with the pre-mRNA (1Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). At an early stage in assembly, U1 snRNP binds to sequences at the 5′ splice site and promotes the binding of U2 snRNP to the intron branch site (13Barabino S.M.L. Blencowe B.J. Ryder U. Sproat B.S. Lamond A.I. Cell. 1990; 63: 293-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,14Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 59: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The stable binding of U2 snRNP to the branch site also requires the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF), which consists of two subunits, U2AF-65 kDa and U2AF-35 kDa (15Ruskin B. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 207-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). U2AF-65 kDa contains a short N-terminal RS domain followed by three RRMs and U2AF-35 kDa contains a short C-terminal RS domain (16Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 17Zhang M. Zamore P.D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lamond A.I. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8769-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). U2AF binds through the 65-kDa subunit to the polypyrimidine tract located between the branch site and 3′ splice site (18Zamore P.D. Green M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Following the assembly of a U2 snRNP-containing pre-splicing complex, U4/U6 and U5 snRNPs enter the assembly pathway as a pre-formed tri-snRNP particle which, together with additional protein factors, form an assembled spliceosome. In higher eukaryotes, the sequences specifying splice sites and the branch site are weakly conserved and are often surrounded by many cryptic splice sites that are not selected. Moreover, many pre-mRNAs in metazoan cells contain alternative splice sites that must be recognized in a regulated fashion to generate specific mRNA variants (reviewed in Refs. 19Wang J. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and 20Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Additional sequence elements within a pre-mRNA are important for splice site recognition and one type of element is the exonic splicing enhancer (ESE). One or more SR proteins bind to ESEs and promote the recognition of adjacent splice sites (reviewed in Refs. 3Fu X.-D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 4Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Manley J. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar and 21Chabot B. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). ESEs are often purine-rich although recent studies employing SELEX procedures have demonstrated that diverse sequences can function as enhancers in conjunction with different SR proteins (22Liu H.-X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 23Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1705-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that the splicing coactivator SRm160/300 (complex of SR-relatedmatrix proteins of 160kDa and300kDa) is required for ESE-dependent splicing (24Blencowe B.J. Issner R. Nickerson J.A. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 996-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The association of SRm160/300 with an ESE-dependent pre-mRNA requires U1 snRNP, factors bound to the ESE, and is stabilized by U2 snRNP. Independently of pre-mRNA, SRm160/300 interacts specifically with U2 snRNP and hTra2β, a human homolog of the Drosophila alternative splicing regulator Transformer-2 that binds to purine-rich ESEs (26Tacke R. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Manley J.L. Cell. 1998; 93: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It was proposed that SRm160/300 functions in ESE-dependent splicing by mediating critical interactions between ESE-bound components and the snRNP machinery of the spliceosome. However, the mechanism by which SRm160/300 and other SR proteins promote spliceosome formation during ESE-dependent splicing is not understood. In previous studies it was proposed that one or more SR proteins bound to an ESE promote splicing by stabilizing the binding of U2AF-65 kDa to the polypyrimidine tract through protein-protein interactions mediated by U2AF-35 kDa (7Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 27Wang Z. Hoffmann H.M. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have tested this model by comparing the SR protein and U2AF-65 kDa composition of splicing complexes assembled on an ESE-dependent pre-mRNA derived from the doublesex gene ofDrosophila. We provide evidence that an ESE functions through interactions that are distinct from those required for the binding of U2AF-65 kDa to the polypyrimidine tract. DISCUSSIONThe results in the present study provide evidence that a purine-rich ESE is important for the stable association of hTra2β and several SR family proteins with the dsx pre-mRNA, but not U2AF-65 kDa. Instead, binding of U2AF-65 kDa is promoted by U1 snRNP. This indicates that an ESE promotes the formation of splicing complexes through interactions that are separate from those required for the binding of U2AF-65 kDa to the polypyrimidine tract. These findings are in contrast to those of previous studies in which it was reported that cross-linking of U2AF-65 kDa to pre-mRNAs containing suboptimal polypyrimidine tracts is increased in the presence of an ESE (27Wang Z. Hoffmann H.M. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar, 43Lavigueur A. Branche H.L. Kornblihtt A. Chabot B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2405-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar,44Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15169-15176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, in these studies the level of U2AF-65 kDa cross-linking was not found to correlate with increased splicing activity promoted by the ESE. In another study employing recombinant factors in the absence of nuclear extract, it was observed that efficient cross-linking of U2AF-65 kDa to the dsx pre-mRNA required the addition of a single SR family protein and U2AF-35 kDa (28Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the present study, binding of U2AF-65 kDa to the dsx pre-mRNAs was assayed in splicing reactions containing total nuclear extract without added factors. It is possible that the experimentally defined levels of SR proteins and U2AF subunits in the previous study resulted in the promotion of interactions that do not normally occur in splicing reactions. The present findings are consistent with a very recent report demonstrating that cross-linking of U2AF-65 kDa to two different ESE-dependent pre-mRNAs occurs with equal efficiency in the presence or absence of an ESE, and that immunodepletion of U2AF-35 kDa does not prevent ESE-dependent splicing in vitro (45Kan J.L.C. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has also been reported recently that the RS domain of the Drosophila homolog of U2AF-35 kDa, which was proposed to mediate interactions with ESE-bound SR proteins (7Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), is dispensable for viability and also the regulation of dsxpre-mRNA splicing (46Rudner D.Z. Breger K.S. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).An ESE consisting of six GAA repeats was sufficient for promoting the association of several SR proteins and hTra2β with the dsx pre-mRNA. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that SR proteins of these sizes can associate specifically with short RNAs consisting only of GAA repeats (23Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1705-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 34Yeakley J.M. Morfin J.P. Rosenfeld M.G. Fu X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7582-7587Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the present study these proteins were detected on the dsx(GAA)6pre-mRNA at different times during the splicing reaction, with the stable binding of “SRp75” appearing earlier than the 55-kDa, 40-kDa hTra2β, and 30-kDa SR protein(s). This indicates that different SR proteins and hTra2β may associate with the dsx pre-mRNA individually rather than as a pre-assembled complex. The increased detection over time of a slower migrating 30-kDa protein(s) detected by mAb104 on the dsx(GAA)6 pre-mRNA could reflect the recruitment of a distinct 30-kDa SR protein, or else the modification of one or more 30-kDa SR protein(s) already bound to this substrate. The latter case would be consistent with the previous observation that phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 is important for ESE-dependent splicing (12Xiao S.H. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The results in the present study demonstrate that the SR protein composition of complexes formed on the dsx pre-mRNA undergoes dynamic changes during ESE-dependent splicing.We have demonstrated recently that the level of binding of U1 snRNP to the dsx pre-mRNA substrate in the present study is approximately equivalent in the presence and absence of the ESE (25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It was therefore unexpected that only minor levels of SR family proteins and hTra2β were detected on the dsx pre-mRNA in the absence of the ESE, since previous reports have indicated that SR proteins such as ASF/SF2 promote the binding to U1 snRNP to the 5′ splice site (8Kohtz J.D.

The other set of interactions promoted by U1 snRNP simultaneously requires the ESE and functions to further stabilize the binding of U2 snRNP to the branch site, and also promotes the association of SRm160/300 with the pre-mRNA (25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This set of interactions does not influence the binding of U2AF to the pre-mRNA. Although depletion of SRm160/300 or U2 snRNP weakens but does not prevent the association of the other component with the dsx(GAA)6 pre-mRNA, these two components interact specifically (25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).

Although the low levels of SR proteins detected on the dsxΔE pre-mRNA could represent a population that functions in promoting the binding of U1 snRNP, the present results, taken together with those of Eldridgeet al. (25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), indicate that the increased SR protein and hTra2β association with the dsx pre-mRNA promoted by the ESE does not significantly influence U1 snRNP binding. We also demonstrated recently that U1 snRNP is strongly required for the association of both U2 snRNP and the SRm160/300 splicing coactivator with the dsx(GAA)6 pre-mRNA (25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the presence of U1 snRNP, but absence of the ESE, these components bound weakly to this substrate. Taken together with the results of the present study, we propose that U1 snRNP promotes two distinct sets of interactions during ESE-dependent splicing. One set involves ESE-independent interactions that are required for the binding of U2AF-65 kDa to the polypyrimidine tract, which then promotes partial binding of U2 snRNP to the branch site. This set of interactions likely involves previously proposed cross-intron interactions mediated by the branch site-binding factor SF1/mBBP, which interacts with U2AF-65 kDa and is also required for the stable binding of U2 snRNP to the branch site (47Kramer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4545-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 48Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The other set of interactions promoted by U1 snRNP simultaneously requires the ESE and functions to further stabilize the binding of U2 snRNP to the branch site, and also promotes the association of SRm160/300 with the pre-mRNA (25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This set of interactions does not influence the binding of U2AF to the pre-mRNA. Although depletion of SRm160/300 or U2 snRNP weakens but does not prevent the association of the other component with the dsx(GAA)6 pre-mRNA, these two components interact specifically (25Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, instead of promoting splicing complex formation through interactions mediated by the U2AF heterodimer, one or more ESE-associated components, including the SRm160/300 splicing coactivator, may promote splicing by interacting directly with the snRNP machinery of the spliceosome.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) DREF proteins have been cloned and characterized. Various in vivo experiments have revealed that DRE is essential for the function of the PCNA promoter both in embryos and in larvae (15Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Nishimoto Y. Hirose F. Matsukage A. J.

Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).We have also identified two E2F recognition sites (nucleotide positions −56 to −36 with respect to the cap site) in the region downstream of the PCNA gene DRE (−100 to −93) (23Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25159-25165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Multiple E2F sites have been also identified in the promoters of the Drosophila DNA polymerase α 180-kDa subunit (24Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the 73-kDa subunit (16Takahashi Y. Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Cotterill S. Kobayashi J. Miyajima S. Matsukage A. J. Biol.

In mammals, E2F and its heterodimeric partner DP associate to E2F sites for activation of the target genes (25Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). cDNAs have been cloned for the Drosophila counterparts dE2F, dE2F2, and dDP (26Dynlacht B.D. Brook A. Dembski M. Yenush L.

Commun. 1998; 251: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Transcription of DNA polymerase α and PCNA genes is completely lost in dE2F or dDP mutant embryos after division cycle 16, indicating that dE2F and dDP are essential for transcription of these DNA replication-related genes (29Duronio R.J. O'Farrell P.H. Xie J.E. Brook A. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1445-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 30Royzman I. Whittaker A.J. Orr-Weaver T.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1999-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The function of dE2F2 has yet to be determined. Analyses with transgenic flies demonstrated that two E2F sites are essential for PCNA promoter activity throughout development (23Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25159-25165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, E2F sites alone proved to be insufficient for PCNA promoter activity during embryonic and larval stages, because deletion of the upstream region containing DRE completely abolished the promoter activity during these stages (23Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25159-25165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).In addition to DRE and E2F sites, the PCNA promoter contains three common regulatory factor for DNA replication and DREF genes (CFDD) recognition sites, site 1 (−84 to −77), site 2 (−100 to −93), and site 3 (−134 to −127) (31Hayashi Y. Hirose F. Nishimoto Y. Shiraki M. Yamagishi M. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22848-22858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Among these three, at least site 1 could be demonstrated to play an important role in promoter activity in both cultured cells and living flies (31Hayashi Y. Hirose F. Nishimoto Y. Shiraki M. Yamagishi M. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22848-22858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition to the PCNA gene, multiple CFDD sites were found in promoters of the DNA polymerase α and DREF genes (31Hayashi Y. Hirose F. Nishimoto Y. Shiraki M. Yamagishi M. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22848-22858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Another important regulatory element for the PCNA promoter is the upstream regulatory element (URE) located in the region from nucleotide positions −168 to −119 (22Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Matsukage A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). URE, in addition to the E2F sites, CFDD sites, and DRE, appears to be essential for activation of the PCNA promoter in larvae (22Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Matsukage A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A protein factor(s), which specifically binds to URE, has hitherto not been identified. In the present study, we detected one such binding factor, the URE-binding factor (UREF) that recognizes the sequence 5′-AAACCAGTTGGCA. A yeast one-hybrid screen using URE as the bait allowed isolation of a cDNA encoding a transcription factor, Grainyhead (GRH/NTF-1) (32Bray S.J. Burke B. Brown N.H. Hirsh J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1130-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33Dynlacht B.D. Attardi L.D. Admon A. Freeman M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that GRH is a likely candidate for UREF with possible roles in regulation of the PCNA promoter in vivo.DISCUSSIONThe Drosophila PCNA gene promoter contains multiple regulatory elements including URE, DRE, E2F, and CFDD sites (Fig. 1). In the present study, we detected a protein factor, UREF that binds to the region between −130 and −118 of the PCNA promoter. One-hybrid screening using UREF-binding site as a bait allowed cloning of a GRH cDNA. The nucleotide sequence required for binding to the GST-GRH fusion protein was indistinguishable from that for UREF, and a specific antibody to GRH reacted with UREF in embryo nuclear extracts. From these results we conclude that UREF is identical to GRH.GRH is present in several tissues, where it appears to participate in different developmental programs. GRH is expressed in cuticle secreting cells during embryogenesis (32Bray S.J. Burke B. Brown N.H. Hirsh J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1130-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and one of the putative target genes in these cells is the dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) gene, which is essential for cuticle formation (35Bray S.J. Kafatos F.C. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1672-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 50Kramer K.J. Hopkins T.L. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 6: 279-301Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). GRH also appears to function as a transcriptional activator to regulate several other genes involved in epidermal development, including Ultrabithorax(Ubx), engrailed, and fushi tarazu(ftz) (33Dynlacht B.D. Attardi L.D. Admon A. Freeman M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 49Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 51Biggin M.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 53: 699-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). GRH is also present in a particular set of cells in the embryonic and larval central nervous system (37Uv A.E. Harrison E.J. Bray S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 52Attardi L.D. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although its target gene(s) in this site has yet to be identified. GRH may further function as a repressor, contributing to the mechanisms that restrict the expression of tailless anddecapentaplegic to particular domains in embryo termini (53Liaw G.J. Rudolph K.M. Huang J.D. Dubnicoff T. Courey A.J. Lengyel J.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3163-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,54Huang J.D. Dubnicoff T. Liaw G.J. Bai Y. Valentine S.A. Shirokawa J.M. Lengyel J.A. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3177-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although there is no indication so far of a role in cell cycle regulation or DNA replication, this is suggested by our present data.The human α-globin transcription factor CP2 has been identified as a mammalian homologue of GRH/NTF-1 (52Attardi L.D. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 55Lim L.C. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 828-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Uv A.E. Thompson C.R.L. Bray S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4020-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CP2 is identical to LBP-1c/UBP-1, which binds to multiple sites within the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (57Jones K.A. Luciw P.A. Duchange N. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 58Wu F.K. Garcia J.A. Harrich D. Gayner R.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2117-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 59Kato H. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1991; 251: 1476-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). CP2/LBP-1c/UBP-1 is also identical to the transcription factor LSF that specifically binds to and stimulates transcription from the SV40 major late promoter (60Huang H.-C. Sundseth R. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LSF also binds to sites within thec-fos gene, ornithine decarboxylase gene, andthymidylate synthase gene promoters (61Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 62Shirra M.K. Hansen U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19260-19268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Activation of these cellular gene promoters and the SV40 late gene promoter is reported to be coupled with cell proliferation (63Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar, 64Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 243: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 65Feinstein S.C. Dana S.L.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5525-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has also been noted that LSF is rapidly phosphorylated on mitogenic stimulation of resting T cells and its DNA binding activity is enhanced by this phosphorylation (61Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of LSF-binding sites to activation of these cell cycle-regulated genes has yet to be determined. Our findings indicate that a GRH-binding site positively regulates the Drosophila PCNA gene, a DNA replication-related gene. The observation provides the first direct evidence for an involvement of GRH in regulation of DNA replication-related genes.The nucleotide sequence required for binding to UREF (GRH) in the PCNA gene promoter was determined to be 5′-AAACCAGTTGGCA. This sequence matches 8 of 12 nucleotides of GRH-binding element 1 (be1, 5′-GAAACCGGTTAT) and 6 of 12 nucleotides of GRH-binding element 2 (be2, 5′-TGAACCGGTCCT), respectively, in the Ddc gene (37Uv A.E. Harrison E.J. Bray S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Sharing of nucleotides was also found between the binding site in the PCNA gene promoter and the NTF-1 (GRH)-binding consensus, 5′-(T/C)NAAC(C/TGGT(T/C )(T/C)TGCGG examined with ftz, Ubx and Ddc genes (33Dynlacht B.D. Attardi L.D. Admon A. Freeman M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The element be1 functions in all GRH-expressing cells including the epidermis and the central nervous system, whereas the element be2 functions exclusively in the CNS (37Uv A.E. Harrison E.J. Bray S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The higher similarity between the binding site in the PCNA promoter and in be1 may reflect some function in wide variety of proliferating cells. In addition, the UREF (GRH) binding sequence in the PCNA promoter is also similar to the reported binding consensus sequence (5′-ANCACCTGTTNNCA) for the Drosophila snail gene product and its related proteins (67Kasai Y. Nambu J.R. Lieberman P.M. Crews S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 89: 3414-3418Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 68Fuse N. Hirose S. Hayashi S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2270-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, bacterially expressed Snail protein did not bind to the site in a band mobility shift assay (data not shown).Although transgenic third instar larvae having a mutation in the UREF (GRH)-binding site (mutβ) had a reduced staining signal in the salivary glands, further reduction was observed with flies having a deletion to the position −119. The results thus indicate that the region upstream of the UREF (GRH)-binding site can stimulate PCNA promoter activity in the salivary glands. Other transcription factor(s) therefore might bind to an adjacent site upstream of the UREF (GRH)-binding site, although we have not succeeded in detecting such binding activity yet. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)1 is required for replication of simian virus 40 (SV40) (1Tsurimoto T. Melendy T. Stillman B.

In previous studies of the Drosophila genes for PCNA and DNA polymerase α, we found a common 8-base pair sequence named the DNA replication-related element (DRE) (14Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H.

Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs and genes for D. melanogaster (20Hirose F. Yamaguchi M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) DREF proteins have been cloned and characterized. Various in vivo experiments have revealed that DRE is essential for the function of the PCNA promoter both in embryos and in larvae (15Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Nishimoto Y. Hirose F. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15808-15814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,22Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Matsukage A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have also identified two E2F recognition sites (nucleotide positions −56 to −36 with respect to the cap site) in the region downstream of the PCNA gene DRE (−100 to −93) (23Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25159-25165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Multiple E2F sites have been also identified in the promoters of the Drosophila DNA polymerase α 180-kDa subunit (24Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the 73-kDa subunit (16Takahashi Y. Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Cotterill S. Kobayashi J. Miyajima S. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14541-14547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In mammals, E2F and its heterodimeric partner DP associate to E2F sites for activation of the target genes (25Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). cDNAs have been cloned for the Drosophila counterparts dE2F, dE2F2, and dDP (26Dynlacht B.D. Brook A. Dembski M. Yenush L.

Commun. 1998; 251: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Transcription of DNA polymerase α and PCNA genes is completely lost in dE2F or dDP mutant embryos after division cycle 16, indicating that dE2F and dDP are essential for transcription of these DNA replication-related genes (29Duronio R.J. O'Farrell P.H. Xie J.E. Brook A. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1445-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 30Royzman I. Whittaker A.J. Orr-Weaver T.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1999-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The function of dE2F2 has yet to be determined. Analyses with transgenic flies demonstrated that two E2F sites are essential for PCNA promoter activity throughout development (23Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25159-25165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, E2F sites alone proved to be insufficient for PCNA promoter activity during embryonic and larval stages, because deletion of the upstream region containing DRE completely abolished the promoter activity during these stages (23Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25159-25165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition to DRE and E2F sites, the PCNA promoter contains three common regulatory factor for DNA replication and DREF genes (CFDD) recognition sites, site 1 (−84 to −77), site 2 (−100 to −93), and site 3 (−134 to −127) (31Hayashi Y. Hirose F. Nishimoto Y. Shiraki M. Yamagishi M. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22848-22858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Among these three, at least site 1 could be demonstrated to play an important role in promoter activity in both cultured cells and living flies (31Hayashi Y. Hirose F. Nishimoto Y. Shiraki M. Yamagishi M. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22848-22858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition to the PCNA gene, multiple CFDD sites were found in promoters of the DNA polymerase α and DREF genes (31Hayashi Y. Hirose F. Nishimoto Y. Shiraki M. Yamagishi M. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22848-22858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Another important regulatory element for the PCNA promoter is the upstream regulatory element (URE) located in the region from nucleotide positions −168 to −119 (22Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Matsukage A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). URE, in addition to the E2F sites, CFDD sites, and DRE, appears to be essential for activation of the PCNA promoter in larvae (22Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Matsukage A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A protein factor(s), which specifically binds to URE, has hitherto not been identified. In the present study, we detected one such binding factor, the URE-binding factor (UREF) that recognizes the sequence 5′-AAACCAGTTGGCA. A yeast one-hybrid screen using URE as the bait allowed isolation of a cDNA encoding a transcription factor, Grainyhead (GRH/NTF-1) (32Bray S.J. Burke B. Brown N.H. Hirsh J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1130-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33Dynlacht B.D. Attardi L.D. Admon A. Freeman M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that GRH is a likely candidate for UREF with possible roles in regulation of the PCNA promoter in vivo. DISCUSSIONThe Drosophila PCNA gene promoter contains multiple regulatory elements including URE, DRE, E2F, and CFDD sites (Fig. 1). In the present study, we detected a protein factor, UREF that binds to the region between −130 and −118 of the PCNA promoter. One-hybrid screening using UREF-binding site as a bait allowed cloning of a GRH cDNA. The nucleotide sequence required for binding to the GST-GRH fusion protein was indistinguishable from that for UREF, and a specific antibody to GRH reacted with UREF in embryo nuclear extracts. From these results we conclude that UREF is identical to GRH.GRH is present in several tissues, where it appears to participate in different developmental programs. GRH is expressed in cuticle secreting cells during embryogenesis (32Bray S.J. Burke B. Brown N.H. Hirsh J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1130-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and one of the putative target genes in these cells is the dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) gene, which is essential for cuticle formation (35Bray S.J. Kafatos F.C. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1672-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 50Kramer K.J. Hopkins T.L. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 6: 279-301Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). GRH also appears to function as a transcriptional activator to regulate several other genes involved in epidermal development, including Ultrabithorax(Ubx), engrailed, and fushi tarazu(ftz) (33Dynlacht B.D. Attardi L.D. Admon A. Freeman M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 49Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 51Biggin M.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 53: 699-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). GRH is also present in a particular set of cells in the embryonic and larval central nervous system (37Uv A.E. Harrison E.J. Bray S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 52Attardi L.D. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although its target gene(s) in this site has yet to be identified. GRH may further function as a repressor, contributing to the mechanisms that restrict the expression of tailless anddecapentaplegic to particular domains in embryo termini (53Liaw G.J. Rudolph K.M. Huang J.D. Dubnicoff T. Courey A.J. Lengyel J.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3163-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,54Huang J.D. Dubnicoff T. Liaw G.J. Bai Y. Valentine S.A. Shirokawa J.M. Lengyel J.A. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3177-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although there is no indication so far of a role in cell cycle regulation or DNA replication, this is suggested by our present data.The human α-globin transcription factor CP2 has been identified as a mammalian homologue of GRH/NTF-1 (52Attardi L.D. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 55Lim L.C. Swendeman S.L. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 828-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Uv A.E. Thompson C.R.L. Bray S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4020-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CP2 is identical to LBP-1c/UBP-1, which binds to multiple sites within the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (57Jones K.A. Luciw P.A. Duchange N. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 58Wu F.K. Garcia J.A. Harrich D. Gayner R.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2117-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 59Kato H. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1991; 251: 1476-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). CP2/LBP-1c/UBP-1 is also identical to the transcription factor LSF that specifically binds to and stimulates transcription from the SV40 major late promoter (60Huang H.-C. Sundseth R. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LSF also binds to sites within thec-fos gene, ornithine decarboxylase gene, andthymidylate synthase gene promoters (61Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 62Shirra M.K. Hansen U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19260-19268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Activation of these cellular gene promoters and the SV40 late gene promoter is reported to be coupled with cell proliferation (63Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar, 64Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 243: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 65Feinstein S.C. Dana S.L.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5525-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has also been noted that LSF is rapidly phosphorylated on mitogenic stimulation of resting T cells and its DNA binding activity is enhanced by this phosphorylation (61Volker J.L. Rameh L.E. Zhu Q. DeCaprio J. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of LSF-binding sites to activation of these cell cycle-regulated genes has yet to be determined. Our findings indicate that a GRH-binding site positively regulates the Drosophila PCNA gene, a DNA replication-related gene. The observation provides the first direct evidence for an involvement of GRH in regulation of DNA replication-related genes.The nucleotide sequence required for binding to UREF (GRH) in the PCNA gene promoter was determined to be 5′-AAACCAGTTGGCA. This sequence matches 8 of 12 nucleotides of GRH-binding element 1 (be1, 5′-GAAACCGGTTAT) and 6 of 12 nucleotides of GRH-binding element 2 (be2, 5′-TGAACCGGTCCT), respectively, in the Ddc gene (37Uv A.E. Harrison E.J. Bray S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Sharing of nucleotides was also found between the binding site in the PCNA gene promoter and the NTF-1 (GRH)-binding consensus, 5′-(T/C)NAAC(C/TGGT(T/C )(T/C)TGCGG examined with ftz, Ubx and Ddc genes (33Dynlacht B.D. Attardi L.D. Admon A. Freeman M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The element be1 functions in all GRH-expressing cells including the epidermis and the central nervous system, whereas the element be2 functions exclusively in the CNS (37Uv A.E. Harrison E.J. Bray S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The higher similarity between the binding site in the PCNA promoter and in be1 may reflect some function in wide variety of proliferating cells. In addition, the UREF (GRH) binding sequence in the PCNA promoter is also similar to the reported binding consensus sequence (5′-ANCACCTGTTNNCA) for the Drosophila snail gene product and its related proteins (67Kasai Y. Nambu J.R. Lieberman P.M. Crews S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 89: 3414-3418Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 68Fuse N. Hirose S. Hayashi S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2270-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, bacterially expressed Snail protein did not bind to the site in a band mobility shift assay (data not shown).Although transgenic third instar larvae having a mutation in the UREF (GRH)-binding site (mutβ) had a reduced staining signal in the salivary glands, further reduction was observed with flies having a deletion to the position −119. The results thus indicate that the region upstream of the UREF (GRH)-binding site can stimulate PCNA promoter activity in the salivary glands. Other transcription factor(s) therefore might bind to an adjacent site upstream of the UREF (GRH)-binding site, although we have not succeeded in detecting such binding activity yet. The Drosophila PCNA gene promoter contains multiple regulatory elements including URE, DRE, E2F, and CFDD sites (Fig. 1). In the present study, we detected a protein factor, UREF that binds to the region between −130 and −118 of the PCNA promoter. One-hybrid screening using UREF-binding site as a bait allowed cloning of a GRH cDNA.

The higher similarity between the binding site in the PCNA promoter and in be1 may reflect some function in wide variety of proliferating cells. In addition, the UREF (GRH) binding sequence in the PCNA promoter is also similar to the reported binding consensus sequence (5′-ANCACCTGTTNNCA) for the Drosophila snail gene product and its related proteins (67Kasai Y. Nambu J.R. Lieberman P.M. Crews S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 89: 3414-3418Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 68Fuse N. Hirose S. Hayashi S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2270-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, bacterially expressed Snail protein did not bind to the site in a band mobility shift assay (data not shown). Although transgenic third instar larvae having a mutation in the UREF (GRH)-binding site (mutβ) had a reduced staining signal in the salivary glands, further reduction was observed with flies having a deletion to the position −119. The results thus indicate that the region upstream of the UREF (GRH)-binding site can stimulate PCNA promoter activity in the salivary glands. Other transcription factor(s) therefore might bind to an adjacent site upstream of the UREF (GRH)-binding site, although we have not succeeded in detecting such binding activity yet. We thank Drs S. Bray for providing GRH cDNAs, S. Elledge for the λACT-Drosophila cDNA library, and M. Moore for comments on the English language used in the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1986719666,"Territrem B (TRB) is a fungal metabolite isolated from Aspergillus terreus shown previously to be a potent and irreversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In the present study, a number of binding and inhibition assays were carried out to further characterize the inhibitory effect of TRB. The results indicate that the binding of TRB (a) is much more selective than a well characterized selective inhibitor of AChE, BW284C51, (b) adopts a one-to-one stoichiometry with the enzyme, (c) cannot be undone by an AChE-regenerating oxime agent, which contrasts the ability of 8 m urea to release AChE-bound TRB, (d) is enhanced by high concentration NaCl but prevented, unless preincubated, by Triton X-100, and (e) exhibits quasi-first order kinetics with an overall inhibition constant of 0.01 nm−1min−1. Together these results suggest a very different irreversible binding (a noncovalent type) from that of the covalent type, which involves typical irreversible AChE inhibitors such as diisopropylfluorophosphate and neostigmine. According to the prediction of a molecular modeling study, the distinct AChE inhibitory characteristics of TRB may arise from the inhibitor being noncovalently trapped within a unique active-site gorge structure of the enzyme. It was predicted that an optimal TRB·AChE binding would position a narrowing connection of the TRB structure at a constricted area near the entrance of the gorge, thereby providing a structural basis for the observed irreversible binding.

An unusual feature revealed by the crystal structure of this enzyme (3Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar) is that its catalytic center is buried at the bottom of a narrow gorge approximately 20 Å in length. Instead of illuminating, this gorge structure further mystifies the mechanism of the catalytic power of AChE and consequently inspires intriguing hypotheses from a number of theoretical investigations (4Ripoll D.R.

On the other hand, the long and narrow substrate passage and multiple reaction subsites provide ample places upon which inhibitors may act, which helps explain the fact that a structurally diverse set of compounds can inhibit AChE with differing inhibitory kinetics and action mechanisms (9Taylor P. Radic Z. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 281-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). There are two major types of AChE inhibitors (9Taylor P. Radic Z. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 281-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 10Taylor P. Neurology. 1998; 51 Suppl. 1: 830-835Google Scholar): (a) those that inactivate the enzyme by carbamoylating or phosphorylating the catalytic serine (the inhibition of this type is irreversible, but regeneration of the enzyme activity can be achieved via deacetylation (e.g. using an agent such as pyridine-2-aldoxime methiodide, 2-PAM)) and (b) those that inactivate the enzyme by blocking the access of the substrate to the active center and/or by inducing defective conformational change of the enzyme with noncovalent binding (the inhibition of this type is reversible). Both types of AChE inhibitors are current targets of drug development for treating Alzheimer's disease (10Taylor P. Neurology. 1998; 51 Suppl. 1: 830-835Google Scholar). About three decades ago, Ling and co-workers (52Tung S.-S. Ling K.-H. Tsai S.-E. Chung C.-H. Wang J.-J. Tung T.-C. J. Formosan Med. Assoc. 1971; 70: 251-257Google Scholar) found that the stored unhulled rice of Taiwan was heavily polluted by the three major groups of fungi—Aspergillus, Penicillium, andRhizopus. A family of fungal metabolites was subsequently isolated from the chloroform extracts of submerged rice culture ofAspergillus terreus 23-1. These fungal metabolites were given the name “territrem” to indicate their biological origin ofA. terr eus and thetremorgenic activities they induced in rat and mice (reviewed in Ref. 11Ling K.H. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1994; 13: 243-252Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In an experiment with the central neuron of the snail Achatinae fatice, it was further found that territrem B (TRB) potentiates the acetylcholine-induced current of the neuron but has no effect on γ-aminobutyric acid - orl-glutamate-elicited currents (12Arvanov V.L. Ling K.H. Chen R.C. Tsai M.C. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 152: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the tremorgenic effects of territrems arise from their being a potent inhibitor of AChE. This suggestion was first supported by the observed inhibitory activities of territrems on AChE extracted from the head of an insect (13Dowd P.F. Peng F.C. Chen J.W. Ling K.H. Entomol. Exp. Appl. 1992; 65: 57-64Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More recently, TRB and other members of the territrem family were shown to bind tightly and inhibit irreversibly eel AChE with an IC50 value in the order of 10−8m (14Chen J.W. Ling K.H. J. Biomed. Sci. 1996; 3: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Independently, Omura et al. (15Omura S. Kuno F. Otoguro K. Sunazuka T. Shiomi K. Masuma R. Iwai Y. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 48: 745-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) confirmed that territrems are potent AChE inhibitors by reporting the inhibitory activities of TRB and territrem C (TRC) on AChE from human erythrocytes. Omura's group additionally showed that several analogs of territrem isolated from rice culture broth ofPenicillium sp. FO-4259, which the researchers called arisugacins, are highly specific and potent AChE inhibitors as well (15Omura S. Kuno F. Otoguro K. Sunazuka T. Shiomi K. Masuma R. Iwai Y. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 48: 745-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 16Otoguro K. Kuno F. Omura S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 76: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both territrems and arisugacins are composed of a basic structure that includes a benzyl group, a pyran, and a terpenoid (Fig.1). The notable absence of nitrogen in these compounds, as in onchidal (18Abramson S.N. Radic Z. Manker D. Faulkner D.J. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 349-354PubMed Google Scholar), is unlike other known AChE inhibitors. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of TRB AChE inhibition using both kinetic and molecular modeling studies. Our data indicate that TRB does not form a covalent bond with the enzyme. This result is counterintuitive. One would expect the opposite due to the irreversibility of the inhibition. However, the finding that TRB does not form a covalent bond with the enzyme is consistent with its lack of a carbamate and a phosphate moiety, which could otherwise react with the active serine of the enzyme. By searching for a probable binding mode between TRB and AChE through extensive docking simulations, a structural model of their complex was derived. This model appears to explain the novel noncovalent yet irreversible AChE-inhibiting mechanism of TRB. A. terreus 23-1 was cultivated, and TRB was isolated as described by Ling et al. (19Ling K.H. Yang C.K. Kuo C.A. Kuo M.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1982; 44: 860-863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ling K.H. Liou H.H. Yang C.M. Yang C.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1984; 47: 98-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRB with a purity greater than 99.5% was achieved by two-dimensional TLC (21Peng F.C. Ling K.H. Wang Y. Lee G.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1985; 49: 721-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and high performance liquid chromatography (22Ling K.H. Yang C.K. Huang H.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1979; 37: 358-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of TRB in methanol was determined spectrophotometrically and calculated from the molar absorption coefficient of 18,400 at 331 nm in methanol (23Ling K.H. Chang M.F. Tsai S.C. Peng Y.W. Chen B.J. Wang E.C. Mycotoxin Res. 1987; 3: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). [14C]TRB was synthesized from TRC and [14C]dimethylsulfate (24Ling K.H. Chiou C.M. Tseng Y.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 587-595PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylthiocholine iodide, butyrylthiocholine iodide, neostigmine bromide, 1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl)pentan-3-one dibromide (BW284C51), 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and Triton X-100 were obtained from Merck. Sephadex G-50 (fine) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 2,5-Diphenyloxazole, 1,4-bis-2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)benzene, and [14C]dimethylsulfate (11.5 mCi/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. Electric eel AChE (1000–12,000 units/mg of protein) and horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, 100–150 units/mg of protein) were purchased from Sigma. The stock solutions of TRB and of neostigmine were prepared in methanol. Before use, these stock solutions were diluted with 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, until the content of methanol was about 10% in the working solutions. The final content of methanol in the assay was less than 1%. This content of methanol had no effect on the enzyme activity assayed, either for AChE or for BChE. The stock solution of BW284C51 was prepared by dissolving in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, without the aid of methanol. The stock solution of DFP was prepared by dissolving in isopropanol to make a 0.2 × 10−3m solution. A package of 1000 units of eel AChE or horse serum BChE was dissolved in 200 ml 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, to produce the working solution of AChE or BChE, respectively. In the experiment with NaCl or Triton X-100, the working enzyme solution contained 1 m NaCl or 1% Triton X-100. Enzyme activity was determined as described previously (14Chen J.W. Ling K.H. J. Biomed. Sci. 1996; 3: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and according to the colorimetric method of Ellman et al. (25Ellman G.L. Gourtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21719) Google Scholar). The concentration of the catalytic subunit of AChE in the working enzyme solution was calculated using a molar catalytic efficiency of 6.0 × 105m acetylthiocholine hydrolyzed/min at 25 °C (26Gordon M.A. Carpenter D.E. Willson J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 266-270PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same procedures were followed for the experiment with BChE, except that the substrate used was butyrylthiocholine and the enzyme used was horse serum BChE. Other specifics of the individual inhibition studies are separately described below. A Sephadex G-50 column (0.5 × 25 cm) was equilibrated with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and eluted with the same buffer after application of the sample. Each 0.5-ml of effluent was collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For an aqueous sample, the mixture was a mixture of toluene, Triton X-100 (1:1 by volume) containing 0.8% 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 0.02% 1,4-bis-2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)benzene (28Fox B.W. Int. J. Appl. Radiat. Isotopes. 1968; 19: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The radioactivity was counted with a Packard liquid scintillation analyzer, model 2200 CA. 5 μl of various concentrations of TRB (40–33 nm in 10% methanol solution) were added to each 45 μl of the AChE working solution (6 nm of catalytic subunit) and then preincubated at 25 °C. At different time points during preincubation, 3 ml of the AChE assay solution was introduced, and the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis was measured. The results were analyzed by the method of Kitz and Wilson (29Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each 40 μl of AChE (1.25 μm of catalytic subunit) was incubated with 40 μl of [14C]TRB (0–2.5 μm dissolved in 0.1m phosphate buffer at pH 7.0). After 1 h of incubation, an aliquot (60 μl) of the incubation mixture was applied to a G-50 column for gel filtration analysis. Each 0.5 ml of effluent was analyzed by scintillation counting. The total counts that appeared in the fractions 3 and 4, where AChE activity was found, were regarded as bound [14C]TRB. The concentration of the bound [14C]TRB was calculated from its specific activity (4.5 Ci/mol). To assay AChE activity, another aliquot (20 μl) of a 100-fold diluted solution of the above incubation mixture was used. The percent of AChE inhibition was determined by comparing the enzyme activity determined in the presence of TRB to that determined in the absence of TRB. AChE (the working enzyme solution) was incubated with either 2 × 10−5m DFP or 1.5 × 10−8m TRB in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, until more than 99% of the AChE activity was inhibited. At 80 min after the addition of DFP or TRB, the inhibited enzyme was allowed to incubate with 2-PAM (0.04 m at the incubation). At different periods of incubation, 20-μl aliquots were removed for determination of AChE activity. The ratio of enzyme activity relative to control (i.e. activity measured in the absence of TRB inhibition) was determined. Three specimens (A, B, and C) were made as follows. Specimen A had 25 μl of 1 μm [14C]TRB, 25 μl of bovine serum albumin (0.4 mg), and 50 μl of 0.1 mphosphate buffer of pH 7.0. The content of specimen B was the same as that of specimen A, except that the 50 μl of 0.1 mphosphate buffer was replaced by 50 μl of 1.25 μm AChE in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, such that the molar ratio of AChE subunit to [14C]TRB was 2.5:1. Specimen C had the same content as that of specimen B plus 72 mg of urea. Specimens A and B were applied separately on different G-50 columns for gel filtration analyses. Specimen C was applied on another G-50 column previously equilibrated with a 0.1 m phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 containing 8 m urea and was then eluted with the same solvent used in equilibration. Each 0.5 ml of the effluent was collected for determination of the absorbance at 280 nm, radioactivity, and AChE activity. Preincubation of aliquots (2.97 ml each) of the working enzyme solution of eel AChE or horse serum BChE with 30 μl of different concentrations of TRB or BW284C51 was carried out for 20 min at 25 °C. The enzyme assay was then performed by adding a mixture of 100 μl of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and 20 μl of acetylthiocholine or butyrylthiocholine to the aliquot. The enzyme activity of an experimental control, which contained the same components as the test solution except that the inhibitor was replaced with an equal amount of methanol, was regarded as 100% activity. By comparison to 100% activity of the control assay, the percent of enzyme inhibition for the inhibitor-containing solution was deduced. TRB (10−6min methanol) and neostigmine (10−5m in a 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) were diluted 10-fold with 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, or with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. An aliquot (180 μl) of the AChE working solution prepared in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, or in the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl was allowed to incubate with 20 μl of either TRB or neostigmine at 25 °C. At the indicated time of incubation, 20 μl of the above mixture was sampled for AChE activity assay. The experimental procedures were the same as those described in the experiment with NaCl, except that 1% Triton X-100 was present in the buffer instead of NaCl. An additional experiment was carried out as follows. A solution of AChE and TRB was incubated in the absence of Triton X-100 as described above. At 12 min after incubation, the incubation mixture was diluted 2-fold to form a solution containing 1% Triton X-100. At the indicated time of further incubation, 40 μl of the 2-fold-diluted mixture was added to the assay solution for determination of AChE activity. The structure of TRB, as determined by x-ray (30Hsu T.H. Yang C.K. Ling K.H. Wang C.J. Tang C.P. Crystallogr. Struct. Commun. 1982; 11: 199-206Google Scholar), is rather thin and long (Fig. 1 B). Our modeling began with an alignment of the long axis of TRB with that of the gorge of AChE (Protein Data Bank code 2ace (31Harel M. Quinn D.M Nair H.K. Silman I. Sussman J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2340-2346Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar)) and superimposing the respective geometric centers of the two. The gorge axis was defined by connecting the geometric center of Phe-448 side chain with the midpoint between Phe-330 and Tyr-121. This axis is not identical but is close to the one used by others (32Antosiewicz J. McCammon J.A. Wlodek S.T. Gilson M.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4211-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A total of 3024 (14 × 12 × 9 × 2) initial AChE·TRB complex structures were then generated by translating and rotating TRB along the aligned axis by increments of 1 Å (spanning for 14 Å) and 30°, respectively, and accounting for the internal rotation of the benzyl group (every 45° starting from 0°, plus the original orientation, 14°, of the x-ray structure) as well as both directions of TRB insertion into the gorge (i.e. head in or tail in, with the benzyl group representing head, see Fig. 1 B). Each of the 3024 structures was energy-minimized, and the 200 lowest interaction energy structures were roughly clustered into 20 groups (10 each, respectively, for the head-in and the tail-in insertion) of significantly dissimilar rotational orientations and axial positions of the ligand. The lowest energy structure in each of the 20 groups was then subjected to a 30-ps molecular dynamics-simulated annealing using temperatures up to 1000 K to surmount some conformational barriers. The molecular dynamics simulation, during which backbone atoms of the protein were fixed at their crystallographic coordinates, was followed by energy minimization without constraints. The resulting structures were assessed by (a) interaction energy between TRB and AChE, (b) side chain conformations of gorge residues as checked by PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), (c) root mean square deviations from the x-ray structure for both TRB and AChE, and (d) ability to interpret results of biochemical experiments (see “Discussion”). Based on these assessments, a TRB tail-in structure, which coincidentally was also the one that had the lowest AChE·TRB interaction energy among all, was selected as the most probable model for the binding of TRB with AChE. This binding mode was then used to generate the initial complex structure for an additional 30-ps molecular dynamics simulation at 300 K, in which the enzyme was reverted to its crystal (2ace) coordinates at the beginning of the simulation. The purpose of this additional run was to remove large conformational changes of the protein side chain (as compared with the x-ray structure), which are results of high temperature dynamics. The final structure (described below) is the resultant complex structure of this additional run, with its energy minimized. To test the validity of these docking procedures, they were applied to predict the binding mode of (−)-huperzine A (hupA) with AChE, which is crystallographically known (protein data bank code 1vot (34Raves M.L. Harel M. Pang Y.P. Silman I. Kozikowski A.P. Sussman J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar)). The complex with the lowest interaction energy emerged from simulations of 720 initial structures (15 × 12 × 4 hupA configurations; 2 axes of hupA, but no internal rotation, were considered) reproduced the x-ray structure remarkably well (0.4-Å root mean square deviations for hupA upon superposition of the protein backbone). A comparison to its initially assigned configuration showed that hupA of this predicted structure was translated by 4.8 Å and rotated by 109° and 46° (respectively, for the two axes considered) during the simulation. The InsightII/Discover program of Molecular Simulation Inc. (San Diego, California) and its consistent valence force field were employed for energy calculations and structural manipulations. The molecular dynamics simulations were proceeded with a time step of 1 fs, and 1000 steps of conjugate gradient optimization were used for energy minimization. Noncovalent interactions were calculated using a cell multiple method (35Ding H.Q. Karasawa N. Goddard III, W.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1992; 97: 4309-4315Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and a distance-dependent dielectric constant (ε(r) = r). To derive a kinetic model for the inhibition of TRB on AChE, enzyme activity was measured against preincubation time. The results, shown in Fig.2 A in a semilogarithmic plot, exhibited linearly declining lines indicative of an inhibitory mechanism of quasi-first order. Furthermore, the absence of a gradually approaching steady state in the inhibition of TRB (Fig. 2 A) indicated no spontaneous regeneration of free enzymes. A double reciprocal plot yielded a straight line that did not pass through the origin (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that a reversible AChE·TRB complex (EI) was present before the formation of an irreversible AChE·TRB complex (EI′) (29Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such an inhibition scheme can be illustrated in the following equation. E+I↔kdEI→kinactEI′Equation 1 where k d is the dissociation constant of EI, and k inact is the rate constant of the formation of the inactivated complex EI′. The values of k d andk inact calculated from the intercepts of the 1/K app versus 1/[I] plot (Fig.2 B) were 5 nm and 0.05 min−1, respectively. The rate constant for the overall inhibition (k i), as calculated from the equationk i =k inact/k d, was 0.01 nm−1 min−1. Because the inhibition of TRB on AChE is irreversible, the molar ratio between TRB and AChE in regard to their binding and the resulting inhibition can be measured. As shown in Fig. 3, both the binding and the inhibition of [14C]TRB to AChE increased linearly with increasing concentration of [14C]TRB, and the highest level of binding and inhibition was observed when the concentration of [14C]TRB was close to 1.25 μm, which was also the concentration of AChE added in each sample. Moreover, this highest level of inhibition and binding remained unchanged despite further increases of [14C]TRB in the sample. These results indicated that one molecule of TRB binds one catalytic unit of AChE and that this binding is directly related to TRB inhibition of AChE. The nature of the binding between TRB and AChE was further elucidated by the following. (a) The AChE-inhibiting time course of TRB was similar to that of DFP; however, DFP-inhibited AChE was reactivated by 2-PAM, but TRB-inhibited AChE was not (Fig.4). (b) A high NaCl concentration enhanced the inhibitory effect of TRB but reduced that of neostigmine (Fig. 5). In comparison, preincubation with 1% Triton X-100 abrogated the inhibitory effect of TRB, whereas it had no effect on the inhibition of neostigmine. Interestingly, post-addition of Triton X-100 to TRB-inhibited AChE was unable to restore the activity of the enzyme (Fig.6). (c) The binding of [l4C]TRB to AChE was specific (Fig.7, A and B) and, moreover, was noncovalent because AChE-bound [l4C]TRB was released by treatment with 8 m urea (Fig. 7 C). Thus, TRB inhibits AChE via a noncovalent binding mechanism, which is different from the covalent binding mechanisms of the typical irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme.Figure 5Inhibition of AChE by TRB or neostigmine in the presence or absence of 1 m NaCl. The working AChE solution was incubated with the inhibitor, TRB or neostigmine, in the presence (empty square) or absence (filled square) of 1 m NaCl. At the indicated incubation times, enzyme activity was measured. The activity of a control assay in which no inhibitor was present in the enzyme solution was used as the denominator to calculate the percent of AChE activity of the inhibitor-incubated solutions.

The three specimens for experiments A, B, and C were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These specimens were placed on a G-50 column, and effluents of 0.5 ml each were collected. UV absorption and radioactivity were measured for each effluent; for experiment B, AChE activity was also assayed.BSA, bovine serum albumin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As the inhibition experiment shown in Fig. 8indicated, AChE was completely inhibited by 10−8m TRB; in contrast, BChE was not inhibited by TRB even when the TRB concentration was increased to 10−3m. A higher concentration of TRB was not tested because of its lack of further solubility. Under the same assay condition, 10−7m BW284C51 completely inhibited AChE. This same concentration of BW284C51 had no inhibitory effect on BChE, but as the concentration of BW284C51 increased, it started to inhibit BChE, and at 10−2m, the inhibition was essentially complete. TRB is, therefore, superior to BW284C51 in selectively inhibiting eel AChE over horse serum BChE. Consistent with this finding, the inhibitory activities of TRB and also of TRC and arisugacin A and B against horse serum BChE are several thousand times weaker than against human erythrocyte AChE (15Omura S.

To gain insight into the inhibitory mechanism of TRB, we determined the interaction of TRB with the AChE substrate channel (the gorge) by molecular modeling. The model predicted that TRB would bind to AChE by occupying a large portion of the gorge, making contact interactions (defined as distance < 5 Å between any pair of hea"

In addition to the well known down-regulation of cell surface receptors (CD4, MHCI), Nef is able to alter cellular signaling. Of particular interest for this study is the ability of Nef to bind with a very high affinity to SH3 domains of myelomonocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinases of the Src family (Src-like PTK). We have therefore investigated Ca2+signaling in HL60 cells retrovirally transduced with wild type Nef or with a Nef mutant deficient in the SH3-interacting proline-rich motif (Nef(PXXP)4−). In differentiated HL60 cells, Nef markedly altered cellular Ca2+ signaling; the amount of intracellularly stored Ca2+ was increased, and as a consequence, store-operated Ca2+-influx was decreased. This effect was not observed in undifferentiated HL60 cells or in CEM T-lymphocytes and correlated with the differentiation-induced up-regulation of Src-like PTK. The Nef effect on Ca2+ signaling depended entirely on the integrity of its PXXP motif. The Src-like PTK p56/59hckco-immunoprecipitated with both Nef and with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, providing a possible mechanistic link between the viral protein and intracellular Ca2+ stores of the host cell. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the human immunodeficiency virus 1 Nef protein manipulates intracellular Ca2+ stores through SH3-mediated interactions in myelomonocytic cells.

Nef is expressed early in the viral replication cycle (1Kim S.Y. Byrn R. Groopman J. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3708-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Klotman M.E. Kim S.Y. Buchbinder A.

Results of studies in rhesus macaques suggest that it is a key factor in the pathogenesis of HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus infection and that it plays a particularly important role for the persistence of infection (3Kestler H.W.

An important role for Nef in HIV pathogenesis was also suggested by analysis of the HIV genome in long term surviving patients (5Salvi R. Garbuglia A.R. Di Caro A. Pulciani S. Montella F.

In addition, Nef exerts genetically and biochemically distinguishable effects on the biology of the cell and on viral growth (14Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D.

Nef enhances virus replication by facilitating the early post-entry steps of infection, indirectly promoting the efficiency of reverse transcription (16Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5048-5056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nef also perturbs cellular activation pathways both in lymphoid and nonlymphocytic cells (17De S.K. Marsh J.W. J. Biol.

The identification of cellular proteins interacting with Nef both in vitro and in vivo have strengthened the concept that Nef acts as a modulator of intracellular activation pathways. Indeed, tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinases have been reported to interact with Nef (21Saksela K. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: 606-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In particular, studies in vitro with recombinant proteins and crystal structure determinations have shown that the core region of Nef, via a proline-rich motif, binds with a high affinity to the SH3 domains of Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases (Src-like PTKs) (14Saksela K.

The Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases consists of nine members (Src, Lck, Hck, Fyn, Fgr, Yes, Blk, Lyn, and Yrk) that share common structures and regulation (26Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar).

In these studies, we used HL60 cells as a cellular model to investigate a possible effect of Nef on Ca2+-associated signal transduction pathways in myelomonocytic cells. Thapsigargin (Tg), ionomycin, 1,25(OH)2D3, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and Me2SO were purchased from Sigma, fetal calf serum and geneticin disulfate (G418) were from Life Technologies, Inc., fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), Complement C tablets (mixture of protease inhibitors) was rom Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Calbiochem, Sigma, Merck, and Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). The Ca2+-free medium contained 143 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5.6 mm glucose (0.1%), 20 mm Hepes; 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4. The Ca2+ medium had the same ionic composition but was supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. The promyelocytic HL60 cell line stably expressing either Nef, Nef(PXXP)4−, or the empty vector was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418. The CEM cell line expressing Nef was described elsewhere (9Aiken C. Konner J. Landau N.R. Lenburg M.E. Trono D. Cell. 1994; 76: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar).

HL60 differentiation to the granulocyte phenotype was triggered by adding Me2SO (final concentration 1.3% v/v for 3 days and then 0.65% for 2 days) to the culture medium.

Nef expression did not affect the general morphology of differentiated cells, and cytofluorimetry analysis of specific cell surface markers such as CD14, CD11b, CD11c, CD18, HLA DR, HLA ABC, the fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) receptor, and CD71 confirmed that differentiation to each phenotype was efficient under these conditions (data not shown). The plasmid pLXSN (CLONTECH, Hampshire, UK) as well as pLNefSN were described elsewhere (9Aiken C. Konner J. Landau N.R. Lenburg M.E. Trono D. Cell. 1994; 76: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The construct LNef(PXXP)4-SN was created by ligation of a XhoI-DraIII fragment from pCMX Nef(PXXP)4) (50Aiken C.

HL60 cell lines stably producing the various murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vectors were generated by infecting CRIP cells with the supernatant of transfected CRE cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (43Danos O. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6460-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Transduced CRIP clones were selected in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies Inc.). HL60 promyelocytes were infected with the various retroviral expression vectors by cocultivation with CRIP producer cell lines and selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (9Aiken C. Konner J.

Pugin (Hópital Cantonal, Geneva). Polyclonal antibodies against p56/59hck were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies against the Ins(1,4,5)P3-receptor type I Rbt04 were kindly provided by Dr. J. Parys (Leuven, Belgium). Polyclonal antibodies against the HIV-1 Nef were as described previously (50Aiken C. Krause L. Chen Y.L. Trono D. Virology. 1996; 217: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Anti-mouse/rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and anti-mouse/rabbit fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG was from DAKO (Copenhagen). Flow cytometry was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur. Labeling was performed by incubating cells with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for 2 h in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. Next cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and immediately analyzed on the flow cytometer. For fluorochrome-unconjugated antibodies, a second incubation with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies was performed 1 h at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, bovine serum albumin 0.5%. Time course of antibody binding showed that equilibrium was reached for all antibodies after 90 min at 4 °C, and binding was saturating at the concentration used (data not shown). Specificity of the binding was assessed by incubating the cells with a 10-fold excess of nonspecific immunoglobulins before the specific antibody (data not shown). [Ca2+]c was measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2. Cells (2 × 107/ml) suspended in Ca2+ medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were loaded for 45 min at 37 °C with 2 μm fura-2/AM, then diluted to 107/ml and kept on ice. Just before use, a sample of loaded cells (5×106/ml) was centrifuged and resuspended in the desired medium at 37 °C. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer (LS3, Perkin-Elmer) thermostated at 37 °C. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 and 505 nm, respectively. Calibration was performed for each cuvette by the sequential addition of 4–5 mm Ca2+ (to reach a 5 mmfinal Ca2+ concentration), 2 μm ionomycin to measure Ca2+-saturated fura-2 (F max), followed by 24 mm EGTA, 60 mm Tris, pH 9.3, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (TX-100) to measure Ca2+-free fura-2 (F min). Results are expressed as concentration (nm) of intracellular free Ca2+. For quantitative protein detection, cells were lysed in TX-100 1% buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% sucrose, 1% TX-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors) or alternatively in radioimmune precipitation buffer (9.1 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.7 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) for 20 min on ice. Cell lysates were next centrifuged 20 min at 4 °C 1200 ×g to discard aggregates, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay from Pierce. The proteins were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred on nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analysis was performed using the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. For immunoprecipitations, cells were solubilized 20 min on ice with either solubilization buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, 1% TX-100, 10 mmorthovanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) or alternatively with radioimmune precipitation buffer (9.1 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.7 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm orthovanadate and a mixture of protease inhibitors). After a brief sonication, 400–500 μg of protein were adjusted to the same volume (800 μl) and precleared for 1 h with 3 mg/ml protein A-Sepharose. The beads were discarded by centrifugation, and 1.5 μg of anti-p56/59hck antibodies were added to each sample overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The immune complexes were then precipitated by adding 3 mg/ml protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed three times with the corresponding solubilization buffer and boiled 5 min. The immunoprecipitates were finally separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred on nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analysis was performed using the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Myelomonocytic cells (especially macrophages) are important targets of HIV. It therefore seems very relevant that the HIV Nef protein interacts with a high affinity with Src-like PTKs of myelomonocytic cells. However, the effects of Nef in these cells have so far not been examined. We therefore decided to use HL60 cells as a myelomonocytic cell model to investigate this question. Indeed, HL60 cells cannot only be used in their undifferentiated form as promyelocytes but can also be induced to differentiate major subtypes of myelomonocytic cells (44Harris P. Ralph P. J.

Retroviral transduction was used to generate HL60 cell lines stably expressing the wild type form of HIV1 Nef (Nef) or a mutated Nef protein (Nef(PXXP)4−), where prolines 69, 72, 75, and 78 were replaced by alanines. Previousin vitro studies have shown that, although Nef interacts with high affinity with four members of the Src-like PTK family (Lck, Fyn, Hck, and Lyn), no such interactions are observed for the Nef(PXXP)4−) mutant (14Saksela K.

As assessed by Western blot analysis, Nef and (Nef(PXXP)4−) were expressed to significant levels both in undifferentiated promyelocytes and differentiated cells (Fig.1 A). To verify whether the expressed Nef wild type and PXXP mutant were functional, we investigated the down-regulation of CD4 cell surface expression by cytofluorimetry. Indeed, it has been shown previously that the PXXP motif of Nef is not crucial for CD4 down-regulation (14Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 15Iafrate A.J. Bronson S. Skowronski J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, CD4 surface expression was efficiently down-regulated by Nef in undifferentiated and differentiated HL60 cells showing that Nef was functional in this cellular background. The Nef(PXXP)4−) mutant was also able to down-regulate CD4, but, as described previously in other cells (14Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 50Aiken C. Krause L. Chen Y.L. Trono D. Virology. 1996; 217: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), somewhat less efficiently than the wild type form. Thus, the expressed Nef and Nef(PXXP)4) are functional with respect to CD4 down-regulation. The cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]c, is a crucial intracellular signaling mediator in myelomonocytic cells (51Mandeville J.T. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1996; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,52Krause K.H. Campbell K.P. Welsh M.J. Lew D.P. Clin. Biochem. 1990; 23: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In response to specific agonists, [Ca2+]celevations occur in two different steps. First, Ca2+ is released from intracellular stores in response to the generation of inositol phosphate (=Ca2+ release). Second, the emptying of intracellular stores activates, by a yet unknown mechanism, Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane (=Ca2+influx). To investigate a potential effect of Nef on agonist-induced [Ca2+]c elevations, fura-2-loaded HL60 cells were stimulated with the bacterial peptide fMLP. To separate the initial Ca2+ release phase from the subsequent Ca2+influx phase, the following protocol was used. Cells were kept in a Ca2+-free medium. Under these conditions, the [Ca2+]c increase in response to fMLP stimulation was used as a measure for Ca2+ release. Subsequently, Ca2+ was added to the extracellular medium, and the resultant [Ca2+]c elevation was used as a measure of Ca2+ influx (Fig. 2). In control cells, basal [Ca2+]c was around 70–80 nm. Ca2+ elevations due to Ca2+release in response to 100 nm fMLP were 250–350 nm. Ca2+ influx, induced by Ca2+readdition, raised [Ca2+]c to 300–400 nm (Fig. 2 B). Wild type Nef expression affected neither basal [Ca2+]c nor Ca2+release from intracellular stores. By contrast, Ca2+ influx was decreased by approximately 50% in the presence of the viral protein (Fig. 2 B). The Nef inhibition of Ca2+influx was also present when the lag time between fMLP addition and Ca2+ readdition was reduced to 1 min, suggesting that activation of Ca2+ channels is decreased by Nef already in the early phase of fMLP stimulation (not shown). Since in myelomonocytic cells agonist-induced Ca2+ influx is regulated by the filling state of intracellular Ca2+stores (53Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 54Favre C.J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1996; 128: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the decrease in agonist-induced Ca2+influx in Nef-transfected cells might be due to an increase in residual Ca2+ store content after stimulation. To test this hypothesis, we performed experiments essentially similar to the Ca2+ influx protocol described above. However, instead of adding back Ca2+ in the medium to measure Ca2+influx, the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin was added to assess the amount of residual Ca2+ store content. Ionomycin-releasable Ca2+ from internal stores was approximately double in wild type nef-expressing cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 2, C and D). This would be compatible with the concept that an increased Ca2+ store content accounts for the decreased Ca2+ influx in Nef-transfected cells. Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the Ca2+ pumps of agonist-sensitive Ca2+ stores, is able to induce a depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores and a subsequent store-operated Ca2+ influx independently from receptor activation and Ins(1,4,5)P3 production. We therefore studied thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]c changes using protocols similar to those described above for fMLP. In contrast to fMLP, thapsigargin induced an equivalent Ca2+ influx innef-expressing and in control cells (Fig.3, A and B). The absence of inhibition of thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx by Nef might have two possible explanations. (i) Either the presence of a receptor agonist (i.e. fMLP) is necessary to unravel the inhibitory effect of Nef on Ca2+ influx, or (ii) after efficient depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin, a normal activation of store-operated Ca2+influx occurs. When fMLP was coapplied with thapsigargin, no inhibition was observed (Fig. 3, C and D), excluding the former possibility. Instead, thapsigargin efficiently depleted intracellular Ca2+ stores both in nef-expressing and in control cells (Fig. 3, E and F), demonstrating that after efficient inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase, (i) the Ca2+ store contents are down to similarly low levels in both nef-expressing and control cells, and (ii) normal size Ca2+ influx occurs. Taken together, these results demonstrate that, after agonist stimulation, an abnormally high residual Ca2+ store content prevents the normal activation of store-operated Ca2+influx in nef-expressing cells. The normal activation of Ca2+ influx by thapsigargin excludes the possibility that Nef directly blocks store-operated Ca2+ channels. The residual Ca2+ after agonist stimulation is unlikely to be due to an inhibition of agonist-induced signaling to Ca2+stores, as the amplitude of fMLP-induced Ca2+ release was identical in nef-expressing and in control cells. Thus, we considered the possibility that the Ca2+ content of intracellular stores is constitutively increased innef-expressing cells. To"

To investigate the molecular mechanism that regulates the mechanical properties of smooth muscle, we determined the effect of forced expression of MLC17a and MLC17b on the rate of force activation during agonist-stimulated contractions of single cultured chicken embryonic aortic and gizzard smooth muscle cells. Forced expression of MLC17a in aortic smooth muscle cells increased (p < 0.05) the rate of force activation, forced expression of MLC17b in gizzard smooth muscle cells decreased (p < 0.05) the rate of force activation, while forced expression of the endogenous MLC17 isoform had no effect on the rate of force activation. These results demonstrate that MLC17 is a molecular determinant of the contractile properties of smooth muscle. MLC17 could affect the contractile properties of smooth muscle by either changing the stiffness of the myosin lever arm or modulating the rate of a load-dependent step and/or transition in the actomyosin ATPase cycle.

( Tokyo ). 1992; 111: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have been correlated with the expression of splice variant isoforms both of the MHC and MLC17. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the mechanical properties of smooth muscle are regulated by splice variant expression of MLC17. We determined the effect of forced expression of MLC17a and MLC17b on the rate of force activation for agonist stimulated contractions of single cultured chicken embryonic aortic and gizzard smooth muscle cells (SMC). Aorta and gizzard cells were isolated from primary cultures of ED 13–15 chicken embryos, as described previously (10Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, after dissecting these tissues and removing the surrounding connective and epithelial tissues, gizzard or aorta were minced into fine pieces and resuspended in growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, 1:1 mixture supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, Life Technologies, Inc.). The fine pieces in suspension medium were pipetted into culture dishes, and sedimented larger fragments were re-minced. This procedure was repeated for 2–4 cycles and all tissue fragments were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The culture media was changed the next day to remove the unattached fragments. Cells grew out from tissue explants in 2–3 days and they were passed and expanded after 0.05% trypsin digestion. Cells between the first and third passages were used for transfection and mechanical studies. The cDNAs encoding splice variants of the chicken 17-kDa smooth muscle essential myosin light chain (MLC17) were obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the adult chicken bladder total RNA extracted by Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The primers were synthesized according to the MLC17 cDNA sequence from position +44 to 66 and +528 to 552, this includes 5′-noncoding, all of the translated product and 3′-noncoding regions (2Nabeshima Y. Nonomura Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10608-10612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with the 3′-MLC17 primer by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 2 h. 1/10 of the RT product was subject to PCR to amplify both isoforms of MLC17 using 5′- and 3′-MLC17primers with PCR programmed at 95 °C denaturing for 1 min, 55 °C annealing for 1 min, and 72 °C elongation for 1 min for a total of 35 cycles. The MLC17a and MLC17b cDNAs produced were isolated by 2% agrose gel electrophoresis in TBE buffer, purified by QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN), and ligated to the pTracer-SV40” mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) individually using standard molecular cloning techniques (11Huang Q.Q. Chen A.C. Jin J.P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1999; 229: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The expression constructs encoding MLC17a or MLC17b were screened by PCR using 5′- and 3′-MLC17 primers and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The MLC17a or MLC17b expression plasmids were prepared by an endotoxin-removal column (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfections were performed by electroporation with the GenePulser II RF Module electroporator (Bio-Rad). The protocol was optimized for transfection efficiency. Primary cultured embryonic chicken aorta or gizzard SMC were collected and washed once in an electroporation buffer (27 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sucrose, pH 7.5). After centrifugation (RTH-750 rotor (Sorvall), 1,000 rpm at 4 °C for 4 min), approximately 5 × 104-2 × 105 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of the electroporation buffer and mixed with 2 μg of either MLC17a or MLC17bexpression plasmid DNA, or the buffer as a control. Electroporation was performed at the following conditions: total voltage, 180; 100% modulation; frequency, 40 kHz; bursts, 10 at a duration of 3 ms and an interval of 1 s in a cuvette with 0.2-cm gap. The cells were placed on the MatrigelTM (Becton-Dickinson) coated culture dishes, or for mechanical studies, microcoverslips (10Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in low serum (0.5% fetal calf serum) medium after electroporation. For analysis of steady state levels of mRNA, the population of transfection positive SMC was sorted through a flow cytometer (Elite ESP, Coulter, Miami, FL) and SMC with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence were collected. Transfection efficiency ranged from 15 to 60%. The individual cultured cells that carried the MLC17expression constructs after transfection were identified by the expression of GFP. The vector expressed MLC17, driven by an SV40 promoter and GFP as a separate transcript driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (pTracer-SV40, InvitrogenTM). GFP expression was visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon) with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. Transcription of the exogenous MLC17a and MLC17b were confirmed by RT-PCR. Total RNA extracted from the cultured cells was subjected to three RT-PCR reactions at the same time. One of them applied the 5′- and 3′-MLC17 primers specific for MLC17 (10Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), one applied the primers specific for MHC (10Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the last used 5′-MLC17 and a 3′-bovine growth hormone gene primer which was synthesized according to the sequence of bovine growth hormone gene polyadenylation signal in the vector DNA. This primer flanks the 3′ end of the transgene insert and will specifically anneal with the transcripts of exogenous MLC17 transcript. The experiments using the 3′-bovine growth hormone gene primer demonstrated that only cells transfected with the recombinant plasmid show a specific RNA transcript, indicating the expression of exogenous MLC17 (data not shown). For mechanical measurements, single SMC were attached to a force transducer (series 400A, Aurora Scientific Inc., Aurora, Ontario, Canada) with glue (Polycel, Maklanberg-Duncan, Oklahoma City, OK) as described previously (12Shue G. Brozovich F.V. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2361-2369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). SMCs were grown on MatrigelTM-coated coverslips (13Bowers C.W. Dahm L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C229-C236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in low serum culture dishes for 24–48 h after transfection and were then transferred to a chamber on the movable stage of a Nikon inverted florescent microscope. The SMC were incubated in physiological saline solution, and healthy single SMC either with GFP or without GFP expression were selected for mechanical studies. SMC were activated with 10 μmphenylephrine. The rate of force activation was computed from thet 12 of the force response (time to reach 50% of the maximum force), where rate = (t 12)−1. Cultured aortic and gizzard embryonic SMC were transfected with GFP and MLC17. A bicistronic expression vector was used in which a cytomegalovirus promoter drove GFP expression and an SV40 promoter drove MLC17 isoform expression. SMC carrying the transgene were detected by fluorescence. GFP positive and negative cells are easily identified, and since cells for the mechanical studies were selected based on the presence of a marker protein, GFP, transfection efficiency was not a factor. The effect of forced expression of one MLC17 isoform on the ratio of MLC17a/MLC17b was determined (Fig.1). Culturing both aortic and gizzard SMC on MatrigelTM maintains the ratio of MLC17a/MLC17b observed in tissue (TableI and Ref. 10Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transfection of aortic and gizzard SMC with the endogenous isoform of MLC17increased the expression of MLC17b in cultured aortic cells and MLC17a in cultured gizzard SMCs (Table I). Transfection of aortic cells with MLC17a increased the level of message for MLC17a from 15 to 80% of all transcripts (Table I). Similarly, transfection of gizzard cells with MLC17bincreased the level of message for MLC17b from 60% of all transcripts to almost exclusively MLC17b (Table I). These results suggest that transfection of cultured SMC with MLC17 results in the overexpression of MLC17band/or MLC17a. In addition, overexpression of MLC17 did not effect MHC splicing (Fig. 1). Both ED 14 cultured aortic and gizzard SMC express exclusively the splice-out isoform of MHC and the forced expression of MLC17 did not effect the expression of the MHC.Table IMLC17b and MLC17a transcript ratios for cultured chicken embryonic SMCCell typeTransfected MLC17MLC17b expression1-aMLC17a and MLC17b are expressed as the percentage of total transcripts (mean ± S.E., n = 5–12 for each experiment).

For the nontransfected controls, phenylephrine (10 μm) produced contractions of both single cultured ED 13–15 aortic and gizzard SMC. Aortic SMC displayed a slow rate of force activation compared with single cultured ED 13–15 gizzard SMC (Fig. 2, TableII). These results are in agreement with others (10Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and suggest that when cultured on MatrigelTM, embryonic aortic and gizzard SMC retain their native tonic and phasic contractile properties, respectively. For the aortic SMC, forced expression of MLC17a resulted in an increase in the rate of force activation (p < 0.05) to that observed in the untransfected gizzard cells while overexpression of MLC17bdid not change (p > 0.05) the rate of force activation (Fig. 2, Table II). Similarly for gizzard SMC, forced expression of MLC17a did not change the rate of force activation (p > 0.05), while overexpression of MLC17bslowed the rate of force activation (p < 0.05) to that observed in the untransfected aortic SMC (Fig. 2, Table II). Transfection did not influence the maximal steady state force (TableII), and transfection of both embryonic aortic and gizzard SMC with the vector alone, expressing GFP, neither effected the rate of force activation nor the maximal steady state force (data not shown). Similar to contractions of intact tissues (14Hai C.M. Murphy R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C99-C106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the agonist stimulated contractions of both cultured embryonic aortic and gizzard SMC were accompanied by transient increases in MLC20 phosphorylation (data not shown).Table IIContractile response for aortic and gizzard SMCsCell typeTransfected MLCsnt 1/2ForcesμNAortaNone816.66 ± 2.172.0 ± 0.2AortaMLC17b715.52 ± 1.371.7 ± 0.2AortaMLC17a69.01 ± 2.382.7 ± 0.7GizzardNone119.28 ± 0.631.7 ± 0.2GizzardMLC17b1014.05 ± 2.353.5 ± 0.9GizzardMLC17a68.18 ± 1.832.4 ± 0.3Values are mean ± S.E.

The t 1/2 was the time to reach 50% maximum force, and the rate of force activation is (t 1/2)−1. The mechanical properties of smooth muscle are thought to arise from differences in the expression of the contractile proteins (3Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 432-482Google Scholar, 4Somlyo A.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). For smooth muscle, the distribution of both MHC and MLC17varies for both the same tissues across species and among tissues within a species (6Malmqvist U. Arner A. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 418: 523Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In general, tonic tissues express predominantly the splice-out isoform of MHC and MLC17b, while phasic tissues express predominantly the splice-in isoform of MHC and MLC17a. During development, the mechanical properties of the aorta and gizzard correlate with the changes in contractile protein expression. Early during embryogenesis both aorta and gizzard predominantly exclude exons for expression of MHC and MLC17b (10Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and both tissues display tonic contractile properties (15Ogut O. Brozovich F.V. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A284Google Scholar). The gizzard develops phasic contractile properties at ED 12–14, coincident with the change in contractile protein expression to predominantly splice-in MHC and MLC17b (10Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Ogut O. Brozovich F.V. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A284Google Scholar). However, a correlation between changes in protein expression and changes in mechanical properties could arise from a variety of factors unrelated to differences in the expression of MHC and/or MLC17. In the present study, neither expression of an irrelevant cytosolic protein (GFP) nor the endogenous isoform of MLC17 in SMC effected the rate of force activation. Overexpression of MLC17 isoforms also did not change the maximum force of contraction. Thus, the differences in the rate of force activation were due to neither transfection alone nor an unphysiologic level of protein expression. The vector expresses two independent proteins, GFP and MLC17, which rules out the possibility that the results were due only to an affect of a fusion protein. The differences in the rate of force activation of cultured embryonic SMC are also unlikely to be the result of differences in splice variant expression of MHC near the 25/50-kDa junction (1Kelley C.A. Takahashi M. Yu J.H. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12848-12854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) since MHC splicing was not effected by the forced expression of MLC17 in our study. The results of the present study of single cultured embryonic SMC demonstrate that the expression of splice-variant isoforms of MLC17 is a determinant of the rate of force activation and MLC17 is a molecular marker for the contractile phenotype of smooth muscle. Our results are in general agreement with those of others (9Hasegawa Y. Ueda Y. Watanabe M. Morita F. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 111: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) who have demonstrated that an increase in both the V maxand K m for the actin-activated ATPase of smooth muscle myosin correlates with an increase in the ratio of MLC17a/MLC17b. However, a correlation of the ATPase and the ratio of MLC17a/MLC17b is not universal (1Kelley C.A. Takahashi M. Yu J.H. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12848-12854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and changes in the rate of force activation may not be related to changes in the V max andK m of the ATPase. Our results in single cultured embryonic SMC are similar to those reported for endothelin-1-treated cultured SMC (10Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and permeabilized trifluoperazine-treated smooth muscle strips (7Mathew J.D. Khromov A.S. Trybus K.M. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31289-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Chronic endothelin-1 treatment of cultured gizzard smooth muscle cells slowed the rate of force activation and increased the expression of MLC17b (10Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, for the endothelin-1-treated cultured SMC, a change in the rate of force activation could have been due to a variety of factors other than a change in MLC17 expression. For trifluoperazine-treated permeabilized strips of smooth muscle (7Mathew J.D. Khromov A.S. Trybus K.M. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31289-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the contractions were unaccompanied by either a change in Ca2+ or MLC20 phosphorylation, and occurred after the exchange of MLC17 isoforms, upon transfer of the preparation from a solution containing trifluoperazine to a relaxing solution. This result raises the possibility that the differences in force activation and muscle V max could be due to the trifluoperazine treatment alone and unrelated to the regulation of the mechanical properties of intact smooth muscle. An insert at the 25/50-kDa junction of the MHC (1Kelley C.A. Takahashi M. Yu J.H. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12848-12854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has also been suggested to determine the functional properties of smooth muscle (1Kelley C.A. Takahashi M. Yu J.H. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12848-12854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res.

Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both the ATPase activity and the velocity of actin translation in the in vitro motility assay was higher for the splice-in isoform of MHC with either MLC17a or MLC17b than the splice-in isoform of MHC with either isoform of MLC17. This difference in motility could be due to an increase, by a factor of 2, in the attachment time for actin and myosin for the splice-out MHC compared with the splice-in MHC (16Lauzon A.-M. Tyska M.J. Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Warshaw D.M. Trybus K.M.A.J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 825-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Similarly, the velocity of actin translation by skeletal muscle MHC from in vitro motility assays was primarily determined by the MHC isoform and the essential MLC isoform played a minor, modulatory role (17Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20414-20418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the ATPase activity and the velocity of actin movement in the in vitromotility assay measure the properties of unloaded myosin, and these parameters are thought to correlate with muscleV max. However, the effect of elevating ADP on the velocity of actin movement by myosin in the in vitromotility assay (18Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 332: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and skinned fiber V max (19Fulbright R.M. Barsotti R.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 72: A278Google Scholar) are opposite. The results of these studies (18Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 332: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Fulbright R.M. Barsotti R.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 72: A278Google Scholar) suggest that a change in the ATPase activity and velocity of actin translation duringin vitro motility assays do not always correlate with a change in the mechanical properties of muscle. It is also possible that the mechanical properties of smooth muscle could be determined by a number of factors; i.e. splicing at the 25/50-kDa junction of MHC could regulate the ability of the unloaded cross-bridge to hydrolyze ATP and thus could control V max, while MLC17 could regulate the properties of loaded cross-bridges, and thus the rate of force activation. The results of the present study of cultured embryonic SMC clearly demonstrate that, in the absence of any other confounding variables, a change in the ratio of MLC17a/MLC17b expression alone changes the contractile properties of the SMC. Our data suggests that MLC17a may have a dominant effect; above a threshold level of MLC17a, the rate of force activation could be fast while below the threshold, force activation might be slow. Force activation was rapid for control gizzard cells and RT-PCR of gizzard cells showed 40% MLC17a and 60% MLC17b, and increasing MLC17a to 75% did not influence the rate of force activation while decreasing the expression of MLC17bto 2% slowed the rate of force activation. Similarly in the aorta, increasing the expression of MLC17a from 15 to 80% increased the rate of force activation. Alternatively above a threshold level of MLC17a expression, there may be a dose-response relationship between the relative content of MLC17a and a further increase in the speed of the tissue. Our experiments were not designed to investigate this question, but rather only whether changing the relative expression of MLC17a/MLC17binfluences the rate of force activation. Our results clearly demonstrate that splice variant expression of MLC17 is a determinant of the rate of force activation and that MLC17 is a molecular marker for the tonic and phasic contractile phenotype. The ability of MLC17 to modulate the rate of force activation could be due to a change either in the stiffness of the myosin lever arm (7Mathew J.D. Khromov A.S. Trybus K.M. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31289-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or a change in the rate of a load-dependent transition within the actomyosin ATPase.

Sakman B. Nature. 1976; 260: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar) in 1976 is one of the most direct and quantitative assay techniques which can be conducted under conditions similar to those in vivo. This technique, therefore, could potentially be one of the most powerful assay tools for the identification of transporter genes as well. Some transporter genes have been identified by introducing them into a heterogeneous expression system of Xenopus oocyte as a host for patch clamp recording (or two-electrode voltage clamp recording). Those genes had to be ones that Xenopus oocyte cells did not express or scarcely expressed on the Xenopus genome. For example, the genes for neurotransmitter receptor channels (2Mishina M.

Nicoll D.A. Phillipson K.D. Nature. 1991; 352: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) were successfully identified using this particular method. Since the gene manipulation technique can be applied much more easily to eukaryotic unicellular yeast cells than to animal cells, Kung and associates (5Gustin M.C. Matinac B. Saimi Y. Culbertson M.R.

For successful, quantitative patch clamp assays of ion pumps and carrier-type transporters that do not accompany high ionic currents, the sizes of the protoplasts are crucial; the small size of the cell used for the above study allowed identification only of ion channels with high ionic currents. For that reason, Bertl and co-workers (13Bertl A. Slayman C.L. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 271-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) tried to prepare yeast protoplasts as large as 20 μm in diameter by digesting the cell wall using enzymes followed by prolonged incubation in an osmotically protective medium containing 200 mm KCl. It should be noted that they added no inhibitor of cell wall synthesis. They reported an ATP-induced current flow on the giant vacuole isolated from these oversized protoplasts (14Bertl A. Bieler H. Kettner C. Slayman C.L. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 999-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). They appeared to have used polyploid cells, which were much larger than haploid cells to begin with, in order to obtain giant protoplasts as large as 20 μm. Polyploid cells, however, are not suitable for obtaining a disrupted mutant through genetic manipulation, because all the target genes on the multiple chromosomes have to be disrupted in order to obtain a stable phenotype. Recently, we succeeded in converting Escherichia coli cells into giant protoplasts that are suitable for patch clamp experiments (15Kuroda T. Okuda N. Saitoh N. Hiyama T. Terasaki Y. Anazawa H. Hirata A. Mogi T. Kusaka I. Tsuchiya T. Yabe I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16897-16904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This spheroplast incubation method (SI method)1 was a modification of the giant cell preparation method originally developed forBacillus megaterium by Kusaka (16Kusaka I. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 96: 884-888Crossref Google Scholar) in which giant protoplasts are formed after prolonged incubation of spheroplasts formed by treating cells with lysozyme in the presence of both penicillin G, an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis, and an osmo-protectant. We have decided to apply a similar technique to haploid cells ofS. cerevisiae, and chose 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a hydrophilic inhibitor of cell wall synthesis, since Biely and co-workers (17Bieley P. Kratky Z. Kovarik J. Bauer S. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 121-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that a small amount of 2-DG, an analogue of glucose, specifically inhibits cell-wall synthesis without a significant effect on protein synthesis. In the present paper, we describe a method for preparing giant protoplasts of S. cerevisiae as large as 20 μm from haploid cells of the wild type and also a mutant that lacked the V-type ATPase activity. By using the whole cell/vacuole patch clamp technique upon giant vacuoles derived from the protoplasts, an ATP-induced and bafilomycin A1-sensitive pump current was measured and quantitatively investigated. The mutant, in which the gene for one of the crucial subunits of the V-type ATPase was disrupted, failed to show this activity. The feasibility of extending the present technique to other ion transporter genes from organisms other than yeast will also be discussed. The S. cerevisiaestrains used were X2180–1A (MAT a gal2 CUP1), YPH499 (MAT a leu2 ura3 trp1 lys2 his3 ade2), and YPH500 (MATα leu2 ura3 trp1 lys2 his3 ade2). RH105 (Δvma1::TRP1 derivative of YPH500) was constructed as in Ref. 18Hirata R. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar. Innoculum from a stock culture on agar medium was grown in 4 ml of YPD medium (2% glucose, 1% peptone, and 1% yeast extract, pH 7.0) for 7 h at 30 °C. Two hundred microliters of the culture were transferred to a fresh 4-ml aliquot of YPD medium and cultivated for 4 h until the cell reached an early logarithmic phase. Cells were harvested by low-speed centrifugation for a few minutes, resuspended in 2 ml of A buffer (5 mm EGTA, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 5 mm DTT) using a vortex mixer, and then incubated on a shaker at 30 strokes/min for 10 min. The cells were again harvested by centrifugation as described above, washed once with distilled water (supplemented with 1 mm DTT), and then resuspended in 2 ml of B buffer (1 m sorbitol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). Zymolyase was added to the suspension to give a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The suspension was again shaken for 30 min. After confirming under a microscope that the cells had been fully converted to spherical cells (spheroplasts), they were harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was carefully resuspended in 2 ml of A medium (YPD medium supplemented with 1 m sorbitol and 0.05% 2-DG). One-hundred and fifty microliters of the suspension were diluted with 4 ml of A medium and incubated at 20 °C overnight on a shaker at 30 strokes/min. Since RH105, which is a catalytic subunit-disrupted mutant of the V-type ATPase, does not grow well at neutral pH but grows normally at lower pH (19Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), the YPD medium and the A medium were supplemented with 50 mm MES-MOPS to lower the pH to 5.5. These media were further supplemented with leucine (20 mg/liter), uracil (20 mg/liter), lysine (30 mg/liter), histidine (20 mg/liter), and adenosine (20 mg/liter), since RH105 requires these nutrients for growth. Cells were all grown to about 10 μm after this incubation. After 2 ml of 0.5 m KCl was added, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 2 ml of A medium. The suspension was divided into four 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes (400 μl each) and stored at 10 °C until use. The stock can be stored for several hours without loss of activity. Prior to the next vacuole isolation step, the suspension was shaken for 3 h at 30 °C; spheroplasts had grown to 20–30 μm by this time. Two-hundred microliters of 0.5 m KCl were added to each tube, which was then centrifuged in an Eppendorf-type centrifuge at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of C buffer (A buffer supplemented with 0.8 m sorbitol and 0.1 mKCl), and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C on a shaker at 30 strokes/min. The cells were harvested as described above, resuspended in 1 ml of D buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) supplemented with 1 mg/ml Zymolyase, and then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C on a shaker at 30 strokes/min. Microscopic observation confirmed that the cells were fully converted to spheroplasts. For vacuole staining, spheroplasts were incubated in the YPD medium supplemented with 1m sorbitol, 50 mm citric acid, and 10 μm CDCFDA (20Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit P.A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14294-14303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and were shaken at 30 strokes/min for 30 min at 30 °C. A vacuole was observed as a bright yellow fluorescent sphere inside the cell. This result indicates that the CDCFDA added to the medium was transported through the cytoplasmic membrane into a vacuole, hydrolyzed by an esterase, and became the fluorescent in the acidic vacuolar lumen. For nuclei staining, propidium iodide (PI) was used as fluorescent dye according to Ref. 21Eilam Y. Chernichovsky D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 1063-1070PubMed Google Scholar. A confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS4D, Leica Co.) was used for observation with excitation at 488 nm. For CDCFDA and PI, a 550-nm band path filter and a 550-nm long path filter were used for emission, respectively. For electron microscopy, giant cells (X2180-1A) were fixed by using a conventional glutaraldehyde/OsO4 method without Zymolyase treatment (22Hirata A. Tanaka K. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1982; 28: 263-274Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar); for intact cells (YPH499), a freeze-substitution method (23Sun G-H. Hirata A. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1625-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was used. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate, except for the observation of cell wall, for which a silver proteinate method for carbohydrate staining (24Courtoy R. Simar L.J. J. Microsc. 1974; 100: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was employed. The suspension of giant spheroplasts obtained above was concentrated 5-fold by centrifugation. Ten microliters of the concentrate were transferred to the recording chamber of the patch clamp apparatus, diluted there with 200 μl of E buffer (0.1 m sorbitol, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.5), and allowed to stand for 5 min. Under the microscope, it was observed that more than half of the cells were broken and released vacuoles into the medium. Vacuoles of more than 20 μm were selected for patch clamp experiments. As released vacuoles tend to stick to the glass wall of the chamber, unbroken spheroplasts, broken cytoplasmic membranes, organelles, and other debris can easily be washed away by pouring F buffer (0.1 m sorbitol, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm CaCl2 (10 nm free Ca2+), and 10 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.5) through a capillary tube with six-way valves as described below. Experiments were performed basically as described by Hamill et al. (25Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15140) Google Scholar). Capillaries were made of 75-μl disposable glass micropipettes (Duramont, Bromall, PA) using a two-stage pulling apparatus (PP-83, Narishige, Tokyo), and the tips were heat-polished. The conductivity of the open capillaries filled with G buffer (0.1 m sorbitol, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MES-Tris, pH 5.5, 2 mm CaCl2) ranged from 3 to 5 MΩ. To produce a whole cell/vacuole patch, after a tight seal was formed (10 GΩ), the patched part of the vacuole membrane was broken by applying a few pulses (±2.0 volts) with duration ranging from 1 to 10 ms. After that, the resistance became 1 to 5 GΩ. Five minutes were usually long enough to exchange the medium inside the vacuole with another medium through the capillary by diffusion. The external medium was changed by a tandem 6-way valve system as described previously (15Kuroda T. Okuda N. Saitoh N. Hiyama T. Terasaki Y. Anazawa H. Hirata A. Mogi T. Kusaka I. Tsuchiya T. Yabe I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16897-16904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Membrane currents were amplified by a patch/whole cell clamp amplifier (CEZ-2300, Nihon Kohden Co., Tokyo), and recorded on a digital audio tape recorder (DTC 55ES, Sony Corp., Tokyo). Stored data were subsequently processed and analyzed by using a personal computer (PC-9801DX, NEC Inc., Tokyo) and a software program (QP-120J, Nihon Kohden Co., Tokyo).

Experiments were performed at room temperatures (20–23 °C). Peptone and yeast extract were purchased from Difco; sorbitol, EGTA, and DTT from Sigma; 2-deoxy-d-glucose from Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka; CDCFDA, from Molecular Probes Ltd.; Zymolyase (20T) from Seikagaku Kogyo Co Ltd., Tokyo. Other reagents were all of analytical grade. As shown in Fig.1, A and B, the haploid cells of S. cerevisiae were all converted to giant cells as large as 20 μm, five times larger than untreated cells. Most of these cells were spherical; some had buds that appeared to have stopped developing further. In order to confirm that the spherical cells were protoplasts without the cell wall, electron microscopy was conducted (Fig. 2). The magnified images of the cell envelope revealed that the cells (protoplasts) lacked cell wall carbohydrates that would be stained by the silver proteinate method (Fig. 2 C). The envelope of intact cells was well stained (27Hirata A. Shimoda C. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and showed a thick layered structure with β-glucan and mannan-protein layers (Fig. 2 D). Further treatment with Zymolyase resulted in total conversion of the cells into the spherical shape. The ratio of 2-DG/glucose was found to be critical: ratios neither lower nor higher than 1/40 were effective in producing the giant protoplasts. The otherwise normal growth indicates that 2-DG at this critical concentration does act as an inhibitor of cell wall synthesis but does not significantly affect energy-generating glycolysis (17Bieley P. Kratky Z. Kovarik J. Bauer S. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 121-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that the yeast cells were converted to giant protoplasts merely by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Although much needs to be done to elucidate the mechanism, fluorescence microscopy of the cells stained with PI for DNA (Fig.3) may provide some insight into this problem. These pictures show that the cells became multinuclear when budding was arrested either in the middle (Fig. 3, A andB) or at the start (Fig. 3, C and D). These observations are consistent with previous results with a mutant cell in which the cell morphogenesis checkpoint system was genetically impaired: nuclear divisions continued while the corresponding synchronous budding cycle (cytoplasmic division) was halted (28Sakaguchi S. Miyamoto S. Iida H. Suzuki T. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Protoplasma. 1995; 189: 142-148Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 29Lew D.J. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that these giant protoplasts, although they have multiple nuclei, derive originally from haploid cells and thus have identical nuclei.Figure 2Electron micrographs of a giant cell.

The same magnifications were used for A andB as well as for C and D. The strain used here was YPH500.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As seen in a micrograph (Fig. 1 B), the giant protoplast was occupied by a huge organelle that appeared to be a vacuole. This organelle was indeed confirmed to be a vacuole, since it was stained with a vacuole-specific CDCFDA (Fig. 1 C) and did not show any electron-dense material inside the vacuole in an ultrathin section under the electron microscope (Fig. 2 A). By slightly lowering the osmotic pressure of the medium, the cell membrane of the giant protoplast was broken and, as a result, the intact vacuole was readily released into the medium (Fig. 1 D). The vacuole thus released swelled up and became as large as 30 μm, adhering well to the surface of the glass slide along with small pieces of broken cytoplasmic membrane and small spherical bodies acting like glue. The adhesion was stable enough for buffer washing through the capillary, thus enabling quick exchange of the medium simply by using the six-way valve system. The patch clamp technique in the whole cell/vacuole recording mode was applied to this vacuole. Two types of ion-transporter activities were detected. Fig. 4 shows an anion-specific transporter. With equimolar potassium (100 mm) on both sides of the membrane, the voltage versus current curve (V-I curve) changed little when 90% of the anion outside was replaced with fluoride (open circles); on the other hand, glutamate (triangles) and nitrate (squares) drastically changed the curve. With the Goldman equation and using the reversal potentials of these anions, permeability ratios were calculated to be 2.8 ± 0.2: 1:0.5 ± 0.3:0.1 ± 0.015 for NO3−:Cl−:F−:glutamate−. These results are consistent with previous reports that indicate that there is an electrogenic anion transporter on the vacuole membrane (30Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and that glutamate is accumulated mainly in the cytoplasm (31Kitamoto K. Hoshizawa K. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2683-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and nitrate in the vacuole (32Martinola E. Heck U. Wiemken A. Nature. 1981; 289: 292-294Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A distinct ion-transport activity is shown in Fig.5. When 1 mm ATP was poured onto the surface of the vacuole through the capillary with the membrane potential being kept at zero, a huge current as high as 100 pA (0.1 pA/μm2) flowing into the vacuolar lumen was observed (Fig. 5 A). After a transient overshoot, the current gradually reached a steady-state level. Washing the medium outside the vacuole with an ATP-free medium brought the current down to the baseline level. Bafilomycin A1, which is a potent and specific inhibitor of V-type ATPase (33Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar), strongly inhibited this ATP-induced pump current (Fig. 5 B). At 10 μm, the pump was completely inhibited (data not shown); 50% inhibition was achieved at 10 nm. In order to confirm that this ATP-induced current is generated by V-type ATPase, mutant cells that lacked the V-type ATPase activity were also converted to giant cells using the SI method. The RH105 strain (Δvma1::TRP) was cultivated and converted to giant protoplasts in a similar way, except that the pH was kept at 5.5 as stated under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected, while no significant difference was observed in terms of the above described anion-specific transporter activity between the wild type (YPH500, Fig.6 B) and the mutant (RH105, Fig. 6 C), the ATP-induced current was detected only in the wild type and could not be detected in the RH105 mutant (Fig.6 A). It was thus confirmed that no other ATP-dependent pump such as Ca2+-ATPase (34Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) was induced under our present experimental conditions. It should be noted here that in this particular experiment (Fig.6 A) an ATP-regenerating system consisting of creatine phosphate and creatine kinase was supplemented in the medium in order to minimize the ADP concentration, because ADP is known to inhibit the activity (35Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, the overshoot observed in earlier experiments (Fig. 5) no longer appeared. Experiments hereafter were all conducted under these conditions. The ATP-induced current was measured at different ATP concentrations (Fig. 7 A). A double reciprocal plot of the current against the ATP concentration is shown in Fig. 7 B. The apparent K m value for ATP was calculated to be 0.159 mm, which is in good agreement with the K m value (0.2 mm) obtained by measurements of ATP hydrolysis for the yeast V-type ATPase (36Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the two V-I curves, one for the ATP-induced current and the other for the ATP-independent current (Fig.8 A) included a component due to the anion-specific transporter and a small leak current, the subtracted difference was plotted in Fig. 8 B in order to obtain the “true” V-I curve for the ATP-dependent pump. This curve has two distinct characteristics: (a) the H+-pump activity saturates at sufficiently high membrane potentials (>40 mV); (b) it does not become negative even at sufficiently low potentials (−70 mV). The former observation (a) suggests that the H+-pump is accelerated with an increase of the membrane potential until the rate becomes limited by a step independent of the potential such as ATP hydrolysis. The latter (b) indicates that the H+-pump (V-type ATPase) does not work in the negative direction which is necessary, if any, for the synthesis of ATP. This is consistent with the previous result that indicated that the V-type ATPase has no ATP-synthase activity (37Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Based on the reversal potential of −70 ± 5 mV and ΔpH of 2.0 units, the electrochemical potential difference of H+(ΔμH+) was calculated to be −190 ± 5 mV, which is very close to the value obtained with vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from normal size yeast cells (36Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The free energy difference of ATP in equilibrium with this system (ΔG ATP = −15.3 Kcal/mol) was calculated by adopting a value for Δ GATPo = −9 Kcal/mol (38Alberty R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1337-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and RT ln ([ADP] [Pi]/[ATP] = −6.3 Kcal/mol, which was estimated from the equilibrium constant for the creatine kinase reaction (39LoPresti P. Cohn M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 998: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). From the reversible ΔμH+ and ΔG ATP, the H+/ATP ratio was estimated to be 3.5 ± 0.3. In a previous report, the H+/ATP ratio for a plant vacuolar H+-pump was directly calculated to be 2 from the amounts of transported H+ and hydrolyzed ATP (40Bennett A.B. Spanswick R.M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 74: 545-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which has since been assumed to be a fixed value. A recent result from patch clamp experiments with the vacuole of a plant cell, where inside and outside pH was widely varied, showed that the H+/ATP ratio varied from 1.75 to 3.28 depending on the pH inside and outside of the vacuole (41Davies J.M. Hunt I. Sanders D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8547-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). When the outside medium was basic (pH 8.0) and ΔpH was large (4.7), the H+/ATP ratio was 1.75; when the outside medium was neutral (pH 7.0) and Δp"

It has recently been demonstrated that a number of genes triggered by the sex-inducing pheromone are also inducible by wounding. By differential screening of a cDNA library, a novel gene was identified that is transcribed in response to the pheromone. Its gene product was characterized as an ECM glycoprotein with a striking feature: it exhibits a hydroxyproline content of 68% and therefore is an extreme member of the family of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs). HRGPs are known as constituents of higher plant ECMs and seem to function as structural barriers in defense responses. The Volvox HRGP is also found to be inducible by wounding.

The volvocine algae provide the unique opportunity for exploring the pathways that led from a simple cell wall to a complex ECM that stabilizes the shape of an organism and mediates many developmental responses of cells to internal as well as external stimuli. The volvocine algae range in complexity from unicellular Chlamydomonas to multicellular organisms, with differentiated cells and complete division of labor, in the genusVolvox. The asexually growing organism of Volvox carteri is composed of only two cell types: 2000–4000 biflagellate Chlamydomonas-like somatic cells are arranged in a monolayer at the surface of a hollow sphere (1Starr R.C. Arch. Protistenk. 1969; 111: 204-222Google Scholar, 2Starr R.C. Dev. Biol. Suppl. 1970; 4: 59-100Google Scholar) and 16 much larger reproductive cells (“gonidia”) lie just below the somatic cell sheet. Volvox cells are surrounded and held together by a glycoprotein-rich ECM (reviewed in Refs. 3Kirk D.L. Birchem R. King N. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 80: 207-231PubMed Google Scholar and 4Sumper M. Hallmann A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 180: 51-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell walls and ECMs of the volvocine algae are assembled entirely from glycoproteins (5Miller D.H. Mellman I.S. Lamport D.T.A. Miller M. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 63: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and a high content of hydroxyproline has been detected. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) represent a constituent of higher plant ECMs, and much work has been done to analyze the structures of these proteins (6Cooper J.B. Chen J.A. Varner J.E. Dugger W.M. Bartnicki-Garcia S. Structure, Function, and Biosynthesis of Plant Cell Walls. Waverly Press, Baltimore, MD1984: 75-88Google Scholar, 7Showalter A.M. Varner J.E. Stumpf P.K. Conn E.E.

However, there are few examples in the literature where multiple ECM proteins have been examined in molecular detail from a single species or from closely related species. This approach has been initiated with volvocine algae to allow a more integrated approach to elucidate the structure, assembly, and function of ECM proteins.A remarkably rapid remodelling of the ECM is observed under the influence of the sex-inducing pheromone (a glycoprotein) that triggers initiation of the sexual life cycle of Volvox carteri(12Wenzl S. Sumper M. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 311-315Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Wenzl S. Sumper M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 115: 119-128Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Gilles R. Gilles C. Jaenicke L. Naturwissenschaften. 1983; 70: 571-572Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In particular, synthesis of some members of the pherophorin family of ECM proteins (15Sumper M. Berg E. Wenzl S. Godl K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Godl K. Hallmann A. Rappel A. Sumper M. Planta. 1995; 196: 781-787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Godl K. Hallmann A. Wenzl S. Sumper M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) is strongly induced by the pheromone. Pherophorins are ECM glycoproteins that contain a C-terminal domain with homology to the sex-inducing pheromone.By differential screening of a cDNA library, additional genes were recently identified that are transcribed under the control of the sex-inducing pheromone (18Amon P. Haas E. Sumper M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, genes were found, in addition to those encoding the pherophorins, that encode extracellular chitinases and proteinases. In higher plants, similar protein families are known to play an important role in defense against fungi. Indeed, it could be demonstrated that the same set of genes triggered by the sex-inducing pheromone is also inducible by wounding ofVolvox spheroids.Pheromone-induced changes in the composition of the ECM have been characterized in detail within the cellular zone of the ECM (12Wenzl S. Sumper M. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 311-315Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Wenzl S. Sumper M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 115: 119-128Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar,15Sumper M. Berg E. Wenzl S. Godl K.

Engel J. Sumper M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3493-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and to a lesser extent within the deep zone (DZ) (17Godl K. Hallmann A. Wenzl S. Sumper M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which contains all ECM components internal to the cellular zone (for nomenclature see Ref. 3Kirk D.L. Birchem R. King N. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 80: 207-231PubMed Google Scholar). The DZ appears as a relatively amorphous component that fills the deepest regions of the spheroid and that may constitute more than 90% of the total volume of the organism. In this paper, we characterize a HRGP exhibiting an extreme composition that is expressed in response to the sex-inducing pheromone and to wounding and that is part of the DZ compartment of the ECM.DISCUSSIONThis paper describes the structure and properties of a novel component of the Volvox ECM with the striking feature of being composed of 68% hydroxyproline. Some of these hydroxyprolines are arranged in Ser-(Pro)3 and Ser-(Pro)4elements that are typical of higher plant extensins (9Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Bradleyet al. (43Bradley D.J. Kjellbom P. Lamb C.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) noted that tissue wounding in higher plants selectively stimulates the expression of tyrosine-rich extensins. In this respect, the algal DZ-HRPG is different because it contains only a single tyrosine residue. Similarly, it does not perfectly fit into the general class of higher plant extensins because the predominant basic amino acid lysine is replaced by arginine in the algal polypeptide. To our knowledge, there is no other protein described with a (hydroxy)-proline content as high as 68%. For example, the higher plant extensins with the highest (hydroxy)-proline contents are those of Vigna unguiculata (44Arsenijevic-Maksimovic I. Broughton W.J. Krause A. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Nicotiana tabacum (45Keller B. Lamb C.J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and Gossypium barbadense (46John M.E. Keller G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), exhibiting 53, 44, and 40%, respectively. In the animal kingdom the mini-collagen of Hydra attenuata (47Kurz E.M. Holstein T.W. Petri B.M. Engel J. David C.N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1159-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) exhibits 44%.A typical feature of algal ECM proteins characterized so far is a strictly modular composition, where hydroxyproline-rich (HR) sequences seem to serve as rod-shaped spacers separating modules that are completely devoid of hydroxyproline residues. It has been suggested that these hydroxyproline-rich stretches define a HR module family combining more specialized modules to yield chimeric and multifunctional ECM proteins (4Sumper M. Hallmann A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 180: 51-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this sense, DZ-HRGP represents the first volvocacean ECM glycoprotein being only composed of one (or more?) HR module(s). Electronmicroscopic studies have shown that main parts of the volvocacean ECM consist of a network of fibrous structures (48Goodenough U.W. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1550-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 49Adair W.S. Steinmetz S.A. Mattson D.M. Goodenough U.W. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2373-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Most probably, the rod-shaped HR modules mainly have a structural function and serve as building blocks to create these defined framework of the ECM. Where analyzed in more detail, these modules were found to be targets for extensive posttranslational modifications. Among the modifications identified in Volvoxare O-glycosylations with oligoarabinosides, attachment of saccharides containing phosphodiester bridges between arabinose residues, and in a single case, the additional attachment of a highly sulfated arabinomannan (19Ertl H. Mengele R. Wenzl S. Engel J. Sumper M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3493-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As analyzed in more detail for the ECM protein SSG 185, the HR module is also involved in covalent cross-linking of the monomeric units (19Ertl H. Mengele R. Wenzl S. Engel J. Sumper M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3493-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). If DZ-HRPG serves a similar function, this rod-shaped molecule could be involved in the creation of the fibrous networks observed in the deep zone compartment (3Kirk D.L. Birchem R. King N. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 80: 207-231PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that overexpression of DZ-HRPG did not create an aberrant ECM morphology could indicate the participation of a second ECM molecule in the cross-linking reaction. In this case, only the concomitant overexpression of both ECM partners interacting in a stoichiometric relation would be expected to cause a visible phenotype.The natural resistance of higher plants to diseases involves an array of inducible defense responses, including synthesis of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases and chitinases and the accumulation of HRGPs within the ECM. The latter glycoproteins are hypothesized to function in defense as structural barriers (50Showalter A.M. Rumeau D. Adair W.S. Mecham R.P. Organization and Assembly of Plant and Animal Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, New York1990: 247-281Crossref Google Scholar) or as specific microbial agglutinins (51Leach J.E.

Surprisingly, the simple multicellular green alga Volvoxresponds to wounding in much the same way as observed in higher plants. As was demonstrated recently (18Amon P. Haas E. Sumper M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), Volvox responds to wounding with the synthesis of a chitinase as well as a protease that is combined with chitin-binding modules. With the additional demonstration of a typical HRGP that is produced in response to wounding, it now appears that much of the response scenario found in higher plants already exists in multicellular green algae. Even more surprising is the fact that these algal pathways are also triggered by the sex-inducing pheromone. However, Kirk and Kirk (53Kirk D.L. Kirk M.M. Science. 1986; 231: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were able to demonstrate that synthesis of the sex-inducing pheromone can be triggered in somatic cells by a short heat shock applied to asexually growing organisms. This response induces the production of dormant zygotes that survive unfavorable conditions like drought. Although wounding is unable to induce pheromone production, similar biochemical responses are observed after wounding and pheromone application (18Amon P. Haas E. Sumper M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As induction of sexuality and subsequent production of zygotes obviously is part of the strategy of the organism to escape from environmental stress, it appears to make sense that apparently completely different stimuli (wounding and pheromone treatment) cause up-regulation of the same set of genes. Further studies on this algal system should confirm or deny an evolutionary relation of both the pheromone and the wound response systems. In addition, the possible relation of this algal system and the wound healing reactions in higher plants deserves further investigation. The evolution of a complex extracellular matrix (ECM)1 from a simple cell wall was one of the prerequisites to promote the transition from unicellularity to multicellularity. The volvocine algae provide the unique opportunity for exploring the pathways that led from a simple cell wall to a complex ECM that stabilizes the shape of an organism and mediates many developmental responses of cells to internal as well as external stimuli. The volvocine algae range in complexity from unicellular Chlamydomonas to multicellular organisms, with differentiated cells and complete division of labor, in the genusVolvox. The asexually growing organism of Volvox carteri is composed of only two cell types: 2000–4000 biflagellate Chlamydomonas-like somatic cells are arranged in a monolayer at the surface of a hollow sphere (1Starr R.C. Arch. Protistenk. 1969; 111: 204-222Google Scholar, 2Starr R.C. Dev. Biol. Suppl. 1970; 4: 59-100Google Scholar) and 16 much larger reproductive cells (“gonidia”) lie just below the somatic cell sheet. Volvox cells are surrounded and held together by a glycoprotein-rich ECM (reviewed in Refs. 3Kirk D.L. Birchem R. King N. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 80: 207-231PubMed Google Scholar and 4Sumper M. Hallmann A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 180: 51-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell walls and ECMs of the volvocine algae are assembled entirely from glycoproteins (5Miller D.H. Mellman I.S. Lamport D.T.A. Miller M. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 63: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and a high content of hydroxyproline has been detected. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) represent a constituent of higher plant ECMs, and much work has been done to analyze the structures of these proteins (6Cooper J.B. Chen J.A. Varner J.E. Dugger W.M. Bartnicki-Garcia S. Structure, Function, and Biosynthesis of Plant Cell Walls. Waverly Press, Baltimore, MD1984: 75-88Google Scholar, 7Showalter A.M. Varner J.E. Stumpf P.K. Conn E.E.

However, there are few examples in the literature where multiple ECM proteins have been examined in molecular detail from a single species or from closely related species. This approach has been initiated with volvocine algae to allow a more integrated approach to elucidate the structure, assembly, and function of ECM proteins. A remarkably rapid remodelling of the ECM is observed under the influence of the sex-inducing pheromone (a glycoprotein) that triggers initiation of the sexual life cycle of Volvox carteri(12Wenzl S. Sumper M. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 311-315Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Wenzl S. Sumper M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 115: 119-128Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Gilles R. Gilles C. Jaenicke L. Naturwissenschaften. 1983; 70: 571-572Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In particular, synthesis of some members of the pherophorin family of ECM proteins (15Sumper M. Berg E. Wenzl S. Godl K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Godl K. Hallmann A. Rappel A. Sumper M. Planta. 1995; 196: 781-787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Godl K. Hallmann A. Wenzl S. Sumper M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) is strongly induced by the pheromone. Pherophorins are ECM glycoproteins that contain a C-terminal domain with homology to the sex-inducing pheromone. By differential screening of a cDNA library, additional genes were recently identified that are transcribed under the control of the sex-inducing pheromone (18Amon P. Haas E. Sumper M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, genes were found, in addition to those encoding the pherophorins, that encode extracellular chitinases and proteinases. In higher plants, similar protein families are known to play an important role in defense against fungi. Indeed, it could be demonstrated that the same set of genes triggered by the sex-inducing pheromone is also inducible by wounding ofVolvox spheroids. Pheromone-induced changes in the composition of the ECM have been characterized in detail within the cellular zone of the ECM (12Wenzl S. Sumper M. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 311-315Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Wenzl S. Sumper M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 115: 119-128Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar,15Sumper M. Berg E. Wenzl S. Godl K.

Engel J. Sumper M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3493-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and to a lesser extent within the deep zone (DZ) (17Godl K. Hallmann A. Wenzl S. Sumper M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which contains all ECM components internal to the cellular zone (for nomenclature see Ref. 3Kirk D.L. Birchem R. King N. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 80: 207-231PubMed Google Scholar). The DZ appears as a relatively amorphous component that fills the deepest regions of the spheroid and that may constitute more than 90% of the total volume of the organism. In this paper, we characterize a HRGP exhibiting an extreme composition that is expressed in response to the sex-inducing pheromone and to wounding and that is part of the DZ compartment of the ECM. DISCUSSIONThis paper describes the structure and properties of a novel component of the Volvox ECM with the striking feature of being composed of 68% hydroxyproline. Some of these hydroxyprolines are arranged in Ser-(Pro)3 and Ser-(Pro)4elements that are typical of higher plant extensins (9Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Bradleyet al. (43Bradley D.J. Kjellbom P. Lamb C.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) noted that tissue wounding in higher plants selectively stimulates the expression of tyrosine-rich extensins. In this respect, the algal DZ-HRPG is different because it contains only a single tyrosine residue. Similarly, it does not perfectly fit into the general class of higher plant extensins because the predominant basic amino acid lysine is replaced by arginine in the algal polypeptide. To our knowledge, there is no other protein described with a (hydroxy)-proline content as high as 68%. For example, the higher plant extensins with the highest (hydroxy)-proline contents are those of Vigna unguiculata (44Arsenijevic-Maksimovic I. Broughton W.J. Krause A. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Nicotiana tabacum (45Keller B. Lamb C.J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and Gossypium barbadense (46John M.E. Keller G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), exhibiting 53, 44, and 40%, respectively. In the animal kingdom the mini-collagen of Hydra attenuata (47Kurz E.M. Holstein T.W. Petri B.M. Engel J. David C.N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1159-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) exhibits 44%.A typical feature of algal ECM proteins characterized so far is a strictly modular composition, where hydroxyproline-rich (HR) sequences seem to serve as rod-shaped spacers separating modules that are completely devoid of hydroxyproline residues. It has been suggested that these hydroxyproline-rich stretches define a HR module family combining more specialized modules to yield chimeric and multifunctional ECM proteins (4Sumper M. Hallmann A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 180: 51-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this sense, DZ-HRGP represents the first volvocacean ECM glycoprotein being only composed of one (or more?) HR module(s). Electronmicroscopic studies have shown that main parts of the volvocacean ECM consist of a network of fibrous structures (48Goodenough U.W. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1550-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 49Adair W.S. Steinmetz S.A. Mattson D.M. Goodenough U.W. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2373-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Most probably, the rod-shaped HR modules mainly have a structural function and serve as building blocks to create these defined framework of the ECM. Where analyzed in more detail, these modules were found to be targets for extensive posttranslational modifications. Among the modifications identified in Volvoxare O-glycosylations with oligoarabinosides, attachment of saccharides containing phosphodiester bridges between arabinose residues, and in a single case, the additional attachment of a highly sulfated arabinomannan (19Ertl H. Mengele R. Wenzl S. Engel J. Sumper M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3493-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As analyzed in more detail for the ECM protein SSG 185, the HR module is also involved in covalent cross-linking of the monomeric units (19Ertl H. Mengele R. Wenzl S. Engel J. Sumper M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3493-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). If DZ-HRPG serves a similar function, this rod-shaped molecule could be involved in the creation of the fibrous networks observed in the deep zone compartment (3Kirk D.L. Birchem R. King N. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 80: 207-231PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that overexpression of DZ-HRPG did not create an aberrant ECM morphology could indicate the participation of a second ECM molecule in the cross-linking reaction. In this case, only the concomitant overexpression of both ECM partners interacting in a stoichiometric relation would be expected to cause a visible phenotype.The natural resistance of higher plants to diseases involves an array of inducible defense responses, including synthesis of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases and chitinases and the accumulation of HRGPs within the ECM. The latter glycoproteins are hypothesized to function in defense as structural barriers (50Showalter A.M. Rumeau D. Adair W.S. Mecham R.P. Organization and Assembly of Plant and Animal Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, New York1990: 247-281Crossref Google Scholar) or as specific microbial agglutinins (51Leach J.E.

Transfection into 2fTGH and Tyk2-deficient 11,1 cells showed that EpoR/IFNaR2–2 alone was able to transduce a signal upon stimulation with erythropoietin (Epo), as judged by induction of the interferon type I-inducible 6-16 promoter. In contrast, protection against infection with encephalomyocarditis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus was reduced or absent, respectively. To further investigate the role of IFNaR1 in the induction of an antiviral state, we analyzed the Epo-versus IFNα-induced transcription of a set of genes, involved in antiviral protection. Up to 24 h after stimulation with Epo or IFNα, comparable transcription of the p56, dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, 2′-5′A synthetase, and MxA genes was seen. However, at later time points, only in the case of Epo induction, a sharp decrease of mRNA levels was observed. Western blotting analysis of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase showed a similar pattern at the protein level. Taken together, our results imply a role for IFNaR1 in the induction of sustained mRNA and protein levels that are likely required for optimal antiviral activity.

With the exception of the heptamembrane-spanning receptors, members from the hematopoietin/IFN,1 tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor, and tyrosine kinase receptor families are all activated by this mechanism of cytokine-driven multimerization. Ligand binding to the first receptor component induces the association with additional receptor subunits eventually resulting in an increase of affinity for the ligand (1Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S.

Both types of interferons bind to distinct receptors that belong to the class I cytokine receptors. The interferon type I receptor (IFNaR) is composed of two subunits, IFNaR1 and IFNaR2–2. As a result of alternative splicing, subtypes of the latter subunit do also exist: a cytoplasmic truncated transmembrane form (IFNaR2–1) and a soluble form (IFNaR2–3) (4Lutfalla G. Holland S.J.

This JAK/Stat pathway is essential for transcription of many of the cytokine-inducible genes (9Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). (10Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar, 11Pellegrini S.

Stat1 and Stat2 subsequently bind to the phosphorylated receptors and form heterodimers after being phosphorylated themselves. The activated Stat1/Stat2 heterodimer then associates with a DNA binding subunit, p48, to form the multisubunit complex, ISGF3, that binds with high affinity to the interferon-stimulated response element enhancer sequences, located in the promoters of the interferon-stimulated genes (9Darnell Jr., J.E.

Specificity of a cytokine can be determined at the intracellular level, where cell-specific signal transduction components can bind the cytoplasmic portions of the receptor subunits, thereby causing distinct effects of the same cytokine on different cells. At the extracellular level, however, many cytokines share a common receptor subunit (such as, for instance, the common βc subunit for the IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IL-5 receptor complexes), and ligand-specific signaling is at least in part derived from association with cytokine-specific additional receptor components (such as IL-3Rα, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor α chain, and IL-5Rα) (1Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). The interferon type I receptor seems to be an exception to this rule. Although IFNα and IFNβ share the same receptor components, differences in specificity in antiviral, antiproliferative, and clinical effects have been reported (16De Marco F. Giannoni F. Marcante M.L.

Moreover, differences between IFNα and IFNβ have also been characterized at the gene induction level since only IFNβ is able to induce a gene called β-R1 in 2fTGH cells (22Rani M.S. Foster G.R.

Additionally, some recent findings suggest that IFNα and IFNβ utilize different regions of the IFNaR. For instance, co-immunoprecipitation of IFNaR1 and IFNaR2–2 can be achieved upon IFNβ but not IFNα treatment (24Platanias L.C. Uddin S. Domanski P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 282: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, mutagenesis studies of the IFNaR2–2 chain showed differential receptor activation since (i) intracellular deletions abrogated only the IFNβ and not the IFNα-induced antiviral response, while activation of the JAK/Stat pathway was equal in both cases (28Domanski P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3144-3147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and (ii) extracellular mutations created receptor complexes that showed preferential binding for each of the ligands (27Lewerenz M. Mogensen K.E. Uze G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is also possible to obtain mutations in IFNβ that mimic IFNα activity (29Runkel L. Pfeffer L.

These data suggest that other mechanisms may be responsible for generation of signal diversity apart from utilization of cytokine-specific receptor components.Little is known about the exact stoichiometry of the activated IFNaR complex. High affinity ligand binding and activation of the IFNα/β signaling pathways requires clustering of the IFNaR1 with the IFNaR2–2 chain (4Lutfalla G. Holland S.J. Cinato E. Monneron D. Reboul J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but it has been postulated that IFNβ may also be capable of clustering the IFNaR2–2 subunit alone (27Lewerenz M. Mogensen K.E. Uze G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).To further explore the aggregation of the IFNaR1 and IFNaR2–2 chains and their effects on IFNα/β signaling, we fused the extracellular domains of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) to the intracellular and transmembrane domains of IFNaR1 or IFNaR2–2, thereby generating the chimeric receptors EpoR/IFNaR1 and EpoR/IFNaR2–2. Since erythropoietin homodimerizes the EpoR (32Watowich S.S. Yoshimura A. Longmore G.D. Hilton D.J. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), dimerization of the IFNaR intracellular domains could be obtained, and the resulting effects on several interferon functions were studied.DISCUSSIONThe use of chimeric receptors allows to evaluate the specific contribution of each of the two IFNaR receptor components, IFNaR1 and IFNaR2–2 in type I IFN signaling. In particular, use of receptor chimeras with the EpoR extracellular domain and the IFNaR transmembrane and intracellular domains offers the advantage of stimulating the IFN intracellular pathway without activation of the endogenous IFNaR complex, and without interference of other unknown receptor subunits that may associate with the receptor complex upon IFN activation. This latter phenomenon cannot be excluded in transfection experiments that make use of the species-specific activity of IFN, since an endogenous unknown receptor component may still cross-species interact with the ligand. Furthermore, since EpoR extracellular domains are used, we know precisely that the chimeric receptors aggregate by homodimerization.Transfection of the EpoR/IFNaR chimeric receptor constructs in 2fTGH 6-16SEAP clone 5 cells showed that Epo-induced dimerization of the IFNaR2–2 was sufficient for activation of several interferon-inducible genes, such as the 6-16 gene (as measured by reporter protein synthesis), p56, PKR, 2′-5′A synthetase, and MxA (as shown by Western and/or Northern blot analysis). Unexpectedly, with the same stimulus, only a weak antiviral response was noticed when the cells were incubated with EMCV and no protection was observed against VSV, despite the involvement of the above mentioned gene products in the IFN-induced antiviral state. This decreased antiviral potency of the EpoR/IFNaR2–2 chimeras is probably not the result of an inefficiently functioning chimeric receptor, since no difference was seen between Epo- or IFN-induced gene transcription up to 24 h after stimulation. Moreover, IL-5-induced formation of a chimeric IL-5R/IFNaR receptor complex that includes the IFNaR1 and IFNaR2–2 intracellular domains proved to be functional in antiviral activity against EMCV as well as VSV.2 Since the stability of both ligands, Epo and IFNα, is equal in the antiviral assay, our results imply that it is the absence of the IFNaR1 intracellular domain in the activated receptor complex that is responsible for the decrease or complete lack of antiviral activity.Kotenko et al. (39Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Lee C. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5007-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that IFNγ-induced dimerization of receptor chimeras, consisting of the IFNγR1 extracellular domains and the IFNaR2–2 intracellular domains, resulted in induction of ISGF3 formation and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen induction. However, this receptor configuration was also able to protect the cells against EMCV although no quantitative measurements were performed preventing comparison with our data. A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be the involvement of the wild-type IFNγR2 receptor subunit in their experiments, a subunit that, although it does not recruit Stat molecules, might recruit other signaling molecules, required for full antiviral activity. The above model therefore only serves for analyzing IFN-induced effects that act solely through Stat activation. Since involvement of other pathways in many IFN-induced functions has been described (14Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar), we favored the use of EpoR/IFNaR receptor chimeras.The results shown here provide additional evidence for IFNaR activation via differently clustered complexes. Since IFNα and IFNβ both bind to the same IFNaR components, but induce different in vivo or in vitro effects, it is conceivable that these ligands use different ways to activate the receptor. Indeed, a similar uncoupling of JAK/Stat pathway activation and antiviral activity as seen here with EpoR/IFNaR2–2 homodimerization has been observed before with a deletion of the C-terminal end of the IFNaR2–2 intracellular domain, resulting in formation of receptor complexes that are capable of inducing antiviral activity if clustered by IFNα, but not by IFNβ, while activation of the JAK/Stat pathway is equal for both ligands (28Domanski P. Nadeau O.W. Platanias L.C. Fish E. Kellum M. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3144-3147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although the involvement of a murine receptor component that cross-reacts with one of the two human ligands cannot be excluded in these experiments, these studies suggest a difference in clustering or receptor conformation between IFNα and IFNβ, resulting in a qualitatively different signal. There are two reasons to believe that activation via IFNaR2–2 dimerization is not a merely artificial situation, but rather mimics (partial) IFNaR activation by IFNβ. First, involvement of IFNaR1 in IFN signaling in 11,1 cells is very unlikely, due to the Tyk2 deficiency and the resulting low levels of IFNaR1 in these cells (34Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uze G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35Richter M.F. Dumenil G. Uze G. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24723-24729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since we observed a clear Epo activity on 11,1 cells, transfected with the EpoR/IFNaR2–2 chimeras (Fig. 3), it is conceivable that the partial 6-16 promoter activation by IFNβ, seen on these cells (23Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), is also transmitted via IFNaR2–2 homodimerization. Interestingly, our results also imply that some residual antiviral protection can occur in cells devoid of Tyk2. A second reason refers to studies done with monoclonal antibodies directed against the IFNaR1 chain. Such antibodies were able to block IFNα but not IFNβ activity (26Lu J. Chuntharapai A. Beck J. Bass S. Ow A. de Vos A.M. Gibbs V. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1782-1788PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Lewerenz et al. (27Lewerenz M. Mogensen K.E. Uze G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed that anti-IFNaR1 polyclonal antibodies could only partially neutralize IFNβ activity, leading to a loss of antiviral protection against VSV, consistent with our data where EpoR/IFNaR2–2 dimerization by Epo confers only partial protection to EMCV, but not to VSV.The mechanism by which IFNaR2–2 homodimerization elicits a signal, leading to gene activation, is at present unclear partly because of the conflicting reports on the requirement of IFNaR1 for Stat activation. Initially, Tyr466 on IFNaR1 was reported to be crucial for Stat activation since peptides containing Tyr466phosphotyrosines could inhibit IFN signaling in permeabilized cells and interact with Stat1 and Stat2 (40Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C.W. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 41Li X. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In contrast, later reports indicated the dispensability of the IFNaR1 chain for gene activation. For instance, mutation of all four Tyr residues in the IFNaR1 chain resulted in a functional receptor complex (42Gibbs V.C. Takahashi M. Aguet M. Chuntharapai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28710-28716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and Nadeau et al. (43Nadeau O.W. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4045-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) postulated that Stat2 binding always required the membrane proximal tyrosines of the IFNaR2–2 intracellular domain and at least another Stat2 binding site (Tyr466 or Tyr481 on IFNaR1 or the C-terminal end of IFNaR2–2). Moreover, although they postulated that Stat1 and Stat2 molecules need to be translocated to the IFNaR1 chain, Li and co-workers (41Li X. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) showed that the recruitment of both Stats initially happens on the IFNaR2–2 subunit in a ligand-independent manner. Finally, dimerization of the IFNaR2–2 chain was performed by Kotenko et al. (39Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Lee C. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5007-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), using IFNγR1/IFNaR2–2 chimeras, and was shown to be fully functional in terms of Stat activation. Hence, activation and heterodimerization of the Stat proteins in the EpoR/IFNaR2–2 homodimer may occur via recruitment to one IFNaR2–2 subunit, followed by binding on a phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the other, juxtaposed IFNaR2–2 intracellular domain. Alternatively, no such juxtaposed domain is needed, as has been shown for Stat1 homodimer formation (44Behrmann I. Janzen C. Gerhartz C. Schmitz-Van d. L. Hermanns H. Heesel B. Graeve L. Horn F. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5269-5274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since Stat1 activation by the type I interferons is supposed to be Stat2-dependent, probably by interaction with IFNaR1 via Stat2 (41Li X. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 45Improta T. Schindler C. Horvath C.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), recruitment and activation of Stat1 by the EpoR/IFNaR receptor chimera may follow the same route as Stat2.Which additional pathways may be activated through recruitment of IFNaR1 in the activated receptor complex? A first possibility is the membrane distal interferon receptor tyrosine activation motif (IRTAM) motif that is perfectly conserved between human, mouse and bovine IFNaR1 and from which the tyrosine residues are the only completely conserved tyrosine residues in the IFNaR1 chains (47Mouchel-Vielh E. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. Uze G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has been reported that this motif may serve as a docking site for Stat3, which on its turn could act as an adapter for the IFN-dependent interaction of IFNaR1 with the regulatory subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (48Yang C.H. Shi W. Basu L. Murti A. Constantinescu S.N. Blatt L. Croze E. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol.

Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Apart from the serine phosphorylation of Stat3, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase also plays an important role in the regulation of many cellular processes and is an upstream element in a serine kinase phosphorylation cascade (50Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar, 51Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). It may therefore be involved in the cytosolic activation of a set of proteins, involved in antiviral action. This may explain why a cell line, resistant to the antiviral and antiproliferative actions of IFN, was found to be defective in Stat3 activation and why expression of Stat3 complemented these effects (52Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). On the other hand, removal of the IRTAM sequence blocked IFN-dependent IFNaR1 down-regulation, resulting in a prolonged antiviral effect (53Basu L. Yang C.H. Murti A. Garcia J.V. Croze E. Constantinescu S.N. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Virology. 1998; 242: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, as it has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the IFNaR1 intracellular domain is not required for Stat3 activation (43Nadeau O.W. Domanski P. Usacheva A. Uddin S. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Raz R. Levy D. Majchrzak B. Fish E. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4045-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), other Stat3 docking sites, apart from the IRTAM sequence and not necessarily containing tyrosine residues, may exist on the IFNaR1 intracellular domain. In addition, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase activation may also be regulated by insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) for which activation via Tyk2 and JAK1 has been described (54Burfoot M.S. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Smith J.M. Pons S. Paonessaw G. Pellegrini S. White M.F. Kerr I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24183-24190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although association of MAP kinase (ERK2) with the IFNaR1 subunit has been reported (55David M. Petricoin E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), caution must be taken when linking this pathway to antiviral activity since inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation had no effect on the antiviral activity of IFNα (56Arora T. Floyd-Smith G. Espy M.J. Jelinek D.F. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3289-3297PubMed Google Scholar). Another uncoupling from the antiviral pathway was seen in Lck−, CD45−, and ZAP 70− Jurkat cells where no growth inhibition could be exerted by IFNα while the induced resistance to measles virus was unaffected. These components were associated with IFNaR1, as judged by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and are essential for signaling via the T-cell receptor (57Petricoin E.F. Ito S. Williams B.L. Audet S. Stancato L.F. Gamero A. Clouse K. Grimley P. Weiss A. Beeler J. Finbloom D.S. Shores E.W. Abraham R. Larner A.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Requirement of T-cell receptor signaling components was also reported by other groups, who showed that Stat5, which is constitutively associated with Tyk2, provides upon phosphorylation a docking site for the SH2 domain of CrkL, a protein that is located upstream of the T-cell receptor induced growth-inhibitory C3G/Rap-1 cascade. The Stat5-CrkL complex then migrates to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription via the IFNγ-activated site elements (58Ahmad S. Alsayed Y.M. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29991-29994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 59Fish E.N. Uddin S. Korkmaz M. Majchrzak B. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

Taken together, and since IFN receptors are found on every cell type, cell-specific pathways, involved in the induction of the antiviral state, must exist. Therefore, with the above mentioned data in mind, we suggest that IFNaR2–2 may serve mainly to activate the JAK/Stat pathway, resulting in the activation of a large set of IFN-inducible genes. In addition, engagement of the IFNaR1 chain in the activated receptor complex may mainly serve to provide additional cell-specific signals required for full antiviral protection.The observed prolonged high mRNA level of"

It is through this receptor that the peptide hormone insulin regulates a multitude of cellular processes including glucose transport and metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, DNA and protein synthesis, amino acid transport, and mitogenesis. Insulin binding to the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor results in receptor autophosphorylation and activation (reviewed in Ref. 1Lee J. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C319-C334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated insulin receptor activates many intracellular signaling pathways (reviewed in Ref. 2White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1 family members and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, which is upstream of protein kinase C and protein kinase B/Akt enzymes (3Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). How these kinases are biochemically connected to ultimate targets, such as glucose transporters, remains obscure. Despite the enormous amount of information regarding the insulin signaling pathway, information detailing structural aspects of the insulin receptor itself is limited.The insulin receptor is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family (4Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4577) Google Scholar). This receptor shares considerable sequence similarity and structural characteristics with the insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor (4Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4577) Google Scholar). The insulin receptor is a glycosylated heterotetrameric protein composed of two α-subunits and two β-subunits. Each β-subunit is covalently linked to an α-subunit by class II disulfide bonds to form an αβ heterodimer (5Massague J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6729-6738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two αβ heterodimers are covalently linked through the α-subunits by class I disulfide bonds to form α2β2heterotetramers (5Massague J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6729-6738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-subunits of the insulin receptor are entirely extracellular and contain the insulin binding site (reviewed in Ref. 1Lee J. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C319-C334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each β-subunit consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. The intracellular domain of the β-subunit contains the kinase activity of the insulin receptor, and this segment can be further subdivided into a juxtamembrane region, a kinase region, and a C-terminal region. Binding of insulin to the α-subunit of the insulin receptor results in a conformational change that is coincident with the autophosphorylation of the β-subunit of the receptor (6Lee J. Pilch P.F. Shoelson S.E. Scarlatta S.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2701-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation is an intramolecular process (7Shia M.A. Rubin J.B. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), growth hormone receptor and tenascin (12Schaefer E.M. Erickson H.P. Federwisch M. Wollmer A. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23393-23402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (13Ward C.W. Hoyne P.A. Fligg R.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The ectodomain is composed of two large homologous domains, L1 (residues 1–119) and L2 (residues 313–428), separated by several cysteine-rich domains (residues 155–312) (11Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Secondary structural predictions suggest that each large homologous domain is composed of an α-helix, β-strand, turn, β-strand motif (11Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich regions of the insulin receptor may adopt one or two loop configurations similar to those identified in the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (13Ward C.W. Hoyne P.A. Fligg R.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal segment of the insulin receptor extracellular domain contains two potential fibronectin type III repeats, each consisting of a seven-stranded β-sheet structure. This structural information relies heavily on sequence based predictions. A segment of the IGF-1 receptor extracellular domain containing the L1-cystine-rich-L2 regions has recently been crystallized (14McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Verkuylen A. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Ivancic N. Elleman T.C. Garrett T.P. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2663-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and solved (15Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.H. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The crystal structure exhibits this region of the monomeric α-subunit fragment as a relatively extended segment (40 × 48 × 105 Å) (15Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.H. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This fragment is the first successfully crystallized extracellular segment of the insulin receptor class of proteins, and the information obtained begins to provide insight into the extracellular organization of this class of proteins.Segments of the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor have also been crystallized. A peptide fragment of the insulin receptor juxtamembrane region has been crystallized complexed with the IRS-1 phosphotyrosine binding domain (16Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trüb T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The resulting structure demonstrated the importance of specific structural features, including a key phosphotyrosine residue, in this interaction (16Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trüb T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor has also been crystallized in both the dephosphorylated (17Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) and phosphorylated (18Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) forms. The crystal structure of the kinase region enabled identification of key residues involved in the specificity of the family of tyrosine kinases. The phosphorylated form of the kinase region demonstrated the conformational changes that take place in the activated receptor exposing the nucleotide binding site and positioning the catalytic loop for substrate interactions. These structures cannot, however, be used to address the importance of interactions between the two β-subunits of the heterotetrameric complex, nor can they address the role that insulin binding plays in receptor activation.Electron microscopic studies allow one to study the holoreceptor and the domain organization that so far cannot be captured in a crystalline state. Negative stain electron microscopic studies of the purified placental α2β2 heterotetrameric insulin receptor have identified “Y”-like and “T”-like conformations in the detergent-solubilized state (19Christiansen K. Tranum-Jensen J. Carlsen J. Vinten J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These studies are supported by images of the extracellular domain of the receptor identifying short Y-like and “V”-like structures (12Schaefer E.M. Erickson H.P. Federwisch M. Wollmer A. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23393-23402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Images of the reconstituted insulin receptor visualized using negative stain electron microscopy also show Y-like, V-like, T-like, and stalklike projections from the vesicle surface (20Tranum-Jensen J. Christiansen K. Carlsen J. Brenzel G. Vinten J. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 140: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All of the microscopic studies to date are limited by the use of heavy metals for preservation and contrast. These heavy metals potentially distort structural detail, in addition to requiring a certain degree of sample drying.Cryo-electron microscopy enables visualization of a protein in a fully hydrated state, free of heavy metals and the associated artifacts. Macromolecular complexes are preserved in a non-crystalline, or vitreous ice layer and visualized under low electron dose conditions to minimize radiation damage (21Dubochet J. Adrian M. Chang J. Homo J. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Schultz P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1988; 21: 129-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). The relative background noise is higher, and the contrast between protein and background is lower than in stain; however, the structural detail of a biological sample is more accurately preserved. We have applied the technique of cryo-electron microscopy to the study of insulin receptor structure and visualized the insulin receptor in both the detergent-solubilized and vesicle-reconstituted forms. Using specific labeling techniques, we have also been able to identify distinct subdomains of the heterotetrameric complex under cryo conditions. These studies demonstrate the contribution that electron microscopy can make to understanding the entirety of a complex and structurally challenging protein such as the insulin receptor.RESULTSInsulin Receptor PurificationInsulin receptors were purified from NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor cDNA. Isolated cell membranes were solubilized in Triton X-100, and the resultant protein solution was subjected to conventional chromatographic separation including gel filtration, affinity chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography. The presence of the insulin receptor was monitored throughout the purification using protein and insulin binding assays (data not shown). The final product from the purification is a single protein of approximately 350 kDa under non-reducing conditions (Fig.1 A, lane 6) confirmed as the heterotetrameric insulin receptor by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B, lane 6). Despite the absence of reducing agent, a distinct band of approximately 200 kDa was often present during the purification, and this was identified as αβ half-receptor by Western blotting (Fig.1 B, lanes 3–5). The half-receptor could be separated from the heterotetrameric receptor by ion-exchange chromatography (data not shown) and is not present in the purified product (Fig. 1, A, lane 6, andB, lane 6). Functionality of the fully purified insulin receptor was confirmed by autophosphorylation assays (Fig. 1 C). Insulin receptors were incubated in the absence and presence of insulin with ATP and the appropriate metal ions. The phosphotyrosine content of the insulin receptor was detected by blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig. 1 Cillustrates that the insulin-dependent phosphorylation of the fully purified receptor corresponds to that of crude wheat germ-purified receptor controls (Fig. 1 C). These data confirm that the human insulin receptor obtained from this extensive purification protocol is intact as measured by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and functionality, the latter determined by autophosphorylation assays.Detergent-solubilized Insulin ReceptorThe purified, functionally active, heterotetrameric insulin receptor was visualized in the detergent-solubilized form using negative stain electron microscopy under low electron dose conditions. Several stains were used including sodium phosphotungstate and methylamine tungstate (data not shown); however, uranyl acetate provided the highest contrast and the most reproducible results. There were no large protein aggregates evident in the stained samples; however, occasionally, small clusters containing two or three receptors were seen. Regions with light, even stain were optimal for visualization of individual receptor particles with minimal detergent artifact. Selected receptors from the resulting micrographs are shown in Fig. 2. The negatively stained insulin receptors take on the same Y- or T-shaped appearance reported previously (19Christiansen K. Tranum-Jensen J. Carlsen J. Vinten J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2 A, there is considerable variation among individual receptors. Some appear as a perfect Y (Fig. 2 A, 1), while others appear as a perfect T (Fig. 2 A, 15); however, most of the receptors do not conform precisely to either shape and demonstrate “characteristics” of these two shapes (Fig. 2 A,7, 11, 12, 17,18, 20, and 22).Figure 2Detergent-solubilized insulin receptors preserved in 1% uranyl acetate and visualized under low electron dose conditions.

B, receptors in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of insulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Purified receptors were incubated in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of insulin prior to staining. The presence of insulin did not appear to affect the general staining characteristics of the insulin receptor. Unlike the results reported by Johnson et al.(30Johnson J.D. Wong M.L. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7516-7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), insulin did not appear to induce aggregation of the purified holoreceptors. Fig. 2 B displays selected individual insulin receptors in the presence of insulin. These receptors show the same Y- and T-like characteristics observed in the absence of insulin (Fig.2 A). There are receptors that appear like perfect Y (Fig.2 B, 4) and T (Fig. 2 B, 12) shapes, although the majority of the receptors appear to be variations on these themes. These data demonstrate that insulin receptors exhibit the same general multiformity with and without insulin. In the presence of insulin, the receptors appear to be slightly more globular and less variable in structure. Quantitative measurements, however, show that insulin does not affect the overall length of individual receptor arms, nor does it affect the distribution of arm lengths (data not shown). Insulin receptors in the presence of insulin appear to be slightly larger in width than insulin receptors without insulin (data not shown); however, the limited resolution of these images prohibits the conclusion that this difference represents an insulin-induced conformational change.In order to visualize the insulin receptor in a fully hydrated state, free of heavy metals and staining artifacts, we used the technique of cryo-electron microscopy. When preserved in vitreous ice and visualized using cryo-electron microscopy, the insulin receptor retains the Y- or T-shaped appearance identified above in negative stain. Fig.3 A is a representative field of detergent-solubilized receptors visualized using cryo-electron microscopy. Individual receptors from this field, and others, have been selected and displayed in Fig. 3 B. In the selected receptors, the Y-like characteristics of the insulin receptor (Fig.3 B, 4, 10, 12,23, 25, etc.) seem to dominate over the T-like characteristics (Fig. 3 B, 20 and 32), although both are evident. For many of the receptors, the Y-like or T-like appearance depends greatly on the perception of the individual observer. Of the 48 representative receptors selected and displayed in Fig. 3 B, no 2 are identical, differing in arm length, separation angles, or both. Because of the individual receptor variability, and lack of orienting features, overall receptor dimensions were not determined. The cryo-electron microscopy data do, however, confirm the gross insulin receptor structure identified in negative stain. As illustrated by Fig. 3 B, the four individual subunits of the insulin receptor come together to form a three-armed macromolecular complex.Figure 3Detergent-solubilized insulin receptors preserved in vitreous ice and visualized using cryo-electron microscopy.

Lee J. Lynch C.S. Backer J.M. Pilch P.F. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 4085-4091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and streptavidin-Nanogold. BBpa insulin is a photoactivatable insulin analogue that is covalently cross-linked to the insulin receptor when exposed to UV light (26Shoelson S.E. Lee J. Lynch C.S. Backer J.M. Pilch P.F. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 4085-4091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residue B29 of this analogue has a biotin moiety that is accessible to streptavidin binding (26Shoelson S.E. Lee J. Lynch C.S. Backer J.M. Pilch P.F. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 4085-4091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a streptavidin-Nanogold conjugate, we have been able to label the insulin binding site with a 1.4-nm gold particle and visualize the insulin receptor·BBpa-insulin·streptavidin-Nanogold complex by cryo-electron microscopy.Insulin receptors in the presence of the BBpa-insulin· streptavidin-Nanogold complex exhibit the same characteristics that were evident in the detergent-solubilized insulin receptor alone (Fig. 4). The receptors are identifiable, three-armed complexes (Fig. 4 A,1, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 15). Only one gold particle is seen per receptor, suggesting that only one insulin analogue binds per receptor, confirming the studies reported by Lee et al. (9Lee J. O'Hare T. Pilch P.F. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4092-4098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Nanogold particles were localized to the tip of one arm, and the identity of the gold was confirmed by defocus pairs (data not shown). Because insulin binds to the α-subunit of the insulin receptor, the presence of a gold particle at the tip of one of the arms identifies that arm as containing the α-subunit. Identifying one of the α-subunits does not assist in orienting the receptor subunit composition with respect to the two-dimensional projection, as this does not distinguish the identity of the other two arms. The location of the gold particle does, however, confirm that insulin binds to that arm and suggests that the insulin binding site is not itself at the arm tip. Because streptavidin was used as a linker between the gold particle and the insulin analogue, the true insulin binding site is at least 5 nm away from the gold particle. Additionally, the lack of distinct density attributable to the streptavidin molecule in the gold-labeled receptors suggests that the streptavidin density is concealed by the receptor density. Taking into account the streptavidin spacer and the effect of projecting the receptor complex in two dimensions, it is possible that the insulin binding site lies toward the center of the receptor molecule in a manner similar to that of the interaction between growth hormone and the growth hormone receptor (31DeVos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar).Figure 4Insulin receptor·BBpa-insulin·streptavidin-Nanogold complex preserved in vitrous ice and visualized using cryo-electron microscopy.

Erickson H.P. Federwisch M. Wollmer A. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23393-23402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that two of the arms of our three-armed structure contain the α-subunits, and the third arm contains both β-subunits. Identifying the β-subunit enables us to orient the receptor because the identity of all three arms would be determined. The β-subunit of the insulin receptor can be distinguished from the α-subunit based on its free sulfhydryl content (32Finn F.M. Ridge K.D. Hofman K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Wilden P.A. Boyle T.F. Swanson M.J. Sweet L.J. Pessin J.E.

We incubated purified insulin receptor with a biotin-maleimide conjugate and detected this conjugate with streptavidin-linked horseradish peroxidase. Fig.5 shows that in the absence of reducing agent, the heterotetrameric insulin receptor is labeled by the maleimide conjugate. Complete reduction of the holoreceptor into its component subunits demonstrates that greater than 95% of the labeling of the α2β2 receptor is located in the β-subunit with a trace corresponding to incorporation into the α-subunit (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). Compared with the extremely strong β-subunit band, this α-labeling is inconsequential and is most likely a result of some small degree of disulfide reduction. The identity of the individual subunits was confirmed with anti-insulin receptor α-subunit antibody and anti-insulin receptor β-subunit antibody (Fig. 5 B,lane 4). These data confirm the previous reports that only the β-subunit is accessible to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) labeling in the absence of reducing agents (32Finn F.M. Ridge K.D. Hofman K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Unlike the streptavidin-Nanogold used to label the α-subunit of the insulin receptor, monomaleimide-Nanogold does not have a large protein spacer. When the maleimide moiety is covalently attached to the sulfhydryl of a protein, the center of the gold particle is only 2 nm from the cysteine side chain (35Hainfeld J.F. Furuya F.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This property enables more direct labeling of the insulin receptor than the insulin·biotin·streptavidin complex used to label the α-subunit.Fig. 6 shows representative maleimide-Nanogold-labeled insulin receptor heterotetramers. The receptors were oriented using the SPIDER image processing package (29Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct.

https://openalex.org/W2037742735,"Human <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is synthesized as a proenzyme that undergoes an autocatalytic cleavage reaction generating the α and β subunits and forming the pyruvate prosthetic group, which is derived from an internal Ser residue (Ser-68). The mechanism of this processing reaction was studied using site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues (His-243 and Ser-229) located close to the cleavage site. Mutant S229A failed to process, and mutant S229C cleaved very slowly, whereas mutant S229T processed normally, suggesting that the hydroxyl group of residue 229 is required for the processing reaction where Ser-229 may act as a proton acceptor. Mutant His-243A cleaved very slowly, forming a small amount of the correctly processed pyruvoyl enzyme but a much larger proportion of the α subunit with an amino-terminal Ser. The cleavage to form the latter was greatly enhanced by hydroxylamine. This result suggests that the N-O acyl shift needed for ester formation occurs normally in this mutant but that the next step, which is a β-elimination reaction leading to the two subunits, does not occur. His-243 may therefore act as the basic residue that extracts the hydrogen of the α-carbon of Ser-68 in the ester in order to facilitate this reaction. The availability of the recombinant H243A <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase proenzyme provides a useful model system to examine the processing reaction <i>in vitro</i> and test the design of specific inactivators aimed at blocking the production of the pyruvoyl prosthetic group."
https://openalex.org/W1989384944,"Chimeric proteins resulting from characteristic chromosomal translocations are believed to play a key role in the development of neoplasia. The consistent chromosomal translocation t(12;22) found in Clear Cell sarcoma (CCS) fuses the genes for Ewing's sarcoma protein (EWS) and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1). Contribution of the chimeric EWS/ATF1 protein to maintenance of the tumor phenotype was investigated using intracellular expression of an inhibitory anti-ATF1 single chain antibody fragment (scFv4). Transfection of scFv4 into a cell line (SU-CCS-1) derived from CCS resulted in a 90% reduction in cyclic AMP response element-driven reporter activity. The delivery of scFv4 into SU-CCS-1 cells by a Moloney sarcoma retroviral vector (SRα-Fv4) significantly reduced viability and induced apoptosis as measured by terminal deoxynucleotidetransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling and flow cytometry. Conversely, scFv4 had no effect on viability of HeLa cells. The level of EWS/ATF1 expression was found to be significantly higher in primary tumor tissue than in SU-CCS-1 cells or in 293T cells following introduction of an EWS/ATF1 expression vector. These studies demonstrate a direct role for the EWS/ATF1 fusion protein in maintaining tumor cell viability of Clear Cell sarcoma and indicate that intracellular antibodies may be used to achieve a phenotypic knockout of tumor-related proteins as a method to explore their function. Chimeric proteins resulting from characteristic chromosomal translocations are believed to play a key role in the development of neoplasia.

Contribution of the chimeric EWS/ATF1 protein to maintenance of the tumor phenotype was investigated using intracellular expression of an inhibitory anti-ATF1 single chain antibody fragment (scFv4). Transfection of scFv4 into a cell line (SU-CCS-1) derived from CCS resulted in a 90% reduction in cyclic AMP response element-driven reporter activity. The delivery of scFv4 into SU-CCS-1 cells by a Moloney sarcoma retroviral vector (SRα-Fv4) significantly reduced viability and induced apoptosis as measured by terminal deoxynucleotidetransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling and flow cytometry. Conversely, scFv4 had no effect on viability of HeLa cells. The level of EWS/ATF1 expression was found to be significantly higher in primary tumor tissue than in SU-CCS-1 cells or in 293T cells following introduction of an EWS/ATF1 expression vector. These studies demonstrate a direct role for the EWS/ATF1 fusion protein in maintaining tumor cell viability of Clear Cell sarcoma and indicate that intracellular antibodies may be used to achieve a phenotypic knockout of tumor-related proteins as a method to explore their function.

Diagn Mol. Pathol. 1995; 4: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Look T.L. Science. 1997; 278: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 3Bridge J. Borek D. Neff J. Huntrakoon M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1990; 93: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The clonal nature of these chromosomal abnormalities, their association with specific cell types, and their presence in somatic cells but not germ cells suggests an important role in the development of neoplasia. Transcription factors are typically composed of multiple domains with different functions including DNA binding, dimerization, and transcriptional activation. The combination of specific domains from unrelated transcription factors may result in the generation of chimeric proteins with activity distinct from either of its components (3Bridge J. Borek D. Neff J. Huntrakoon M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1990; 93: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The chromosomal translocation t(12;22)(q13;q12) associated with Clear Cell sarcoma (CCS)1 was first described by Bridge et al. (3Bridge J. Borek D. Neff J. Huntrakoon M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1990; 93: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4Bridge J. Sreekantaiah C. Neff J. Sandberg A. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1991; 52: 101-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and has since been shown to be a characteristic finding of diagnostic value. The balanced translocation gives rise to a fusion protein in which the N-terminal 325 amino acids of the Ewing's sarcoma protein (EWS) replace the N-terminal 65 amino acids of the activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) (3Bridge J. Borek D. Neff J. Huntrakoon M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1990; 93: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4Bridge J. Sreekantaiah C. Neff J. Sandberg A. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1991; 52: 101-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The reciprocal ATF1/EWS translocation does not produce a fusion product in transformed cells due to the presence of an in-frame stop codon immediately C-terminal to the ATF1 sequence. The biologic role of EWS is not well understood. EWS functions as an RNA-binding protein and may play a role in RNA processing (5Speleman F. Delattre O. Peter M. Hauben E. Van Roy N. Van Marck E. Mod. Pathol. 1997; 10: 496-499PubMed Google Scholar). Bertolotti et al. (6Bertolotti A. Melot T. Ackler J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) suggested EWS may also function as a transcription factor due to a high degree of homology with the TBP-associated factor hTAFII68. EWS was shown in studies by Pan et al. (7Pan S. Ming K. Dunn T. Li K. Kee K. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to possess multiple determinants that cooperate synergistically to activate transcription, but by itself EWS was not capable of binding to DNA. Protein-protein interactions may occur between transcription factors, independent of DNA binding, and are important in transcriptional activation. EWS also participates in fusion proteins with other DNA-binding proteins, most notably FLI (8Magnaghi L.M.H. Robin P. Lininski M. Harel-Bellan A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a member of the ETS family, and EWS/FLI is overexpressed in Ewing's sarcoma. ATF1 is a member of the CREB/ATF subfamily of bZIP transcription factors that also includes CREB and CREM (9Sassone-Corsi P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 10Meyer T. Waeber G. Lin J. Beckmann W. Habener J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Foulkes N. Duval G. Sassone-Corsi P. Oncogene. 1996; 10: 1749-1756Google Scholar). These inducible transcription factors regulate transcription through binding as homodimers or heterodimers to cyclic AMP response elements (CRE) following activation of certain pathways such as protein kinase A. ATF1 is a weaker transactivator in vitro than CREB (12Gilchrist C. Orten D. Bosilevac J. Sanderson S. Hinrichs S. Antibody, Immunoconjugates and Radiopharmaceuticals. 1995; 8: 281-298Google Scholar, 13Orten D.J. Strawhecker J.M. Sanderson S.D. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B. Hinrichs S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32254-32263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EWS/ATF1 is predicted to bind to CREs via the bZIP domain provided by the C-terminal region of ATF1, but it does not retain cAMP-inducible activation due to partial deletion of the kinase-inducible domain located in the N-terminal 65 amino acids of ATF1(14). Brown et al. (15Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C. Lee K.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar) have shown in a heterologous cell type that EWS/ATF1 is a strong constitutive activator of some CRE-containing promoters and a repressor of others. A plausible mechanism for transformation in Clear Cell sarcoma involves the deregulated activation of CRE-containing promoters by the fusion protein. Other chimeric proteins, including the PAX/FKHR chimeric protein found in rhabdomyosarcoma, are capable of transforming cells in culture, and EWS/ATF1 may function in a similar manner to initiate tumor cell proliferation (16Paula Y. Lam P. Sublett J. Hollenbach A. M. R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The development of cancer is believed to be a multistep process, and downstream events may occur that render the tumor independent of the initiating event (14Li F. Lee K. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is not known whether EWS/ATF1 or other chimeric proteins resulting from translocations are essential for maintenance of cell proliferation. In studies aimed at addressing the cellular roles of ATF1, a single chain Fv fragment (scFv) was derived from an anti-ATF1 monoclonal antibody (mAb). The mAb, designated mAb41.4, inhibited ATF1 binding and transcriptional activation from CRE-containing promoters in vitro, and its epitope was mapped to the first 15 residues N-terminal to the DNA binding domain (13Orten D.J. Strawhecker J.M. Sanderson S.D. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B. Hinrichs S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32254-32263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gilchrist C. Orten D. Bosilevac J. Sanderson S. Hinrichs S. J. Biochem. Sci. 1995; 3: 96-127Google Scholar). The single chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from mAb41.4 (designated scFv4) retained in vitro activity, but unlike the mAb, it could be expressed intracellularly to target ATF1 activity (18Bosilevac J.M. Gilchrist C.A. Jankowski P.E. Paul S. Rees A.R. Hinrichs S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16874-16879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The availability of the anti-ATF1 scFv4 provided a unique means to explore the importance of DNA binding by EWS/ATF1 and evaluate its role in the neoplastic process. In this study, we demonstrate that the C-terminal region of EWS/ATF1 retains the mAb4 epitope and that this epitope is accessible for binding by scFv4. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the presence of mAb4 was capable of inhibiting CRE binding by EWS/ATF1. Intracellular expression of scFv4 reduced the activational effect of EWS/ATF1 on CRE-containing reporters when transfected into HeLa cells expressing EWS/ATF1 but had no effect on cell viability. Additional studies were performed in 293T cells transfected with EWS/ATF1 and in a cell line termed SU-CCS-1, derived from a human CCS tumor. Levels of EWS/ATF1 in both of these cell lines were lower than the level of EWS/ATF1 in primary tumor tissue as determined by Western blot. Following transfection into the EWS/ATF1-expressing SU-CCS-1 cell line, scFv4 reduced activity of a CRE-containing reporter, and this inhibitory effect could be reversed by overexpression of ATF1. These studies suggested that the role of EWS/ATF1 in maintenance of the malignant phenotype could be investigated directly if scFv4 intracellular expression could be achieved in a high percentage of SU-CCS-1 cells. When introduced via retroviral vector into SU-CCS-1 cells, intracellular expression of scFv4 reduced viability to 10% compared with controls. Evidence of tumor cell death occurring through an apoptotic mechanism was obtained by TUNEL and flow cytometry. Preparations of mAb4 were affinity purified on a protein G column and quantitated by absorbance at 280 nm (assuming 1 mg IgG/ml of IgG = 1.4A 280) with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Soluble scFv4 was produced and quantitated as described previously (38Ohno T. Ouchida M. Lee L. Gatalica Z. Rao V. Reddy E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3087-3097PubMed Google Scholar).Escherichia coli HB21 cells, incubated until reaching anA 600 of 0.6, were induced with isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated an additional 4 h at 25 °C. The periplasm was extracted in a high salt lysate buffer, clarified, and dialyzed. scFv4 quantitation was performed through slot blotting of the periplasmic extract and a peptide standard. The slot blots were stained with an anti-c-myc tag Ab (murine 9E10 hybridoma, ATCC) and an alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG heavy and light (H & L) chain Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). A standard curve (1–100 ng) using c-Myc peptide 1 (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) was generated, and the signal of scFv wells was visually compared for determination of approximate concentration and digitally scanned for densitometric analysis. Following normalization for mass (mass of c-Myc peptide = mass of scFv/8), the average periplasmic concentration of scFv was observed to be 5 ng/ml. Total RNA mini-preps were prepared from 100-mm dishes of SU-CCS-1 cells using Qiagen RNeasy and QuiaShredder columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The protocol for the isolation of total RNA from animal cells was followed as supplied by the manufacturer. 50 ng of total RNA was reverse-primed with an oligonucleotide poly(dT) primer and extended with SuperscriptTM reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to established protocols. TheEWS/ATF1 (15Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C. Lee K.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar) fusion was amplified from the product of the cDNA synthesis by polymerase chain reaction with appropriately designed primers based on the GenBankTM ATF1 andEWS sequences. A polymerase chain reaction product of approximately 1600 base pairs was obtained and ligated into the T/A cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for screening and sequencing. Multiple colonies were screened using mini-prep spin columns (Qiagen), and those containing the properly sized insert were submitted for automated sequencing. For intracellular expression assays, the cDNA of EWS/ATF1 was cloned into pCMV4(18). TheEcoRI-HindIII fragment from T/A-EWS/ATF1 was inserted into the BglII-HindIII sites of pCMV4 to generate the vector referred to as pEWS/ATF1 and used to generate protein in 293T cells. The vectors pATF1 and pFv4 are as described previously (18Bosilevac J.M. Gilchrist C.A. Jankowski P.E. Paul S. Rees A.R. Hinrichs S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16874-16879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The EWS/ATF1 cDNA was inserted into theEcoRI site of pET29(b) (Novagen, Madison, WI) which had theNcoI-EcoRV fragment removed. This construct, pET-EWS/ATF1, was screened for orientation and used for the in vitro generation of recombinant protein in E. coliBL21. Recombinant EWS/ATF1 was generated by in vitro transcription-translation using the TnT® T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI) as per the instructions of the manufacturer. Both35S-labeled and unlabeled recombinant proteins were generated for use as markers in Western blot and EMSA. Recombinant EWS/ATF1 and ATF1 were also generated through isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction of ATF1 cDNA and EWS/ATF1 cDNA containing pET vectors in E. coli BL21 (19Zhao L. Giam C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). ATF1-expressing bacteria were boiled for 20 min as described previously (19Zhao L. Giam C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). EWS/ATF1 was isolated as the insoluble protein fraction of induced bacteria according to established protocols (20Marasco W. Immunotechnology. 1995; 1: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Additionally, EWS/ATF1 was generated in 293T cells following transfection with pEWS/ATF1 and isolation of the nuclear extract using established protocols. EMSA were performed as described previously (13Orten D.J. Strawhecker J.M. Sanderson S.D. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B. Hinrichs S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32254-32263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gilchrist C. Orten D. Bosilevac J. Sanderson S. Hinrichs S. J. Biochem. Sci. 1995; 3: 96-127Google Scholar). Incubations were conducted at 30 °C after determining that EWS/ATF1 forms more intense complexes with the CRE at this temperature. 32P-Labeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus CRE 5′-AGA GAT TGC CTGACGTCA GAG AGC TAG-3′ was incubated with 50 ng of full-length recombinant ATF-1 from E. coli BL21 or EWS/ATF1 from 293T cells. The binding reactions were done in the presence or absence of mAb4, mAb5, EWS-N, and species and isotype-matched controls. Following electrophoresis, the bound and unbound fractions of labeled oligonucleotide were quantitated by autoradiography for 12 h using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The PhosphorImager data were exported as TIFF files and used to prepare Fig. 1, B and C. Protein extractions from HFF and SU-CCS-1 cell lines were made using triple detergent saline (TDS) lysis buffer (1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% lauryl sulfate (SDS)). Protein extraction efficiencies were determined by examining the relative amount of EWS/ATF1 and/or ATF1 in the insoluble cell membrane fraction as compared with the TDS-soluble fraction. The insoluble fraction remaining from the original TDS extraction was re-solubilized in 1% SDS, and DNA was sheared by sonication. The samples were boiled for 10 min and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblots (Western) were performed as described previously (13Orten D.J. Strawhecker J.M. Sanderson S.D. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B. Hinrichs S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32254-32263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein extraction from a Clear Cell sarcoma tumor was performed by mechanical homogenization in the presence of TDS lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were determined for each extract using the Bradford Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation was performed using mAb1 and mAb5 concurrently and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (6 μg/μl) incubated with 150 ng of cellular or tumor extract for 150 min at 4 °C. Efficiency of immunoprecipitation was determined by comparison of pre- and post-immunoprecipitation and supernatant fractions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with either 1 μg/ml mAb5 followed by an alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse heavy and light (H & L) chain secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or EWS-N (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by an AP-conjugated mouse anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The stained Western blots were digitally scanned using a UMAX Astra 610s scanner to generate transfer image file format (TIFF) images that were imported into Canvas version 5.0.3 and used to prepare Fig.1 D. In vitro 35S-labeled EWS/ATF1 analyzed by autoradiography migrated identically to the presumed EWS/ATF1 band generated by Western blot, thus confirming the identity of the EWS/ATF1 band. Analysis of band intensity was performed on the stained blots using a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Transient cotransfections of HeLa cells were performed according to established protocols using calcium phosphate precipitation (18Bosilevac J.M. Gilchrist C.A. Jankowski P.E. Paul S. Rees A.R. Hinrichs S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16874-16879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The transfections were performed in duplicate 35-mm wells containing 5 μg of the CMV-luciferase reporter construct and an Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase construct (2 μg) to control for variations in transfection efficiency. Cotransfections included increasing amounts of the EWS/ATF1 vector at 0, 5, 10, and 20 μg and the presence of plasmids pFv4 and pATF1. Additionally, a molar equivalent of parent vector (without cDNA insert) was used to maintain an equal number of promoter units in each transfection. The cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection, and the reporters were assayed. Transient cotransfections of SU-CCS-1 cells were performed using a similar approach of increasing amounts of pFv4. To facilitate efficient transfection of SU-CCS-1 cells, liposome-mediated transfection was used with the LipofectAMINE PLUS system (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells were harvested at 72 h. Measurement of reporter activity of firefly luciferase was determined as described relative to an internal β-galactosidase standard. Following transfection, cell extracts were prepared by freeze-thaw lysis in a potassium phosphate buffer. ATP and luciferin were added, and light emission was measured with a Luminoskan RS (Lab Systems/Denley, Franklin, MA) microplate luminometer. β-Galactosidase expression was quantitated through the addition ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. The luciferase value of each well was normalized to the internal β-galactosidase reporter. Results of three to five experiments were then averaged to generate the data depicted in Figs. 2and 3.Figure 3Effect of scFv4 on endogenous EWS/ATF1-regulated CRE-reporter activity in SU-CCS-1 cells.Transient co-transfection experiments in SU-CCS-1 cells were performed using increasing amounts (0–10 μg) of pFv4 and a CRE-luciferase (CRE-luc) reporter. Results from the addition of 10 μg of pFv4 are shown in lane 5. Relative light units (RLU) are depicted on the y axis with results of reporter alone set to 1.0 for comparison. Error barsrepresenting the average of at least three experiments are indicated. A constant number of CRE promoter elements was maintained in all experiments. Transfection efficiency was controlled by co-transfection of a β-galactosidase reporter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The retroviral vectors were produced by inserting theEcoRI-HindIII fragment of pFv4 that contains the cDNA of scFv4 into the SRα-PN retrovirus at the corresponding sites. SRα-PN was kindly provided by Dr. T. Smithgall and is the SRαMStkneo vector described by the laboratory of Dr. O. Witte (21Takebe Y. Seiki M.J.F. Hoy P. Yokota K. Aral K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol.

To infect SU-CCS-1 cells, the SRα-Fv DNA construct was cotransfected into 293T cells with the amphotrophic packaging vector psi(−) ampho. 10 μg of each was transfected using the LipofectAMINE system. The cellular supernatant was collected every 12 h between 24 and 72 h post-infection and pooled. The retroviral titer was determined by colony-forming assay in 3Y1 cells grown in minimum Eagle's medium containing 5% bovine calf serum and 800 mmG418 (Geneticin). Typical yields of retrovirus were 104cfu/ml. Infection of cells was performed using 3 ml of retroviral stock/well in a 6-well plate in the presence of 4 mg/ml hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene). Plates were spun at 1250 × g in a refrigerated centrifuge at 18 °C. The viability of SU-CCS-1 cells infected by SRα-Fv4 or control SRα-PN was determined by trypan blue stain exclusion. Cells were harvested from 35-mm dishes with a rubber policeman, suspended in minimum Eagle's medium, and transferred to centrifuge tubes. The cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. An equal amount of cell suspension was added to 2× trypan blue stain, and the cells were counted in a hemocytometer. Grids were counted to quantitate blue cells and white cells until a minimum of 400 was obtained. In order to avoid the mechanical harvesting which could interfere with viability measurements, an MTS assay was performed using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous non-radioactive proliferation assay (Promega) which is a colorimetric method for determining the number of viable cells in proliferation assays. The assay is composed of the tetrazolium compound 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and the electron coupling reagent phenazine methosulfate. MTS is bioreduced by cells into a formazan that is soluble in tissue culture medium. The absorbance of the formazan at 490 nm can be measured directly from 96-well assay plates without additional processing. The conversion of MTS into the aqueous soluble formazan is accomplished by dehydrogenase enzymes found in metabolically active cells. Therefore, the quantity of formazan is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. For this assay, SU-CCS-1 cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/well and infected with SRα-Fv4 or controls (0.2 ml/well). Cell infections were conducted over 7 days to generate a time course of viability. On day 7, 96-well plates were incubated with the MTS assay reagents, and the absorbance was measured. The results of 3–6 experiments were normalized and plotted as percent viable cells versus time. The same MTS procedure was used to study the effect of SRα-Fv4 and control treatments on HeLa cell viability over a 4-day time course. 50 μl of the washed cell suspensions described above were plated on glass slides, air-dried, and fixed in 50% acetone, 50% methanol. The remaining cell suspension was pelleted and fixed in 70% ethanol. The ethanol-fixed cells were prepared for DNA content analysis and apoptosis measurement by flow cytometry by washing in PBS and staining with propydium iodide (Telford reagent) overnight (24Telford W. King L. Parker P. Cell Proliferation. 1991; 24: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Measurements were made using a Becton Dickinson FACStarPLUSflow cytometer, and the data set was analyzed using ModFit DNA modeling software (Versity Software, Topsham, ME). The slides of fixed cells were stained for apoptosis by in situ labeling of DNA breaks using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) (25Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9167) Google Scholar). TdT was used to incorporate biotinylated deoxyuridine at sites of DNA breaks, and the signal was amplified by avidin-peroxidase and photographed under light microscopy. EWS/ATF1 incorporates the C-terminal region of ATF1 containing the epitopes of the two anti-ATF1 mAbs used in these studies (Fig. 1 A). Although both mAb4 and mAb5 recognize epitopes adjacent to the DNA binding domain of ATF1, mAb4 interferes with DNA binding by ATF1 in EMSA, and mAb5 super-shifts ATF1 without disrupting its DNA binding activity (18Bosilevac J.M.

The contribution of EWS to the overall conformation of the chimeric protein is unknown, and it was important to determine whether the addition of the EWS domain would block the epitope of mAb4 and mAb5. EWS/ATF1 and ATF1 were used in gel shift assays with radiolabeled CRE DNA to evaluate the ability of mAb4 and mAb5 to bind EWS/ATF and determine the effect of mAb4 and mAb5 on complex formation. EWS/ATF1 binding to CRE DNA has been previously demonstrated (14Li F. Lee K. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C. Lee K.A.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 159-167PubMed Google Scholar); however, it is not known whether CRE sequences are the primary target in cells or whether other related DNA sequences are capable of being bound (13Orten D.J.

Sanderson S. Hinrichs S. J. Biochem. Sci. 1995; 3: 96-127Google Scholar). For these studies, a consensus CRE (TGACGTCA) as occurs in the somatostatin promoter was utilized. EWS/ATF1 was expressed in 293T cells rather than bacteria to control for possible effects of post-translational modification (13Orten D.J. Strawhecker J.M. Sanderson S.D. Huang D. Prystowsky M.B.

This effect on complex formation was similar to that of mAb4 on ATF1·CRE complexes (compare lanes 2 and5, Fig. 1 B) and the supershift of ATF1·CRE complexes by mAb5 (lane 7).

We first initiated a time course analysis of bpV-mediated activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 long terminal repeat- and NF-κB-driven reporter gene. Our results showed a slower and more transient activation of both κB-regulated luciferase-encoding vectors by bpV compounds when compared with the action of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF). Time course analyses of NF-κB translocation by shift assay experiments further confirmed these results, hence implying distinct pathways of NF-κB activation for bpV compounds and TNF. Attempts to characterize the bpV-dependent signaling cascade revealed that thesrc family protein tyrosine kinase p56lck was critical for NF-κB induction by bpV. Furthermore, p56lckinteraction with the intracytoplasmic tail of CD4 markedly enhanced such induction. Optimal activation of NF-κB following bpV treatment necessitated downstream effectors of p56lck such as thesyk family protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 and the molecular adaptor SLP-76. Importantly, reduced NF-κB activation was observed when capacitative calcium entry was deficient but also upon pharmacological inhibition of calmodulin and calcineurin. Altogether, these results suggest that induction of NF-κB by phosphotyrosyl phosphatase bpV inhibitors necessitates both proximal and distal effectors of T cell activation.

The binding of extracellular cytokines to their physiological cell surface receptors leads to a cascade of biochemical events generally culminating in the activation of specific transcription factors. One of them is the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)1 that is a dimer composed most frequently of subunits p50 and RelA (p65) but occasionally composed of other subunits like p52, c-Rel, and RelB (reviewed in Ref. 1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4609) Google Scholar). In most cell types, this transcription factor is retained in the cytoplasm by an inhibitory factor called IκB (2Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Activation of protein kinases in the cell ultimately leads to phosphorylation of two critical serines on IκB (3Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar) targeting it for degradation by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-dependent fashion (4Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F.

In T cells, NF-κB activation normally occurs either via classical antigenic recognition of a specific peptide/major histocompatibility complex by the T cell receptor (7Jamieson C. McCaffrey P.G. Rao A. Sen R. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 416-420PubMed Google Scholar) or via stimulation by proinflammatory cytokine such as tumor necrosis factor (8Lowenthal J.W. Ballard D.W. Bohnlein E. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2331-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and interleukin-1 (9Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Signaling events leading to NF-κB activation following TNF and IL-1 stimulation are becoming quite well characterized (reviewed in Ref. 10Natoli G. Costanzo A. Moretti F. Fulco M. Balsano C. Levrero M. J. Biol.

TCR-derived activation of NF-κB is nonetheless assuredly critical for differentiation, activation, proliferation, and protection from apoptosis of T lymphocytes because knockout mice for c-Rel (11Kontgen F.

The state of activation of a T lymphocyte is reflected by the amount of its intracellular tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation is controlled by a direct balance of power between activities of PTKs and PTPs. An increase of tyrosine phosphorylation thus occurs either from induction of PTKs or from inhibition of PTPs. To inhibit specifically PTPs, a novel series of compounds has been synthesized that are derived from the mixture of vanadate and hydrogen peroxide. Unlike pervanadate, these new bisperoxo- vanadium compounds are highly purified by51V NMR and contain an ancillary ligand in the inner coordination sphere of the vanadium molecule whose function is to increase the stability of the compound as well as to provide a certain degree of specificity (16Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their mode of action is thought to be the same as pervanadate which can enter the active site of the enzyme due to its high similarity with phosphate groups and then oxidize the conserved catalytic cysteine residue located at the bottom of the active site (17Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). These properties make pervanadate and its purified counterparts, the bpV molecules, competitive, specific, and highly potent inhibitors of PTPs (18Morinville A. Maysinger D. Shaver A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 452-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). PTP inhibitors are mainly recognized for their insulinomimetic properties on adipocytes and myocytes (16Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B.

Biochem. 1995; 153: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, lymphocytes treated with PTP inhibitors such as pervanadate demonstrate many characteristics proper to activated T cells such as an increase in c-fos gene transcription and IL-2 production as well as expression of activation markers such as CD25 and CD69. Furthermore, several studies have identified a panoply of second messengers that are activated following pervanadate treatment of lymphocytes such as p56lck, p59fyn, ZAP-70, intracellular calcium, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (21Secrist J.P.

Those effector molecules are thought to permit the shuttling of the activation signal to the nucleus in order to mediate gene transcription by the activation of specific transcription factors. Interestingly, nuclear translocation of NF-κB is seen in cells treated with pervanadate, but it was reported by Imbert and co-workers (25Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.

These results could not be reproduced regarding NF-κB activation by bpV compounds since two following studies using different bpV compounds reported that serine phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα seemed in fact necessary for NF-κB-dependent activation of gene transcription (26Barbeau B.

In this study, we have thus characterized signal transducers involved in activation of NF-κB following treatment of CD4+ T lymphoid cells with these novel bpV compounds that can markedly increase intracellular phosphotyrosyl levels. We demonstrate the critical role of thesrc family PTK p56lck as well as the importance of its interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein CD4 in the activation of NF-κB after treatment with bpV. The sykfamily PTK ZAP-70 and its downstream effector, SLP-76, are also clearly involved in the cascade but seem not to be as essential as p56lck for bpV-induced activation of NF-κB. Finally, we demonstrate that capacitative entry of calcium is necessary for efficient NF-κB induction upon bpV treatment, and both calmodulin and calcineurin are similarly required. The lymphoid T cell lines used in this work include Jurkat (clone E6.1), JCAM1.6, 1G5, JκB, P116, P116 cl.39, P116 cl.40, JRT3, J14-V-29, J14-76-11, CJ parental, CJ 5.13, CJ 1.1, A2.01, A2D8, and 3D4D8. Jurkat is considered as a model cell line for the study of T cell signaling machinery (28Gillis S. Watson J. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1709-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). JCAM1.6 is a derivative of the Jurkat leukemic T cell line, which is deficient in p56lck expression (29Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The 1G5 T cell line is a Jurkat derivative that harbors two stably integrated constructs constituted of the luciferase gene under the control of the HIV-1 SF2 LTR (30Aguilar-Cordova E. Chinen J. Donehower L. Lewis D.E. Belmont J.W. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). JκB cell line was developed for this study and consists of Jurkat cells electroporated with pNF-κB-LUC and pEFneo constructs at a 10:1 ratio. The G418-resistant population harbors an NF-κB-responsive promoter driving the luciferase gene. P116 is a ZAP-70-deficient derivative of Jurkat, and the P116 cl.39 and P116 cl.40 are clones reconstituted using a ZAP-70 expression vector (31Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The JRT3 cell line is a Jurkat derivative and is deficient for the expression of the TCR·CD3 complex due to a deletion in the β chain of the TCR that hinders expression of the whole complex on the cell surface (32Morley B.J. Chin K.N. Newton M.E. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1971-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The J14-V-29 cell line is also derived from Jurkat and lacks expression of the T cell-specific adaptor SLP-76 that has been reintroduced using an expression vector, thus creating the J14-76-11 clone (33Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The CJ cell lines have been derived from Jurkat using a toxic gene under the control of the NFAT transcription factor (34Fanger C.M. Hoth M. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The CJ parental cell line retains full calcium capacitative entry, whereas the CJ 5.13 and CJ 1.1 have, respectively, 40% and less than 10% of the wild-type capacitative entry of calcium following stimulation. A2.01 is a CD3- and CD4-negative T lymphoid cell line (35Folks T. Powell D.M. Lightfoote M.M. Benn S. Martin M.A. Fauci A.S. Science. 1986; 231: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The A2D8 clone of A2.01 cells is stably transfected with human full-length CD4, whereas the 3D4D8 clone is stably expressing a truncated version of the human CD4 glycoprotein lacking 32 of 38 amino acids located in the cytoplasmic domain (36Tremblay M. Meloche S. Gratton S. Wainberg M.A. Sekaly R.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 774-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All cell lines were grown in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories) added with penicillin and streptomycin except for CJ cell lines, which were grown in 20% fetal calf serum. When necessary, G418 and/or hygromycin B were added to the cell culture medium at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and 300 μg/ml, respectively. The expression vector for p56lck, pEFneo LCK-wt, as well as the pEFneo-based empty vector have already been described (37Couture C. Baier G. Oetken C. Williams S. Telford D. Marie-Cardine A. Baier-Bitterlich G. Fischer S. Burn P. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5249-5258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were kind gifts from Dr. Clement Couture (Lady Davis Institute). The expression vector encoding luciferase under the control of five consensus binding sites for NF-κB (pNF-κB-LUC) was obtained from Stratagene. For each condition, 5 × 106 cells were washed with transfection buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.7 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4), centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 500 μl of transfection buffer supplemented with 5–30 μg of plasmidic DNA and 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cell/DNA/DEAE-Dextran mixture was then incubated for 25 min at room temperature after which 5 ml of 100 μmchloroquine (Sigma) in cell culture medium was added. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min before centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min followed by resuspension of the cells in fresh cell culture medium prior to incubation for 16–24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For studies using pharmacological inhibitors, cells were resuspended in fresh cell culture medium at 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cyclosporin A (CsA) (Fujisawa, Osaka, Japan) and FK506 (Sigma) were added at subcytotoxic concentrations of 50–100 and 5–10 ng/ml, respectively, for 30 min before stimulation. Calmidazolium chloride (Calbiochem) was added 1 h before stimulation at subcytotoxic concentrations of 5–10 μm. Depending on the experiments, transfected or pretreated cells were then stimulated with PMA at 20 ng/ml (Sigma), PHA (Sigma) at 3 μg/ml, ionomycin (Sigma) at 1 μm, and TNF (R & D Systems) at 2 or 8 ng/ml. Bisperoxovanadium compounds harboring different ancillary ligand (bipyridine, bpV[bipy]; 5-hydroxypyridine-2-carboxylic acid anion, bpV[HOpic]; pyridine-2-carboxylic acid anion, bpV[pic]) were always added at a subcytotoxic and subcytostatic concentration of 10 μm. Luciferase activity was monitored following a previously described protocol (26Barbeau B. Bernier R. Dumais N. Briand G. Olivier M. Faure R. Posner B.I. Tremblay M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12968-12977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) in which 100 μl of cell-free supernatant is drawn from each well and 25 μl of 5× lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) is added. After 30 min of vigorous agitation and one freeze/thaw cycle, 20 μl of cellular extracts were transferred to a luminometer plate, and luciferase activity was monitored on a Dynex MLX microplate luminometer for 20 s/well after a 2-s delay following addition of 100 μl of luciferase buffer (20 mm tricine, 1.07 mm(MgCO3)4 · Mg(OH)2 · 5 H2O, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 220 μm coenzyme A, 4.70 μm d-luciferin potassium salt, 530 μm ATP, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to a previously described protocol (26Barbeau B. Bernier R. Dumais N. Briand G. Olivier M. Faure R. Posner B.I. Tremblay M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12968-12977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, unstimulated or activated cells (5 × 106) were first washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer (Buffer A: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and kept 15 min on ice before lysis with 25 μl of Nonidet P-40 10%. After brief vortexing and centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended with a hypertonic buffer (Buffer B: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by gentle agitation for 15 min. The solution was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was assayed for protein concentration by BCA assay (Pierce) and stored at −85 °C until use. Radioactive labeling of an oligonucleotide specific for NF-κB (5′ ATGTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC 3′) was performed by mixing 50 ng of one of the DNA strands in a T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and the T4 polynucleotide kinase for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 0.2 m EDTA and 25 μl of H2O. A phenol/chloroform extraction of the oligonucleotide was then performed after which the aqueous phase was spun through a G-50 Sephadex column for further purification. The oligonucleotide was then allowed to hybridize with 200 ng of the complementary strand in an annealing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) after heating at 90 °C for 2 min. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) mixed with poly(dI-dC) (1 μg/ml), bovine serum albumin (1 μg/ml), and the labeled oligonucleotide in a binding buffer were first incubated at room temperature and run through a 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel for 2 h at 150 V. Competition experiments were performed with 100-fold excess of cold oligonucleotides harboring sequences for NF-κB (specific competition) or Oct-2A (nonspecific competition). Gels were dried and exposed on a Kodak Biomax MR film at −85 °C. In order to characterize the NF-κB signaling pathway initiated by the bpV PTP inhibitors, kinetic analyses of NF-κB activation were carried out using bpV and other well known NF-κB-inducing agents. Results showed a strong induction of both HIV-1 long terminal repeat- and NF-κB-driven reporter gene expression by bpV molecules and commonly used inducers of NF-κB (PMA, PHA, and TNF). In stably transfected 1G5 cells harboring a construct encoding the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR, maximum levels of luciferase activity were achieved at approximately the same time (8 h) for all activators tested (Fig.1, panels A and B). In stably transfected JκB cells expressing luciferase under the control of five consensus binding sites for NF-κB, the induction kinetics were different since PMA, PHA, PMA/PHA, and TNF all showed a peak of activity after a 6-h treatment (Fig. 1, panel C), whereas that of cells stimulated with bpV appeared later, between 8 and 12 h (Fig. 1, panel D, and data not shown). Furthermore, luciferase activity for both HIV-1 LTR- and NF-κB-driven expression vectors was much more transient when cells were stimulated with bpV compounds than with any other activator. When electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed, nuclear translocation of NF-κB correlated with transcriptional assays, showing a delayed and less sustained activation of NF-κB (compare lanes 3–7 withlanes 8–12). In fact, NF-κB activation by TNF appeared within no more than 10 min (lane 3), while detectable nuclear translocation by bpV required at least 30 min (lane 10). Furthermore, peak activation of NF-κB was delayed in cells stimulated with bpV and started declining at the 120-min time point (lanes 11 and 12). All induced signals were found to be specific to the NF-κB probe as these latter were outcompeted by 100-fold excess of cold NF-κB oligonucleotide (lanes 14and 15) but not by excess of a nonspecific oligonucleotide (lanes 17 and 18). Our results hence suggest that NF-κB activation by either TNF or bpV does not proceed through similar signaling cascade. TCR-oriented signaling is one of the most important activation pathways of T lymphocytes. Such activation first requires the participation of two major types of PTK, the src and the syk family PTK. Thesrc family PTK p56lck is physically linked with CD4 in helper T lymphocytes and has been reported to phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of the CD3 ζ chains (38Barber E.K. Dasgupta J.D. Schlossman S.F. Trevillyan J.M. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3277-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). These phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs provide anchoring for the syk family PTK ZAP-70 (39Wange R.L. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which becomes activated (40Neumeister E.N. Zhu Y. Richard S. Terhorst C. Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is then responsible for phosphorylation of downstream effectors such as p36LAT (41Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) and SLP-76 (42Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19641-19644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In order to find possible effectors of NF-κB activation following PTP inhibition by bpV, cell lines deficient for either p56lck, ZAP-70, or the TCR·CD3 complex were transfected with a NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter gene and stimulated with TNF, PHA, and bpV[pic]. Transfection of NF-κB-LUC in the p56lck-deficient cell line JCAM1.6 showed a dramatic loss of activation in terms of luciferase activity by either PHA or bpV[pic] (Fig. 2, panel A). A similar loss of activation was clearly apparent when the ZAP-70-deficient cell line P116 was instead transfected and stimulated by either of these NF-κB activators (Fig. 2, panel A). The absence of TCR/CD3 expression (JRT3 cells), surprisingly, seemed to have no consequences on NF-κB activation by bpV[pic]. As expected, PHA treatment of transfected JRT3 cells resulted in total abrogation of the induction of luciferase activity. However, TNF-induced activation of NF-κB was found to be unaffected in JCAM1.6, JRT3, and P116 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with the same cell lines stimulated with TNF or bpV[pic] for 10, 60, or 240 min. These data confirmed results from the transcriptional activation experiments since, upon bpV[pic] stimulation, no translocation of NF-κB could be seen in JCAM1.6 (p56lck-deficient) cells (Fig. 2,panel B, lanes 5–8), whereas greatly reduced NF-κB translocation occurred in P116 (ZAP-70-deficient) cells (Fig. 2,panel B, lanes 13–16). Furthermore, although JRT3 cells stimulated with bpV[pic] showed a lesser extent of NF-κB translocation as compared with the parental Jurkat cells (Fig. 2,panel B, lanes 9–12), NF-κB activation seemed to be faster, which might account for the observed similarity in luciferase activity between bpV-treated Jurkat and JRT3 cell lines. For all cell lines tested, TNF stimulation resulted in fast and strong NF-κB translocation independently of the deficiency characterizing these cell lines (Fig. 2, panel C). Our findings indicate that, although the TCR itself is not absolutely required per se, bpV-mediated activation of NF-κB involves several effectors shared with TCR-mediated signaling pathway, and such signal transducers are not necessary for induction of NF-κB by TNF. PTKs of the src family are critical in many signal transduction pathways, and p56lck is especially important in TCR signaling. Its absence leads to unresponsiveness of the cell to its nominal antigen, anti-CD3 or -TCR antibodies as well as mitogenic agents such as PHA. Since p56lck-negative cell line were found to be unresponsive to bpV as well, reconstitution experiments were performed in which JCAM1.6 cells were transfected with the pNF-κB-LUC construct and a p56lck expression vector or a control plasmid. As previously demonstrated (Fig. 2, panel A), a minimal fold induction was measured in pNF-κB-LUC-transfected JCAM1.6 cells after bpV treatment (Fig.3, panel A). Expression of p56lck restored NF-κB responsiveness of the JCAM1.6 cell line toward bpV induction. These results clearly demonstrate that a defect in the expression of p56lck results in an unresponsive state with respect to the induction of NF-κB upon bpV treatment. Intracellular localization of many enzymes is critical for their action by allowing interactions either with their substrate or with needed cofactors. p56lckinteracts with the intracellular portion of the CD4 glycoprotein and this interaction allows it to colocalize with the TCR·CD3 complex during antigenic recognition (43Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Samelson L.E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1989; 338: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 44Shaw A.S. Chalupny J. Whitney J.A. Hammond C. Amrein K.E. Kavathas P. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In order to assess if this interaction is important for NF-κB activation following PTP inhibition, we used the CD3- and CD4-deficient cell line A2.01 and reconstituted clones expressing either wild-type CD4 or a truncated CD4 version lacking the intracellular portion. Such pNF-κB-LUC-transfected cells were next stimulated with TNF or bpV[pic] prior to monitoring of luciferase activity. Results showed a 4-fold enhancement of NF-κB-driven luciferase activity by bpV[pic] with the A2.01 cell line expressing full-length CD4 (A2D8) in comparison to the parental A2.01 cell line or the derivative expressing the truncated CD4 version (3D4D8) (Fig. 3, panel B). TNF induction of NF-κB was not significantly altered by the presence or the absence of cell surface CD4, further showing that TNF-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway is independent of either p56lck, CD4, or their physical association. These results thus further argued for the importance of the most"
https://openalex.org/W1989419438,"RNA 3′-terminal phosphate cyclases are a family of evolutionarily conserved enzymes that catalyze ATP-dependent conversion of the 3′-phosphate to the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiester at the end of RNA. The precise function of cyclases is not known, but they may be responsible for generating or regenerating cyclic phosphate RNA ends required by eukaryotic and prokaryotic RNA ligases. Previous work carried out with human andEscherichia coli enzymes demonstrated that the initial step of the cyclization reaction involves adenylation of the protein. The AMP group is then transferred to the 3′-phosphate in RNA, yielding an RNA-N3′pp5′A (N is any nucleoside) intermediate, which finally undergoes cyclization. In this work, by using different protease digestions and mass spectrometry, we assign the site of adenylation in the E. coli cyclase to His-309. This histidine is conserved in all members of the class I subfamily of cyclases identified by phylogenetic analysis. Replacement of His-309 with asparagine or alanine abrogates both enzyme-adenylate formation and cyclization of the 3′-terminal phosphate in a model RNA substrate. The cyclase is the only known protein undergoing adenylation on a histidine residue. Sequences flanking the adenylated histidine in cyclases do not resemble those found in other proteins modified by nucleotidylation."
https://openalex.org/W2055364662,"Adenovirus E1A confers enhanced cell sensitivity to radiation and drug-induced DNA damage by a mechanism involving the binding to cellular proteins. Mutant analysis in E1A-transfected murine keratinocytes demonstrates that increased sensitivity to DNA damage requires at least E1A binding to the p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) transcriptional coactivators and to pRb family members, indicating that this biological activity of E1A is the result of the concomitant perturbation of different cell pathways. Here we show that in the same cells E1A binding to members of the retinoblastoma protein family induces transcriptional down-regulation of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) gene, coding for a NAD-dependent enzyme stimulated by DNA breaks. Inhibition of PARP expression is accompanied by a decrement of γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis, which is overridden by reconstitution of wild type levels of PARP. Hence, E1A effects on PARP transcription are central determinant of the apoptotic sensitivity of E1A-expressing keratinocytes. Conversely, E1A binding to only p300/CBP results in an increase in PARP enzyme activity and consequently in cell death susceptibility to irradiation, which is effectively counteracted by the PARP chemical inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide. Therefore, our results identify in the E1A-mediated effects on PARP expression and activity a key molecular event involved in E1A-induced cell sensitization to genotoxic stress.

This effect is probably the consequence of perturbation of a variety of cellular basal programs, like proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death (1Zantema A. van der Eb A.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 119: 1-23Google Scholar). A well characterized effect of transfected E1A alone is a marked increase in cell sensitivity to DNA damaging agents (ionizing radiation and DNA-targeted chemotherapeutic compounds such as doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil) in epithelial tumor (2Sanchez-Prieto R. Quintanilla M. Cano A. Leonart M.L. Martin P. Anaya A. Ramon y Cajal S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1083-1092PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shao R. Karunagaran D. Zhou B.P. Li K. Lo S.S. Deng J. Chiao P. Hung M.C.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 675-682PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in primary embryo fibroblasts (6Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E.

A. 1997; 94: 12094-12099Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). At the doses employed in the cited studies, the morphology of cell death induced by these agents is that of apoptosis, which under conditions of serum deprivation and high cell density could be elicited per se by E1A transfection, without any additional stimulus (8Rao L. Debbas M. Sabbatini P. Hockenbery D. Korsmeyer S. White E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the basis of E1A-induced enhanced sensitivity to DNA damage relies at least partially in the lowering of the apoptotic threshold, by acting at a distal step in the programmed cell death pathway. E1A encodes two mRNA species, named 13S and 12S, which give respectively a 289- and a 243-amino acid protein, identical apart from an internal stretch of 46 amino acids. E1A proteins present two conserved regions (CR1 and CR2), which are known from mutational studies to be responsible for the induction of transformation and to be the site of interaction with several identified cellular proteins (reviewed in Ref. 9Barbeau D. Marcellus R.C. Bacchetti S. Bayley S.T. Branton P.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These proteins are p107, p130, and p105Rb, belonging to the pRb tumor suppressor gene family and which interact primarily with CR2 with a weak cooperativity of CR1, and p300 and CREB1-binding protein (CBP) of the p300/CBP family of transcriptional coactivators, which require a portion of CR1 and the N terminus for binding (10Barbeau D. Charbonneau R. Whalen S.G. Bayley S.T. Branton P.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 359-373PubMed Google Scholar). Since these proteins have key regulatory roles in different cell pathways, the perturbations induced by their association with E1A are thought to be responsible for the complex biological activity of E1A (11Moran E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism leading to E1A-induced cell sensitization and the exact role in this process of the bound cellular proteins are almost totally unclear.This study was designed with the aim of finding downstream substrates for the action of E1A that could be involved in its sensitization to ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. We used an established in vitro model of spontaneously immortalized murine keratinocytes, stably transfected with full-length E1A 13S or with E1A 13S deletion mutants unable to bind either p300 (mutant NTdl598) or p105Rb (mutant NTdl922/947) family members (5Sanchez-Prieto R. Lleonart M. Ramon y Cajal S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 675-682PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, we demonstrate that E1A down-regulates the expression of PARP (EC 2.4.2.30), an abundant nuclear enzyme endowed with DNA damage-triggered ADP-ribosylating activity and involved in the late apoptotic cascade as a substrate/effector protein (12Le Rhun Y. Kirkland J.B. Shah G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). By testing the behavior of the two mutant E1A-expressing cell lines, we also show that this effect is mediated by E1A binding to pRb proteins and is accompanied by apoptosis resistance to γ-rays, while E1A binding to the transcriptional integrators p300/CBP enhances PARP activity and increases irradiation-induced cell death.DISCUSSIONDespite the substantial amount of data describing the details of the interaction of E1A with cellular proteins, limited information is available on how this interaction brings to the pleiotropic effects of E1A, including cell sensitization to genotoxic agents. Since these agents are known to elicit a complex pathway starting with the change in activity of DNA damage sensor proteins (26Szumiel I. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150: S92-S101Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), an obvious hypothesis is that E1A could directly or indirectly affect the expression and activity of these proteins to produce its profound perturbations in the downstream signals. A first confirmation of this assumption has come with the recent demonstration that p300/CBP coactivators are essential for the transactivation function of the p53 oncosuppressor protein (27Scolnick D.M. Chehab N.H. Stavridi E.S. Lien M.C. Caruso L. Moran E. Berger S.L. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3693-3696PubMed Google Scholar) and that E1A sequestration of p300/CBP disrupts functions mediated by p53 (28Somasundaram K. el-Deiry W. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 29Lill N. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Since p53 is known to be activated by its direct association with DNA strand breaks (30Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 31Jayaraman J. Prives C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), we wanted to study the effects of E1A on another well known DNA lesion-scanning protein, the PARP enzyme.Similarly to p53, PARP is activated by binding to breaks in DNA, binding that triggers its enzymatic domain to consume NAD for the synthesis of chains of poly(ADP-ribose) on target proteins, including PARP itself (32de Murcia G. Menissier de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). We focused on an established model of spontaneously immortalized and stably E1A-transfected cells, the murine Pam212 keratinocytes, to look for a role of PARP in modulation by E1A of the response to γ-irradiation. We found that full-length E1A induced a clear down-regulation of expression of PARP both at the protein and the mRNA level and that this effect is due to transcriptional repression of the PARP promoter. Moreover, mutant analysis clearly indicated that this E1A activity is dependent on its association with pRb-related proteins. A well described mechanism of in vivostimulation of transcription by pRb is that mediated by binding to the transcriptional activator Sp1 (33Kim S.J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 34Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D. Murata Y. Martin K.H. Humphrey P.A. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl.

Virol. 1996; 77: 2775-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Since in the rat PARP promoter five consensus sites for Sp1 are present to whom Sp1 has been demonstrated to bind strongly stimulating transcription in reporter assays (38Yokoyama Y. Kawamoto T. Mitsuuchi Y. Kurosaki T. Toda K. Ushiro H. Terashima M. Sumimoto H. Kuribayashi I. Yamamoto Y. et al.Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 39Potvin F.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the pRb-Sp1 activator complex could be responsible for positive regulation of the PARP promoter, destroyed by E1A-induced sequestration of pRb. This activity of E1A is also associated with a reduction of apoptosis elicited by γ-ray, and the role of PARP down-regulation in this process, among the other events induced by E1A binding to pRb proteins, is sustained by the fact that PARP expression in the same mutant cell line under the control of a viral promoter restores cell sensitivity to γ-ray. An antiapoptotic activity of E1A mediated by PARP down-regulation is in agreement with the demonstration of profound protection from experimental cerebral ischemic injury in PARP null mice (41Eliasson M.J. Sampei K. Mandir A.S. Hurn P.D. Traystman R.J. Bao J. Pieper A. Wang Z.Q. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Dawson V.L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) and with the partial protection exerted in wild type mice by PARP chemical inhibitors (42Lo E.H. Bosque-Hamilton P. Meng W. Stroke. 1998; 29: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cerebral ischemia is supposed to elicit a pathway starting with the excessive release of glutamate by overexcited neurons and resulting in the production of DNA damaging species (43Choi D.W. Neuron. 1988; 1: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar), which in turn overactivate PARP with the consequent depletion of NAD and a sudden ATP fall induced by the cell effort to resynthesize NAD, ultimately responsible for death (23Zhang J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 1994; 263: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar).Besides our demonstration of the role of PARP activity in E1A cell sensitization to radiation-induced apoptosis, the complex effects of E1A on the expression and activation of PARP could represent a future tool for dissecting the regulation of this gene, as happened in the past for other nuclear proteins directly or indirectly affected by E1A. Adenovirus E1A proteins stimulate entry into S-phase of the infected cells and, in combination with E1B proteins, induce transformation. This effect is probably the consequence of perturbation of a variety of cellular basal programs, like proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death (1Zantema A. van der Eb A.J. Curr. Top.

This activity of E1A is also associated with a reduction of apoptosis elicited by γ-ray, and the role of PARP down-regulation in this process, among the other events induced by E1A binding to pRb proteins, is sustained by the fact that PARP expression in the same mutant cell line under the control of a viral promoter restores cell sensitivity to γ-ray. An antiapoptotic activity of E1A mediated by PARP down-regulation is in agreement with the demonstration of profound protection from experimental cerebral ischemic injury in PARP null mice (41Eliasson M.J. Sampei K. Mandir A.S. Hurn P.D. Traystman R.J. Bao J. Pieper A. Wang Z.Q. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Dawson V.L. Nat.

Stroke. 1998; 29: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cerebral ischemia is supposed to elicit a pathway starting with the excessive release of glutamate by overexcited neurons and resulting in the production of DNA damaging species (43Choi D.W. Neuron. 1988; 1: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar), which in turn overactivate PARP with the consequent depletion of NAD and a sudden ATP fall induced by the cell effort to resynthesize NAD, ultimately responsible for death (23Zhang J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 1994; 263: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar).Besides our demonstration of the role of PARP activity in E1A cell sensitization to radiation-induced apoptosis, the complex effects of E1A on the expression and activation of PARP could represent a future tool for dissecting the regulation of this gene, as happened in the past for other nuclear proteins directly or indirectly affected by E1A. Despite the substantial amount of data describing the details of the interaction of E1A with cellular proteins, limited information is available on how this interaction brings to the pleiotropic effects of E1A, including cell sensitization to genotoxic agents. Since these agents are known to elicit a complex pathway starting with the change in activity of DNA damage sensor proteins (26Szumiel I. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150: S92-S101Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), an obvious hypothesis is that E1A could directly or indirectly affect the expression and activity of these proteins to produce its profound perturbations in the downstream signals. A first confirmation of this assumption has come with the recent demonstration that p300/CBP coactivators are essential for the transactivation function of the p53 oncosuppressor protein (27Scolnick D.M. Chehab N.H. Stavridi E.S. Lien M.C. Caruso L. Moran E. Berger S.L. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3693-3696PubMed Google Scholar) and that E1A sequestration of p300/CBP disrupts functions mediated by p53 (28Somasundaram K. el-Deiry W. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 29Lill N. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Since p53 is known to be activated by its direct association with DNA strand breaks (30Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 31Jayaraman J. Prives C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), we wanted to study the effects of E1A on another well known DNA lesion-scanning protein, the PARP enzyme. Similarly to p53, PARP is activated by binding to breaks in DNA, binding that triggers its enzymatic domain to consume NAD for the synthesis of chains of poly(ADP-ribose) on target proteins, including PARP itself (32de Murcia G. Menissier de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). We focused on an established model of spontaneously immortalized and stably E1A-transfected cells, the murine Pam212 keratinocytes, to look for a role of PARP in modulation by E1A of the response to γ-irradiation. We found that full-length E1A induced a clear down-regulation of expression of PARP both at the protein and the mRNA level and that this effect is due to transcriptional repression of the PARP promoter. Moreover, mutant analysis clearly indicated that this E1A activity is dependent on its association with pRb-related proteins. A well described mechanism of in vivostimulation of transcription by pRb is that mediated by binding to the transcriptional activator Sp1 (33Kim S.J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R.

This G2delay is associated with reduced cyclin B1-specific associated histone H1 kinase activity, increased inhibitory phosphorylation of p34Cdc2, and depressed cyclin B1 levels in HeLa cells. Induction of cyclin B1 or expression of Cdc2AF, a mutant p34Cdc2 that lacks the sites of inhibitory phosphorylation, only partially reverses the radiation-associated G2 delay, although both maneuvers rapidly result in increased histone H1 kinase activity. To account for the persistent G2 delay in the face of active p34Cdc2 kinase, we determined the location of the kinase activity. Although p34Cdc2 was active in the cytoplasm, the nuclear p34Cdc2 was inactive. Irradiation led to nuclear accumulation of the inactive tyrosine-phosphorylated form of p34Cdc2, whereas the active form was seen in the cytoplasm. At later times when cells had resumed cell cycle progression, nuclear kinase activity was detectable. These results give evidence of segregation of cytoplasmic and nuclear kinase activity after DNA damage that has the effect of enhancing checkpoint control.

The most widely studied of these checkpoints are those that are seen in the G1 and G2 phases of the cycle (4Maity A. McKenna W.G. Muschel R.J. Radiother.

The G1 delay induced by ionizing radiation is entirely dependent upon p53, which directs the transcription of p21waf1/cip1/sdi1 (6El-Deiry W. Tokino T. Velculescu V. Levy D. Parson R. Trent J. Lin D.

The G2 block, however, appears to result from multiple mechanisms. Induction of p53 can lead to a G2 arrest (9Stewart N. Hicks G.G. Paraskevas F. Mowat M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 109-115PubMed Google Scholar,25Bache M. Dunst J. Wurl P. Frode D. Meye A. Schmidt H. Rath F.W. Taubert H. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 1827-1832PubMed Google Scholar); however, many malignant cells lack p53 function, as demonstrated by the absence of a G1 arrest after radiation exposure, yet these cells almost universally retain a G2 block. For example HeLa cells, which lack functional wild type p53, show no induction of p21 protein after exposure to ionizing radiation and no G1 checkpoint but have a dose-dependent G2 delay (11Munger K. Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Surv. 1992; 12: 197-217PubMed Google Scholar, 12Terasima T. Tolmach L. Biophys. J. 1963; 3: 11-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Neither p21 nor p53 is required for the radiation-induced G2 delay, as cells derived from p21 or p53 knockout mice or cells in which p53 is inactivated show equivalent G2 delays after radiation (13Kastan M.B.

Other factors have been implicated as components of the G2block. Radiation results in transiently decreased p34Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase activity (17Lock R. Ross W.

The absolute levels of p34Cdc2 protein are not altered after radiation (18Lock R.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1817-1822PubMed Google Scholar, 22O'Connor P.M. Ferris D.K. Pagano M. Draetta G. Pines J. Hunter T. Longo D.L. Kohn K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8298-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, the decreased activity is regulated both through levels of cyclin B1 as well as the inhibitory phosphorylation of p34Cdc2/cyclin B complex. We have previously shown that radiation results in cyclin B1 mRNA instability and decreased cyclin B1 protein levels, which would prevent activation of p34Cdc2 (4Maity A. McKenna W.G. Muschel R.J. Radiother. Oncol. 1994; 31: 1-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 32Muschel R.J. Zhang H.B. Iliakis G. McKenna W.G.

We also found that restoration of cyclin B1 expression after radiation can only partially abrogate the G2 delay (26Kao G. McKenna W. Maity A. Blank K. Muschel R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 753-758PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that there is a contribution of decreased cyclin B1 to the G2 delay, but that other factors must also be at play. The contribution of the inhibitory phosphorylations of p34Cdc2 to the G2 arrest has also been evaluated. Jin et al. (38Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) induced expression of Cdc2AF, a mutant form of Cdc2 that cannot undergo inhibitory phosphorylation. This resulted in only partial abrogation of the G2 delay, despite markedly increased p34Cdc2 activity. The phosphorylation of p34Cdc2 is regulated in part by the phosphatase Cdc25C, whose activity in turn is regulated by phosphorylation. Radiation induces chk1 activity in yeast, which in turn inhibits Cdc25C (63Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). A number of mammalian chk1 homologs have been identified that interact with Cdc25C (43Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3745-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 61Flaggs G. Plug A.W. Dunks K.M. Mundt K.E. Ford J.C. Quiggle M.R. Taylor E.M. Westphal C.H. Ashley T. Hoekstra M.F. Carr A.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 977-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, neither the ability to phosphorylate p34Cdc2 nor the regulation of the levels of cyclin B1 individually appears to control the G2 delay. Nuclear localization of the cyclin B1/p34Cdc2 complex has also been implicated both as a component of normal mitosis and as a component of the G2 delay (27Jin P. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 29Li J. Meyer A. Donoghue D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The nuclear localization of cyclin B1 in itself does not appear to be the sole determinant of progression into mitosis. The cell cycle delay is not abolished when cyclin B1 is introduced into the nucleus via microinjection, expression of nuclear localization signal-tagged cyclin B1 protein, or treatment with leptomycin B (which disrupts cyclin B1-CRM1 interaction) (30Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The delay was, however, abolished by leptomycin B plus caffeine. We have shown that caffeine abolishes the radiation-induced suppression of cyclin B expression (31Bernhard E.J. Maity A. Muschel R.J. McKenna W.G. Radiat. Res. 1994; 140: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but caffeine also has promiscuous effects on protein phosphorylation, which may also contribute to its cell cycle effects. It has been recently reported that expression of nuclear localization signal-tagged cyclin B1 and Cdc2AF together led to nuclear envelope dissolution, accelerating the normal cycle and the G2 delay. In this case, however, normal cycling did not result but, instead, a mitotic catastrophe, leaving the question of whether this procedure resembled normal physiological processes. We report here our efforts in investigating mechanisms underlying the G2 delay after radiation. We find that despite cyclin B1 induction and the presence of significant levels of cyclin B1-associated kinase activity, cells remain partially blocked in G2. We find that when cells are blocked in G2after radiation, the cyclin B1-associated kinase activity is localized in the cytoplasm for a substantial period of time. Nuclear kinase activity is evident only when cells exit the G2 delay. We find that expression of both cyclin B1 and Cdc2AF together increases cytoplasmic kinase activity but is still insufficient to circumvent the cellular compartmentalization of kinase activity and completely remove the G2 delay. These results help explain why induced expression of cyclin B1 or Cdc2AF protein were not successful in completely abrogating the G2 delay after irradiation. These observations together highlight the presence of multiple distinct but interrelated mechanisms of regulation of cell cycle progression after exposure to DNA-damaging agents. Experiments described here were performed with S21 cells (described in Ref. 26Kao G. McKenna W. Maity A. Blank K. Muschel R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 753-758PubMed Google Scholar), which are a HeLa clone stably transfected with a dexamethasone-inducible expression vector encoding cyclin B1. Cells were grown and synchronized with sequential thymidine and aphidicolin blocks and irradiated as described previously (27Jin P. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Radiation was delivered using a high dose rate cesium irradiator (12.84 Gy/min,1confirmed by Fricke dosimetry). Control cells were always mock-irradiated. Dexamethasone when added was at 1 μg/ml and 1 h after irradiation. For experiments involving transfections, 10 μg of plasmid (pECE-Cdc2 (cDNA coding for coding for wild type Cdc2 protein) or pECE-Cdc2AF (p34Cdc2 with mutations replacing the threonine 14 and tyrosine 15 with alanine and phenylalanine, respectively), both kindly provided by Dr. F. McKeon) was used for transfection of 1 × 106 cells with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. LipofectAMINE with the transfected plasmid was applied in serum-free medium. After 4–6 h, aphidicolin (2 μg/ml) was added in serum-containing medium for 12 h. The aphidicolin was washed out, and cells were then irradiated 3 h after the removal of aphidicolin. One h after irradiation, dexamethasone was added (1 μg/ml). In the experiments using caffeine (2 mm), it was added at the time of removal of the aphidicolin 3 h before irradiation. For immunoblotting, 100,000 cells were harvested in 400 μl of sample buffer (10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmTris, pH 6.8). 30 μl of each lysate was loaded per lane and separated by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel before overnight transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The cyclin B1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), α-tubulin (Sigma), or phosphotyrosine p34Cdc2 antibodies (New England Biolabs) were used at 1:1000. Polyclonal anti-ataxia-telangiectasia protein (ATM) antibodies was kindly provided by Dr. T. Yen. Incubation with the secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, 1:2000 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), was performed in a solution of 2.5% powdered milk in phosphate-buffered saline. Detection was performed by chemoilluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometry was analyzed by NIH image software. Cell cycle progression into mitosis was analyzed via nocodazole trapping of synchronized cells as described in (26Kao G. McKenna W. Maity A. Blank K. Muschel R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 753-758PubMed Google Scholar, 22O'Connor P.M. Ferris D.K. Pagano M. Draetta G. Pines J. Hunter T. Longo D.L. Kohn K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8298-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for each time point, nocodazole (0.04 μg/ml) was added to duplicate plates 2–3 h after release from the aphidicolin block. Thus the number of mitotic cells represent the cumulative total of all cells that have entered into mitosis at that time. At least 100 cells were evaluated for mitosis after staining with propidium iodide using the Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Cell fractionation was performed via a modification of methods as described by Schreiber et al.(33Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 million cells grown on 10-cm tissue culture dishes (Fisher) were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH7.9, 10 mm KCL, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA) incubated at 4 °C for 10 min, and Nonidet P-40 added to a final concentration of 0.5%. Samples were vortexed ×10 s and centrifuged at 800 rpm × 5 min to collect the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellet was resuspended and incubated in 200 μl of nuclear extract buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol) for 30 min before centrifugation at 2000 rpm × 10 min to collect the nuclear fraction. Immunoprecipitation of cyclin B1-specific histone H1 kinase (p34Cdc2) activity was performed using anti-cyclin B1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) as described by Pines and Hunter (34Pines J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 35Sherwood S. Rush D. Kung A. Schimke R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated samples were preincubated with HB buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotonin) at 37 °C for 5 min. 10 μl of KIN buffer (1 mg/ml histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 200 μmγ-labeled [32P]ATP in HB buffer) was then added and incubated for a further 20 min. Finally, 2× lysis buffer was added, and samples were boiled for 5 min and separated by 12% SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. Densitometry was performed with NIH Image software. To ask whether the depression of cyclin B1 seen after irradiation in HeLa cells contributes to the G2delay, we had previously developed a HeLa cell clone (S21) carrying a dexamethasone-inducible vector for cyclin B1 (26Kao G. McKenna W. Maity A. Blank K. Muschel R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 753-758PubMed Google Scholar). Dexamethasone itself affected neither cyclin B1 levels nor the cell cycle delay in the absence of the expression vector. Treatment of stable clones carrying the inducible vector with dexamethasone leads to elevated levels of cyclin B1 as soon as 2 h after addition. Induction of cyclin B1 in unirradiated cells had no discernable effect on the timing of G2, whereas restoration of cyclin B1 levels in irradiated cells shortened but did not eliminate the G2 delay. To investigate the effect of induction of cyclin B1 on p34Cdc2 kinase activity, we synchronized the S21 cells with sequential thymidine and aphidicolin blocks (see “Materials and Methods”), and 2 h after release from the aphidicolin block, irradiated with 3 Gy. One h after irradiation, dexamethasone was added to induce cyclin B1. Irradiation markedly diminished cyclin B1-immunoprecipitable p34Cdc2 histone H1 kinase activity (Fig. 1 A, compare irradiatedversus unirradiated samples, 11 (lane 4 versus lane 12) and 13 (lane 6 versus lane 13) h after release from the aphidicolin block). The addition of dexamethasone increased cyclin B1 levels (Fig. 1 A) and restored cyclin B1-p34Cdc2 kinase activity (lane 3). Despite the restoration of cyclin B1-p34Cdc2kinase activity, however, cell cycle progression was only partially accelerated. At the 15-h time point, most of the unirradiated control cells (79%) had entered mitosis, compared with only 2% of the irradiated cells and 19% of the irradiated cells with induced cyclin B1. These cumulative mitotic counts (Fig. 1 B) indicated that the cell cycle delay after irradiation was diminished but not abolished by the induced expression of cyclin B1, despite overall levels of cyclin B1-p34Cdc2 kinase activity that approximated levels in unirradiated control cells. To understand why cyclin B1-p34Cdc2 kinase activity might be ineffective in abolishing the G2 block, we measured the kinase activity after separation into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 2). S21 cells were synchronized and harvested either at the G1/S interface, in G2, unirradiated in G2, or blocked in metaphase with nocodazole. Verification of the separation between the nuclear and the cytoplasmic fractions was achieved by immunoblotting parallel samples with anti-α-tubulin (a cytoplasmic protein) or anti-ataxia-telangiectasia protein (a nuclear protein) (36Moore M.S. Blobel G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 211-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments will be mixed in mitosis due to the dissolution of the nuclear envelope, and mitotic cells arrested by nocodazole had both markers in each fraction. There was little contamination of the nuclear fraction with cytoplasm, although trace nuclear material was found in the cytoplasm under the conditions used. After irradiation, p34Cdc2 kinase activity was detectable only in the cytoplasm of the irradiated cells, not in the nucleus, and was diminished in amount compared with that of the unirradiated cells. In unirradiated G2 cells, p34Cdc2 kinase activity was detectable in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas activity was not detected in either compartment in G1/S cells. We evaluated the effect of cyclin B1 induction on kinase activity in irradiated cells (Fig. 3). At each time point after irradiation, parallel samples were harvested for analysis of kinase activity after fractionation into cytoplasmic and nuclear components and analysis of cell cycle progression. Cyclin B1-p34Cdc2 kinase activity was reduced in irradiated cells compared with the unirradiated cells. Kinase activity in the nucleus was not seen in the irradiated cells (Fig. 3 A, comparelanes 5 and 7). At 15 h, cytoplasmic cyclin B1-p34Cdc2 kinase activity in the irradiated cells was equivalent to that in unirradiated cells, but nuclear kinase activity was still depressed. Induction of cyclin B1 resulted in levels of cytoplasmic p34Cdc2 kinase activity that exceeded the levels in unirradiated control cells, yet the nuclear p34Cdc2 kinase activity was still depressed (compare activity in lanes 3 and 5). Fig. 3 Bshows in graphical form the densitometry values of the p34Cdc2 kinase assays shown in Fig. 3 A, showing the dissociation of cytoplasmic from nuclear kinase activity after irradiation and showing that nuclear, not cytoplasmic, kinase activity correlated with progression into mitosis. Cdc2AF is a mutant p34Cdc2 protein that lacks the inhibitory phosphorylation sites at positions 14 and 15 (37Heald R. McLoughlin M. McKeon F. Cell. 1993; 74: 463-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 38Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 39Krek W. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3331-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We irradiated synchronized cells that had been transfected with an expression vector for Cdc2AF. As before, radiation resulted in markedly decreased cytoplasmic cyclin B1-p34Cdc2 activity (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and2) and no detectable nuclear cyclin B1-p34Cdc2activity in the control cells. The induced expression of either cyclin B1 or Cdc2AF led to increased cytoplasmic kinase activity but did not effect an increase in nuclear activity (lanes 3 and5). The induced expression of cyclin B1 and Cdc2AF together led to a greater increase of cyclin B1-p34Cdc2 activity than either alone, but still there was no increase in nuclear activity (lane 4). Transfection of a vector coding for wild type p34Cdc2 protein did not increase the cytoplasmic or the nuclear cyclin B1-p34Cdc2 activity. Dexamethasone alone had a negligible effect on nuclear cyclin B1-p34Cdc2 activity, consistent with its lack of effect on cell cycle progression (Ref. 26Kao G. McKenna W. Maity A. Blank K. Muschel R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 753-758PubMed Google Scholarand data not shown). We determined the phosphorylation status of p34Cdc2 in the nucleus and cytoplasm using an antibody specific for the phosphotyrosine 15 form of p34Cdc2, which has minimal cross-reactivity with unphosphorylated p34Cdc2. Using this antibody, it has previously been reported that exposure of yeast to DNA-damaging agents results in accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated p34Cdc2 (45Rhind N. Furnari B. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Synchronized HeLa cells were irradiated with 5 Gy, fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear components, and assessed for tyrosine 15 p34Cdc2protein at 7 h, when the control unirradiated cells would be in G2 (7 h) and when virtually all irradiated cells would have accumulated in the G2 block, whereas unirradiated cells would have completed mitosis (24 h) (Fig.5). Irradiation led to marked nuclear accumulation of tyrosine 15-phosphorylated p34Cdc2 protein (Fig. 5 A). At 24 h, unirradiated control cells have already passed through mitosis and show slight accumulation of tyrosine 15-phosphorylated p34Cdc2. In contrast, irradiated cells show marked nuclear accumulation of tyrosine 15 phosphorylated p34Cdc2. Caffeine abrogates the G2 delay resulting from irradiation (31Bernhard E.J. Maity A. Muschel R.J. McKenna W.G. Radiat. Res. 1994; 140: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and leads to increased nuclear p34Cdc2 activity (Fig.4 B, lanes 5 and 6). We examined the location of tyrosine 15-phosphorylated p34Cdc2 after caffeine treatment. Synchronized HeLa cells were treated with radiation or etoposide with or without caffeine and harvested 16 h after release from the G1/S block. Harvested samples were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear components and probed for phosphotyrosine 15 p34Cdc2 protein (Fig. 5 B). Nocodazole-treated cells, serving as controls, as expected showed no tyrosine 15-phosphorylated p34Cdc2 protein. In contrast, both radiation or etoposide treatment led to marked nuclear accumulation and minimal cytoplasmic accumulation of tyrosine 15-phosphorylated p34Cdc2. Caffeine substantially reduced tyrosine 15-phosphorylated p34Cdc2 protein accumulation after radiation and etoposide treatment. The blot was then stripped and reprobed for total (both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) p34Cdc2 protein. This showed that total p34Cdc2protein was comparable in amounts in the cytoplasm and nucleus under all treatment conditions, suggesting that there was no marked redistribution of protein. Progression into mitosis was measured for cells under the treatment conditions described in Fig. 5 B, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 C. In each case, inhibition of progression into mitosis was associated with high levels of nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated p34Cdc2. The dose dependence of nuclear accumulation of tyrosine 15-phosphorylated p34Cdc2 protein after irradiation was determined. Synchronized cells were mocked-irradiated or irradiated with 2, 5, or 10 Gy (Fig. 6). All cells were harvested at 15 h after release from the G1/S block. Cells treated with 10 Gy showed the greatest accumulation, whereas cells treated with 2 Gy showed less but still an appreciable accumulation of phosphotyrosine 15 p34Cdc2 protein. In summary, treatment of HeLa cells by radiation leads to nuclear accumulation of tyrosine 15-phosphorylated p34Cdc2concomitant with G2 delay, and caffeine abrogates both the cell cycle delay as well as the accumulation of tyrosine 15-phosphorylated p34Cdc2. In this report, we showed that the induced expression of either cyclin B1 or Cdc2AF increased p34Cdc2 kinase activity after irradiation, but that the restoration of activity failed to result in cell cycle progression. The barrier appears to lie in localization of the activity within the cell. The increased p34Cdc2activity was initially confined to the cytoplasm. These results indicated that exclusion of p34Cdc2 kinase activity from the nucleus may contribute to the cell cycle delay after radiation in addition to contributing to the availability of cyclin B1 and phosphorylation of p34Cdc2. These results are in accord with and give further insight into a number of previous observations. In the report of Jin et al. (27Jin P. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), expression of Cdc2AF in HeLa cells only partially reversed the G2 delay after irradiation, despite the rapid induction of substantial p34Cdc2 kinase activity to amounts greater than those in unirradiated cells. In this report, we confirm that p34Cdc2 kinase activity is increased by Cdc2AF expression, but we found that the increased activity was not in the nucleus. The delay in the appearance of p34Cdc2 activity in the nucleus or repression of nuclear p34Cdc2 kinase activity may account for the residual G2 delay. These results are quite similar to results obtained by restoring cyclin B1 protein in irradiated HeLa cells. Increased cyclin B1 resulted in increased total p34Cdc2 activity, yet the p34Cdc2 activity was also initially restricted to the cytoplasm, consistent with the observation that increased cyclin B1 only partially abrogated the G2 block in HeLa cells. p34Cdc2 activity is reduced by radiation, but even high levels of p34Cdc2cytoplasmic activity are not sufficient to eliminate the G2block. Sluder et al. (41Sluder G. Thompson E.A. Rieder C.L. Miller F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have found evidence of cytoplasmic and nuclear compartmentalization of p34Cdc2 kinase activity in sea urchin zygotes. Pronuclear fusion in these cells is normally marked by the synchronous dissolution of both the sperm and egg nuclei. However, pretreatment of sperm or egg nuclei with ultraviolet light or psoralen to damage the DNA prevented nuclear membrane dissolution of the treated nuclei despite high levels of cytoplasmic p34Cdc2 kinase activity. Similarly, treatment of HeLa cells with a dose of etoposide, which leads to profound cell cycle block, led to cytoplasmic accumulation of levels of p34Cdc2 histone H1 kinase activity comparable with control untreated cells (42Barr"

Recently, however, a constitutively active form of catalytic subunit of mouse PKA, when introduced into fly embryos, was shown to elicit an up-regulation of ptcexpression that appears to be independent of HH (26Ohlmeyer J.T. Kalderon D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2250-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This experiment, however, does not necessarily reflect the situation in vivo, leaving some doubt about whether PKA-mediated, HH-independent ptc induction exists under normal physiological conditions.The pineal gland (epiphysis) is an unpaired midline neuroendocrine structure originating as an invagination of the diencephalon. The pineal transduces environmental light and dark information into nightly formation of the hormone melatonin, which links the body's physiological processes to the daily cycle of sunlight and darkness. This circadian production of melatonin is dependent on the suprachiasmatic nucleus clock, information from which is relayed to the pineal by the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) in the form of rhythmic norepinephrine release at night. Light potently inhibits hormone production at night (27Borjigin J. Li X. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Subtractive hybridization cloning, seeking genes that are selectively up-regulated during the day or night, led to the identification of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) (28Borjigin J. Wang M.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1995; 378: 783-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), the rate-limiting enzyme in melatonin synthesis, and a pineal night-specific ATPase (PINA) (29Borjigin J.

Here we report the circadian expression of ptc1in the pineal and its cAMP-dependent transcriptional activation that appears to be independent of the hedgehog signaling.DISCUSSIONMechanisms of HH/PTC signal transduction have been the subject of intense investigation. In this study, we demonstrate that theptc1 transcript displays a pronounced circadian rhythm in the pineal. In the pineal, cAMP activates ptc1transcription, contrasting dramatically with ptc1 regulation in other systems. Hh signaling does not seem to be required in pinealptc1 induction, again contrasting with other ptcsystems. These observations point to a novel pathway forptc1 signal transduction that is driven by cAMP.Is cAMP the only signaling system driving pineal ptc1expression? Our results demonstrate that cAMP is required to induceptc1 expression. Although it is possible that the HH system may be involved in pineal regulation, several factors support a predominant role of cAMP. First, we have repeatedly failed to detect any mRNA or protein expression for any of the HH family members in pineal. Second, there is no evidence of HH activity in SCG, the only known neuronal input to the pineal. Third, because the pineals in vitro in the organ culture experiments were analyzed more than 48 h after excision, nerve terminals had completely degenerated. The denervated pineals are able to mount an impressive increase inptc1 expression by cAMP alone, without other factors (such as HH) that may be carried by SCG neurons in vivo. Fourth,in vivo ablation experiments indicate that expression ofptc1 is dependent on SCG input but can be fully recovered using agents that specifically stimulate cAMP production.The cAMP-dependent and HH-independent regulation ofptc1 in the pineal suggests PTC1 may play a role in the neuroendocrine and perhaps other systems in an activity-dependent manner. Unlike the relatively slow time course of ontogenic and oncogenic processes in which ptc1has been previously studied, the pineal regulation of ptcoccurs rapidly, with 10–20-fold changes of expression in a few hours. This swift change suggests a novel type of short term regulatory function for PTC1 in the pineal and other HH-independent PTC systems. Our developmental studies indicate that ptc1 cycling is not necessary for the rhythmic transcription of NAT early in life. Perhaps PTC1 in the pineal functions in the post-transcriptional regulation of diurnal processes (i.e. mRNA stability or post-translational modifications). Besides some diurnally determined role, PTC1 might play a part in the ontogenesis of pineal systems, including the development of circadian rhythms and a role in the oncogenesis of various pineal region tumors, consistent with the known functions of PTC1 during development and in tumor formation.

Recently, however, a constitutively active form of catalytic subunit of mouse PKA, when introduced into fly embryos, was shown to elicit an up-regulation of ptcexpression that appears to be independent of HH (26Ohlmeyer J.T. Kalderon D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2250-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This experiment, however, does not necessarily reflect the situation in vivo, leaving some doubt about whether PKA-mediated, HH-independent ptc induction exists under normal physiological conditions. The pineal gland (epiphysis) is an unpaired midline neuroendocrine structure originating as an invagination of the diencephalon. The pineal transduces environmental light and dark information into nightly formation of the hormone melatonin, which links the body's physiological processes to the daily cycle of sunlight and darkness. This circadian production of melatonin is dependent on the suprachiasmatic nucleus clock, information from which is relayed to the pineal by the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) in the form of rhythmic norepinephrine release at night. Light potently inhibits hormone production at night (27Borjigin J. Li X. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Subtractive hybridization cloning, seeking genes that are selectively up-regulated during the day or night, led to the identification of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) (28Borjigin J. Wang M.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1995; 378: 783-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), the rate-limiting enzyme in melatonin synthesis, and a pineal night-specific ATPase (PINA) (29Borjigin J.

Here we report the circadian expression of ptc1in the pineal and its cAMP-dependent transcriptional activation that appears to be independent of the hedgehog signaling. DISCUSSIONMechanisms of HH/PTC signal transduction have been the subject of intense investigation. In this study, we demonstrate that theptc1 transcript displays a pronounced circadian rhythm in the pineal. In the pineal, cAMP activates ptc1transcription, contrasting dramatically with ptc1 regulation in other systems. Hh signaling does not seem to be required in pinealptc1 induction, again contrasting with other ptcsystems. These observations point to a novel pathway forptc1 signal transduction that is driven by cAMP.Is cAMP the only signaling system driving pineal ptc1expression? Our results demonstrate that cAMP is required to induceptc1 expression. Although it is possible that the HH system may be involved in pineal regulation, several factors support a predominant role of cAMP. First, we have repeatedly failed to detect any mRNA or protein expression for any of the HH family members in pineal. Second, there is no evidence of HH activity in SCG, the only known neuronal input to the pineal. Third, because the pineals in vitro in the organ culture experiments were analyzed more than 48 h after excision, nerve terminals had completely degenerated. The denervated pineals are able to mount an impressive increase inptc1 expression by cAMP alone, without other factors (such as HH) that may be carried by SCG neurons in vivo. Fourth,in vivo ablation experiments indicate that expression ofptc1 is dependent on SCG input but can be fully recovered using agents that specifically stimulate cAMP production.The cAMP-dependent and HH-independent regulation ofptc1 in the pineal suggests PTC1 may play a role in the neuroendocrine and perhaps other systems in an activity-dependent manner. Unlike the relatively slow time course of ontogenic and oncogenic processes in which ptc1has been previously studied, the pineal regulation of ptcoccurs rapidly, with 10–20-fold changes of expression in a few hours. This swift change suggests a novel type of short term regulatory function for PTC1 in the pineal and other HH-independent PTC systems. Our developmental studies indicate that ptc1 cycling is not necessary for the rhythmic transcription of NAT early in life. Perhaps PTC1 in the pineal functions in the post-transcriptional regulation of diurnal processes (i.e. mRNA stability or post-translational modifications). Besides some diurnally determined role, PTC1 might play a part in the ontogenesis of pineal systems, including the development of circadian rhythms and a role in the oncogenesis of various pineal region tumors, consistent with the known functions of PTC1 during development and in tumor formation.

https://openalex.org/W2027958278,"The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family plays a key role in a multitude of physiological and pathological processes. The activities of FGFs are mediated by a family of tyrosine kinase receptors, designated FGFRs. The mechanism by which FGFs induce receptor activation is controversial. Despite their structural similarity, FGFs display distinct receptor binding characteristics and cell type specificity. Previous studies with FGF-2 identified a low affinity receptor binding site that is located within a loop connecting its 9th and 10th β-strands. The corresponding residues in the other family members are highly variable, and it was proposed that the variability might confer on FGFs unique receptor binding characteristics. We studied the role of this loop in FGF-7 by both site-directed mutagenesis and loop replacement. Unlike the other members of the FGF family, FGF-7 recognizes only one FGFR isoform and is, therefore, ideal for studies of how the specificity in the FGF-FGFR interaction is conferred at the structural level. Point mutations in the loop of FGF-7 did not change receptor binding affinity but resulted in reduced mitogenic potency and reduced ability to induce receptor-mediated phosphorylation events. These results suggest that the loop of FGF-7 fulfills the role of low affinity binding site required for receptor activation. The observation that it is possible to uncouple FGF-7 receptor binding and biological activity favors a bivalent model for FGFR dimerization, and it may be clinically relevant to the design of FGF-7 antagonists. Reciprocal loop replacement between FGF-7 and FGF-2 had no effect on their known receptor binding affinities nor did it alter their known specificity in eliciting a mitogenic response. In conclusion, these results suggest that, despite the diversity in the loop structure of FGF-2 and FGF-7, the loop has a similar function in both growth factors.

EXS. 1995; 74: 191-214PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-7 is secreted by cells of mesenchymal origin and acts predominantly on cells of epithelial origin (2Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Chedid M. Miki T. Ron D. Cunha G.R. Finch P.W. EXS. 1995; 74: 191-214PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-7 is thought to regulate a number of biological processes in embryonal development and in adults including cell growth, differentiation, cell migration, and repair of epithelial tissues (2Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Chedid M. Miki T. Ron D. Cunha G.R. Finch P.W. EXS. 1995; 74: 191-214PubMed Google Scholar,3Werner S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It is also implicated in a number of pathological conditions such as prostate and breast cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (4Brauchle M. Madlener M. Wagner A.D. Angermeyer K. Lauer U.

The involvement of FGF-7 in a variety of physiological processes and in diseases provides a strong impetus for uncovering the structural basis of its activities. Furthermore, the knowledge of the structural and functional relationship in FGF-7 is key to rational design of analogues for potential therapeutic applications.FGFs interact predominantly with two types of receptors: a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs) that mediate the biological activities of FGFs, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans that act as modulatory co-receptors for FGFs (6McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 7Vlodavsky I. Miao H.Q. Medalion B. Danagher P. Ron D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Four closely related FGFRs (FGFR1–FGFR4) have been isolated, and an additional level of complexity was created via an alternative splicing mechanism that generates FGFR isoforms with altered ligand binding properties (6McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Members of the FGF family bind FGFRs with varying affinities. For example, FGF-1 binds with high affinity to the four known receptors and all the isoforms that have been studied, whereas FGF-2 binds FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 with high affinity (8Dionne C.A.

FGF-7 interacts only with a splice variant of FGFR2 known as the KGFR or FGFR2IIIb form, whereas FGF-2 binds this receptor with about 10–20-fold lower affinity (13Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar,14Reich-Slotky R. Shaoul E. Berman B. Graziani G. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29813-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Structure-based site-directed mutagenesis in FGF-2 identified two putative receptor-binding sites as follows: a primary site that contributes most of the high affinity interaction of FGF-2 to FGFR1, and a secondary site that exhibits low receptor binding affinity but is required for receptor activation (15Springer B.A. Pantoliano M.W. Barbera F.A. Gunyuzlu P.L. Thompson L.D. Herblin W.F. Rosenfeld S.A. Book G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26879-26884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary site is located in a surface-exposed loop connecting the 9th and 10th β-strands of FGF-2 (16Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham S. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1991; 251: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The primary site is highly conserved among FGFs suggesting that the dominant interaction of FGFs with FGFRs is likely to be similar if not identical. On the other hand, the secondary site is highly variable among FGFs both with respect to primary sequence and length of the loop. Because FGFs interact differently with their receptors, it was suggested that the secondary binding site may confer on FGFs unique receptor binding characteristics, tissue specificity, and unique biological activities (15Springer B.A. Pantoliano M.W. Barbera F.A. Gunyuzlu P.L. Thompson L.D. Herblin W.F. Rosenfeld S.A. Book G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26879-26884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Seddon A.P. Aviezer D. Li L.Y.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported that exchanging the loop of FGF-2 with that of FGF-1 confers on FGF-2 the ability to bind the KGFR with high affinity. In view of the reported effect of mutations in the loop of FGF-2, the finding of Seddon et al. (17Seddon A.P. Aviezer D. Li L.Y. Bohlen P. Yayon A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) implies that the binding affinity contributed by the secondary site may be weak or strong depending on the FGF type. However, this question was not studied in other members of the FGF family.FGF-7 is ideal for studies of how the specificity of the FGF-FGFR interaction is conferred at the structural level because it recognizes only one isoform of FGFRs and because of its unique target cell specificity (2Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Chedid M. Miki T. Ron D. Cunha G.R. Finch P.W. EXS. 1995; 74: 191-214PubMed Google Scholar, 6McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Since FGF-7 binds the KGFR with a similar affinity as FGF-1, we investigated whether the loop of FGF-7 also participates in high affinity interaction and whether it contributes to the unique receptor binding characteristics of FGF-7. To address this question we utilized two mutational approaches. First, we reciprocally replaced the loop between FGF-2 and FGF-7, and we examined how the unique receptor binding characteristics of each growth factor are segregated in the chimeras. As mentioned earlier in this section, FGF-2 binds weakly to the KGFR, and it binds strongly to several other members of the FGFR family. Second, we generated point mutations in the loop of FGF-7 and examined the effect of the mutations on receptor binding affinity and biological activity. Mutations in the loop of FGF-7 separated high affinity receptor binding from biological activity, suggesting that the loop of FGF-7 does not contribute to strong receptor binding interactions but rather functions as low affinity site required for receptor activation and subsequent signaling. Loop replacement revealed that the loops of both FGF-7 and FGF-2 have similar function.DISCUSSIONFGFs are known to interact differently with their signaling receptors (6McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). FGF-7 is an unusual FGF member in that it recognizes only one FGFR isoform and acts predominantly on cells of epithelial origin (2Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Chedid M. Miki T. Ron D. Cunha G.R. Finch P.W. EXS. 1995; 74: 191-214PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in FGF-2 identified a secondary receptor binding site that is located in the crystal structure within a loop connecting its 9th and 10th β-strands (15Springer B.A. Pantoliano M.W. Barbera F.A. Gunyuzlu P.L. Thompson L.D. Herblin W.F. Rosenfeld S.A. Book G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26879-26884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham S. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1991; 251: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The corresponding region in the other family members is highly variable, and it is, therefore, thought to contribute to the specificity of ligand-receptor interaction. It was recently proposed that this region predominantly confers receptor binding specificity to FGF-7 (18Osslund T.D. Syed R. Singer E. Hsu W.-J. E. Nybo R. Chen B.L. Harvey T. Arakawa T. Owers Narhi L. Chirino A. Morris C.F. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, we exchanged the loop between FGF-2 and FGF-7, and we tested how their unique receptor binding characteristics and known cell type specificities in eliciting a mitogenic response were segregated in the mutants. The residues comprising the loop in FGF-7 were defined from a computerized model of its 3-dimensional structure. Recent publication of the crystal structure of FGF-7 confirmed our prediction (18Osslund T.D. Syed R. Singer E. Hsu W.-J. E. Nybo R. Chen B.L. Harvey T. Arakawa T. Owers Narhi L. Chirino A. Morris C.F. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We showed here that reciprocal loop replacement did not alter the known receptor binding specificities of FGF-2 and FGF-7 nor did it alter their known specificity in eliciting a mitogenic response. However, although the extent of mitogenic activity of the FGF2/L7 in fibroblasts and keratinocytes was indistinguishable from that of FGF-2, the reciprocal mutant, FGF7/L2, was less mitogenic in keratinocytes that highly respond to FGF-7. The lower biological activity of this mutant seems to result from thermolability rather than reduced capacity to activate the KGFR, as this mutant induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates as efficiently as FGF-7. Taken together, these findings suggest that the loop does not confer FGF-7 with its unique receptor binding characteristics.Point mutations in residues within the loop of FGF-7 had no effect on receptor binding affinity or thermal stability. Three of the five mutants that were generated displayed reduced mitogenic potency. Two mutations (K155E and H158A) had a modest effect, whereas the mutation in Trp156 (W156A) had a dramatic effect (2–3- and 70-fold reduction, respectively). The W156A mutant also displayed significantly reduced capacity to induce tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that the loop functions as a secondary receptor-binding site involved in receptor activation and subsequent signaling but not in high affinity interactions. These findings are consistent with the reported effect of mutations in the loop of FGF-2 (15Springer B.A. Pantoliano M.W. Barbera F.A. Gunyuzlu P.L. Thompson L.D. Herblin W.F. Rosenfeld S.A. Book G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26879-26884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further suggest that despite the variability in the loop structure of FGF-7 and FGF-2, it has a similar function in both growth factors. By mutating 9 of the 10 residues in the loop of FGF-7, Osslund et al. (18Osslund T.D. Syed R. Singer E. Hsu W.-J. E. Nybo R. Chen B.L. Harvey T. Arakawa T. Owers Narhi L. Chirino A. Morris C.F. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) also noted the importance of Trp156 and His157for mitogenic activity. These authors did not observe an effect upon substitution of Lys155 with alanine, suggesting that Lys155 does not directly participate in receptor recognition, but an acidic side chain may not be well tolerated at this position.Comparison of the results of the mutational analysis in the loop of FGF-7 and FGF-2 suggests that only a few amino acid residues in the loop contribute to biological activity: Trp156 and His158 in FGF-7 and Tyr120 and Trp123 in FGF2 (present work and Refs. 15Springer B.A. Pantoliano M.W. Barbera F.A. Gunyuzlu P.L. Thompson L.D. Herblin W.F. Rosenfeld S.A. Book G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26879-26884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 18Osslund T.D. Syed R. Singer E. Hsu W.-J. E. Nybo R. Chen B.L. Harvey T. Arakawa T. Owers Narhi L. Chirino A. Morris C.F. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). In the crystal structure, Trp156 of FGF-7 is superimposed on Tyr120 of FGF-2, and both are located in the loop region that is structurally similar in both growth factors (close to the 9th β-strand, see Fig. 1, B and C). His158 in FGF-7 is located in the loop region that differs in structure between the two growth factors, whereas Trp123in FGF-2 is superimposed on Met163 in FGF-7 and both terminate the loop. Met163 of FGF-7 may be important for maintaining the conformation of FGF-7 as its substitution with alanine affected the folding of the protein (18Osslund T.D. Syed R. Singer E. Hsu W.-J. E. Nybo R. Chen B.L. Harvey T. Arakawa T. Owers Narhi L. Chirino A. Morris C.F. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, the secondary binding site of FGF-2 and FGF-7 overlap but is not identical. However, the results of the loop exchange suggest that FGFRs can accommodate the differences.Amino acid sequence alignment of the 19 members of the FGF family indicates that an aromatic residue (tyrosine, tryptophan, or histidine) is always present at the position that corresponds to Trp156 in FGF-7. At the end of the loop, FGFs have mostly tryptophan (similar to FGF-2) or methionine (similar to FGF-7). Therefore, whereas there is variability in both length and sequence of the loop, there exists either identity or similarity in residues that, in FGF-2 and FGF-7, contribute the most for biological activity. Based on this observation we propose that the loop functions as a secondary receptor-binding site throughout the FGF family. The findings that the loop of FGF-7 can functionally substitute for the loop of FGF-2 in receptor activation suggest that the putative secondary binding site displays broad specificity for FGFRs.Our results also have implications for the mechanism of ligand-induced FGFR dimerization. Earlier studies with FGF-2 suggested that one ligand molecule binds to two molecules of FGFR1 in a mechanism similar to that described for growth hormone (15Springer B.A. Pantoliano M.W. Barbera F.A.

Springer B.A. Van Dyk D.E. Tobery T. Wetmore D.R. Lear J.D. Nahapetian A.T. Bradley J.D. Sisk W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10229-10248Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 37Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). According to this mechanism FGF is a bivalent ligand containing two asymmetric sites for receptor binding, a primary and a secondary site. Binding of one receptor molecule to the primary site on FGF leads to the recruitment of a second receptor molecule through binding to the secondary site. In this model heparin stabilizes ligand receptor complexes. Others suggested that a heparin-linked FGF dimer facilitates receptor dimerization (stoichiometry of 2FGFR:2FGF). According to this mechanism heparin is absolutely required for receptor dimerization (38Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J.

Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The current findings that it is possible to uncouple receptor binding and biological activity in FGF-7 and that all the mutants retained wild type affinity for heparin are consistent with the bivalent model and further support the notion that the loop can fulfill the role of the secondary binding site. A recent report by Hsu et al. (40Hsu Y.R. Nybo R. Sullivan J.K. Costigan V. Spahr C.S. Wong C. Jones M. Pentzer A.G. Pacifici R.E. Lu H.S. Morris C.F. Philo J.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2523-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) also suggested that FGF-7 induces receptor dimerization in a stoichiometry of 1FGF-7:2KGFR (40Hsu Y.R. Nybo R. Sullivan J.K. Costigan V. Spahr C.S. Wong C. Jones M. Pentzer A.G. Pacifici R.E. Lu H.S. Morris C.F. Philo J.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2523-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ligand bivalence and broad specificity may lead to signal diversification because it enables a given FGF to induce receptor heterodimerization through the putative secondary site. This may be possible because many cell types express several distinct FGFRs (10Werner S. Duan D.S. de Vries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 11Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C. Cohen O.E. Chan A.M. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol.

Vainikka S. Partanen J. Korhonen J. Alitalo R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2004-2007PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, the present study suggests that the loop connecting the 9th and 10th β-strands of FGFs functions as a low affinity/broad specificity determinant that is required for the activation of FGF receptors. The ability to separate heparin and primary receptor binding from mitogenic activity in FGF-7 favors a bivalence model for receptor dimerization and suggests it will be feasible to generate growth factor antagonists by mutational approaches. The keratinocyte growth factor (FGF-7) is a member of the heparin-binding fibroblast growth factor (FGF)1 family with a distinctive target cell specificity (1Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 2Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Chedid M. Miki T. Ron D. Cunha G.R. Finch P.W. EXS. 1995; 74: 191-214PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-7 is secreted by cells of mesenchymal origin and acts predominantly on cells of epithelial origin (2Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Chedid M. Miki T. Ron D. Cunha G.R. Finch P.W. EXS. 1995; 74: 191-214PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-7 is thought to regulate a number of biological processes in embryonal development and in adults including cell growth, differentiation, cell migration, and repair of epithelial tissues (2Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Chedid M. Miki T. Ron D. Cunha G.R. Finch P.W. EXS. 1995; 74: 191-214PubMed Google Scholar,3Werner S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It is also implicated in a number of pathological conditions such as prostate and breast cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (4Brauchle M. Madlener M. Wagner A.D. Angermeyer K. Lauer U. Hofschneider P.H. Gregor M. Werner S. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 521-529PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lopez-Otin C. Diamandis E.P. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 365-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The involvement of FGF-7 in a variety of physiological processes and in diseases provides a strong impetus for uncovering the structural basis of its activities. Furthermore, the knowledge of the structural and functional relationship in FGF-7 is key to rational design of analogues for potential therapeutic applications. FGFs interact predominantly with two types of receptors: a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs) that mediate the biological activities of FGFs, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans that act as modulatory co-receptors for FGFs (6McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 7Vlodavsky I. Miao H.Q. Medalion B. Danagher P. Ron D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Four closely related FGFRs (FGFR1–FGFR4) have been isolated, and an additional level of complexity was created via an alternative splicing mechanism that generates FGFR isoforms with altered ligand binding properties (6McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Members of the FGF family bind FGFRs with varying affinities. For example, FGF-1 binds with high affinity to the four known receptors and all the isoforms that have been studied, whereas FGF-2 binds FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 with high affinity (8Dionne C.A.

FGF-7 interacts only with a splice variant of FGFR2 known as the KGFR or FGFR2IIIb form, whereas FGF-2 binds this receptor with about 10–20-fold lower affinity (13Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar,14Reich-Slotky R. Shaoul E. Berman B. Graziani G. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29813-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Structure-based site-directed mutagenesis in FGF-2 identified two putative receptor-binding sites as follows: a primary site that contributes most of the high affinity interaction of FGF-2 to FGFR1, and a secondary site that exhibits low receptor binding affinity but is required for receptor activation (15Springer B.A. Pantoliano M.W. Barbera F.A. Gunyuzlu P.L. Thompson L.D. Herblin W.F. Rosenfeld S.A. Book G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26879-26884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary site is located in a surface-exposed loop connecting the 9th and 10th β-strands of FGF-2 (16Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham S. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1991; 251: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The primary site is highly conserved among FGFs suggesting that the dominant interaction of FGFs with FGFRs is likely to be similar if not identical. On the other hand, the secondary site is highly variable among FGFs both with respect to primary sequence and length of the loop. Because FGFs interact differently with their receptors, it was suggested that the secondary binding site may confer on FGFs unique receptor binding characteristics, tissue specificity, and unique biological activities (15Springer B.A. Pantoliano M.W. Barbera F.A. Gunyuzlu P.L. Thompson L.D. Herblin W.F. Rosenfeld S.A. Book G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26879-26884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Seddon A.P. Aviezer D. Li L.Y.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported that exchanging the loop of FGF-2 with that of FGF-1 confers on FGF-2 the ability to bind the KGFR with high affinity. In view of the reported effect of mutations in the loop of FGF-2, the finding of Seddon et al. (17Seddon A.P. Aviezer D. Li L.Y. Bohlen P. Yayon A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) implies that the binding affinity contributed by the secondary site may be weak or strong depending on the FGF type. However, this question was not studied in other members of the FGF family. FGF-7 is ideal for studies of how the specificity of the FGF-FGFR interaction is conferred at the structural level because it recognizes only one isoform of FGFRs and because of its unique target cell specificity (2Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Chedid M. Miki T. Ron D. Cunha G.R. Finch P.W. EXS. 1995; 74: 191-214PubMed Google Scholar, 6McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Since FGF-7 binds the KGFR with a similar affinity as FGF-1, we investigated whether the loop of FGF-7 also participates"

Using templates designed to restrict synthesis to defined positions, formation of a 3-nucleotide-long RNA was found to be sufficient to trigger expansion of the initial transcription bubble. This occurred by a discrete transition that expanded the downstream limit of melting from position 1 to 15. Subsequent clearance of the bubble from the promoter region also occurred without detectable intermediates. Thus, initial opening, extension, and the clearance of the promoter bubble appear to occur as discrete, unique transitions. The apparent K mvalues for these three steps were determined to be near 5, 9, and 50 μm, respectively. Comparison of these values with ATPase activities within known transcription factors raises the possibility that different activities could be responsible for each step.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Initially, the polymerase is recruited to the promoter in the closed complex state. In this state, the DNA remains fully double-stranded. Transcription cannot initiate because the template strand cannot be read in double stranded form. In a series of post-recruitment steps, the DNA is opened over the transcription start site, allowing initiation to begin. During the subsequent promoter clearance steps, the polymerase elongates away from the promoter along with the transcription bubble of melted DNA (2Jiang Y. Yan M. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1614-1621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each round of initiation requires that a new polymerase be recruited into closed complexes and that the DNA be reopened. Transcription initiation has long been known to require hydrolysis of the β–γ bond of ATP (3Bunick D. Zandomeni R. Ackerman S. Weinmann R. Cell. 1982; 29: 877-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrolysis was shown to be in a postrecruitment step that preceded elongation (5Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2962-2968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, permanganate probing was used to identify open complexes, and ATP was shown to be required to open the DNA within closed complexes at a variety of promoters (6Wang W. Carey M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1992; 255: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 7Jiang Y. Smale S.T. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6535-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter clearance was also shown to depend on ATP (2Jiang Y. Yan M. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1614-1621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 9Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23352-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More recently the postrecruitment pathway has been subdivided into several steps. Parallel studies in two different systems identified three consecutive postrecruitment steps (10Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 11Yan M. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7457-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the first step, the DNA upstream from the start site is opened (to form the preinitiation open complex (POC)).1 In the second step, the melted bubble is enlarged as DNA downstream from the start site is opened (to form the initiation open complex (IOC)). Formation of the IOC is triggered after initiation of RNA synthesis. When ATP is depleted, the POC decays rapidly, but the IOC does not, implying that the IOC has much higher stability. Finally, the polymerase and the bubble exit the promoter region as the complex enters elongation mode. In at least one of these systems, ATP hydrolysis is required for all of these postrecruitment steps and also for the formation of the first bond of the RNA (11Yan M. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7457-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because each of these steps has the potential to be regulated, some effort has been applied to identify the activities that catalyze them. General transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIH have been implicated in these postrecruitment steps (8Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 12Holstege F.C. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Mutations that inhibit a helicase activity of TFIIH impair the ability to reach the IOC stage (13Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence implicate the C-terminal domain kinase activity of TFIIH in the final conversion to the elongation stage (2Jiang Y. Yan M. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1614-1621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Yankulov K.Y. Pandes M. McCracken S. Bouchard D. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3291-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Akoulitchev S. Makela T.P. Weinberg R.A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1995; 377: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Gebara M.M. Sayre M.H. Corden J.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both helicase and kinase activities use ATP, which supports their involvement in transcription initiation. Several important issues surrounding these postrecruitment steps remain to be resolved. These issues center on how the promoter is opened initially to form the POC and how the POC is converted to the IOC during initial RNA synthesis. We showed previously that all postrecruitment steps require ATP hydrolysis (11Yan M. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7457-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This includes the initial opening of the DNA and the formation of the first RNA bond. There have not been studies to identify which activities use ATP in these steps. Although the TFIIH helicase is an obvious candidate activity for steps prior to the IOC stage, it has not been implicated specifically in POC formation. Moreover, helicases rarely if ever initiate opening from unmodified fully double-stranded DNA without assistance from other activities (17Matson S. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Thus, this activity is likely required to extend the initial bubble, but what causes the initial bubble to form is not known. In addition, the POC to IOC conversion appeared to occur differently in the two systems studied. In one case, the conversion occurred in a discrete step triggered by the initiation of RNA synthesis (11Yan M. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7457-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the other case the conversion was gradual and was not complete until a substantial length of RNA had been produced (10Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The more rapid and discrete stabilization process was observed in an activated unfractionated system, allowing for the possible involvement of factors absent from highly purified basal system. Thus, it is not yet clear how many activities are involved in forming and clearing the open DNA during initiation. Significant uncertainty surrounds how DNA opening is initiated and how RNA synthesis is involved in extending and stabilizing the open complex. This study focuses on how ATP is used in order to define how many activities might be involved in these processes. In addition, it explores the applicability of the discrete model for conversion to the IOC using an experimental system with tighter regulation of RNA synthesis than used previously (11Yan M. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7457-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The results lend further support for the postulated pathway for formation of the IOC and also provide constraints on the types of activities that may be involved in the use of ATP during initiation. Ultrapure NTPs, dNTPs, and 3-O-methyl-GTP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ribodinucleotide UpA and ATPγS were from Sigma. The DNA template G9E4T contains nine Gal4 binding sites upstream of a truncated adenovirus E4 promoter (18Carey M. Leatherwood J. Ptashne M. Science. 1990; 247: 710-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Permanganate probing in a HeLa extract was done as described (6Wang W. Carey M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1992; 255: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 11Yan M. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7457-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To measure theK m for the POC formation, various concentrations of dATP were added 2 min before permanganate treatment. To measure theK m for the IOC formation, 2 mm UpA and 25 μm CTP were added before the dATP and permanganate treatment. To measure the K m for the promoter clearance, various concentration of dATP were added for 2 min, followed by the addition of the elongation mixture (50 μm GTP, CTP, UTP, and 2.5 μm ATP) for 2 min and permanganate treatment. Quantitation of results used ImageQuant software for PhosphorImager results (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Background subtraction used a common region of each lane, not associated with melting. Signals were normalized to the strongest POC or IOC signal or the maximum amount of clearance in appropriate experiments. Data from several experiments were averaged and fit into the classic Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot (version 4.0, SPSS Inc.). TheK m values and S.D. values were calculated using the same software. The first experiments address the role of initial RNA synthesis in extending the POC bubble to form the stable IOC. In our prior study of the activated adenovirus E4 promoter, this transition was sudden and discrete (11Yan M. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7457-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); i.e. when formation of a 3-mer RNA was triggered by the addition of dinucleotide UpA and CTP, the downstream edge of the transcription bubble moved from near position 1 to near position 15. This result contrasted with results from a basal adenovirus major late system, where the downstream edge extended gradually as the initial bonds of the RNA were made (10Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Another difference was that only the latter study used a series of constructs that stop synthesis definitively at set points by incorporating the chain terminator 3′-O-methyl-GTP. By including G at different template locations, one can use such templates to eliminate potential nucleotide misincorporations (10Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We created a series of modified templates to test the discrete model in the situation where chains can be terminated definitively with 3′-O-methyl-GTP. The parent G9E4T template contains nine Gal4 binding sites upstream of an adenovirus E4 promoter. Transcription starts within the T6A region approximately 25 base pairs downstream from the TATA box. For convenience, we designate the last thymidine in the T6 sequence as +1. Fig. 1 A shows the series of templates constructed and used in these studies. Each variant has a G substituted in a different position, including positions 2, 3, 4, and 5. As discussed elsewhere, the use of 3′-O-methyl-GTP allows synthesis to be restricted to RNAs terminated at these positions (10Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We confirmed that each of these templates can be transcribed (data not shown). The transition through the different stages of open complex formation can be visualized using permanganate footprinting (6Wang W. Carey M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1992; 255: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Permanganate can selectively modify the thymidine residues in the single strand region of the DNA template, thus causing a stop when copied withTaq polymerase in a subsequent primer extension protocol. The region that has been melted is detected as a series of hypersensitive bands upon autoradiography of the primer extension products separated on gels. In this set of experiments, permanganate is used to detect the downstream limits of bubble formation on templates where G nucleotides are present to ensure termination at different points. The experiment of Fig. 1 B begins by showing the bubble upstream from the start site that is triggered by the addition of dATP to closed transcription complexes (lane 2 versus lane 1). Lane 3 shows the extension of the bubble to far downstream positions when ATP and CTP are added to closed complexes on the original template with initial sequence TACAC. These controls show the limits of permanganate-sensitive regions for the POC (lane 2) and the IOC (lane 3). In the next experiment, the DNA with the initial sequence TAGAC was used to restrict synthesis in conjunction with the chain terminator 3-O-methyl-GTP. Lane 5 shows the permanganate signal obtained when this template is used with the dinucleotide UpA and 3′-O-methyl-GTP (expected product of UpApG). The addition of these nucleotides has triggered the IOC pattern (compare with lane 3) rather than the POC pattern (compare with lane 2). The overall signal is somewhat weaker, perhaps indicating that the conversion is not quite complete. The downstream edge of the bubble appears to have reached its full extension, previously shown to approach position 15. Although the presumptive UpApG product in this experiment contains two RNA bonds, only a single one has formed due to the use of a dinucleotide primer. Another experiment indicates that the existence of an RNA product of 3 nucleotides in length may be more important than the synthesis of a single bond. When ATP and 3′-O-methyl-GTP are used with this same template (lane 4) there is, at best, only weak extension of the bubble to form the IOC. Under these circumstances the expected product is only a 2-mer, pppApG. The comparison indicates that formation of a 3-nucleotide-long RNA is sufficient for formation of an IOC with the bubble extended fully to near position 15. This discrete transition is also observed in protocols allowing extension to positions 4 and 5 without dinucleotide primers (lanes 6 and 7). These used ATP, CTP, and 3′-O-methyl-GTP on templates TACAG (potential product pppApCpApG) and TACACG (potential product pppApCpApCpG). The patterns in lanes 6 and 7 are slightly more hypersensitive in the downstream region (compare with lane 5), indicating a slightly higher efficiency of IOC formation. The downstream limit of the extended bubble appears to be the same in all three circumstances. It should be emphasized that these experiments use a high concentration of 3′-O-methyl-GTP, so the possibility of producing longer transcripts due to misincorporation is very low. Direct observation of RNA did not show such products (Ref. 19Jiang Y. Yan M. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27332-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and data not shown), but they would not necessarily be detectable in the crude extract system. In the system with purified factors where longer products could be seen, 3′-O-methyl-GTP was able to arrest chain elongation at the first G position (10Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We further confirm the termination efficiency of 3′-O-methyl-GTP by using a TAGAG template. The combination of ATP and GTP (with the expected product pppApGpApG) is sufficient to cause IOC formation (lane 8). However, the substitution of 3′-O-methyl-GTP for GTP blocks IOC formation (lane 9), demonstrating that it has prevented any read-through due to misincorporation. The data indicate that when the IOC forms the opening always extends as far as position 15 (lanes 3 and 5–8), whereas the POC opening never extends beyond the start site (lanes 2, 4, and 9). The results indicate that the transition from POC to IOC is not gradual and is accompanied by a sudden extension of the transcription bubble. This extension happens when an RNA as short as a 3-mer is formed and appears to be somewhat more efficient when longer RNA is made. The results contrast with a prior study in a different experimental system in which the leading edge of the bubble extended gradually as the RNA became longer (Ref. 10Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar; discussed below). It is apparent from these and prior data that the formation of the POC and IOC are different processes. Formation of both complexes requires ATP. It is not yet known if the same activities are involved in the creation of these two complexes. Recent results using mutant forms of TFIIH measured the formation of the IOC only; the effect of mutation on the POC was not assessed (see Introduction). In order to place constraints on which activities might be involved, we measured the K m for these steps. We use dATP rather than ATP to avoid potential complications from the use of ATP as an elongation substrate. The result will allow theseK m values to be compared with each other and with values for various activities that are candidates for triggering formation of the POC and the IOC. To measure the apparent K m for dATP, its concentration was varied, and the extent of POC formation was assayed. dATP concentrations up to 125 μm were added to reactions. Two minutes later, permanganate was added, and opening was assayed in the standard manner. The result (Fig.2 A) shows the increasing POC signal that is observed with increasing dATP concentration. The extent of POC formation was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. The average of four trials was used in the data display of Fig.2 B. The results indicate an apparent K mfor dATP of about 4.8 μm with an S.D. value of 0.9 μm. This value is consistent with previous indications that the K m of POC formation should be under 10 μm for dATP (20Jiang Y. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1277-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The apparent K m for IOC formation was determined using a protocol modified to trigger bubble extension. In this protocol, UpA and CTP are included as substrates for UpApC formation. Varying concentrations of dATP are added to trigger IOC formation. Fig.3 A shows the resulting permanganate patterns. Part of the IOC-specific signal (bar at right) was quantified and analyzed as for the IOC data. The results of five trials were averaged and are shown plotted in Fig.3 B. The apparent K m for dATP for IOC formation is about 8.5 μm, with a S.D. of 1.6 μm. This IOC K m is approximately 2-fold higher than that obtained for POC formation. Qualitatively, the raw data in the autoradiograph also confirm that it takes less dATP to trigger the upstream opening typical of POC formation than to trigger bubble extension to form the IOC. For example, the upstream melted DNA signal in the fifth lane from the left is nearly saturated as judged by comparison with the seven lanes to its right. However, in this same lane, the IOC-specific part of the signal is significantly below saturation (see bracket at right). This comparison shows directly that bubble extension requires a higher dATP concentration than upstream opening, although the difference may be modest. It was shown previously that a large excess of the nonhydrolyzable ATPγS inhibited formation of both the POC and the IOC (11Yan M. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7457-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Jiang Y. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1277-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), consistent with prior reported effects during the early stage of transcription initiation (5Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2962-2968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dvir A. Garrett K.P. Chalut C. Egly J.M. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7245-7248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). If the activities catalyzing both steps are similar, they would be expected to be affected similarly by this inhibitor. In this experiment, we used a low concentration of inhibitor to compare the responses in formation of the POC and the IOC. The assays used were like those just described but performed in the presence of 25 μm ATPγS. The amount of dATP was varied from 0 to 125 μm. Separate experiments determined the amount of POC formed (Fig. 4 A) and IOC formed (Fig. 4 B). The inhibition is apparent in both cases; i.e. at 12.5 μm dATP there is little formation of POC (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) as well as little formation of IOC (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). This is in contrast to the extensive formation of both complexes at 12.5 μm dATP seen when no inhibitor was present (see Fig. 3). Qualitatively, both complexes are inhibited similarly. Quantitative analysis (not shown) indicates that the apparent K m for each process is raised by roughly 1 order of magnitude in the presence of 25 μm ATPγS. We infer that the activities that catalyze POC and IOC respond similarly to this inhibitor. The step following IOC formation is the escape of RNA polymerase from the promoter into elongation phase. The escaped polymerase is accompanied by the transcription bubble, and both clear the promoter region together. We devised an assay to follow the disappearance of the bubble from the promoter region. The disappearance is monitored at different dATP concentrations to evaluate theK m for the clearance step. Such an assay is complicated by the need for ATP as an elongation substrate for transcription. Thus, ATP must be present to allow the polymerase to move away from the promoter. But because the steps prior to clearance also require ATP, the aggregate effects of low ATP could be confusing. This complexity can be bypassed if theK m for clearance is substantially higher than that for the prior steps. This turned out to be the case, and the following protocol proved to be successful. In this protocol a mixture of 50 μm each of CTP, GTP, and UTP and 2.5 μm ATP is added to reaction mixtures. This amount of ATP is sufficient to allow POC formation (Fig.5 A, leftmost lane). However, it is too low to allow efficient clearance, as indicated by the retention of the permanganate signal over the promoter region. If 1 mm dATP is added (rightmost lane), the permanganate signal is substantially depleted. This demonstrates that a high concentration of dATP can trigger clearance of the bubble. The experiment is then to simply vary the concentration of dATP and follow the clearance of the bubble from the promoter region. Fig.5 A shows the resulting autoradiographs, which demonstrate progressive degrees of clearance triggered by increasing dATP concentrations. The transition to clearance is a discrete rather than a gradual process; i.e. there is no evidence in the patterns that inefficient clearance at low dATP concentrations gives complexes where the bubble has changed its location. Instead, the patterns at low and high dATP concentrations are essentially similar; there is just a lower degree of melting upstream from the start site at the high concentrations at which clearance has occurred efficiently. The data were analyzed quantitatively by PhosphorImager analysis, and four trials were averaged (Fig. 5 B). The apparentK m for promoter clearance is 53 μm, with a S.D. of 12 μm. This is obviously greater than theK m values for the prior steps, as measured above. Overall, the data show that the three consecutive postrecruitment steps occur via activities that are associated with progressively higherK m for dATP. Below we discuss the relevance of this to the postrecruitment pathway. Prior studies of postrecruitment processes at the promoter have shown that there are three critical consecutive steps (2Jiang Y. Yan M. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1614-1621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 11Yan M. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7457-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). First, the DNA is opened, then the bubble is extended and stabilized, and finally the polymerase and the bubble clear the promoter as the transcript is elongated. The current data on an activated adenovirus E4 promoter indicate that the transitions between the steps occur discretely rather than gradually. The bubble extension to form a stable complex occurs reasonably efficiently when a 3-nucleotide-long RNA is made. The full number of base pairs is melted at this stage. The transition to clearance is also discrete. The three consecutive steps use activities associated with progressively higherK m values for dATP. The first two steps, initial opening and bubble extension, respond similarly to an inhibitor. These data have both similarities and differences to data from the literature. Below we attempt to place the data in context. A primary area of prior uncertainty involves the relationship between initial unstable promoter opening and the extension of the bubble to form a fully stable open complex. Two unresolved types of questions have arisen. 1) How is the bubble extension triggered and maintained? 2) What protein factors are involved, and does the same activity catalyze the initial opening and the extension? We consider the transition first. The current data indicate that the transition is virtually complete when a 3-nucleotide-long RNA is made. The opening extends a full helix turn downstream from the edge of the RNA, and the entire downstream region appears to open at once. Thus, the transition appears to be between one discrete complex and another. Aspects of these data differ from a prior study at the adenovirus major late promoter (10Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Some of these differences were seen previously (11Yan M. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7457-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the major late case, the transition occurred gradually and apparently was not between two fully discrete complexes. Instead, as the RNA grew progressively longer the bubble also grew progressively longer. There are several differences between the two experimental systems, and the new data reported here help to decide which differences are the most relevant. One difference in the prior studies was that only the major late templates were engineered to prevent unintended read-through via placement of sites for the chain terminator 3′-O-methyl-GTP. In the current study, we engineered an analogous series of templates at the E4 promoter. The use of these showed that this was not the source of the different results in the two systems; the more detailed studies presented here still demonstrated a discrete transition early in the initiation process. Other data indicate that the different promoter used was also unlikely to be the source of the difference; i.e. prior less detailed study of the major late promoter showed that formation of a 3-nucleotide-long RNA was sufficient to catalyze opening downstream the start site (12Holstege F.C. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,22Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32301-32307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The remaining system difference is that the current E4 system relies on activated transcription from unfractionated extracts, whereas the comparison major late promoter study used a highly purified basal system. We suggest that factors present in the unfractionated activated system allow the transition to occur earlier and more efficiently. Thus, the activated system can trigger the discrete transition as soon as a very short RNA is made. We suggest that the normal pathway is likely to proceed in this manner. The current data show that the three postrecruitment steps have a progressively higher K m for dATP. The transcription machinery has multiple ATPase activities within factor TFIIH, two helicases and a protein kinase (23Serizawa H. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7476-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Schaeffer L. Moncollin V. Roy R. Staub A. Mezzina M. Sarasin A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2388-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). TFIIH is indeed required in the postrecruitment steps along with factor TFIIE (8Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 13Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar,25Ohkuma Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Dvir A. Tan S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28175-28178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The properties of these TFIIH activities may be discussed in terms of the use of ATP in the postrecruitment pathway. The available data give strongest support to the involvement of the TFIIH kinase in clearance and weakest support for the involvement of TFIIH helicases in the initial opening. The involvement of the kinase in clearance is supported by diverse experiments (Refs. 2Jiang Y. Yan M. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1614-1621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yankulov K.Y.

Nature. 1995; 377: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar; but see Refs. 27Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9232-9237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and 28Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The K m value for the use of ATP in a protein kinase assay was found to be 40 μmfor the kinase component, CAK, of TFIIH (29Solomon M.J. Harper J.W. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This is essentially identical to the K m measured here for the promoter clearance reaction, lending additional support to the involvement of the TFIIH kinase in promoter clearance. By contrast, there is very poor agreement between theK m values measured here for POC and IOC formation and that for the TFIIH helicases. The K m value measured for the TFIIH “transcription” helicase is approximately 200 μm (30Serizawa H. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17300-17308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sung P. Bally V. Weber C. Thompson L.H. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1993; 365: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 32Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. Chambon P. Egly J.M. Science. 1993; 260: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), which is in the typical range for helicases (17Matson S. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This is 20–50 times higher than the values found here for initial opening and subsequent extension and stabilization. The contrast is supported by prior experiments reporting very lowK m values for formation of sarkosyl-resistant initiated complexes (5Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2962-2968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contradiction is not definitive, because the K m value for a helicase in a replication system can be dramatically reduced in the context of a larger macromolecular complex (33Kornberg A. Scott J. Bertsch L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3298-3304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An ATPase activity within TFIIH with a lowK m value has been reported, and its coupling to helicase activity was implied (34Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7356-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, these considerations suggest that TFIIH could be involved, but they do not identify the appropriate activity within it. Other data support some involvement of the TFIIH transcription helicase. The helicase subunit has been mutated, and the re-assembled TFIIH was shown to be deficient in reaching the stage of a fully extended stable open complex (IOC formation) (13Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Initial opening (POC formation) was not assayed. Thus, TFIIH is required to reach the IOC stage in this system. The mutations destroyed the presumptive ATP binding sites of the polypeptide and thus inactivated the associated ATP-dependent helicase activity. This helicase is known to be involved in DNA repair and is a typical repair helicase in that it uses templates at which melting has been initiated by mispairing and then extends the length of the melted region. This activity is analogous to the transition from POC to IOC, where a melted template has its open region extended. Thus, despite the lack of agreement between the measured K m values, the involvement of the TFIIH transcription helicase in the transition to IOC is plausible. By contrast, there are no data available concerning which activity opens the DNA initially to form the POC. The involvement of a helicase activity would be very unusual in this step. Typically, helicases require a single strand DNA region or an end of double strand DNA to function (17Matson S. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). They rarely, if ever, initiate an unassisted melting reaction within intact duplex DNA. This view is supported by recent structural studies, which show that helicases typically require an initial single strand region to catalyze their melting reactions (35Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Moreover, the K m for initial opening measured here is far below that measured for the TFIIH helicase (30Serizawa H. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17300-17308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sung P. Bally V. Weber C. Thompson L.H. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1993; 365: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 32Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. Chambon P. Egly J.M. Science. 1993; 260: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) but does correspond to an ATPase activity within TFIIH (34Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7356-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the TFIIH helicase participates in this step, it must be using an unusual and modified helicase activity. These considerations suggest that other activities should be considered along with the TFIIH helicase for triggering the initial opening of the DNA. Our K m data show that the initial opening and the extension steps have similar but distinguishable K mvalues and that the two steps respond similarly to the inhibitor ATPγS. This is the type of behavior that one might expect from a single ATP binding site used in two different reactions. Thus, it is possible that TFIIH binds ATP and uses nonhelicase determinants to trigger initial opening. This could be coupled to subsequent triggering of the helicase activity, which could use the same ATP binding site to extend the opening in a conventional helicase reaction. Thus, a key unresolved issue is how opening is initiated. In prokaryotes, this requires a fork junction binding activity that binds double strand-single strand junctions and nucleates melting (36Guo Y. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11655-11660Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Such activities have not been assayed in the mammalian machinery and could function in conjunction with TFIIH. In this speculative model, an ATPase activity of TFIIH would work in conjunction with other polypeptides to initiate DNA opening. This initial opening would trigger the helicase activity of the same TFIIH polypeptide, which then extends the bubble as in a typical helicase reaction. Presumably, single strand DNA binding activities within the transcription machinery would be used to stabilize the open complexes. To be fully harmonious with the data of this report, the helicase activity would need to be assisted by the formation of a DNA-RNA hybrid with a length of at least 3 base pairs. Whether or not this speculation proves to be correct, the data presented here should provide significant constraints on any models proposed.
