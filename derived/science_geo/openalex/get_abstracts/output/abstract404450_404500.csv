https://openalex.org/W2040547343,"Multiple sclerosis is a common disease of the central nervous system in which the interplay between inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes typically results in intermittent neurological disturbance followed by progressive accumulation of disability1. Epidemiological studies have shown that genetic factors are primarily responsible for the substantially increased frequency of the disease seen in the relatives of affected individuals2,3, and systematic attempts to identify linkage in multiplex families have confirmed that variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exerts the greatest individual effect on risk4. Modestly powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS)5,6,7,8,9,10 have enabled more than 20 additional risk loci to be identified and have shown that multiple variants exerting modest individual effects have a key role in disease susceptibility11. Most of the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to the disease remains to be defined and is anticipated to require the analysis of sample sizes that are beyond the numbers currently available to individual research groups. In a collaborative GWAS involving 9,772 cases of European descent collected by 23 research groups working in 15 different countries, we have replicated almost all of the previously suggested associations and identified at least a further 29 novel susceptibility loci. Within the MHC we have refined the identity of the HLA-DRB1 risk alleles and confirmed that variation in the HLA-A gene underlies the independent protective effect attributable to the class I region. Immunologically relevant genes are significantly overrepresented among those mapping close to the identified loci and particularly implicate T-helper-cell differentiation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2105872868,"Biodiversity–ecosystem function experiments have shown the importance of a diverse range of species for the health of ecosystems, but the number of species needed to maintain ecosystem functioning and services remains unclear. A meta-analysis of biodiversity research now shows, surprisingly, that 84% of grassland plant species have promoted ecosystem functioning at least once. Different species were important in different years, in different places and for different functions. These results strongly suggest that most grassland plant species provide ecosystem services. Consequently, even a few extinctions could have a deleterious effect. Biodiversity is rapidly declining worldwide1, and there is consensus that this can decrease ecosystem functioning and services2,3,4,5,6,7. It remains unclear, though, whether few8 or many9 of the species in an ecosystem are needed to sustain the provisioning of ecosystem services. It has been hypothesized that most species would promote ecosystem services if many times, places, functions and environmental changes were considered9; however, no previous study has considered all of these factors together. Here we show that 84% of the 147 grassland plant species studied in 17 biodiversity experiments promoted ecosystem functioning at least once. Different species promoted ecosystem functioning during different years, at different places, for different functions and under different environmental change scenarios. Furthermore, the species needed to provide one function during multiple years were not the same as those needed to provide multiple functions within one year. Our results indicate that even more species will be needed to maintain ecosystem functioning and services than previously suggested by studies that have either (1) considered only the number of species needed to promote one function under one set of environmental conditions, or (2) separately considered the importance of biodiversity for providing ecosystem functioning across multiple years10,11,12,13,14, places15,16, functions14,17,18 or environmental change scenarios12,19,20,21,22. Therefore, although species may appear functionally redundant when one function is considered under one set of environmental conditions7, many species are needed to maintain multiple functions at multiple times and places in a changing world."
https://openalex.org/W1991024712,"The genome of the Atlantic cod has been sequenced, and genomic analysis reveals an immune system that differs significantly from that in other vertebrates. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II has been lost, as have some other genes that are essential for MHC II function. But there is an expansion in the number of MHC I genes and a unique composition for its toll-like receptor family. These compensatory changes in both adaptive and innate immunity mean that cod is no more susceptible to disease than most other vertebrates. These findings challenge current models of vertebrate immune evolution, and may facilitate the development of targeted vaccines for disease management in aquaculture. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is a large, cold-adapted teleost that sustains long-standing commercial fisheries and incipient aquaculture1,2. Here we present the genome sequence of Atlantic cod, showing evidence for complex thermal adaptations in its haemoglobin gene cluster and an unusual immune architecture compared to other sequenced vertebrates. The genome assembly was obtained exclusively by 454 sequencing of shotgun and paired-end libraries, and automated annotation identified 22,154 genes. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II is a conserved feature of the adaptive immune system of jawed vertebrates3,4, but we show that Atlantic cod has lost the genes for MHC II, CD4 and invariant chain (Ii) that are essential for the function of this pathway. Nevertheless, Atlantic cod is not exceptionally susceptible to disease under natural conditions5. We find a highly expanded number of MHC I genes and a unique composition of its Toll-like receptor (TLR) families. This indicates how the Atlantic cod immune system has evolved compensatory mechanisms in both adaptive and innate immunity in the absence of MHC II. These observations affect fundamental assumptions about the evolution of the adaptive immune system and its components in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2059355164,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disease, with astrocytes implicated as contributing substantially to motor neuron death in familial (F)ALS. However, the proposed role of astrocytes in the pathology of ALS derives in part from rodent models of FALS based upon dominant mutations within the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene, which account for <2% of all ALS cases. Their role in sporadic (S)ALS, which affects >90% of ALS patients, remains to be established. Using astrocytes generated from postmortem tissue from both FALS and SALS patients, we show that astrocytes derived from both patient groups are similarly toxic to motor neurons. We also demonstrate that SOD1 is a viable target for SALS, as its knockdown significantly attenuates astrocyte-mediated toxicity toward motor neurons. Our data highlight astrocytes as a non-cell autonomous component in SALS and provide an in vitro model system to investigate common disease mechanisms and evaluate potential therapies for SALS and FALS."

https://openalex.org/W1985504995,"The bifidogenic effect of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) has long been known, yet the precise mechanism underlying it remains unresolved. Recent studies show that some species/subspecies of Bifidobacterium are equipped with genetic and enzymatic sets dedicated to the utilization of HMOs, and consequently they can grow on HMOs; however, the ability to metabolize HMOs has not been directly linked to the actual metabolic behavior of the bacteria. In this report, we clarify the fate of each HMO during cultivation of infant gut-associated bifidobacteria. Bifidobacterium bifidum JCM1254, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis JCM1222, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum JCM1217, and Bifidobacterium breve JCM1192 were selected for this purpose and were grown on HMO media containing a main neutral oligosaccharide fraction. The mono- and oligosaccharides in the spent media were labeled with 2-anthranilic acid, and their concentrations were determined at various incubation times using normal phase high performance liquid chromatography. The results reflect the metabolic abilities of the respective bifidobacteria. B. bifidum used secretory glycosidases to degrade HMOs, whereas B. longum subsp. infantis assimilated all HMOs by incorporating them in their intact forms. B. longum subsp. longum and B. breve consumed lacto-N-tetraose only. Interestingly, B. bifidum left degraded HMO metabolites outside of the cell even when the cells initiate vegetative growth, which indicates that the different species/subspecies can share the produced sugars. The predominance of type 1 chains in HMOs and the preferential use of type 1 HMO by infant gut-associated bifidobacteria suggest the coevolution of the bacteria with humans.

Neubauer S.H. Jensen R.G. Handbook of Milk Composition. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 273-349Crossref Google Scholar). These oligosaccharides are collectively termed human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). HMOs are characterized by their complex structures. About 200 molecular species have been detected using a microfluidic chip separation coupled to mass spectrometry (2Ninonuevo M.R. Park Y. Yin H. Zhang J. Ward R.E. Clowers B.H. German J.B.

Kobata A. Gordon N.G. Oligosaccharides: Sources, Properties, and Applications. Nova Science Publishers, New York2011: 1-58Google Scholar). HMOs have been classified into 13 core structures that consist of lactose, at the reducing end, elongated by β1–3-linked lacto-N-biose I (Galβ1–3GlcNAc, LNB, type 1 chain) and/or β1–3/6-linked N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1-4GlcNAc, LacNAc, type 2 chain) (4Amano J.

The unique feature of HMOs is the predominance of type 1 chains, and such a composition has not been observed in milk oligosaccharides from other mammals, including anthropoids (Ref. 3Urashima T.

HMOs are resistant to gastrointestinal digestion in host infants, and thus the majority of HMOs reach the colon (6Brand-Miller J.C. McVeagh P. McNeil Y. Messer M. J.

The rapid and predominant colonization of a breast-fed infant intestine by bifidobacteria has long been known in pediatrics, and the selective growth of bifidobacteria has been attributed to HMOs (11Penders J.

However, our overall understanding of what structures of HMOs exert bifidogenic effects, and how, remains incomplete. Ward et al. (17Ward R.E. Niñonuevo M. Mills D.A. Lebrilla C.B. German J.B. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2007; 51: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and LoCascio et al. (18LoCascio R.G. Ninonuevo M.R. Freeman S.L. Sela D.A. Grimm R. Lebrilla C.B. Mills D.A.

The results showed that Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC15697 (same as JCM1222 used in this study) can grow vigorously in the presence of HMOs acting as carbon sources, whereas Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC29521 (JCM1255), Bifidobacterium breve ATCC15700 (JCM1192), and B. longum subsp. longum ATCC15707 (JCM1217) did not grow. B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC15697 preferentially consumed HMOs with DP ≤7 during the incubation period, whereas the other species showed very limited utilization of HMOs (only a 20–30% decrease of an oligosaccharide with an m/z 732.3, which corresponds to lacto-N-tetraose (Galβ1-3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc, LNT) or lacto-N-neotetraose (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc, LNnT), was observed for B. breve and B. longum subsp. longum). More recently, Marcobal et al. (19Marcobal A. Barboza M. Froehlich J.W. Block D.E. German J.B. Lebrilla C.B. Mills D.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2010; 58: 5334-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) used a chemically synthesized medium to show that B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC15697 can utilize HMOs with DP up to 12. Sela et al. (20Sela D.A. Li Y. Lerno L. Wu S. Marcobal A.M. German J.B. Chen X. Lebrilla C.B. Mills D.A. J. Biol.

In all of these studies, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry was employed for analyzing the consumption of HMOs. This method is superior because of its high sensitivity and high throughput capacity; however, MALDI-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS is not suitable for the quantification of each HMO, and the technique cannot distinguish between several important isomers contained in HMOs, e.g. LNT versus LNnT and lacto-N-difucohexaose I (LNDFH I) (Fucα1-2Galβ1-3(Fucα1-4)GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glc) versus lacto-N-difucohexaose II (LNDFH II) (Galβ1–3(Fucα1–4)GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)Glc). In addition, the use of the matrix may interfere with the measurement of low molecular compounds, and therefore the approach may not be suitable for the detection of HMOs with DP = 3 and the degradation products (mono- and disaccharides) of HMOs during cultivation. This particular drawback is apparent in the recent reports where the presence of trisaccharides 2′-fucosyllactose (Fucα1–2Galβ1–4Glc, 2′-FL) and 3-fucosyllactose (Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)Glc, 3-FL) are not described. 2′-FL is the most abundant HMOs unless the milk is derived from nonsecretor subjects (5Kobata A. Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2010; 86: 731-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 21Leo F. Asakuma S. Fukuda K. Senda A. Urashima T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2010; 74: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this report, we have conducted refined HPLC profiling of HMO consumption by the infant gut-associated bifidobacteria, in which the concentrations of the main fractions of HMOs (DP of 3–6) and the degraded intermediates (mono- and disaccharides) were determined. These results were then interpreted with respect to the metabolic functionalities of the bifidobacteria. The physiology of HMO metabolism in each bifidobacterial strain is also discussed in detail. This is the first study that unequivocally reveals the fate of each tested HMO during bacterial fermentation and the results indicate that bifidobacterial species/subspecies share the degraded products. The standard human milk oligosaccharides 2′-FL, 3-FL, LNT, LNnT, lacto-N-fucopentaose I (Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc, LNFP I), LNFP II (Galβ1–3(Fucα1–4)GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc), LNFP III (Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc), LNDFH I, and LNDFH II were purchased from Dextra Laboratory (Reading, UK). Lactodifucotetraose (Fucα1–2Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)Glc, LDFT) was synthesized by introducing an α1–3-fucosyl linkage into the Glc residue of 2′-FL using 1,3–1,4-α-l-fucosynthase. 3Haruko Sakurama, Yuji Honda, and Takane Katayama (Ishikawa Prefectural University), personal communication. LNB was synthesized as described previously (22Nishimoto M. Kitaoka M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Lacto-N-triose II (GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc) was prepared by hydrolyzing LNnT by β-galactosidase (23Miwa M. Horimoto T. Kiyohara M. Katayama T. Kitaoka M. Ashida H. Yamamoto K. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 1402-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and the triose was subsequently purified using Toyopearl HW-40F (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). Isomaltopentaose (IG5) was obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Lactose monohydrate (Galβ1–4Glc, Lac) was from Kanto Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). l-Fucose (Fuc) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) were from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), and glucose (Glc) and boric acid were from Kishida Kagaku (Osaka, Japan). Galactose (Gal), 2-anthranilic acid, and sodium acetate were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). LacNAc, Lewis a/x trisaccharides (Galβ1–3/4(Fucα1–4/3)GlcNAc) and sodium cyanoborohydride (grade, 95%) were from Sigma. The purities of the mono- and oligosaccharides other than LNB, lacto-N-triose II, LDFT, and LNFP III were certified to be >95% by the manufacturers. The purities of LNB, lacto-N-triose II, LDFT, and LNFP III were checked (>95%) using an HPLC equipped with a charged aerosol detector (Corona CAD, MA). All other reagents were analytical grade. Fifty seven healthy Japanese mothers who had not taken any antibiotics for 1 month were recruited from several midwife clinics in Kyoto Prefecture between July and September 2008. They were 32.7 ± 4.3 years old (mean ± S.D.), with a range of 25–40 years of age, and had given birth to infants at term (gestational age of 36–41 weeks). The mothers and their babies had no health issues. Breast milk samples were collected in sterile polypropylene tubes at 74.9 ± 27.2 days after delivery with a range of 30–120 days. The samples (900 ml in total) were combined and mixed with equal volumes of chloroform and methanol and stirred vigorously for 1 h at 25 °C to remove proteins and lipids. After standing for 16 h at 25 °C, the upper layer (∼1.6 liters) was collected and concentrated to ∼800 ml by evaporation. The solution was centrifuged, and the supernatant was lyophilized to give 59.6 g of solid materials that contained mainly carbohydrates. The crude carbohydrate preparation was dissolved in 400 ml of distilled water, and aliquots (20 ml) were applied every 60 min for a total of 20 loadings to a Toyopearl HW-40F gel filtration column (inner diameter, 5 × 80 cm) (Tosoh). The elution was carried out using water at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Fractions containing neutral oligosaccharides were collected and combined as a pool of human milk oligosaccharides. In some cases, fractions contained both lactose and trisaccharides. These fractions were separately collected, concentrated by lyophilization, and rechromatographed to remove the lactose. During the steps, almost all lactose (>99.5%) was removed. The purified fractions were combined with the pool and then lyophilized to give a final preparation of human milk oligosaccharides (4.74 g). Note that the sialyl oligosaccharides were eluted near the void fractions as polymeric compounds (24Thurl S. Munzert M. Henker J. Boehm G. Müller-Werner B. Jelinek J. Stahl B. Br. J.

All strains were purchased from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms. Bididobacteria were anaerobically grown at 37 °C in GAM medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) or in basal medium consisting of 0.2% yeast extract, 1.0% peptone, 0.5% sodium acetate, 0.2% diammonium citrate, 0.02% magnesium sulfate, 0.2% dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, 0.1% cysteine hydrochloride, and 1% sugar (Fuc, Gal, Glc, GlcNAc, Lac, LNB, or HMOs). The basal medium was supplemented with 4% reducing reagent (2% cysteine hydrochloride and 11% sodium carbonate) prior to the inoculation of the bacteria. The medium (10 ml) was inoculated with the bifidobacterial strain (equivalent to A600 = 0.1) and incubated under anaerobic conditions. For the analysis of HMO consumption, the samples (0.5 ml) were taken at the indicated times and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min, and the resulting supernatants were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored at −80 °C until use. Growth was monitored by measuring A600 at the indicated times.

Fifty μl of the bacterial culture supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of the labeling reagent and 30 μl of the internal standard solution (1 mg/ml of IG5). The mixture was placed at 80 °C for 45 min and cooled to room temperature. Labeled oligosaccharides were purified by solid extraction using Discovery DPA-6S columns (50 mg) (Supelco, Poole, UK). The columns were pre-equilibrated twice with 1 ml of acetonitrile, and the samples were loaded using gravity flow and allowed to drip through the column. The column was then washed four times with 1 ml of acetonitrile/water (99:1 by volume), followed by 0.5 ml of acetonitrile/water (97:3 by volume). The labeled oligosaccharides were eluted twice with 0.6 ml of water, dried by evaporation, and stored at either 4 or −30 °C until use. The labeled oligosaccharides were dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water and filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene Millex membrane (pore diameter 0.2 μm) (Millipore, MA). Ten μl of solution was injected into a Shimadzu LC-10Avp HPLC system (Kyoto, Japan). An amide-80 column (4.6 × 250 mm) (Tosoh) was used for the separation at 80 °C. Elution was performed with a binary gradient of solvent A (85% acetonitrile) and solvent B (60% acetonitrile) in 100 mm ammonium formate (pH 4.3) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The gradient was performed from 0 to 100% B for 90 min and then 0% B for 15 min to equilibrate the column before the next sample injection. Labeled oligosaccharides were detected with excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 425 nm, respectively. The standard curve for each oligosaccharide was created in triplicate experiments using a solution containing both the internal standard (1 mg/ml) and an oligosaccharide with varying concentrations (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/ml for LNDFH II, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/ml for the other saccharides). The peak areas of the saccharides were standardized by comparing them with that of the internal standard, and the corrected values were used for the calculations. The data represent means of two independent determinations. The gltA genes encoding galacto-N-biose (GNB)/lacto-N-biose I (LNB)-binding proteins (GLBPs) were amplified by high fidelity PCR involving PrimeStar MAX DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) using the genomic DNAs of B. bifidum JCM1254, JCM1255, and JCM7004 as the templates. The primers used were 5′-CACGACGAGGAGGCAACATCCAT-3′ and 5′-GTGGTCTTGGGTGATGGACGGAA-3′. The amplified fragments were inserted into pMW118 (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) for sequencing. PCR was done in two separate tubes for each gltA gene, and the sequences of the two independently amplified fragments were determined. The nucleotide sequences of the gltA genes from JCM1254, JCM1255, and JCM7004 were deposited in GenBankTM under the accession numbers of JF332149, JF332150, and JF332151, respectively. Anti-GLBP antibodies were prepared by immunization of rabbits with the purified recombinant GLBP (29Wada J. Suzuki R. Fushinobu S. Kitaoka M. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Ashida H. Kumagai H. Katayama T.

The immunoglobulin G fraction was purified by protein A-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography (GE Healthcare). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (30Katayama T. Suzuki H.

In brief, the bifidobacterial cells were grown in the basal media containing lactose as a carbon source, harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7), and disrupted by sonication. The cell-free extracts (10 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and subsequently electroblotted to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore). Anti-GLBP antibodies and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibodies (from donkey) (GE Healthcare) were used in 3,000- and 2,000-fold dilutions, respectively. The ECL chemiluminescent detection agent (GE Healthcare) was used to visualize the cross-reaction. HMO degrading activities were examined using 2′-FL, Lewis a/x, Lac, LNT, LNnT, and lacto-N-triose II as the substrates to detect the presence of 1,2-α-l-fucosidase, 1,3–1,4-α-l-fucosidase, β-galactosidase (lactase), lacto-N-biosidase, β-galactosidase (specific for type 2 chains), and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, respectively. The bifidobacterial cells were grown in basal medium containing lactose as a carbon source, harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), and disrupted by sonication. The cell-free extracts were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to separate the cytoplasmic factions from the cell wall fractions. Each fraction (250 μg) was incubated with 2 mm substrates in a total volume of 10 μl at 37 °C for 30 min (B. bifidum and B. longum subsp. infantis) or 3 h (B. longum subsp. longum and B. breve) to determine the localization of the enzymes. Lacto-N-biosidase activity of B. longum subsp. longum was lost when the cells were disrupted by sonication, and therefore, the intact cell suspension was regarded as the cell wall fraction. The reaction products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using a silica gel 60 aluminum sheet (Merck). The sugars were visualized as described previously (23Miwa M. Horimoto T. Kiyohara M. Katayama T. Kitaoka M. Ashida H. Yamamoto K. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 1402-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Shiga Prefecture, and it followed the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all donors. As mentioned above, HMOs are classified into 13 core structures, and the core structures are frequently modified by fucose and sialic acid via α1–2/3/4 and α2–3/6 linkages, respectively. The final HMOs prepared in this study contained neutral oligosaccharides with DP between 3 and 8 and appeared not to contain larger oligosaccharides and acidic (sialylated) oligosaccharides that are known to represent minor components (∼10% of the total HMOs) (31Thurl S. Muller-Werner B. Sawatzki G. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The purified HMOs were added to the medium at a concentration of 1%, and their consumptions by bifidobacteria were monitored using normal phase HPLC. Fig. 1 shows the HPLC profiles of mono- and oligosaccharides in the spent media of B. bifidum JCM 1254 at different times. The main HMOs were successfully separated under the conditions employed, with the exception of LNFP II and III. At 0 h, monosaccharides (Fuc, Gal, and Glc), Lac (small contaminants derived from the HMO preparation step) and oligosaccharides with DP of 7 and 8 (not identified) were also detected as minor peaks. Table 1 presents the list of oligosaccharides analyzed in this study and also shows their initial concentrations in the culture. The total oligosaccharide concentration was estimated to be 10.66 g/liter, which is consistent with the medium composition (1% carbon source). The concentrations of the respective oligosaccharides and the ratios between them were not significantly different from those reported previously (31Thurl S. Muller-Werner B. Sawatzki G. Anal.

We used B. bifidum JCM1254, B. longum subsp. infantis JCM1222, B. longum subsp. longum JCM1217, and B. breve JCM1192 strains to evaluate how these infant gut-associated bifidobacteria consume HMOs. They are the type strains of their respective species/subspecies except for B. bifidum. The type strain of B. bifidum (JCM1255) was found not to possess the functional GNB/LNB transporter (described later), whereas all of the other bifidobacterial strains examined had the transporters, as shown by Western blot analysis using anti-GLBP antibodies (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S1A). The sequence analysis revealed that the dysfunction of GLBP in B. bifidum JCM1255 is because of a frameshift mutation within the C-terminal region, which was caused by the duplication of a 17-bp sequence in its gene (supplemental Fig. S1B).

Temporally sparse transcription factor-DNA interactions induce local chromatin reorganization, resulting in transient access for binding of secondary regulatory factors. Many transcription factors exchange with response elements on a time scale of seconds Proteins with identical recognition sites fail to exhibit competitive binding in vivo Models support dynamic, temporally sparse, factor/response element interactions “Assisted loading” results from chromatin remodeling that creates transient access The access of transcription factors to regulatory elements in their chromosomal context can be strongly limited by local chromatin architecture. Furthermore, many lines of investigation now indicate that these restrictive features of nucleoprotein structure are organized in a cell specific fashion, and contribute significantly to the cell selective activity of a given regulatory site. An emerging paradigm suggests that the local chromatin structure of response elements contributes strongly to their tissue specific action. Thus, the mechanisms that govern site specific activity of distal regulatory sites are central to our understanding of eukaryotic gene regulation. Characterization of regulatory protein binding sites has been addressed primarily through the technique of chromatin immunoprecipitation, coupled with the use of antibodies specific to transcription factors (Robertson et al., 2007Robertson G.

These approaches can only resolve binding events and chromatin transitions on the time scale of minutes to hours, and lead, in general, to models wherein groups of transcription factors are bound to response elements on long time scales. In contrast, studies of site-specific factor binding in living cells have revealed residence times on chromatin measured in seconds for many site-specific DNA binding proteins (McNally et al., 2000McNally J.G. Mueller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L.

Misteli T. Transcription dynamics.Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanisms by which transcription factors bind to, and reorganize, local nucleosome structures are thus subject to considerable variation in interpretation. If most proteins are localized on binding elements over long periods, these sites should in fact be saturable, and subject to competitive displacement, as is normally observed for site-specific DNA binding proteins, both on DNA (Cann, 1989Cann J.R. Phenomenological theory of gel electrophoresis of protein-nucleic acid complexes.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17032-17040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and nucleosomal templates in vitro (Li and Wrange, 1997Li Q. Wrange O. Assays for transcription factors access to nucleosomal DNA.Methods. 1997; 12: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In concert with this model, competitive displacement has been argued for transcription factors (Nalley et al., 2006Nalley K. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Proteolytic turnover of the Gal4 transcription factor is not required for function in vivo.Nature. 2006; 442: 1054-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and saturable DNA response element binding has been assumed in a general quantitative model of eukaryotic transcription activation (Kim and O'Shea, 2008Kim H.D. O'Shea E.K. A quantitative model of transcription factor-activated gene expression.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined if competitive behavior and saturable binding are general properties of highly dynamic eukaryotic transcription factors in vivo. We have directly addressed this question using a well studied sequence-specific DNA binding protein, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We have examined competitive binding for this receptor, using a pBox variant of the estrogen receptor with an identical DNA binding specificity to GREs (Mader et al., 1989Mader S. Kumar V. de Verneuil H. Chambon P. Three amino acids of the oestrogen receptor are essential to its ability to distinguish an oestrogen from a glucocorticoid- responsive element.Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Competition was examined both in intact cells, using fluorescently tagged receptors and an amplified array of promoter elements, and at a variety of response elements throughout the murine genome, using chromatin immunoprecipitation. We report that the two proteins fail to manifest significant competition when binding to the same response element. Indeed, at a large subset of binding elements, we find that GR will “assist” binding of the ER pBox protein, even though they bind exactly the same site. We present a model (assisted loading) under which the interaction of multiple transcription factors to a given response element is understood as a highly dynamic process. Under this model, the direct participation of ATP-dependent remodeling complexes is central to a process of continual nucleosome reorganization and cycling. We developed a fluorescence microscopy assay to measure the steady-state binding of the GR and ER pBox to GREs in single cells. When treated with an individual selective steroid hormone, either GR or ER pBox individually associate with a GRE. However in the presence of both Dexamethasone (Dex) and Estradiol (E2), both receptors are concurrently competent to interact with the GRE. The 6644 cell line was engineered to visualize this process in single cells (see Experimental Procedures). The 6644 cell line cultures, which express GFP-labeled GR (GFP-GR) and mCherry-labeled ER pBox (Ch-ER pBox), were processed for RNA FISH to detect transcription from a 200 copy tandem repeat of MMTV LTR promoter-reporter cassettes that is integrated at a single genomic site (termed the MMTV array). The MMTV LTR contains well characterized GREs that are essential for MMTV transcriptional activation (Figure S4A) (Ostrowski et al., 1984Ostrowski M.C. Huang A.L. Kessel M. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Modulation of enhancer activity by the hormone responsive regulatory element from mouse mammary tumor virus.EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, Payvar et al., 1983Payvar F.

Sequence-specific binding of glucocorticoid receptor to MTV DNA at sites within and upstream of the transcribed region.Cell. 1983; 35: 381-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Following simultaneous treatment with Dex and E2, both labeled receptors concentrate in the subnuclear region containing the MMTV array, which is clearly identified by the RNA FISH signal (Figure 1A ). Figure S1 displays example fluorescent micrographs of cell nuclei under all hormone treatment conditions. Automated image analysis based on algorithmic identification of the RNA FISH signal indicates that GR interacts at similar steady-state levels following treatment with Dex alone or with both Dex and E2 (Figure 1B). Surprisingly, ER pBox interacts at a greater steady-state level in the presence of Dex and E2 compared to treatment with E2 alone (Figure 1C). We refer to this phenomenon as “assisted loading.” Single cells that exhibit high levels of GR/MMTV association also show high levels of ER pBox/MMTV association (Figure 1D), suggesting that the local chromatin state regulates binding of the two receptors without competition. FISH signal was also measured by the automated analysis method, revealing that liganded ER pBox was much weaker as a transactivator compared to liganded GR (Figure 1E). Since total steady-state binding to the GRE was similar for the two receptors under these conditions, this transcriptional difference likely reflects divergent interactions with cofactors. The interaction of ER pBox with the MMTV GREs is extremely transient (Figures S1E and S1F), on the same time scale as those reported previously for GR/MMTV interactions (Becker et al., 2002Becker M. Baumann C.T. John S. Walker D. Vigneron M. McNally J.G. Hager G.L. Dynamic behavior of transcription factors on a natural promoter in living cells.EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1188-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, McNally et al., 2000McNally J.G. Mueller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. The glucocorticoid receptor: Rapid exchange with regulatory sites in living cells.Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The hyper-dynamic interactions of both receptors may permit both receptor types to alternately bind the promoter without competing with one another (Figure 1F). This alternate transient binding of receptors without measurable steady-state competition requires that the MMTV GREs are unsaturated during hormone-dependent transcriptional activation. To extend our studies of the GRE saturation state, we employed a modified version of a competitive-ChIP assay that can measure the dynamics of TF binding if the REs are near steady-state saturation (Nalley et al., 2006Nalley K. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Proteolytic turnover of the Gal4 transcription factor is not required for function in vivo.Nature. 2006; 442: 1054-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These previous studies, which showed competition between transcription factors, were interpreted as evidence for TF/DNA interactions on the time scale of many minutes. ChIP experiments using the 6644 cell line treated with a single ligand show that Dex causes only GR to interact with the consensus GRE located in the B nucleosome of the MMTV LTR promoter, while E2 causes only ER pBox to interact with the same GRE (Figure 2A ). Individually, GR and ER pBox bind to the GRE at statistically identical steady-state levels under these conditions. When both hormones are added concurrently, there is no statistical decrease in the steady state binding level of either receptor compared to binding levels in the presence of their single respective hormones (Figure 2A). In fact, as found with the imaging analysis, activation of GR increases the level of ER pBox binding. Repeating these experiments using the 7281 cell line, which was developed for additional overexpression of ER pBox (Figure S2B ), also showed no competitive binding behavior (Figure 2B). The lack of competition in these two cell lines again suggests that the GREs are far from saturation.Figure S2Relative Expression Levels of Endogenous Steroid Receptors and Exogenous Fusion Proteins, Related to Figure 1 and Figure 2Show full captionCultures of the 3617 cell line, the 6644 cell line, and the 7281 cell line were grown in the absence of tetracycline for 48 hr to induce expression of the GFP-GR and Ch-ER pBox.

(K-L) Using the same image analysis algorithm, noncompetitive GRE binding is detected in 6644 cell cultures. We measured the fluorescence intensity of GFP and Cherry proteins using a single dual tagged fusion protein (data not shown), and employed this information to estimate the relative expression of the GFP-GR and Ch-ER in the 6644 cell line and 7281 cell line based on nuclear fluorescence intensity. Since these two cell lines respectively express over 3× and 10× fold more Ch-ER pBox compared to GFP-GR (Figure 2C), and GFP-GR is expressed at 2×–5× fold endogenous GR levels (Figure S2A) it is unlikely that low receptor abundance is the cause of noncompetitive behavior. Thus, ER pBox exhibits total steady-state binding that is similar to GR binding levels measured by imaging and biochemical assays, despite expression of ER pBox at much higher levels compared to GR (Figures 1B and 1C and Figures 2A and 2C). Combined with the measurements showing that increased expression causes increased steady-state binding of ER pBox to the GRE (compare Figures 2A and 2B), these results indicate that ER-box protein may less efficiently recruit cofactors that are required for efficient binding to GREs in the context of chromatin. Providing further support for this model, ER pBox shows a reduced ability to remodel the MMTV GRE when compared to GR (Figures S4A and S4B). As receptors bind alternately to the RE over time, GR could recruit cofactors to efficiently bind and open the local chromatin structure. Following the transient binding and release of GR, ER pBox could then interact more efficiently with the more accessible chromatin state at the GRE. Consistent with this model, concurrent treatment with Dex and E2 significantly increased the binding of ER pBox to the MMTV GRE (Figure 1C [p value = 4.8 × 10−13], Figure 2A [p value = 7.6 × 10−3], Figure 2B [p value = 6.2 × 10−5]). We next repeated the above experiments using the 7438 cell line, which expresses Ch-ER wild-type (WT) protein, GFP-GR, and contains the MMTV array integrated in the same genomic location as 6644 cells. The Ch-ER WT protein differs from Ch-ER pBox protein by only three amino acids that are located in the proximal zinc finger of the DNA binding domain (Mader et al., 1989Mader S. Kumar V. de Verneuil H. Chambon P. Three amino acids of the oestrogen receptor are essential to its ability to distinguish an oestrogen from a glucocorticoid- responsive element.Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar; Figures S2C and S2D]. Because of these three amino acids, the ER WT protein binds to a consensus estrogen RE (ERE) that is distinct from the consensus GRE (Figure S2E). As expected, the Ch-ER WT protein does not interact with the MMTV promoter in an estrogen-dependent manner when measured by ChIP or a steady-state imaging assay (compare Figures 2A and 2B with Figure 2D; also see Figure S2I). Comparison of fluorescence intensities between the 6644 and 7438 cell lines indicates that expression levels of GR/pBox ER and GR/WT ER are nearly identical in the two cell lines (data not shown). Thus, the levels of steady-state binding we measure for the ER pBox protein are due to specific ER pBox interactions with the GRE, not secondary protein-protein interactions between the two receptor complexes. When cells are simultaneously treated with both hormones, we detect a significant decrease in Dex-dependent GR binding to the GRE (Figure 2D [p value = 2.4 × 10−6]) and Dex-dependent activation of the MMTV promoter (Figure S2J [p value < 1 × 10−3]). These results are consistent with the previously reported sequestration of cofactors by heterologous steroid receptors (Kraus et al., 1995Kraus W.L. McInerney E.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Ligand-dependent, transcriptionally productive association of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of a steroid hormone nuclear receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 12314-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Meyer et al., 1989Meyer M.E. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Bocquel M.T. Tasset D. Chambon P. Steroid hormone receptors compete for factors that mediate their enhancer function.Cell. 1989; 57: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), which suggest the decrease in GR binding is unlikely to involve direct interactions of ER WT with the MMTV promoter. Importantly, the decrease in GR binding after simultaneous treatment with Dex and E2 is a technical control, demonstrating that both imaging and biochemical methods can detect decreases in steady-state receptor/GRE binding (Figure 2D, and Figure S2H). Our control experiments using Ch-ER WT strongly suggest that protein-protein interactions are an unlikely mechanism in targeting ER pBox to GREs. We sought an independent strategy to confirm this. We performed a series of time-resolved “pulse-chase” treatments using combinations of E2 and corticosterone (Ct), the natural glucocorticoid ligand in rodents. Ct can be rapidly washed out of cells, causing a rapid loss of GR binding to GREs and a sharp decrease in GR-dependent transcription (Stavreva et al., 2009Stavreva D.A. Wiench M. John S. Conway-Campbell B.L. McKenna M.A. Pooley J.R. Johnson T.A. Voss T.C. Lightman S.L. Hager G.L. Ultradian hormone stimulation induces glucocorticoid receptor-mediated pulses of gene transcription.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Following a concurrent 30 min pretreatment with Ct and E2, maintaining dual hormone treatment for an additional 30 min (or 15 min, data not shown) resulted in a significant decrease of GR from GREs at the MMTV array (histograms 2 versus 6, Figure 3A [p value = 8.9 × 10−3]) while ER pBox significantly increased association with GREs at the array (histograms 2 versus 6 in Figure 3B [p value = 7.0 × 10−9]). The opposing trends of GR and ER pBox binding during the time course further validates chromatin remodeling as the likely mechanism behind assisted loading. The decrease of GR binding observed from 30 min to 60 min in presence of Ct plus E2 is also observed in the continued presence of Dex alone, indicating that the decrease in GR binding is not caused by competition from ER pBox. Additional supporting evidence comes from re-ChIP experiments showing that GRE chromatin that is immunoprecipitated with an anti-GR antibody contains undetectable levels of coassociated ER pBox protein (Figure S4C). Further detailed in vitro characterization will be required to resolve the mechanisms by which sequential factor binding leads to increased chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activation. We have previously characterized global GR binding sites using genome-wide ChIP-seq (John et al., 2011John S. Thurman R.E. Sabo P.J. Sung M.H. Biddie S.C. Johnson T.A. Hager G.L. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Chromatin accessibility dictates de novo regulatory factor binding.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). To explore the saturation-state at these endogenous sites, we performed manual ChIP assays at multiple GREs throughout the genome. Figure 4 presents the findings for a GRE located near the Lcn2 gene and another GRE located near the Slc5a5 gene (Figure 4). As was found in the MMTV experiments, single steroid receptor binding was not strongly reduced under concurrent binding conditions. The slight reduction in GR binding during treatment with Dex+E2 (Figure 4A) was not detected when the experiment was repeated using the 7281 cell line (data not shown), which expresses additional ER pBox protein, suggesting this trend is due to technical variability in the quantitative ChIP assay. Interestingly, the Lcn2 GRE behaves similarly to the MMTV LTR, where concurrent receptor binding causes increased ER pBox association with the target chromatin (assisted loading). In contrast, assisted loading on the target chromatin does not occur at the GRE in the Slc5a5 locus. This distinct behavior caused us to further investigate the difference between these two genomic loci. We have also performed genome-wide experiments to detect DNaseI hypersensitive (DHS) chromatin regions, which are more accessible to nuclear proteins compared to surrounding regions of chromatin (Li et al., 2007Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. The role of chromatin during transcription.Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GR binding sites are highly correlated with DHS regions across the genome (John et al., 2008John S. Sabo P.J. Johnson T.A. Sung M.H. Biddie S.C. Lightman S.L. Voss T.C. Davis S.R. Meltzer P.S. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Hager G.L. Interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor with the global chromatin landscape.Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 611-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, John et al., 2011John, S., Thurman, R.E., Sabo, P.J., Sung, M.H., Biddie, S.C., Johnson, T.A., Hager, G.L., and Stamatoyannopoulos, J.A. (2011). Chromatin accessibility dictates de novo regulatory factor binding. Nat. Genet. 43, 264–268.Google Scholar). Some DHS sites, such as the site near the Lcn2 gene (Figure 4C) and the MMTV LTR (data not shown), become accessible only when GR interacts with the colocalized receptor binding site; we refer to this class of DHS elements as de novo sites. Other DHS sites are hypersensitive before Dex treatment (preprogrammed), for example the GRE near the Slc5a5 gene (Figure 4D). These initial results suggests that GR-dependent chromatin remodeling renders the chromatin more accessible during transient GR/GRE interaction and this “open” site is then more frequently bound by ER pBox. For a given genomic locus, the extent of chromatin accessibility can be represented as the peak of DHS sequence tag density (see Figure S3 for additional examples). A large ratio of DHS peak tag density value in the presence of Dex over the DHS peak tag density value in the absence of Dex indicates GR-dependent reprogramming of the locus via chromatin remodeling, i.e., a de novo event. Considering the examples of GR binding sites shown in Figure 4, the DHS tag density ratio for the Slc5a5 locus is 1 (preprogrammed) and the DHS tag density ratio for Lcn2 locus is 55 (de novo). To generate a single parameter that measures receptor competition or assisted receptor interaction for a given GR binding site, we used the ratio of"

Two groups report new approaches that enable microwave control over trapped atomic ions for quantum information processing. Ospelkaus et al. describe a device that enables microwave control, using the magnetic fields generated by electrodes integrated into a micro-fabricated ion trap. The internal quantum states of ions held in a trap can be coherently manipulated, and entangled states generated. In a second paper, Timoney et al. report an approach based on applying microwave pulses to trapped ions, which transforms them into a state isolated from outside disturbances. This technique significantly extends the coherence time of the system, decisively improving the prospects of microwave-driven ion-trap quantum information processing. Control over physical systems at the quantum level is important in fields as diverse as metrology, information processing, simulation and chemistry. For trapped atomic ions, the quantized motional and internal degrees of freedom can be coherently manipulated with laser light1,2. Similar control is difficult to achieve with radio-frequency or microwave radiation: the essential coupling between internal degrees of freedom and motion requires significant field changes over the extent of the atoms’ motion2,3, but such changes are negligible at these frequencies for freely propagating fields. An exception is in the near field of microwave currents in structures smaller than the free-space wavelength4,5, where stronger gradients can be generated. Here we first manipulate coherently (on timescales of 20 nanoseconds) the internal quantum states of ions held in a microfabricated trap. The controlling magnetic fields are generated by microwave currents in electrodes that are integrated into the trap structure. We also generate entanglement between the internal degrees of freedom of two atoms with a gate operation4,6,7,8 suitable for general quantum computation9; the entangled state has a fidelity of 0.76(3), where the uncertainty denotes standard error of the mean. Our approach, which involves integrating the quantum control mechanism into the trapping device in a scalable manner, could be applied to quantum information processing4, simulation5,10 and spectroscopy3,11."

Using a conditional gene knockout approach, the α isoform of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was selectively inactivated by AAV1-Cre-recombinase infection in specific brain regions or by promoter-driven excision of p38α MAPK in serotonergic neurons (by Slc6a4-Cre or ePet1-Cre) or astrocytes (by Gfap-CreERT2). Social defeat stress produced social avoidance (a model of depression-like behaviors) and reinstatement of cocaine preference (a measure of addiction risk) in wild-type mice, but not in mice having p38α MAPK selectively deleted in serotonin-producing neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus. Stress-induced activation of p38α MAPK translocated the serotonin transporter to the plasma membrane and increased the rate of transmitter uptake at serotonergic nerve terminals. These findings suggest that stress initiates a cascade of molecular and cellular events in which p38α MAPK induces a hyposerotonergic state underlying depression-like and drug-seeking behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W2098984423,"Cohesin enables post-replicative DNA repair and chromosome segregation by holding sister chromatids together from the time of DNA replication in S phase until mitosis. There is growing evidence that cohesin also forms long-range chromosomal cis-interactions and may regulate gene expression in association with CTCF, mediator or tissue-specific transcription factors. Human cohesinopathies such as Cornelia de Lange syndrome are thought to result from impaired non-canonical cohesin functions, but a clear distinction between the cell-division-related and cell-division-independent functions of cohesion--as exemplified in Drosophila--has not been demonstrated in vertebrate systems. To address this, here we deleted the cohesin locus Rad21 in mouse thymocytes at a time in development when these cells stop cycling and rearrange their T-cell receptor (TCR) α locus (Tcra). Rad21-deficient thymocytes had a normal lifespan and retained the ability to differentiate, albeit with reduced efficiency. Loss of Rad21 led to defective chromatin architecture at the Tcra locus, where cohesion-binding sites flank the TEA promoter and the Eα enhancer, and demarcate Tcra from interspersed Tcrd elements and neighbouring housekeeping genes. Cohesin was required for long-range promoter-enhancer interactions, Tcra transcription, H3K4me3 histone modifications that recruit the recombination machinery and Tcra rearrangement. Provision of pre-rearranged TCR transgenes largely rescued thymocyte differentiation, demonstrating that among thousands of potential target genes across the genome, defective Tcra rearrangement was limiting for the differentiation of cohesin-deficient thymocytes. These findings firmly establish a cell-division-independent role for cohesin in Tcra locus rearrangement and provide a comprehensive account of the mechanisms by which cohesin enables cellular differentiation in a well-characterized mammalian system."
https://openalex.org/W2060611816,"Trapped atomic ions have been successfully used for demonstrating basic elements of universal quantum information processing (QIP). Nevertheless, scaling up of these methods and techniques to achieve large scale universal QIP, or more specialized quantum simulations remains challenging. The use of easily controllable and stable microwave sources instead of complex laser systems on the other hand promises to remove obstacles to scalability. Important remaining drawbacks in this approach are the use of magnetic field sensitive states, which shorten coherence times considerably, and the requirement to create large stable magnetic field gradients. Here, we present theoretically a novel approach based on dressing magnetic field sensitive states with microwave fields which addresses both issues and permits fast quantum logic. We experimentally demonstrate basic building blocks of this scheme to show that these dressed states are long-lived and coherence times are increased by more than two orders of magnitude compared to bare magnetic field sensitive states. This changes decisively the prospect of microwave-driven ion trap QIP and offers a new route to extend coherence times for all systems that suffer from magnetic noise such as neutral atoms, NV-centres, quantum dots, or circuit-QED systems."
https://openalex.org/W1969689291,"Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a secreted factor known to guide axon/dendrite growth and neuronal migration. We found that it also acts as a polarizing factor for axon/dendrite development in cultured hippocampal neurons. Exposure of the undifferentiated neurite to localized Sema3A suppressed its differentiation into axon and promoted dendrite formation, resulting in axon formation away from the Sema3A source, and bath application of Sema3A to polarized neurons promoted dendrite growth but suppressed axon growth. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging showed that Sema3A elevated the cGMP but reduced cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) activity, and its axon suppression is attributed to the downregulation of PKA-dependent phosphorylation of axon determinants LKB1 and GSK-3β. Downregulating Sema3A signaling in rat embryonic cortical progenitors via in utero electroporation of siRNAs against the Sema3A receptor neuropilin-1 also resulted in polarization defects in vivo. Thus, Sema3A regulates the earliest step of neuronal morphogenesis by polarizing axon/dendrite formation."
https://openalex.org/W2078838367,"Atmospheric methane (CH(4)) increased through much of the twentieth century, but this trend gradually weakened until a stable state was temporarily reached around the turn of the millennium, after which levels increased once more. The reasons for the slowdown are incompletely understood, with past work identifying changes in fossil fuel, wetland and agricultural sources and hydroxyl (OH) sinks as important causal factors. Here we show that the late-twentieth-century changes in the CH(4) growth rates are best explained by reduced microbial sources in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results, based on synchronous time series of atmospheric CH(4) mixing and (13)C/(12)C ratios and a two-box atmospheric model, indicate that the evolution of the mixing ratio requires no significant change in Southern Hemisphere sources between 1984 and 2005. Observed changes in the interhemispheric difference of (13)C effectively exclude reduced fossil fuel emissions as the primary cause of the slowdown. The (13)C observations are consistent with long-term reductions in agricultural emissions or another microbial source within the Northern Hemisphere. Approximately half (51 ± 18%) of the decrease in Northern Hemisphere CH(4) emissions can be explained by reduced emissions from rice agriculture in Asia over the past three decades associated with increases in fertilizer application and reductions in water use."
https://openalex.org/W2098595367,"Hippocampal granule cells are important relay stations that transfer information from the entorhinal cortex into the hippocampus proper. This process is critically determined by the integrative properties of granule cell dendrites. However, their small diameter has so far hampered efforts to examine their properties directly. Using a combination of dual somatodendritic patch-clamp recordings and multiphoton glutamate uncaging, we now show that the integrative properties of granule cell dendrites differ substantially from other principal neurons. Due to a very strong dendritic voltage attenuation, the impact of individual synapses on granule cell output is low. At the same time, integration is linearized by voltage-dependent boosting mechanisms, only weakly affected by input synchrony, and independent of input location.

Voltage attenuation is strong in thin dendrites of hippocampal granule cells Integration of synaptic input in granule cell dendrites is linear with gain The somatic impact of individual synapses is low and uniform The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is a key relay station, common to all mammals, that controls information transfer from the entorhinal cortex into the hippocampus proper (Amaral et al., 2007Amaral D.G. Scharfman H.E. Lavenex P. The dentate gyrus: fundamental neuroanatomical organization (dentate gyrus for dummies).Prog. Brain Res. 2007; 163: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, Treves et al., 2008Treves A. Tashiro A. Witter M.E. Moser E.I. What is the mammalian dentate gyrus good for?.Neuroscience. 2008; 154: 1155-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Dentate gyrus granule cells play a crucial role in this process since they receive and integrate the incoming entorhinal synaptic signals. Input from the entorhinal cortex reaches the dentate gyrus via the perforant path projection, which terminates in a laminated pattern onto granule cell dendrites within the outer two thirds of the molecular layer. This input represents the majority of excitatory synapses on granule cell dendritic arbors (approximately 70% of the 3600–5600 synapses onto individual granule cells; Patton and McNaughton, 1995Patton P.E. McNaughton B. Connection matrix of the hippocampal formation: I. The dentate gyrus.Hippocampus. 1995; 5: 245-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Within the inner molecular layer, granule cells receive additional associational/commissural inputs onto their proximal dendrites. Understanding how these different synaptic inputs are integrated by granule cell dendrites is of central importance to understand the process of information transfer into the canonical hippocampal circuit. Dendritic integration is powerfully influenced both by the morphological and passive electrical features of the dendritic arbor, and the expression of voltage-gated ion channels. The presence of voltage-gated conductances can endow individual dendritic branches with active properties and can strongly modulate excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) propagation (London and Häusser, 2005London M. Häusser M. Dendritic computation.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The propagation of voltage signals in granule cell dendrites has so far been addressed only in passive cable models of morphologically reconstructed granule cells (Jaffe and Carnevale, 1999Jaffe D.B. Carnevale N.T. Passive normalization of synaptic integration influenced by dendritic architecture.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 3268-3285PubMed Google Scholar, Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2007Schmidt-Hieber C. Jonas P. Bischofberger J. Subthreshold dendritic signal processing and coincidence detection in dentate gyrus granule cells.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8430-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that differences in the morphology of granule cells and other types of neurons (i.e., pyramidal neurons) may strongly influence dendritic voltage transfer. Indeed, granule cell dendrites differ considerably from those of hippocampal pyramidal cells. For instance, they branch profusely not far from the soma within the inner third of the molecular layer, giving rise to multiple small-caliber higher order dendrites that traverse the entire molecular layer. This branching pattern results in a characteristic cone-shaped dendritic arbor, with most synaptic sites being located on spines within the outer two thirds of the molecular layer (Amaral et al., 2007Amaral D.G. Scharfman H.E. Lavenex P. The dentate gyrus: fundamental neuroanatomical organization (dentate gyrus for dummies).Prog. Brain Res. 2007; 163: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The dendritic integration and voltage transfer of inputs from these synaptic sites is expected to depend strongly on the active and passive properties of granule cell dendrites. However, efforts to experimentally determine these properties have been hampered by their exceedingly small diameter. Consequently, very little is known about voltage transfer in small-caliber granule cell dendrites, or about their integrative properties. We were able to overcome these experimental difficulties by using infrared scanning gradient contrast microscopy to perform dual somatodendritic recordings from granule cells. Combining this technique with experiments utilizing two-photon uncaging of glutamate enabled us to address integration of excitatory input in granule cell dendrites experimentally. We demonstrate that the properties of these dendrites differ substantially from those of other principal and nonprincipal neurons, and are specialized for strong attenuation of synaptic input while processing different spatiotemporal input patterns in a linear manner. The integration of excitatory synaptic inputs from the entorhinal cortex on the elaborate dendritic tree of granule neurons crucially determines the discharge properties of granule cells. So far, direct electrophysiological recordings from granule cell dendrites have not been possible, due to the small diameter of these processes (approximately 0.8 μm in distal and medial molecular layer, Hama et al., 1989Hama K. Arii T. Kosaka T. Three-dimensional morphometrical study of dendritic spines of the granule cell in the rat dentate gyrus with HVEM stereo images.J. Electron Microsc. Tech. 1989; 12: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We used combined two-photon excitation fluorescence and infrared-scanning gradient contrast (IR-SGC, Figure 1A ), suitable for recording from thin neuronal processes (Nevian et al., 2007Nevian T. Larkum M.E. Polsky A. Schiller J. Properties of basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons: a direct patch-clamp recording study.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), to obtain dual somatodendritic recordings from granule cells. We first studied the attenuation of action potentials evoked by somatic current injection that back-propagated into granule cell dendrites (bAPs, Figures 1B and 1C, see insets for magnifications). The bAP amplitudes decreased strongly toward more remote dendritic recording sites (n = 20, Figure 1D), with an attenuation length constant of 86.0 ± 8.5 μm. This corresponds to a much steeper attenuation than reported either for pyramidal cell main apical (Golding et al., 2001Golding N.L. Kath W.L. Spruston N. Dichotomy of action-potential backpropagation in CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 2998-3010PubMed Google Scholar) or basal dendrites (Nevian et al., 2007Nevian T. Larkum M.E. Polsky A. Schiller J. Properties of basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons: a direct patch-clamp recording study.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). When the bAP amplitudes were plotted over the somatodendritic distance normalized to the total length of the dendrite, the attenuation length constant was 0.31 ± 0.04 (n = 14, Figure 1E). Using this analysis, attenuation normalized to total dendritic distance seemed to be similar to both pyramidal cell apical and basal dendrites (cf. Figure S3B in Nevian et al., 2007Nevian T. Larkum M.E. Polsky A. Schiller J. Properties of basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons: a direct patch-clamp recording study.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, the delay of the action potential peaks increased (Figure 1F). The average conduction velocity of action potentials back-propagating into granule cell dendrites was calculated from the action potential peak delays, yielding 149.3 ± 2.0 μm·ms−1. This conduction velocity is markedly different when compared with pyramidal cell apical dendrites (approximately 500 μm·ms−1; Stuart et al., 1997aStuart G. Schiller J. Sakmann B. Action potential initiation and propagation in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons.J. Physiol. 1997; 505: 617-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and is also lower than the estimates for basal dendrites (approximately 200 μm·ms−1; Antic, 2003Antic S.D. Action potentials in basal and oblique dendrites of rat neocortical pyramidal neurons.J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Nevian et al., 2007Nevian T. Larkum M.E. Polsky A. Schiller J. Properties of basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons: a direct patch-clamp recording study.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We also observed pronounced distance-dependent broadening of bAPs, which manifested in a decrease of the maximal rate of rise of bAPs (δV/δt, Figure 1G) together with an increase in bAP half width (Figure 1H). We next studied how bursts of action potentials back-propagate into granule cell dendrites. In our recordings of bAPs during repetitive firing induced by prolonged somatic current injections, we had already observed that the amplitudes of individual bAPs stayed constant during trains of action potentials (Figure 1C, see red dendritic voltage recording). This is in contrast to pyramidal cells, in which a pronounced amplitude reduction during a train of action potentials due to slow inactivation of dendritic voltage-gated Na+ channels was described (Colbert et al., 1997Colbert C.M. Magee J.C. Hoffman D.A. Johnston D. Slow recovery from inactivation of Na+ channels underlies the activity-dependent attenuation of dendritic action potentials in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6512-6521PubMed Google Scholar, Jung et al., 1997Jung H.Y. Mickus T. Spruston N.

Activity-dependent action potential invasion and calcium influx into hippocampal CA1 dendrites.Science. 1995; 268: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). We examined this question in more detail by inducing bursts of somatic action potentials via repetitive brief current injections at defined frequencies (20, 50, and 100 Hz, Figures 1I–1K, respectively, first and fifth action potentials shown enlarged and superimposed in the lowermost panels). In these experiments, the amplitude of dendritic bAPs also remained unaltered during the train (Figure 1L). In addition, we never observed signs of dendritic regenerative potentials during bursts of action potentials, indicating a relatively low density of voltage-gated channels recruited by trains of bAPs. The strong attenuation of bAPs during invasion into granule cell dendrites raises the question if the associated Ca2+ transients also show a distance-dependent attenuation. Using multiphoton Ca2+ imaging, we found that Ca2+ transients associated with single bAPs showed little attenuation in the first, larger caliber dendrite segments up to approximately 50 μm from the soma (Figure 1M). Subsequently, however, attenuation was substantial toward more distal sites (Figures 1M and 1N, decrease for distances >50 μm from the soma 35.5% ± 0.4%/100 μm, 124 linescans, n = 14 cells). Similar attenuation was observed for action potential bursts elicited by brief current injections (5 APs at 20 Hz, n = 3, 26 linescans, see Figure S1D available online). This is markedly different from pyramidal basal dendrites, in which no appreciable attenuation of bAP-associated Ca2+ transients is observed even when bAP amplitudes are markedly attenuated. The dendritic back-propagation of action potentials in pyramidal neurons is substantially modulated by voltage-gated Na+ channels (Colbert et al., 1997Colbert C.M. Magee J.C. Hoffman D.A. Johnston D.

Because the dendritic recordings so far suggested a comparatively low density of Na+ currents in granule cell dendrites, we examined whether dendritic Na+ channels affect AP back-propagation in dentate granule cells by locally applying the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin to granule cell dendrites during dual somatodendritic recordings (TTX, 1 μM, n = 4, average distance of application site from soma 167.9 ± 13.8 μm, Figures 2A–2D ). During continuous local application of TTX, the somatic AP was initially unaffected, but bAP amplitudes decreased (red symbols in Figure 2B, see example traces at time point 2). Twenty seconds after onset of TTX application, the dendritic to somatic amplitude ratio was reduced by 12.6% ± 8.9% (n = 4). Ultimately, TTX application caused failure of somatic action potentials in all experiments (example traces at time point 3 in Figure 2B), indicating TTX had reached the perisomatic region including the axon initial segment. Just before the somatic action potential failed, the dendritic to somatic AP amplitude ratio was reduced by 42.7% ± 10.2% (summary in Figure 2C). Because the recruitment of voltage-gated Na+ currents is dependent on the membrane potential, which may be more depolarized in vivo, we also examined action potential back-propagation over a range of membrane potentials. We elicited somatic action potentials while injecting prolonged de- or hyperpolarizing current pulses into the dendritic electrode (Figures 2E–2G). Dendritic polarization did not affect bAPs over a large range of dendritic membrane potentials, with some attenuation of back-propagation only at dendritic potentials > −60 mV. (Figure 2H, dendritic and somatic AP amplitude normalized to the amplitude at resting membrane potential, n = 10). In further experiments, we examined the effects of TTX on action potential back-propagation as described in Figure 2C, but at depolarized Vm (on average by 34.5 ± 2.9 mV). We found that 20 s of TTX application reduce the dendritic to somatic amplitude ratio by 19.9% ± 10.7% (n = 4). Just before failure of the somatic action potential, the dendritic to somatic action potential amplitude ratio was reduced by 44.3% ± 7.5% (Figure 2D). Local TTX application (1 μM, n = 4) approximately halfway between the soma and the imaging site did not significantly alter bAP-associated Ca2+ transients (average distance of linescan from soma 108 μm, range 86–128 μm, peak fluorescence after TTX application 87% ± 16% of control, Wilcoxon signed-rank test p = 0.25, Figure 2I, leftmost panel). The lack of significant effects in these experiments may be due to the comparatively small effects of local TTX application on bAPs, or may also be due to a contribution of the spike afterdepolarization, present in the dendritic recordings, to Ca2+ influx (see Figure 2B). Dendritic local application of the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (5 mM) to block dendritic A-type K+ channels (Rhodes et al., 2004Rhodes K.J. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Doliveira L.C. Monaghan M.M. Burke S.L. Strassle B.W. Buchwalder L. Menegola M. Cao J. et al.KChIPs and Kv4 alpha subunits as integral components of A-type potassium channels in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7903-7915Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) with the same configuration as for TTX also failed to significantly affect the magnitude of dendritic Ca2+ transients associated with bAPs (n = 11, average distance of linescan from soma 190 μm, range 131–308 μm, Wilcoxon signed-rank test of peak fluorescence before and after drug application, p = 0.08, peak fluorescence after drug application 119% ± 8% of control, Figure 2I, rightmost panel). The effect of 4-aminopyridine was verified by local puff-application at the neuronal soma, which caused action potential broadening and burst generation (Figure 2J). These results suggest that granule cell dendrites contain voltage-gated Na+ channels which affect dendritic propagation of action potentials (Jefferys, 1979Jefferys J.G. Initiation and spread of action potentials in granule cells maintained in vitro in slices of guinea-pig hippocampus.J. Physiol. 1979; 289: 375-388PubMed Google Scholar). However, compared with pyramidal cell dendrites, the impact of these channels appears to be lower. This is also reflected in a low propensity to generate regenerative depolarizations in granule cell dendrites. We next examined the attenuation of bAPs using a realistic computational model (see Experimental Procedures, Figures 3A and 3B ). We incorporated different densities of dendritic voltage-gated Na+ and K+ conductances in this model. Implementations of the model lacking dendritic voltage-gated conductances already closely replicated the bAP attenuation seen experimentally (Figure 3C, three different granule cell morphologies derived from Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2007Schmidt-Hieber C. Jonas P. Bischofberger J. Subthreshold dendritic signal processing and coincidence detection in dentate gyrus granule cells.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8430-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), depicted in light gray, dark gray, and black, experimental data from Figure 1D superimposed). We then systematically varied the density of Na+ conductances in the model granule cell. Increasing dendritic Na+ conductances to >2 mS/cm2 caused a boosting of bAPs that was inconsistent with the experimental data (Figure 3D, see legend for statistical analysis). Increasing dendritic A-type K+ channel conductance to 30 and 60 mS/cm2 did not have large effects on action potential back-propagation (Figure 3E) compared with purely passive dendrites, primarily because the depolarization afforded by bAPs at dendritic sites was insufficient to cause large increases in A-type K+ current. However, A-type conductances did have an effect in the presence of Na+ conductances that boost action potential back-propagation (cf. gNa 10 mS/cm2 in Figure 3D versus gIA 30 mS/cm2 and gNa 10 mS/cm2 in Figure 3E). This finding was also apparent when the relative density of gIA and gNa was systematically varied and the attenuation at 150 μm distance from the soma was coded as a heatmap (Figure 3F). These modeling data suggest that granule cell dendrites with modest densities of voltage-gated Na+ or K+ channels can replicate the experimentally obtained data well (see Figure 3G for overlay of experimental data, and data points from the computational model with passive dendrites and gNa 2 mS/cm2, data presented as mean ± standard deviation of values for all dendritic segments with a given distance from the soma). The attenuation of EPSPs and the influence of voltage-gated conductances on EPSP propagation have been extensively examined in dendrites of pyramidal cells (London and Häusser, 2005London M. Häusser M. Dendritic computation.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, Magee, 2000Magee J.C. Dendritic integration of excitatory synaptic input.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, Silver, 2010Silver R.A. Neuronal arithmetic.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 474-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In contrast, the features of EPSP propagation from distal dendritic sites to the soma in granule cells are unknown. We have studied this issue using dual somatodendritic recordings from granule cells. Injection of mock excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) into the dendritic electrode yielded a strong voltage attenuation from the dendritic to the somatic recording site (Figure 4A , red: dendritic recording, blue: somatic recording, see Experimental Procedures and Figure S1 for description of mock EPSC injection and related control experiments, n = 16). The attenuation (somatic divided by dendritic EPSP amplitude) ranged from 1.04 (43 μm from the soma) to 0.088 (306 μm from the soma) with large variations in the proximal dendrites (CV = 0.81 for proximal sites <50 μm from the soma, CV = 0.44 for more distal sites). In a subset of these recordings, EPSPs were also evoked by local sucrose application (eEPSPs, Figure 4B, magnified average eEPSP, see inset) close to the dendritic recording site. Individual eEPSPs displayed a similar attenuation from the dendritic to the somatic recording electrode as those evoked by dendritic mock EPSC injection (average 0.10 ± 0.3 for eEPSPs and 0.129 ± 0.037 for mock EPSCs, respectively, paired t-test, p = 0.08, n = 3). At all recording sites beyond the initial proximal dendritic segment, attenuation was strong, with the somatic EPSP being only 10%–20% of the dendritic EPSP. Plotting the EPSP attenuation for dual somatodendritic recordings (mock EPSPs: black circles, eEPSPs: gray triangles) versus the distance between the recording electrodes clearly confirmed that voltage attenuation showed only weak distance dependence for dendritic input sites between 50 and 300 μm (Figure 4C). We then used prolonged current injections to study the steady-state forward and backward voltage attenuation in granule cell dendrites. Injection into the somatic electrode revealed relatively modest steady-state attenuation (average 0.78 ± 0.04, range 0.40–1.04, n = 20, Figure 4D, blue symbols in Figure 4F). In comparison, steady-state attenuation was more pronounced upon current injections to the dendrites (0.39 ± 0.05, range 0.06–1.00, n = 19, Figure 4E, red symbols in Figure 4F). The asymmetric nature of voltage propagation in granule cell dendrites is consistent with cable theory, and reflects the different input impedances at dendritic and somatic sites. Indeed, computational modeling revealed that a model granule cell in implementations with purely passive dendrites showed a dendritic EPSP attenuation (Figures 4G and 4H), as well as differential steady-state forward and backward attenuation (Figures 4I and 4J), similar to the experimental results. One notable feature of EPSP attenuation in both the experimental data and the computational model was the limited variance of EPSP attenuation at dendritic distances of > 100 μm between stimulation site and soma (Figure 4K, compare to Figures 4C and 4H). We examined voltage transfer from dendritic locations toward the soma by calculating the transfer impedance, a parameter describing the frequency-dependent voltage transfer properties. Transfer impedance decreased steeply at locations more distal than 100 μm from the soma for high, but not for low frequencies (Figures 4L and 4M for 1 kHz and 0 Hz, respectively). Thus, most of the voltage decrement occurs in proximal granule cell dendrites, allowing attenuation from more distal compartments to be both strong and uniform. Cable theory predicts that propagating fast voltage signals will be more strongly attenuated than slow or steady-state voltage signals. In addition, if the density of voltage-gated currents is low, no pronounced resonant behavior at specific frequency ranges should be detectable. To test whether granule cell dendrites are at all capable of frequency dependent signal amplification we performed a more rigorous analysis of frequency dependent properties using ZAP functions injected either into the dendritic or the somatic electrode (Figures 5A and 5B, respectively, see also Hu et al., 2009Hu H. Vervaeke K. Graham L.J. Storm J.F. Complementary theta resonance filtering by two spatially segregated mechanisms in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 14472-14483Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These recordings first revealed an absence of resonance behavior, indicating low functional expression of dendritic hyperpolarization-activated currents (Figure 5A). Indeed, we did not find changes in dendritic input resistance upon application of the h-current blocker ZD7288 (273.8 ± 64.1 MΩ in control solution, and 277.8 ± 65.6 MΩ after washin of 30 μM ZD7288, n = 3). This finding is also consistent with the absence of a hyperpolarizing voltage sag both in somatic and dendritic recordings (Figures S1E and S1F). We calculated the Fourier transforms of the somatic and dendritic voltage traces for current injections to the dendritic (Figure 5C) or the somatic electrode (Figure 5D). The frequency-dependent voltage transfer was estimated by computing the ratio of dendritic to somatic Fourier transforms (Figure 5G, filled lines, red: dendrite to soma, blue: soma to dendrite, dark gray indicates SD, n = 6 and n = 9, respectively, distance >50 μm from the soma). These data confirm a strong frequency-dependence of voltage attenuation, with a significantly stronger attenuation at higher frequencies (Wilcoxon signed-rank test of steady-state attenuation (at 0.5 Hz) versus attenuation at 25 Hz, D → S p = 0.031, S → D p = 0.004). These experiments were repeated at depolarized (Figure 5E) and hyperpolarized (Figure 5F) membrane potentials (average change in dendritic membrane potential +20.5 ± 3.4 and −15.7 ± 0.9 mV, n = 8 and n = 4, respectively). The frequency-dependent voltage transfer was not significantly altered (Wilcoxon rank tests at 0, 5, and 25 Hz, Figure 5G). The frequency-dependent voltage transfer properties assessed with ZAP functions were well replicated in the computational model with passive dendrites (data not shown). During physiological activity granule cell dendrites receive correlated synaptic input with varying degrees of synchrony. The frequency-dependent properties of granule cell dendrites described above suggest that voltage transfer of highly synchronous synaptic input may be less efficient than inputs with low synchrony. We therefore injected dendritic compound mock EPSCs mimicking inputs of different synchrony. Compound EPSCs consisted of 5 individual EPSCs separated by a variable time interval Δt ranging from 0.1 to 100 ms (Figures 6A and 6B , current injections shown in black, examples shown for Δt of 0.1 and 10 ms, respectively; red and blue indicate dendritic and somatic voltage recordings). Both types of stimuli were strongly attenuated, but the relative attenuation of the compound EPSP with a Δt of 10 ms was less pronounced (Figure 6C, traces as in Figures 6A and 6B, but scaled to the same peak value at Δt = 0.1 ms). When the peak voltage attained during compound EPSPs at the dendritic and somatic recording sites was plotted versus Δt, both parameters decline with increasing Δt. However, the somatic EPSP was stable over a larger range of Δt (Figure 6D). This effect was due to an enhanced voltage transfer around a Δt of approximately 10 ms (Figure 6E, n = 12, distance >50 μm from the soma). Very similar properties were observed in the computational model, with application of identical compound mock EPSPs (virtual recording sites indicated in Figure 6F, example traces in Figure 6G, analysis of the three model"

Compounds that stimulate the release and/or inhibit the reuptake of 5-HT are potential pharmaceutical targets for the treatment of obesity (Halford et al., 2010Halford J.C. Boyland E.J. Blundell J.E.

Indeed, d-fenfluramine (d-Fen) in combination with phenteramine (Fen/Phen) was widely prescribed and was clinically effective to combat obesity. However, the use of serotonergic therapeutics resulted in an increased risk for pulmonary hypertension and ultimately resulted in the withdrawal of d-Fen from the market in 1997 (Connolly et al., 1997Connolly H.M.

Understanding the beneficial anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) effects of antiobesity serotonergic therapeutics from the adverse cardiopulmonary side effects should be critical to developing novel and safe antiobesity medications. Recent studies have established that the 5-HT2C receptors (5-HT2CRs) are key mediators of the ability of 5-HT and drugs like d-Fen to regulate food intake and body weight. For example, global deletion of 5-HT2CRs results in hyperphagia and obesity (Nonogaki et al., 1998Nonogaki K. Strack A.M. Dallman M.F. Tecott L.H.

Eating disorder and epilepsy in mice lacking 5-HT2c serotonin receptors.Nature. 1995; 374: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Additionally, mice lacking 5-HT2CRs develop insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (Nonogaki et al., 1998Nonogaki K. Strack A.M. Dallman M.F. Tecott L.H. Leptin-independent hyperphagia and type 2 diabetes in mice with a mutated serotonin 5-HT2C receptor gene.Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). 5-HT2CRs also contribute to the anorexigenic effects of d-Fen (Vickers et al., 1999Vickers S.P. Clifton P.G. Dourish C.T. Tecott L.H. Reduced satiating effect of d-fenfluramine in serotonin 5-HT2C receptor mutant mice.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1999; 143: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that the anorexigenic effects of d-Fen are mediated in part by the 5-HT2CRs expressed by pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Heisler et al., 2002Heisler L.K.

Notably, hyperphagia/obesity and insulin resistance observed in 5-HT2CR null mice was normalized when 5-HT2CRs were re-expressed only in POMC neurons (5-HT2CR/POMC mice) (Xu et al., 2008Xu Y.

Several groups have also demonstrated that POMC neurons are activated by 5-HT2CR agonists which results in the release of α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) to activate the anorexigenic central melanocortin pathway (Heisler et al., 2002Heisler L.K.

Importantly, the acute effect of leptin to activate POMC neurons mirrors that of serotonin, but it is unclear whether leptin and serotonin share a similar signaling mechanism leading to the activation of arcuate POMC neurons.

However, it is unclear whether inhibition of a GIRK conductance contributes to the 5-HT2CR induced activation of POMC neurons or underlies the effects of 5-HT2CRs on energy homeostasis. Thus, while available data highlight the importance of 5-HT2CRs in POMC neurons to the metabolic effects of serotonin in the brain, the cellular mechanisms involved in the 5-HT2CR-induced activation of POMC neurons remain undefined. In acute hypothalamic slice preparations from POMC-hrGFP transgenic mice (Parton et al., 2007Parton L.E. Ye C.P. Coppari R. Enriori P.J. Choi B. Zhang C.Y. Xu C. Vianna C.R. Balthasar N. Lee C.E. et al.Glucose sensing by POMC neurons regulates glucose homeostasis and is impaired in obesity.Nature. 2007; 449: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of the 5-HT2CR agonist, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP; 4 μM), on the membrane potential of POMC neurons (Heisler et al., 2002Heisler L.K. Cowley M.A. Tecott L.H. Fan W. Low M.J. Smart J.L. Rubinstein M. Tatro J.B. Marcus J.N. Holstege H. et al.Activation of central melanocortin pathways by fenfluramine.Science. 2002; 297: 609-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). POMC neurons were identified by hrGFP signals under a fluorescent microscope (Figure 1B ). Alexa Fluor 594 was added to the intracellular pipette solutions (Figure 1C) for real-time confirmation that hrGFP-positive neurons were targeted for recording (Figure 1D) and for post hoc identification of neuroanatomical location of the recorded cells (Figure 1E). We recorded from 59 POMC-hrGFP neurons in control artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) bath solutions. Similar to several previous reports (Claret et al., 2007Claret M. Smith M.A. Batterham R.L.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), in current clamp mode POMC neurons had a resting membrane potential of −52.2 ± 0.8 mV. Application of mCPP depolarized 15 of 59 POMC-hrGFP cells by 5.5 ± 0.4 mV (n = 15; Figure 1F). Typically, the depolarization started gradually within 1 min of mCPP application, reached a maximal membrane potential deflection within 2 min, and was reversed upon washout of mCPP ∼5 min later. mCPP did not affect the membrane potential in 43 of the remaining cells, while one cell was hyperpolarized by −5 mV. For some experiments, tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM) was added to the bath solution to block action potential (AP)-dependent presynaptic activity from afferent neurons that may affect the membrane potential of postsynaptic neurons targeted for recording. In the presence of TTX, application of mCPP (4 μM) resulted in a depolarization from rest in 5 of 15 POMC-hrGFP neurons (5.2 ± 0.4 mV; n = 5; Figure 1G). The remaining 10 cells were unaffected by mCPP (0.4 ± 0.3 mV; n = 10), indicative of a direct membrane depolarization independent of AP-mediated synaptic transmission. Responses of POMC neurons to mCPP are summarized in Table 1.Table 1Rostrocaudal Distribution of mCPP-Activated and mCPP-Inhibited POMC-hrGFP NeuronsRegionRecorded CellsmCPP-Activated Cells (%)mCPP-Inhibited Cells (%)RCA143 (21.4%)1 (7.1%)Arc1145 (35.7%)0 (0%)Arc2267 (26.9%)0 (0%)Arc350 (0%)0 (0%)Total5915 (25.4%)1 (1.7%) Open table in a new tab Subsequent to recording, slices were fixed and examined for their location in the rostrocaudal and mediolateral extent of the arcuate nucleus with respect to their responses to mCPP (Figure 2). The illustrations in Figure 2A demonstrate that mCPP-depolarized POMC neurons were located adjacent to the midline and the third ventricle. Moreover, the majority of mCPP-depolarized POMC neurons were located between coronal brain sections corresponding to levels −1.30 mm and −1.70 mm from bregma along the rostrocaudal axis (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001Paxinos G. Franklin K.B.J. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates.Second Edition. Academic Press, Maryland Heights, MO2001Google Scholar). This distribution pattern was conserved when the experiments were performed in the presence of TTX (Figure 2B) or in neurons from 5-HT2CR/POMC mice (see Figure S1 available online). These results suggest that there is a distinct distribution of POMC neurons that are activated by 5-HT2CR agonists. A recent report suggested that 5-HT2C receptors blunt a GABAB-activated GIRK conductance in POMC neurons (Qiu et al., 2007Qiu J. Xue C. Bosch M.A. Murphy J.G. Fan W. Rønnekleiv O.K. Kelly M.J. Serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine2C receptor signaling in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin neurons: role in energy homeostasis in females.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that 5-HT2C receptors blunt GABAB-activated GIRK currents in POMC neurons ultimately leading to an activation of POMC neurons. To confirm the effects of mCPP on the GABAB-dependent outward currents, POMC neurons were voltage-clamped at a membrane potential of −40 mV, and changes in whole-cell current in response to bath application of 50 μM baclofen, a specific GABAB receptor agonist, was monitored in the presence of 0.5 μM TTX (Figures 3A and 3B ). Similar to previous reports (Cruz et al., 2004Cruz H.G. Ivanova T. Lunn M.L. Stoffel M. Slesinger P.A. Lüscher C. Bi-directional effects of GABAB receptor agonists on the mesolimbic dopamine system.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, Qiu et al., 2007Qiu J. Xue C. Bosch M.A. Murphy J.G. Fan W. Rønnekleiv O.K. Kelly M.J. Serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine2C receptor signaling in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin neurons: role in energy homeostasis in females.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), application of 50 μM baclofen resulted in an outward current of +17.6 ± 2.7 pA (n = 14). The baclofen-induced current (I1) was readily reversible upon washout, and the baclofen-induced outward current was repeatable in subsequent applications such that baclofen resulted in a second GIRK current (I2) of similar magnitude (I2/I1 = 91.2% ± 5.9%; n = 6) (Figures 3A and 3C). Notably, the specific GABAB receptor antagonist, CGP54626 (2 μM), completely suppressed the baclofen-activated GIRK currents in POMC neurons (Figure 3C), which is consistent with previous reports in the midbrain (Cruz et al., 2004Cruz H.G. Ivanova T. Lunn M.L. Stoffel M. Slesinger P.A. Lüscher C. Bi-directional effects of GABAB receptor agonists on the mesolimbic dopamine system.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Moreover, as previously reported, pretreatment with mCPP prior to the second baclofen application significantly decreased I2 resulting in a reduced average ratio of I2/I1 (47.8% ± 5.6%; n = 4) (Figures 3B and 3C). These data support a role of mCPP to suppress the baclofen-induced GIRK currents in POMC neurons; however, it remains unclear if GIRK channels are involved in the mCPP-induced excitation of POMC neurons. GIRK currents contribute to the resting membrane potential of several types of neurons (Cruz et al., 2004Cruz H.G. Ivanova T. Lunn M.L. Stoffel M. Slesinger P.A. Lüscher C. Bi-directional effects of GABAB receptor agonists on the mesolimbic dopamine system.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, Lüscher et al., 1997Lüscher C. Jan L.Y. Stoffel M. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A.

Thus, in order to determine if inhibition of GABAB-activated GIRK currents may contribute to the mCPP-induced depolarization in POMC neurons we examined the effect of the GABAB antagonist CGP54626 on the resting membrane potential of POMC neurons. Perfusion of CGP54626 (2 μM) failed to alter the membrane potential of all POMC neurons tested (−53.1 ± 1.9 mV in control versus −53.5 ± 1.9 mV in CGP54626, n = 9) (Figure 3D) suggesting that GABAB receptors do not constitutively activate GIRK channels nor contribute to a “leak” GIRK conductance in POMC neurons. Therefore an mCPP-induced suppression of a GABAB activated GIRK conductance may not result in the cellular activation of POMC neurons. However, these data do not eliminate the possibility that mCPP may modulate a GIRK conductance independent of GABAB activity. Previous reports suggest GIRK1 and/or GIRK2 subunits are largely responsible for GIRK currents in the brain (Koyrakh et al., 2005Koyrakh L. Luján R. Colón J. Karschin C. Kurachi Y. Karschin A. Wickman K. Molecular and cellular diversity of neuronal G-protein-gated potassium channels.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11468-11478Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, Lüscher and Slesinger, 2010Lüscher C. Slesinger P.A. Emerging roles for G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Thus, to further examine the contribution of GIRK channel subunits on resting membrane potential in POMC neurons, we generated POMC-hrGFP mice with global deletion of either GIRK1 or GIRK2. The average membrane potential of POMC-hrGFP neurons from GIRK1 knockout mice was −47.0 ± 0.6 mV (n = 16), which was significantly depolarized compared to wild-type mice (−53.3 ± 1.5 mV, n = 14, p < 0.05; Figure S2A). In contrast, the average resting membrane potential of POMC-hrGFP neurons from GIRK2 knockout mice was similar to control POMC-hrGFP neurons (−51.3 ± 0.9 mV, n = 7, p > 0.05 versus wild-type). These results suggest that GIRK channels, which contain GIRK1 subunits, are constitutively active at rest in POMC neurons and contribute to the resting membrane potential of POMC neurons. In support of this, POMC neurons from GIRK1 knockout mice had a significantly higher input resistance as determined by hyperpolarizing current steps (1,514 ± 118 MΩ in GIRK1 knockout versus 1,142 ± 76 MΩ in wild-type mice) (Figure S2B). POMC neurons from GIRK2 knockout mice had a slightly higher input resistance (1,382 ± 112 MΩ), but the difference was not significant. We next examined the requirement of GIRK1 or GIRK2 subunits in the baclofen-induced hyperpolarization of the membrane potential of POMC neurons. Baclofen hyperpolarized 11 of 14 (78.6%) POMC-hrGFP neurons from wild-type mice by −15.1 ± 2.1 mV (from −54.3 ± 1.7 mV in control to −69.4 ± 2.4 mV in baclofen, n = 11; Figure S2C). The hyperpolarization was accompanied by a 40.8% ± 6.2% decreased input resistance with a reversal potential of −91.2 ± 1.6 mV, supportive of K+ as the major cation responsible for the membrane hyperpolarization (Figures S2D and S2E). In GIRK1 knockout mice, baclofen hyperpolarized 2 of 16 (12.5%) POMC-hrGFP neurons (hyperpolarized by −8 mV and −9 mV), while the remaining neurons were unchanged in response to baclofen (Figure S2F). In GIRK2 knockout mice, baclofen hyperpolarized 4 of 7 (57.1%) POMC-hrGFP neurons by −4.0 ± 0.7 mV (from −51.8 ± 1.1 mV in control to −55.8 ± 1.8 mV in baclofen, n = 4) (Figure S2G). These results support a key role of GIRK1 subunits, but not GIRK2, in both constitutively active and GABAB-activated GIRK currents in POMC neurons (Figures S2H and S2I). We next determined the requirement of GIRK1 subunits in the mCPP induced depolarization of POMC-hrGFP neurons in GIRK1 knockout mice (Figure 3E). Perfusion of mCPP depolarized the membrane potential of 6 of 18 (33.3%) POMC-hrGFP neurons from GIRK1 knockout mice by 5.2 ± 0.3 mV (n = 6), which was similar to the effect of mCPP observed in POMC neurons from wild-type mice. Together, these data suggest that inhibition of constitutively active GIRK channels (Chen and Johnston, 2005Chen X. Johnston D. Constitutively active G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels in dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3787-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) is not responsible for the mCPP-induced excitation of POMC neurons. In order to further determine the conductance involved in the mCPP-induced depolarization, POMC neurons from wild-type mice were monitored for changes in input resistance and neuronal excitability. In current clamp configuration, continuous recordings of membrane potential were interrupted by hyperpolarizing rectangular current steps (500 ms; −10 to −50 pA; arrows in Figures 1F and 1G). In control ACSF, the whole-cell input resistance of POMC neurons was 1,323 ± 60 MΩ (n = 59), similar to previous reports (Hill et al., 2008Hill J.W. Williams K.W. Ye C. Luo J. Balthasar N. Coppari R. Cowley M.A. Cantley L.C. Lowell B.B. Elmquist J.K. Acute effects of leptin require PI3K signaling in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin neurons in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 1796-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, Hill et al., 2010Hill J.W. Elias C.F. Fukuda M. Williams K.W. Berglund E.D. Holland W.L. Cho Y.R. Chuang J.C. Xu Y.

The mCPP-induced depolarization of POMC neurons was accompanied by a reversible 17.1% ± 1.5% decrease in whole-cell input resistance. Specifically, the input resistance was reduced from 1,330 ± 135 MΩ in control ACSF to 1,095 ± 107 MΩ in mCPP (n = 15) (Figures 4A–4C ). Extrapolation of the linear slope conductance in control and mCPP-containing ACSF revealed a reversal potential (Er) of −27.3 ± 3.4 mV (n = 15) for the depolarization (Figure 4B). The whole-cell input resistance of mCPP-activated cells was also decreased in the presence of TTX (22.6% ± 3.0%; from 1,364 ± 408 MΩ in control ACSF + TTX to 1,023 ± 266 MΩ in mCPP +TTX; n = 5; Er = −25.7 ± 5.0 mV) (Figure 4C) and in POMC neurons recorded from 5-HT2CR/POMC mice (23.3% ± 5.3%, from 1,384 ± 196 MΩ in control ACSF to 1,066 ± 185 MΩ in mCPP; n = 5; Er = −28.0 ± 3.7 mV). Therefore, the mCPP-induced depolarization of POMC neurons is concomitant with an activated conductance with a reversal potential indicative of a putative mixed-/nonselective-cation channel. Some POMC neurons were transiently monitored in voltage-clamp in order to better assess changes in membrane conductance. Current-voltage relationships were examined by applying voltage ramps (−130 mV to 10 mV in 1.4 s, 100 mV/s) from a holding potential of −50 mV in 9 neurons which were depolarized in response to mCPP (Figure S3A). Application of mCPP resulted in an inward current at −50 mV (−7.5 ± 1.1 pA; n = 9; Figure S3C). Extrapolation of the linear portion of the slope conductance was used to determine the whole-cell membrane conductance and reversal potential (Figure S3D). The membrane conductance was increased by 22.5% ± 3.4% (from 0.9 ± 0.1 nS in control ACSF to 1.1 ± 0.2 nS in mCPP, n = 9) with a reversal potential of −27.2 ± 5.4 mV (n = 9). Moreover, when Cs+ was used as the major cation in the recording pipette, which blocks most leak potassium conductances including GIRK channels (Davila et al., 2003Davila V. Yan Z. Craciun L.C. Logothetis D. Sulzer D. D3 dopamine autoreceptors do not activate G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel currents in substantia nigra dopamine neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5693-5697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the mCPP induced inward current was still observed in arcuate POMC neurons (−14.5 ± 4.2 pA, n = 3). Collectively, these data suggest that mCPP activates a mixed-/nonselective-cation whole-cell conductance independent of afferent inputs which results in a direct membrane depolarization in arcuate POMC neurons. Leptin-induced inward currents in POMC neurons have recently been attributed to the activation of TRPC channels (Qiu et al., 2010Qiu J. Fang Y. Rønnekleiv O.K. Kelly M.J. Leptin excites proopiomelanocortin neurons via activation of TRPC channels.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1560-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Given the electrophysiological properties of the mCPP-activated current observed in the present study, we hypothesized that TRPC channels may also mediate the acute effects of mCPP on POMC neurons. To directly assess the role of TRPC channels in the mCPP-dependent depolarization of POMC neurons, we used the TRPC channel antagonists, SKF96365 (100 μM) and 2-APB (100 μM) (Qiu et al., 2010Qiu J.

https://openalex.org/W2162860740,"Previous studies of the ferret visual cortex indicate that the development of direction selectivity requires visual experience. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging to study the development of direction selectivity in layer 2/3 neurons of the mouse visual cortex in vivo. Surprisingly, just after eye opening nearly all orientation-selective neurons were also direction selective. During later development, the number of neurons responding to drifting gratings increased in parallel with the fraction of neurons that were orientation, but not direction, selective. Our experiments demonstrate that direction selectivity develops normally in dark-reared mice, indicating that the early development of direction selectivity is independent of visual experience. Furthermore, remarkable functional similarities exist between the development of direction selectivity in cortical neurons and the previously reported development of direction selectivity in the mouse retina. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that the development of orientation and direction selectivity in the mouse brain is distinctly different from that in ferrets."

Here, the contribution of this mitochondrial thioredoxin system to the control of H2O2 emission was studied in isolated mitochondria and cardiomyocytes from mouse or guinea pig heart. Energization of mitochondria by the addition of glutamate/malate resulted in a 10-fold decrease in the ratio of oxidized to reduced Trx2. This shift in redox state was accompanied by an increase in NAD(P)H and was dependent on TrxR2 activity. Inhibition of TrxR2 in isolated mitochondria by auranofin resulted in increased H2O2 emission, an effect that was seen under both forward and reverse electron transport. This effect was independent of changes in NAD(P)H or membrane potential. The effects of auranofin were reproduced in cardiomyocytes; superoxide and H2O2 levels increased, but similarly, there was no effect on NAD(P)H or membrane potential.

Folda A. Baldoin M.C. Scutari G. Bindoli A. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the heart, there may be an even more dramatic impact of TrxR2 on ROS emission and overall cell function due to the high rate of mitochondrial respiration in this organ. However, this possibility has yet to be investigated. This issue is relevant to human health, where uncontrolled mitochondrial ROS emission is increasingly recognized as a causative factor for many cardiac disorders (18Akar F.G. Aon M.A. Tomaselli G.F. O'Rourke B. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3527-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 19Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Akar F.G. Brown D.A. Zhou L. O'Rourke B. Int. J. Biochem.

Redox Signal. 2010; 13: 279-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and chronic (e.g. congestive heart failure) (23Zhang M. Shah A.M. Curr. Heart Fail. Rep. 2007; 4: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, although the expression of the enzymatic scavenger GSH reductase is highly conserved in aerobic life (24Ondarza R.N. Rendón J.L. Ondarza M. J. Mol. Evol. 1983; 19: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), its genetic knockdown results in viable mice (25Rogers L.K. Tamura T. Rogers B.J. Welty S.E. Hansen T.N. Smith C.V. Toxicol. Sci. 2004; 82: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Conversely, ablation of either the Trx2 or TrxR2 gene confers a lethal embryonic phenotype (26Conrad M. Jakupoglu C. Moreno S.G. Lippl S. Banjac A. Schneider M. Beck H. Hatzopoulos A.K. Just U. Sinowatz F. Schmahl W. Chien K.R. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Brielmeier M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9414-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 27Nonn L. Williams R.R. Erickson R.P. Powis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and cardiac tissue-restricted ablation of TrxR2 results in fatal dilated cardiomyopathy (26Conrad M. Jakupoglu C. Moreno S.G. Lippl S. Banjac A. Schneider M. Beck H. Hatzopoulos A.K. Just U. Sinowatz F. Schmahl W. Chien K.R. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Brielmeier M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9414-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). That Trx2 contributes to protection against oxidative stress is epitomized by the fact that its overexpression in human HEK-293 cells results in enhanced ΔΨm and increased resistance to oxidative stress induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (28Chen Y. Cai J. Murphy T.J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33242-33248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, Trx2 and TrxR2 play crucial roles in development and survival, and changes in this system likely contribute to cardiac dysfunction in response to oxidative stress. The relative contribution of the GSH and Trx2 systems in controlling ROS levels in the heart is still unclear. GSH is more abundant, with concentrations in the millimolar range (29Watson W.H. Yang X. Choi Y.E. Jones D.P. Kehrer J.P. Toxicol. Sci. 2004; 78: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whereas Trx2 is present at low micromolar levels (3Cox A.G. Winterbourn C.C. Hampton M.B. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 313-325Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown in brain and liver mitochondria that the GSH redox state became much more reducing when respiratory substrates were provided, explaining at least in part why energized mitochondria were protected from an extrinsic oxidative stress (30Garcia J. Han D. Sancheti H. Yap L.P. Kaplowitz N. Cadenas E. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 39646-39654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Whether mitochondrial energy status will alter the redox state of Trx2 (and thus the function of the TrxR2/Trx2 system) is currently unknown. Here, we investigated the possibility that TrxR2 controls H2O2 emission by controlling the levels of reduced (active) Trx2 and Prx3. Trx2 became more reduced upon provision of respiratory substrates. The TrxR2 inhibitor auranofin (AF) blocked the reduction of Trx2, increased the oxidation of Prx3, and increased emission of H2O2 from mitochondria but had no effect on the redox states of GSH or NAD(P)H. Similar effects were obtained when ventricular cardiomyocytes were treated with AF. Incubation of mitochondria with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB) also increased ROS emission but did so by depleting GSH levels in the absence of any effect on Trx2 or Prx3. Our study demonstrates that inhibiting TrxR2 alters mitochondrial redox balance and increases H2O2 emission. This occurs without altering GSH or NAD(P)H levels and without affecting energetics. Energized mitochondria display more reduced Trx2. The latter appears as a means of self-protection against oxidative stress while rendering the organelle less prone to H2O2 emission. Mitochondrial isolation and handling from guinea pig heart were performed as described (31Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Wei A.C. Grunnet M. O'Rourke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The same procedure was utilized for isolating mitochondria from mouse heart but with slight modifications (see supplemental “Methods”). Mitochondrial protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (BCATM protein assay kit, Thermo Scientific). NAD(P)H, GSH, and ΔΨm were monitored simultaneously with a spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology, Inc.) as described (16Aon M.A. Cortassa S. O'Rourke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 865-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). H2O2 was detected utilizing the Amplex Red kit from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) (16Aon M.A. Cortassa S. O'Rourke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 865-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Ventricular cardiomyocytes from guinea pig or mouse were handled as described (32Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Maack C. O'Rourke B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21889-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 33Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Marbán E. O'Rourke B. J. Biol.

Before imaging, cells were loaded with the fluorescent probes 5(6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA; 2 μm) and MitoSOX (2 μm) or with CM-H2DCFDA and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (100 nm) on the stage of the microscope and incubated for at least 20 min at 37 °C. H2O2 and O2⨪ were monitored simultaneously. To prepare mitochondrial extracts, mitochondria were suspended in buffer A (100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science)) and subjected to three sequential freeze/thaw cycles between an ethanol dry ice bath and a 37 °C water bath. Membranes were sedimented by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was recovered for further analysis. The protein concentration was obtained using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The activity of TrxR2 was determined using a modified version of the protocol published by Arnér and Holmgren (35Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Costa L.G. Current Protocols in Toxicology. 7.4. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 1-14Google Scholar), which excludes the use of BSA (BSA is known to bind and sequester AF). Briefly, ∼20 μg of mitochondrial extract was added to buffer A containing 3.33 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and 200 μm NADPH. The relative rate of reduction of DTNB at ΔA412 nm was recorded under base-line conditions or after the addition of increasing AF concentrations. Mitochondrial suspensions (100–200 μg of mitochondrial protein) were precipitated with ice-cold TCA (10%, w/v) for 1 h on ice. Samples were then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min; the pellet was further processed for determining Trx2 and Prx3 redox status, whereas after neutralization, the supernatant was utilized for quantifying GSH. Redox Western blotting was performed to determine the proportion of Trx2 that was either in the reduced (Trx(SH)2) or oxidized (TrxSS) form (36Go Y.M. Jones D.P. Curr. Protoc. Toxicol. 2009; 17.12: 1-12Google Scholar). The mitochondrial pellet after TCA precipitation was washed with acetone (−20 °C) and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min. Acetone was removed, and the pellet was solubilized in labeling buffer (670 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm AMS (Invitrogen)) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were precipitated as before with TCA and washed with acetone, followed by molecular weight separation by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with nonreducing loading buffer. Western blotting was performed using a rabbit anti-Trx2 polyclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution; AbFrontier) and an IRDye 800CW-labeled donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution; LI-COR Biosciences). A mouse anti-Prx3 monoclonal antibody (clone 12B, Abcam) was used at 1:2500 dilution. Secondary antibodies were used at a 1:5000 (goat anti-rabbit with Alexa Fluor 680 dye, Invitrogen) or 1:10,000 (donkey anti-mouse with IRDye 800CW, LI-COR Biosciences) dilution. The oxidized form of Prx3 (dimer) was confirmed by incubating samples with DTT (65 mm) and observing the collapse (∼90%) of the two dimeric bands into the bottom migrating band, which corresponds to the monomeric form of Prx3 (supplemental Fig. S4). Membranes were scanned using an Odyssey scanner (LI-COR Biosciences) with band densitometry performed using NIH ImageJ software (version 1.452q). The levels of both Trx(SH)2 and TrxSS were determined by integrated intensity after background subtraction from a blank portion of the membrane. The portion of reduced Trx2 was determined as the integrated intensity of Trx(SH)2/(TrxSS + Trx(SH)2). A similar procedure was utilized to quantify Prx3. The redox potential of the thioredoxin redox couple was calculated according to the Nernst potential. In the case of the couple TrxSS/Trx(SH)2, for the half-cell reaction Trx(SH)2 → TrxSS + H+ + 2e−, the redox potential is described by Equation 1 (37Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar), E=-304+RTnFlog([TrxSS]Trx(SH)2)(Eq. 1) where E stands for the electrochemical potential of the hemi-redox reaction of oxidized over reduced thioredoxin; −304 is the standard redox potential (expressed in millivolts) at 37 °C and 1 bar, adjusting the published value of −292 (at pH 7.0) to reflect the pH (7.2) utilized in our experiments with isolated mitochondria (13Halvey P.J. Watson W.H. Hansen J.M. Go Y.M. Samali A. Jones D.P. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); R is the universal gas constant; T is temperature in Kelvin degrees; n is the number of electrons required to reduce the oxidized form of the couple; and F is the Faraday constant that stands for the charge of 1 mole of electrons. RT/nF under our conditions is 61.51/2. The redox status of thioredoxin as the ratio (in percentage) of TrxSS to Trx(SH)2 was determined by redox Western blotting as described above (36Go Y.M. Jones D.P. Curr. Protoc. Toxicol. 2009; 17.12: 1-12Google Scholar). Thus, when the ratio is 80/20%, the redox potential is −285 mV. The supernatant of mitochondria after TCA precipitation was neutralized to pH 7.4 after the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. (Usually, 385 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was added to 200 μl of TCA supernatant.) The pH was verified with a pH indicator because the alkaline condition is crucial for GSH detection later. To quantify GSH in these samples, we utilized fluorescent labeling of thiols with N-(4-(7-diethylamino-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl)phenyl)maleimide and a method described previously (38Ayers F.C. Warner G.L. Smith K.L. Lawrence D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that we adapted to our conditions. This highly sensitive, non-enzymatic assay allows detection of picomole levels of GSH. N-(4-(7-Diethylamino-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl)phenyl)maleimide (60 μm) reacts quickly (within seconds) and specifically with GSH (with GSSG remaining undetected), and the fluorescent product was monitored with the spectrofluorometer at λex = 384 nm and λem = 475 nm. The rate of reaction of N-(4-(7-diethylamino-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl)phenyl)maleimide with GSH is linear within 10–50 nm (20–100 pmol of GSH). Additional controls showed that >85% recovery of GSH was possible when known amounts of the latter were subjected to the same procedure as the mitochondria. Previously, we measured the mitochondrial volume with a radioactive tracer method under state 4 respiration (∼2 μl/mg of mitochondrial protein) (31Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Wei A.C. Grunnet M. O'Rourke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Using this value and the amount of protein from which GSH was extracted, we could estimate its concentration in the matrix in the range of 1–1.5 mm. This value is similar to those found in brain mitochondria with glutamate/malate (∼2 mm, calculated using the mitochondrial volume above) (31Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Wei A.C. Grunnet M. O'Rourke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and appears reasonable considering the 2.7 mm intracellular GSH determined before in ventricular cardiomyocytes (32Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Maack C. O'Rourke B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21889-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated and handled under the same conditions described for analyzing H2O2 emission and the redox status of Trx2. Immediately after isolation, mitochondria (0.73 mg of mitochondrial protein) were incubated in the absence (control) or presence of 1 μm AF with assay buffer containing 5 mm glutamate/malate for 5 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. After incubation, mitochondria were centrifuged twice at 14,000 × g for 2 min, and the two supernatants (from AF incubation) were kept for further analysis. The mitochondrial pellets of both control and AF-incubated mitochondria were resuspended in water and subjected in parallel to three freeze/thaw cycles of 3 min each under the same conditions described above for preparing mitochondrial extracts. Thereafter, mitochondrial suspensions were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant and pellet from both control and AF-treated mitochondria were collected for further analysis. Samples (100 μl) from the two washout supernatants and after freeze/thaw, obtained from the AF-treated mitochondrial pellets, were diluted 1:10 with deionized water to give a working volume of 1 ml for ICP-MS analysis. The two pellets after freeze/thaw (both control and AF-treated) were dissolved in 2 ml of 60% aqua regia at 80 °C for 36 h and analyzed in full by ICP-MS. Gold analysis was carried out using a Thermo ICP-MS X7 series. The linearity in the response of the gold signal was calibrated with a set of gold standards at nanograms/ml, and the samples were analyzed four times with the ICP-MS system. We recovered 95% of the total gold (from AF) added initially (150 ng of AF). (The molecular weight ratio of AF to gold (679.5:197) is 3.45; thus, to determine the amount of AF, the gold in nanograms/ml is multiplied by 3.45.) Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software (version 3). The statistical significance of the differences between treatments was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance using Tukey's multiple comparison test. The kinetic parameters of the rates of H2O2 emission in the presence of inhibitors were determined through nonlinear regression analysis performed with a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (MicroCal OriginTM). AF ((1-thio-β-d-glucopyranosato)(triethylphosphine)gold 2,3,4,6-tetraacetate), DNCB, and DTNB were purchased from Sigma. CM-H2DCFDA, MitoSOX, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester, AMS, N-(4-(7-diethylamino-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl)phenyl)maleimide, and Amplex Red were obtained from Invitrogen. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. We first assessed the effect of inhibiting TrxR2 imparted by the two inhibitors (AF and DNCB) in heart mitochondria. The relative TrxR2 activity as a function of dose is shown in Fig. 1. AF strongly inhibited TrxR2 activity with an inhibition constant (IC50) of 8.7 nm and noticeable effects starting at 1 nm. Conversely, the effect of DNCB on TrxR2 was much weaker; at 10 μm DNCB, TrxR2 still had preserved >70% of its activity. Next, we tested the effects of inhibiting TrxR2 on H2O2 emission. Freshly isolated mitochondria from mouse or guinea pig hearts were preincubated with varying concentrations of AF or DNCB, and the rate of H2O2 release was determined (Fig. 2, A and C). In mouse mitochondria respiring under forward electron transport (FET; 5 mm each glutamate and malate), the presence of AF substantially increased ROS emission. The maximal rate of H2O2 emission (Vmax) and K0.5 (i.e. the amount of AF at which 50% of Vmax occurs) were 707 ± 65 pmol/min/mg of protein and 1.32 ± 0.5 nm, respectively (Fig. 2). Similar results were observed in mitochondria from guinea pig (Vmax = 994 ± 49 pmol/min/mg of protein and K0.5 = 4.8 ± 0.95 nm) (supplemental Fig. S1), where AF also produced a large increase in H2O2 emission under reverse electron transport (5 mm succinate) (supplemental Fig. S2). As a highly lipophilic agent, AF should be easily taken up by mitochondria. To ascertain this idea, we utilized ICP-MS to detect the presence of gold in the membrane and matrix fractions from isolated mitochondria treated with AF (1 μm). Following AF incubation, 80 ± 1.5% of the gold (from AF) was taken up by mitochondria. After ICP-MS analysis, we were able to recover 95 ± 2% of this gold fraction that was partitioned as follows: 14 ± 1.2% in the mitochondrial matrix and 84 ± 5% bound to membranes. Thus, due to its lipophilic nature, AF (probably through gold) remains largely attached to membrane, where it can inhibit TrxR2 vicinal to the membrane. In addition, a portion of it will enter the matrix, where it can interact with and inhibit the majority of TrxR2. DNCB also increased ROS emission from isolated mitochondria, albeit at concentrations much greater than for AF (Fig. 2C). Under FET conditions, DNCB produced ≈10-fold higher H2O2 emission from mouse mitochondria with a K0.5 ∼3 orders of magnitude greater than AF (0.93 ± 0.27 μm versus 1.32 ± 0.53 nm, respectively) (Fig. 2, B and D). Next, we tested whether, in addition to exacerbated ROS emission, inhibiting TrxR2 via AF may lead to impaired mitochondrial energetics and affect other scavenging systems, namely GSH. The increase in ROS release elicited by AF had no consequences for mitochondrial energetics or redox status. The dynamic responses of ΔΨm (Fig. 3, A and B), NADH (Fig. 3C), and GSH (Fig. 3D) in guinea pigs (Fig. 3, A and D) or mice (Fig. 3, B and C) were unaffected by 5 nm AF. The observed increase in H2O2 emission appears to be catalase-independent. Indeed, activation of the H2O2 flux by AF was not affected by aminotriazole (supplemental Fig. S5), a well known catalase inhibitor (39Drechsel D.A. Patel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27850-27858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 40Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar), thus ruling out a major role for this enzyme. These findings support previous reports showing that catalase is present in the low nanomolar range in mitochondria (6Radi R. Turrens J.F. Chang L.Y. Bush K.M. Crapo J.D. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22028-22034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus ∼3 orders of magnitude below the concentration of Trx2 (3Cox A.G. Winterbourn C.C. Hampton M.B. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 313-325Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Next, we tested the hypothesis that the redox status of Trx2 correlates with the energization level of the mitochondria and that this will be inhibited by AF. To this end, isolated mitochondria were treated with AF under non-energized (base line), state 4, or state 3 conditions. We then analyzed the redox status of the Trx2 pool in intact functional mitochondria with respect to controls run in parallel by redox Western blotting. This approach allowed us to set precise physiological conditions (e.g. energized versus non-energized) and to determine the effects on multiple variables related to mitochondrial energetics and redox balance. Because the reducing power of Trx2 is determined by the ratio of the oxidized to reduced form (TrxSS/Trx(SH)2), we calculated this ratio and expressed it as redox potential according to the Nernst equation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The redox potential of Trx2 decreased (became more reducing) from −322 mV at base line to −350 mV in state 4 and state 3 mitochondria (Fig. 4C). This corresponds to a 10-fold decrease in the ratio of oxidized to reduced Trx2 (Fig. 4A) and a 2.4-fold increase in the percentage of the Trx2 pool in the reduced form (Fig. 4B). In the mitochondrial matrix, Trx(SH)2 rose in parallel with NAD(P)H and GSH as well as ΔΨm after glutamate/malate addition (Fig. 3). Trx(SH)2 remained as high in state 3 as in state 4, although NAD(P)H was more oxidized in state 3. Excessive H2O2 emission resulting from TrxR2 inhibition would likely be due to oxidation of its downstream effectors. As such, we tested whether varying the concentration of AF or DNCB would affect the oxidation of Trx2 or Prx3 in respiring mitochondria. Furthermore, we also examined the level of GSH in these same samples. AF displayed a strong effect on the redox state of Trx2 (Fig. 5B) and Prx3 (Fig. 6A) but had no significant effect on GSH (Fig. 5A). However, the AF concentrations that resulted in these changes were higher than those that increased H2O2"
https://openalex.org/W2093807483,"Orientation selectivity (OS) is an emergent property in the primary visual cortex (V1). How OS arises from synaptic circuits remains unsolved. Here, in vivo whole-cell recordings in the mouse V1 revealed that simple cells received broadly tuned excitation and even more broadly tuned inhibition. Excitation and inhibition shared a similar orientation preference and temporally overlapped substantially. Neuron modeling and dynamic-clamp recording further revealed that excitatory inputs alone would result in membrane potential responses with significantly attenuated selectivity, due to a saturating input-output function of the membrane filtering. Inhibition ameliorated the attenuation of excitatory selectivity by expanding the input dynamic range and caused additional sharpening of output responses beyond unselectively suppressing responses at all orientations. This ""blur-sharpening"" effect allows selectivity conveyed by excitatory inputs to be better expressed, which may be a general mechanism underlying the generation of feature-selective responses in the face of strong excitatory inputs that are weakly biased."
https://openalex.org/W2003748392,"Synaptic vesicles belong to two distinct pools, a recycling pool responsible for the evoked release of neurotransmitter and a resting pool unresponsive to stimulation. The uniform appearance of synaptic vesicles has suggested that differences in location or cytoskeletal association account for these differences in function.

However, not all synaptic vesicles contribute equally to evoked release. At most synapses, only a fraction of the synaptic vesicles present take up external tracers with stimulation, and this fraction has been termed the recycling pool (Harata et al., 2001Harata N. Ryan T.A. Smith S.J. Buchanan J. Tsien R.W. Visualizing recycling synaptic vesicles in hippocampal neurons by FM 1-43 photoconversion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Even after prolonged stimulation, a large proportion of synaptic vesicles at most boutons do not undergo exocytosis (Fernandez-Alfonso and Ryan, 2008Fernandez-Alfonso T. Ryan T.A.

What accounts for the inability to release a large fraction of the synaptic vesicles at a presynaptic bouton? Resting pool vesicles may simply reside too far from the active zone, although previous work has shown that they intermingle with the recycling pool (Rizzoli and Betz, 2004Rizzoli S.O. Betz W.J.

Recent work has also suggested a role for regulation of the recycling pool by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) (Kim and Ryan, 2010Kim S.H. Ryan T.A. CDK5 serves as a major control point in neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2010; 67: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for extrinsic factors in pool identity, synaptic vesicles within a single bouton generally appear homogeneous, and multiple synaptic vesicle proteins localize in similar proportions to recycling and resting pools (Fernandez-Alfonso and Ryan, 2008Fernandez-Alfonso T.

Alternatively, intrinsic differences in molecular composition may account for the distinct behavior of recycling and resting pool vesicles. Previous work has indeed shown that synaptic vesicles recycle by multiple mechanisms (Glyvuk et al., 2010Glyvuk N. Tsytsyura Y. Geumann C. D'Hooge R. Hüve J. Kratzke M. Baltes J. Boening D.

Synaptic vesicle formation from endosomes depends on the endosomal heterotetrameric adaptor proteins AP-3 and possibly AP-1 (Blumstein et al., 2001Blumstein J. Faundez V. Nakatsu F. Saito T. Ohno H.

Although these pathways are all considered to generate the same synaptic vesicles, blocking the AP-1/3 pathway increases transmitter release at hippocampal synapses as well as at the neuromuscular junction (Polo-Parada et al., 2001Polo-Parada L.

Distinct endocytic pathways control the rate and extent of synaptic vesicle protein recycling.Neuron. 2006; 51: 71-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), suggesting diversion of synaptic vesicle components from a pathway that produces vesicles with a low probability of release to one that generates vesicles with a higher release probability. AP-3 (and AP-1) may therefore produce synaptic vesicles of the resting pool, and AP-2 vesicles of the recycling pool (Voglmaier and Edwards, 2007Voglmaier S.M. Edwards R.H. Do different endocytic pathways make different synaptic vesicles?.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This hypothesis predicts that since many synaptic vesicle proteins target in similar proportions to recycling and resting pools, they should use both AP-2 and AP-3 pathways. However, it also predicts that a protein preferentially dependent on one of these pathways should target more specifically to one of the pools and so differ from other synaptic vesicle proteins in its response to stimulation. To identify proteins that might depend more specifically on AP-3 for sorting to synaptic vesicles, we relied on observations made using AP-3-deficient mocha mice (Kantheti et al., 1998Kantheti P. Qiao X. Diaz M.E. Peden A.A. Meyer G.E. Carskadon S.L. Kapfhamer D. Sufalko D. Robinson M.S. Noebels J.L. Burmeister M.

Mocha mice show only a mild alteration in short-term synaptic plasticity, with no obvious reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles, or the localization of most synaptic vesicle proteins (Voglmaier et al., 2006Voglmaier S.M.

The actions of synaptically released zinc at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.Neuron. 2000; 26: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, a subset of synaptic vesicle proteins depend strongly on AP-3 for localization to synaptic vesicles. These include the zinc transporter ZnT3 and the tetanus toxin-insensitive vesicle-associated membrane protein (TI-VAMP or VAMP7), a v-SNARE implicated in membrane fusion (Kantheti et al., 1998Kantheti P.

We hypothesize that as proteins specifically dependent on AP-3, ZnT3 and VAMP7 may target to synaptic vesicles of the resting pool, and therefore with a low probability of release. To assess the availability of VAMP7 for regulated exocytosis, we fused the short, lumenal C terminus of VAMP7 to the modified green fluorescent protein ecliptic pHluorin (Alberts et al., 2006Alberts P. Rudge R. Irinopoulou T. Danglot L. Gauthier-Rouvière C. Galli T. Cdc42 and actin control polarized expression of TI-VAMP vesicles to neuronal growth cones and their fusion with the plasma membrane.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1194-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Shifted in its pH sensitivity relative to GFP, pHluorin exhibits essentially complete fluorescence quenching at the low pH inside synaptic vesicles (Miesenböck et al., 1998Miesenböck G.

Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins.Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar, Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000Sankaranarayanan S.

J. 2000; 79: 2199-2208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of pHluorin thus increases with exocytosis due to the increase in pH that accompanies exposure at the cell surface. The reacidification that rapidly follows endocytosis in turn results in fluorescence quenching, and alkalinization of the nerve terminal with a permeant weak base reveals the total pool of fluorescent protein. Transfected into hippocampal neurons, VAMP7-pHluorin colocalizes partially with the endogenous synaptic vesicle proteins SV2 and VAMP2 (Figure S1A available online), consistent with previous work localizing VAMP7 to synaptic vesicles as well as other endosomal membranes (Muzerelle et al., 2003Muzerelle A.

USA. 2006; 103: 16562-16567Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Alkalinization with the permeant weak-base NH4Cl increases the fluorescence of VAMP7-pHluorin (Figures 1A and 1B ), confirming expression within an acidic, intracellular compartment, and determination of the lumenal pH using the pHluorin fusions (Mitchell and Ryan, 2004Mitchell S.J. Ryan T.A. Syntaxin-1A is excluded from recycling synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4884-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) shows no difference between vesicles containing VGLUT1 and VAMP7 at synaptic sites (Figure S1B). The surface fraction of VAMP7-pHluorin is higher than for VGLUT1 (Figure S1C), but this does not reflect overexpression (Figure S1D), and previous work has shown a similar surface fraction for endogenous as well as transfected synaptic vesicle proteins VAMP2 and synaptotagmin 1 (Dittman and Kaplan, 2006Dittman J.S.

Klingauf J. Vesicular proteins exocytosed and subsequently retrieved by compensatory endocytosis are nonidentical.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Field stimulation increases the fluorescence of VAMP7-pHluorin at several boutons (Figure 1B), further supporting the localization of at least a fraction of VAMP7 to synaptic vesicles. However, identifying boutons simply based on their response to stimulation may exclude others that do not respond, even if they express VAMP7-pHluorin. On the other hand, identifying sites of intracellular VAMP7-pHluorin accumulation using NH4Cl will not discriminate between presynaptic and other sites where VAMP7 is known to localize (Coco et al., 1999Coco S. Raposo G. Martinez S. Fontaine J.J. Takamori S. Zahraoui A. Jahn R. Matteoli M. Louvard D. Galli T. Subcellular localization of tetanus neurotoxin-insensitive vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/VAMP7 in neuronal cells: evidence for a novel membrane compartment.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9803-9812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify presynaptic boutons in an unbiased manner, we used an internal ribosome entry site to coexpress a monomeric form of the fluorescent Cherry protein (Shaner et al., 2004Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E. Steinbach P.A. Giepmans B.N. Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Improved monomeric red, orange and yellow fluorescent proteins derived from Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar) fused to the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin (syp-mCherry). Syp-mCherry exhibits 78% ± 7% colocalization with endogenous SV2, 93% ± 4% with endogenous VAMP2, and 90% ± 4% with endogenous VAMP7 (Figure S2A). Identifying presynaptic boutons by mCherry fluorescence, alkalinization in NH4Cl reveals variable amounts of VAMP7-pHluorin at essentially all sites (Figures 1A and 1B), and after normalization to the total internal VAMP7-pHluorin, the response to stimulation is in fact quite small (Figures 1B and 1C). In contrast, VGLUT1-pHluorin shows a much larger response to stimulation at synapses identified in the same way (Figure 1C). Differences in the response of VAMP7 and VGLUT1 pHluorin fusions to stimulation could reflect differences in either exocytosis or endocytosis. VAMP7 undergoes endocytosis more slowly than VGLUT1 after the stimulus (Figures 1C and 1D), but increased endocytosis during the stimulus might reduce the response of VAMP7-pHluorin to stimulation. To assess this possibility, we used the vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin, which prevents the reacidification and quenching of pHluorin that follows endocytosis. In the presence of bafilomycin, the response to stimulation thus reflects only exocytosis. We found that even in the presence of bafilomycin, stimulation at 10 Hz for 60 s produces a much larger increase in fluorescence of VGLUT1-pHluorin than of VAMP7-pHluorin (Figure 2A ). Normalization to the total intracellular pool of pHluorin fusion revealed by NH4Cl shows that average recycling pool size is indeed much larger for VGLUT1 than for VAMP7 (Figure 2B). To compare a protein structurally similar to VAMP7, we also analyzed the v-SNARE VAMP2 and observed a much larger recycling pool for VAMP2- than VAMP7-pHluorin, consistent with a previous report (Fernandez-Alfonso and Ryan, 2008Fernandez-Alfonso T. Ryan T.A. A heterogeneous “resting” pool of synaptic vesicles that is dynamically interchanged across boutons in mammalian CNS synapses.Brain Cell Biol. 2008; 36: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The distribution of recycling pool size also differs markedly between VAMP7 and the other proteins, with many boutons showing little or no evoked response by VAMP7-pHluorin but very few if any boutons showing no evoked response by VGLUT1- or VAMP2-pHluorin (Figure 2C). The use of syp-mCherry expression to identify boutons in an unbiased way makes it unlikely that the distinct behavior of VAMP7 reflects expression at a subset of synapses. The hippocampal cultures contain predominantly excitatory synapses (85% ± 3%), but transfected syp-mCherry localizes to both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the same proportions (Figures S3A and S3B), further excluding bias in the selection of boutons. Importantly, endogenous VAMP7 also occurs in both synapse types (Figures S3C and S3D). To determine whether differences in recycling pool size might simply reflect differences in expression of the two proteins, we also analyzed recycling pool size as a function of total pHluorin reporter assessed in NH4Cl. Figure 2D shows that the difference between VGLUT1 and VAMP7 in recycling pool size persists over a wide range of expression levels. To determine whether the expression of VAMP7 might itself change recycling pool size, we used the styryl dye FM4-64 to assess release at synapses with and without VAMP7-pHluorin. Despite the reduced availability of VAMP7 for regulated exocytosis relative to VGLUT1 and other synaptic vesicle proteins including VAMP2 (Figures 2B and 2C), we found that the expression of VAMP7 does not affect either the rate or the extent of FM4-64 destaining (Figure 3A ). At boutons expressing transfected VAMP7, synaptic vesicles thus appear to cycle normally. In addition, cotransfection of untagged VAMP7 does not affect the proportion of VGLUT1 in the recycling pool (Figure 3B), and 86% ± 5% of VGLUT1-pHluorin+ boutons also express the transfected VAMP7 (Figure S2B). Further, the average time constant for exocytosis (τexo) and the distribution of τexo show no difference between VAMP7 and VGLUT1 (Figure 3C), suggesting that the VAMP7 that does respond to stimulation resides on the same synaptic vesicles expressing VGLUT1 and that the overexpression of VAMP7 does not influence their exocytosis. Consistent with this, the rates of evoked VAMP7 and VGLUT1 exocytosis show similar sensitivity to a range of external Ca2+ concentrations (Figure 3D). Although a proportion of VAMP7 localizes to the recycling pool of synaptic vesicles, a much larger proportion does not. Indeed, boutons with little or no response by VAMP7 show a normal response in terms of FM dye destaining and VGLUT1 exocytosis (Figures 3A and 3B), indicating that vesicle composition as well as behavior varies within a single bouton. VAMP7 also localizes to endosomal and lysosomal membranes at the cell body and dendrites, but it has been found to reside only on synaptic vesicles at boutons (Muzerelle et al., 2003Muzerelle A. Alberts P. Martinez-Arca S. Jeannequin O. Lafaye P. Mazié J.C. Galli T. Gaspar P.

USA. 2006; 103: 16562-16567Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), where we analyzed the data. We further confirm the localization of endogenous VAMP7 to membranes that behave like synaptic vesicles by both gradient fractionation and immunoisolation (Figure S4A–S4C). However, it remains possible that overexpression may result in mislocalization of VAMP7 to endosomes or lysosomes at presynaptic sites, and hence an apparent reduction in recycling pool size. To address this possibility, we expressed VAMP7 and VAMP2 as control fused at their lumenal C-termini to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Leal-Ortiz et al., 2008Leal-Ortiz S. Waites C.L. Terry-Lorenzo R. Zamorano P. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Piccolo modulation of Synapsin1a dynamics regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 831-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Localization of HRP within vesicles prevents diffusion of the HRP reaction product and thus unambiguously labels the VAMP7+ or VAMP2+ population. Both VAMP7- and VAMP2-HRP indeed label only a subset of synaptic vesicles that intermingle with unlabeled vesicles (Figure 4A ). In both cases, the HRP reaction product accumulates in small, round vesicles with the same diameter as unlabeled vesicles (Figures 4B and 4C), and not within any other compartment at or adjacent to the nerve terminal. Thus, VAMP7 localizes to membranes morphologically indistinguishable from synaptic vesicles. Resting pool vesicles do not apparently respond to field stimulation, but do they have the capacity for exocytosis under other circumstances? Previous work has suggested that evoked and spontaneous release may derive from distinct vesicle populations (Chung et al., 2010Chung C. Barylko B. Leitz J. Liu X. Kavalali E.T.

Groemer T.W. Rizzoli S.O. The same synaptic vesicles drive active and spontaneous release.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1454-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This predicts that as a protein enriched in the resting (and hence unresponsive) pool of synaptic vesicles, VAMP7 may undergo more spontaneous release than VGLUT1. To test this possibility, we used an optical assay for spontaneous release. Like bafilomycin, the H+-ATPase inhibitor folimycin prevents the reacidification of vesicles that have undergone exocytosis. However, folimycin is less cell permeant than bafilomycin, reducing its access to intracellular vesicles that have not undergone exocytosis (Atasoy et al., 2008Atasoy D. Ertunc M. Moulder K.L. Blackwell J. Chung C. Su J. Kavalali E.T. Spontaneous and evoked glutamate release activates two populations of NMDA receptors with limited overlap.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10151-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the presence of folimycin and tetrodotoxin (TTX), the increase in fluorescence of VGLUT1- and VAMP7-pHluorin should thus reflect spontaneous release (Figure 5A ). This increase in fluorescence is not due to leakage of folimycin into the neurons and alkalinization of vesicles that have not undergone exocytosis because it is greatly reduced by the high-affinity, cell-permeant calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (Figure S5A), consistent with the known calcium dependence of spontaneous release (Wasser and Kavalali, 2009Wasser C.R.

Neurosci. 2004; 5: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Six major neuronal cell types located in three cell body layers elaborate neuronal processes in a stereotypic fashion within the two plexiform layers (Masland, 2001Masland R.H. The fundamental plan of the retina.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, Sanes and Zipursky, 2010Sanes J.R. Zipursky S.L. Design principles of insect and vertebrate visual systems.Neuron. 2010; 66: 15-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In the IPL, the two main retinal pathways that respond to an increment (ON pathway) or a decrement (OFF pathway) in illumination are organized in spatially segregated layers. Over the past two decades, our knowledge of the genetic programs controlling neuronal cell type specification in the vertebrate retina has advanced greatly (Livesey and Cepko, 2001Livesey F.J. Cepko C.L. Vertebrate neural cell-fate determination: lessons from the retina.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, Ohsawa and Kageyama, 2008Ohsawa R. Kageyama R. Regulation of retinal cell fate specification by multiple transcription factors.Brain Res. 2008; 1192: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the cellular and molecular events required for the development of laminar organization in the retina are largely unknown. Further, the establishment of retinal lamination and its relationship to visual system function remain to be investigated. Current evidence implicates both adhesive and repulsive molecules in directing retinal neurite stratification and targeting in the IPL. For example, Dscams and Sidekicks, homophilic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), participate in lamina-specific neurite arborization within the chicken IPL (Yamagata and Sanes, 2008Yamagata M. Sanes J.R. Dscam and Sidekick proteins direct lamina-specific synaptic connections in vertebrate retina.Nature. 2008; 451: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, Yamagata et al., 2002Yamagata M.

DSCAMs in the mouse also regulate retinal neurite self-avoidance (Fuerst et al., 2008Fuerst P.G. Koizumi A. Masland R.H. Burgess R.W. Neurite arborization and mosaic spacing in the mouse retina require DSCAM.Nature. 2008; 451: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, Fuerst et al., 2009Fuerst P.G. Bruce F. Tian M. Wei W.

DSCAM and DSCAML1 function in self-avoidance in multiple cell types in the developing mouse retina.Neuron. 2009; 64: 484-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and two separate point mutations in DSCAM disturb process stratification of select neuronal subtypes in the murine retina (Fuerst et al., 2010Fuerst P.G. Harris B.S. Johnson K.R. Burgess R.W. A novel null allele of mouse DSCAM survives to adulthood on an inbred C3H background with reduced phenotypic variability.Genesis. 2010; 48: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A signals through the PlexinA4 (PlexA4) receptor to direct processes from select subtypes of murine retinal neurons to specific sublaminae within the IPL (Matsuoka et al., 2011Matsuoka R.L. Nguyen-Ba-Charvet K.T. Parray A. Badea T.C. Chédotal A. Kolodkin A.L. Transmembrane semaphorin signalling controls laminar stratification in the mammalian retina.Nature. 2011; 470: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, molecular cues that direct the targeting of the vast majority of neuronal subtypes to specific sublaminae within the IPL, or that serve more generally to segregate retinal neurites to either the IPL or OPL, have yet to be identified. Here, we show that the murine transmembrane repellents Sema5A and Sema5B together constrain the neurites of many inner retinal neurons to the IPL. In the absence of Sema5A and Sema5B, or the PlexinA1 and PlexinA3 receptors that mediate their function in the IPL, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) and amacrine and bipolar cell neurites that normally stratify in the IPL instead extend toward the outer retina, resulting in functional deficits in retinal responses to visual stimuli. To define cues that regulate the lamination of neuronal processes during retinal development, we first determined the expression patterns of Class 5 and Class 6 transmembrane semaphorins (Sema5A, 5B, and Sema6B, 6C, 6D) in the developing mouse retina (Figure 1; data not shown). We observed strong expression of Sema5A and Sema5B mRNA in the embryonic and early postnatal retina (Figures 1A–1H; data not shown; none of our own or commercially available Sema5A or Sema5B antibodies specifically stained mouse retinas). Sema5A and Sema5B exhibit very similar expression patterns, and both are expressed throughout early postnatal development when RGC dendrites, amacrine cell neurites, and bipolar cell axons arborize and make synaptic connections within the IPL. At postnatal day (P) 0 and P3, robust Sema5A and Sema5B mRNA expression is observed in the outer neuroblastic layer (ONBL) (Figures 1A–1F), directly adjacent to the inner neuroblastic layer (INBL), which we labeled with anti-Pax6, a marker for most RGCs and amacrine cells (Figures 1E and 1F). At P7, P10, and P14, the expression of both Sema5A and Sema5B becomes more restricted and is observed in the middle to outer part of inner nuclear layer (INL) (Figures 1G and 1H; data not shown). Sema5A and Sema5B transcripts are not detectable at P21, a time when retinal development is almost complete. The two class 5 semaphorins, Sema5A and Sema5B, are phylogenetically conserved membrane-bound semaphorin proteins and share an identical arrangement of semaphorin domains and thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) with an overall amino acid similarity of 72% (Adams et al., 1996Adams R.H.

Previous work has shown that Sema5A and Sema5B can act as guidance cues to either attract or repel processes belonging to different neuronal populations (Goldberg et al., 2004Goldberg J.L.

We generated mice harboring knockout alleles of Sema5A and Sema5B by targeting exon 6 of Sema5A and exon 2 of Sema5B, each of which encode the first 41 or 51 amino acids, respectively, of these proteins (see Figure S1 available online). Our Sema5A and Sema5B mutant mice lack full-length Sema5A and Sema5B proteins (Figures S1G and S1H). Unlike the early embryonic lethality observed in previously generated Sema5A null mice (in a mixed 129/NMRI genetic background) (Fiore et al., 2005Fiore R. Rahim B. Christoffels V.M. Moorman A.F. Püschel A.W. Inactivation of the Sema5a gene results in embryonic lethality and defective remodeling of the cranial vascular system.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2310-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we found that in a 129/C57BL/6 mixed genetic background, our Sema5A−/−, Sema5B−/−, and Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− mice are viable and fertile. This difference could be due to either the utilization of different targeting strategies and/or mouse genetic backgrounds. These results strongly suggest that our Sema5A and Sema5B mutant mice are null mutants. Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− mice exhibit severe defects in the stereotypic neurite arborization of multiple amacrine cell types. In Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− mice, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing dopaminergic amacrine cells, which predominantly stratify within the S1 sublamina of the IPL in wild-type (WT) retinas (Figure 1I), exhibit dramatic mistargeting within both the INL and OPL (Figure 1L). Similarly, vGlut3-expressing amacrine cells, which mostly stratify within the S2/S3 sublaminae of the IPL in WT retinas (Figure 1M), show severe neurite mistargeting within both the IPL and INL in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− mice (Figure 1P). In addition, AII amacrine cells (labeled with Disabled-1 [Dab-1]), cholinergic amacrine cells (labeled with choline acetyltransferase [ChAT]), calretinin-positive cells, and calbindin-positive cells all exhibit pronounced ectopic neurite extension toward the outer retina in these mutant mice (Figures 2A–2H ). Importantly, these defects are observed with full penetrance and expressivity in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− animals (n = 12 Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− mice; n = 12 WT mice). Sema5B−/− mice also exhibit neurite arborization defects involving these same neuronal subtypes (Figures 1K and 1O; data not shown), although these phenotypes are less severe than those seen in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− mice. Sema5A−/− mice, and also Sema5A+/−; Sema5B+/− mice, did not show defects in these same classes of retinal neurons (Figures 1J and 1N and Figure S2; data not shown). These results suggest that Sema5A and Sema5B play redundant roles in regulating multiple amacrine cell neurite arborization events in vivo. This is in contrast to our observations showing that Sema6A/PlexA4 signaling regulates neurite stratification of only a very small number of amacrine cell types, and serves to guide these projections toward, not away, from the inner retina within the IPL (Matsuoka et al., 2011Matsuoka R.L. Nguyen-Ba-Charvet K.T. Parray A. Badea T.C. Chédotal A. Kolodkin A.L. Transmembrane semaphorin signalling controls laminar stratification in the mammalian retina.Nature. 2011; 470: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, Sema6A and Sema5A/Sema5B serve distinct roles in directing amacrine cell neurites to their appropriate retinal sublaminae. We next assessed Sema5A and Sema5B control of neurite targeting in the early postnatal IPL in vivo. Overall retinal structure, visualized by anti-calbindin and the nuclear marker TO-PRO3, is apparently equivalent between WT and Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− mice prior to P2 (Figures 2I and 2J; data not shown). Starting around P3–P4, when both Sema5A and Sema5B are strongly expressed in the ONBL (Figures 1C and 1D), amacrine cell and RGC subtypes labeled with anti-calbindin in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− mice begin to extend neurites toward the ONBL (Figure 2L), a phenotype never observed in WT retinas (Figure 2K). This suggests that Sema5A and Sema5B prevent amacrine cell and RGC subtypes from extending neurites toward the ONBL. At P7, calbindin+ cell neurites in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas extend further within the INL, forming an ectopic plexiform layer that results in a discontinuity among the Pax6+ nuclei in the INL (Figures 2M–2P). A similar discontinuity is also observed in the INL of adult Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas, along with minor displacement of retinal cell nuclei within the IPL (Figures 2A–2H). Cholinergic amacrine cells and calretinin+ cells also extend aberrant neurites within the INL of Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas at P7 (Figure S3; data not shown), and as early as P3–P4 (data not shown). Therefore, Sema5A and Sema5B direct lamination of multiple retinal neurites to the IPL during early postnatal retinal development. We next asked whether Sema5A and Sema5B affect RGC dendritic arborization within the IPL in vivo. We crossed Sema5A−/−, Sema5B−/−, and Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− mutant mice to a previously described transgenic mouse line in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) is expressed under the control of thy1 regulatory elements (Thy1::GFP-M mouse line), sparsely labeling a diverse set of RGCs, including ON and OFF RGCs, and thereby allowing us to trace single RGC dendritic arbors (Feng et al., 2000Feng G. Mellor R.H. Bernstein M. Keller-Peck C. Nguyen Q.T. Wallace M. Nerbonne J.M. Lichtman J.W. Sanes J.R. Imaging neuronal subsets in transgenic mice expressing multiple spectral variants of GFP.Neuron. 2000; 28: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). In wild-type Thy1::GFP-M mice, nearly all RGCs exhibit dendritic arbors that are stratified within specific sublaminae (Figure 3A ). In contrast, ∼85% of GFP-labeled RGCs in Thy1::GFP-M; Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− mice have dendrites that arborize broadly within the IPL, extending into the INL, OPL, and, in a few cases, the ONL (Figures 3B and 3C; quantification in Figure 3D). GFP-labeled RGCs in Thy1::GFP-M; Sema5A−/− and Thy1::GFP-M; Sema5B−/− mice show much milder dendritic arborization deficits compared to Thy1::GFP-M; Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− mice (Figure 3D). M1-type melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells (ipRGCs), visualized here with an antibody directed against the N terminus of melanopsin, normally stratify within the outermost S1 sublamina of the IPL (Figure 3E) (Ecker et al., 2010Ecker J.L.

Kofuji P. Functional and morphological differences among intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas, M1-type ipRGC dendrites fail to stratify in the S1 sublamina and instead arborize in the INL and OPL (Figures 3F–3H). This same antibody directed against melanopsin clearly labels dendritic stratification of distinct ipRGC subtypes within two discrete domains of the IPL in P14 retinas (Figures 3E and 3I) (Ecker et al., 2010Ecker J.L. Dumitrescu O.N. Wong K.Y. Alam N.M. Chen S.K. LeGates T. Renna J.M. Prusky G.T. Berson D.M. Hattar S.

DSCAM and DSCAML1 function in self-avoidance in multiple cell types in the developing mouse retina.Neuron. 2009; 64: 484-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We found that dendritic stratification of ipRGC subtypes in distinct IPL sublaminae at P14 is selectively disrupted in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas; ipRGC dendritic stratification in the S1 sublamina (within the OFF layer) of the IPL is severely disrupted, similar to what we observed in adult Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas (Figures 3F, 3G 3I, and 3J). However, ipRGC dendritic stratification within the inner (ON) layers is not apparently different from that observed in Sema5A+/−; Sema5B+/− retinas (arrowheads in Figures 3I and 3J). In addition, Figures 3I′ and 3J′ show that neurites from calretinin+ cells, normally confined to three strata in control retinas, are selectively disrupted within the outer (OFF) layers, but not within the inner (ON) layers, of the Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− IPL. We found that earlier in retinal development, at P7 (Figure S3), and even as early as P3–P4 (data not shown), ipRGCs dendrites found normally within the OFF layer are misdirected into the INL of Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas. This is similar to the time course of certain amacrine cell neurite mistargeting events observed in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas (Figure 2 and Figure S3). Therefore, Sema5A and Sema5B constrain dendritic targeting of RGCs to the IPL in vivo, playing a more prominent role in regulating stratification within the OFF relative to the ON layers of the IPL. RGC dendritic targeting abnormalities in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas are not correlated with axonal projection abnormalities to retinorecipient brain targets; we find that all RGC axon central trajectories, as assessed by anterograde tracing, and ipRGC axonal projections to their major CNS targets, as assessed using a genetically encoded tracer (Hattar et al., 2006Hattar S. Kumar M. Park A. Tong P. Tung J. Yau K.W. Berson D.M. Central projections of melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells in the mouse.J. Comp. Neurol. 2006; 497: 326-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), reveal no defects in RGC axonal targeting to the brain (Figure S4). To determine whether Sema5A and Sema5B directly regulate neurite development, we asked if these cues affect neurite outgrowth in dissociated embryonic retinal neurons. WT embryonic day (E) 14.5 retinal neurons were cultured on top of a confluent monolayer of stable HEK293 cell lines expressing Sema5A, Sema5B, or harboring an empty expression vector. Based on neuronal morphological characteristics and also the developmental timing of retinal neuronal cell type generation (Byerly and Blackshaw, 2009Byerly M.S. Blackshaw S. Vertebrate retina and hypothalamus development.Wiley Interdiscip Rev Syst Biol Med. 2009; 1: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, Ohsawa and Kageyama, 2008Ohsawa R. Kageyama R. Regulation of retinal cell fate specification by multiple transcription factors.Brain Res. 2008; 1192: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), a majority of the neurons in our cultures included either RGCs or amacrine cells. The mean neurite length of retinal neurons cultured on the Sema5A- or Sema5B-expressing HEK293 cells was significantly shorter (∼50%–60%) than observed on control HEK293 cells (Figures 3K–3N). Thus, exogenous Sema5A and Sema5B inhibit retinal neurite outgrowth in vitro. Bipolar cells form synaptic connections with both amacrine cells and RGCs within the IPL (Masland, 2001Masland R.H. The fundamental plan of the retina.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, Wässle, 2004Wässle H. Parallel processing in the mammalian retina.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). In contrast to the organized distribution of bipolar cell axon terminals within the IPL, observed as vGlut1+ puncta in WT retinas, we found an ectopic band of vGlut1+ puncta within the INL of Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas (Figures 4A ′ and 4B′). These ectopic vGlut1+ puncta colocalized with the aberrantly projecting axon terminals of cone OFF bipolar cells labeled with anti-synaptotagmin2 (Syt2) (Fox and Sanes, 2007Fox M.A. Sanes J.R. Synaptotagmin I and II are present in distinct subsets of central synapses.J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 503: 280-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (Figures 4A, 4A″, 4B, and 4B″). Similarly, cone OFF bipolar cells labeled by anti-neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) (Haverkamp et al., 2003Haverkamp S. Ghosh K.K. Hirano A.A. Wässle H. Immunocytochemical description of five bipolar cell types of the mouse retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 455: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which normally establish axon terminals within the S1 sublamina of WT retinas (Figure 4C), also exhibit robust axon termination defects within the INL of Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas (Figure 4D). In contrast, rod ON bipolar cells labeled by an antibody directed against protein kinase C α (PKCα) (Haverkamp et al., 2003Haverkamp S. Ghosh K.K. Hirano A.A. Wässle H. Immunocytochemical description of five bipolar cell types of the mouse retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 455: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) exhibit normal axonal terminations within the appropriate ON sublaminae of Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas with the exception of a very few mislocalized axon terminals within the INL (Figures 4E and 4F). By immunolabeling with an antibody directed against calcium-binding protein 5 (CaBP5), which labels three distinct types of bipolar cells, including type 5 cone ON, type 3 cone OFF, and rod bipolar cells (Ghosh et al., 2004Ghosh K.K. Bujan S. Haverkamp S. Feigenspan A. Wässle H. Types of bipolar cells in the mouse retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 469: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we observed in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas that the CaBP5+ rod and cone ON bipolar cell axonal terminations within IPL ON sublaminae show little or no difference compared to WT (Figures 4G and 4H). However, type 3 OFF cone bipolar cell axonal terminations, which stratify within the S2 sublamina of the WT IPL (Ghosh et al., 2004Ghosh K.K. Bujan S. Haverkamp S. Feigenspan A. Wässle H. Types of bipolar cells in the mouse retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 469: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), are more disorganized, exhibiting ectopic axonal terminations within the S1 sublamina or the INL in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas (Figures 4G and 4H). These findings are consistent with the selective disruption of the OFF, but not ON, arbors of amacrine cells and RGCs in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas. We examined the OPL in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas using antibodies directed against calbindin (horizontal cells), vGlut1 (photoreceptor axon terminals), Goα (ON bipolar cells), and PKCα (rod bipolar cells), and observed normal OPL neurite stratification (Figures 4I–4N; data not shown). Although Sema5A and Sema5B can inhibit retinal neuron neurite extension, Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas do not exhibit defects in mosaic patterning or neuronal tiling of dopaminergic amacrine cells, ipRGCs, or AII amacrine cells (data not shown). Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas do not show significant differences in the abundance of retinal cell types as compared to control Sema5A+/−; Sema5B+/− retinas (Table S1). Therefore, the primary role of Sema5A and Sema5B is apparently to direct inner retinal neurite targeting. To address the functional consequences that might result from the neurite targeting defects in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− mice, we recorded light responses ex vivo from neurons in the GCL of Sema5A+/−; Sema5B+/− and Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas using a multielectrode array (Meister et al., 1994Meister M.

Consistent with previous studies (Rentería et al., 2006Rentería R.C. Tian N. Cang J. Nakanishi S. Stryker M.P. Copenhagen D.R.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the vast majority of spiking neurons that we recorded were RGCs based on their spike patterns. We found that the total number of RGCs that responded to whole-field increments or decrements in illumination (referred to hereafter as ON or OFF stimuli) was similar in Sema5A+/−; Sema5B+/− and Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas (n = 12 retinas from 6 animals for each genotype; n = 222 RGCs for Sema5A+/−; Sema5B+/−; and n = 248 RGCs for Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/−). However, Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas had ∼5-fold more RGCs that exhibit spontaneous neural activity but did not respond to whole-field stimuli (Figure 5A ; n = 103 RGCs for Sema5A+/−; Sema5B+/−; and n = 501 RGCs for Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/−). To analyze RGC light responses in more detail, we focused on 97 Sema5A+/−; Sema5B+/− RGCs and 92 Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− RGCs that exhibited responses to all light stimuli presented, including whole-field, local spot, random noise, and direction selective stimuli (see Figures S5 and S6 and Experimental Procedures for details). To determine if RGC ON or OFF light responses were differentially affected in Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− retinas, we distributed RGCs that responded to whole-field and local spot stimuli according to an ON-OFF index that quantifies RGC responses to these stimuli as a weighted difference between the maximal response amplitude following an increment or decrement in light intensity: RGCs that respond exclusively to the onset of illumination have an ON-OFF index of 1; RGCs that respond exclusively to the offset of illumination have an index of −1; RGCs that respond equally to both stimuli have an index of 0 (Figure 5B and Figure S5; see Experimental Procedures for detailed description of ON-OFF index calculation). Although Sema5A+/−; Sema5B+/− RGCs exhibit a relatively broad distribution of ON-OFF index values, Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/− RGCs exhibit a distribution that is heavily skewed toward ON responses, with very few OFF responses recorded (Figures 5D–5G; median ON-OFF index values for Sema5A+/−; Sema5B+/−, 0 in whole-field and −0.15 in local spot experiments; for Sema5A−/−; Sema5B−/−, 0.5 in whole-field and 0.35 in local spot experiments; p = 0.00042 for the whole-field response difference and p = 1.18E-09 for the spot response difference, Student's t test).

The excitotoxic loss of neurons following TBI occurs largely due to hyperactivation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), leading to toxic levels of intracellular Ca(2+). The axon guidance and outgrowth protein collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) has been linked to NMDAR trafficking and may be involved in neuronal survival following excitotoxicity. Lentivirus-mediated CRMP2 knockdown or treatment with a CRMP2 peptide fused to HIV TAT protein (TAT-CBD3) blocked neuronal death following glutamate exposure probably via blunting toxicity from delayed calcium deregulation. Application of TAT-CBD3 attenuated postsynaptic NMDAR-mediated currents in cortical slices. In exploring modulation of NMDARs by TAT-CBD3, we found that TAT-CBD3 induced NR2B internalization in dendritic spines without altering somal NR2B surface expression. Furthermore, TAT-CBD3 reduced NMDA-mediated Ca(2+) influx and currents in cultured neurons. Systemic administration of TAT-CBD3 following a controlled cortical impact model of TBI decreased hippocampal neuronal death. These findings support TAT-CBD3 as a novel neuroprotective agent that may increase neuronal survival following injury by reducing surface expression of dendritic NR2B receptors."

Aβ binds to microglia via a receptor complex that includes CD36 leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic reactive oxygen species and subsequent neurodegeneration. Interruption of Aβ binding to CD36 is a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. To identify pharmacologic inhibitors of Aβ binding to CD36, we developed a 384-well plate assay for binding of fluorescently labeled Aβ to Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human CD36 (CHO-CD36) and screened an Food and Drug Administration-approved compound library. The assay was optimized based on the cells' tolerance to dimethyl sulfoxide, Aβ concentration, time required for Aβ binding, reproducibility, and signal-to-background ratio. Using this assay, we identified four compounds as potential inhibitors of Aβ binding to CD36. These compounds were ursolic acid, ellipticine, zoxazolamine, and homomoschatoline. Of these compounds, only ursolic acid, a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid, successfully inhibited binding of Aβ to CHO-CD36 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The ursolic acid effect reached a plateau at ∼20 μm, with a maximal inhibition of 64%. Ursolic acid also blocked binding of Aβ to microglial cells and subsequent ROS production. Our data indicate that cell-based high-content screening of small molecule libraries for their ability to block binding of Aβ to its receptors is a useful tool to identify novel inhibitors of receptors involved in AD pathogenesis.

We have recently shown that Aβ binding to CD36 leads to formation of a receptor complex composed of CD36 and Toll-like receptors (TLR) 4 and 6 (11Stewart C.R. Stuart L.M. Wilkinson K. van Gils J.M. Deng J. Halle A. Rayner K.J. Boyer L. Zhong R. Frazier W.A. Lacy-Hulbert A. El Khoury J. Golenbock D.T. Moore K.J. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Binding of Aβ to this receptor complex is necessary for activation of microglia to produce ROS, RNS, and proinflammatory cytokines and for Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (11Stewart C.R. Stuart L.M.

Immunol. 2010; 11: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Aβ-induced microglial activation requires all three members of this receptor complex to be present because the absence of CD36, TLR4, or TLR6 significantly reduces Aβ-induced production of cytokines, RNS, and neurotoxicity (11Stewart C.R. Stuart L.M. Wilkinson K. van Gils J.M. Deng J. Halle A. Rayner K.J. Boyer L. Zhong R. Frazier W.A. Lacy-Hulbert A. El Khoury J. Golenbock D.T. Moore K.J. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). CD36 is an essential component of this signaling complex on microglia. We and others have shown that binding of Aβ to CD36 activates the downstream signaling molecules Src and Fyn and mitogen-activated protein kinase, p44/42. Inhibiting this CD36-mediated signaling abrogates ROS production, chemokine release, and subsequent microglial recruitment to amyloid plaques in vivo (12Moore K.J. El Khoury J. Medeiros L.A.

Based on these data, blocking the interactions of Aβ with CD36 is a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. For this purpose, we sought to identify pharmacological inhibitors of CD36-Aβ binding and used a high content approach to screen a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compound library to identify such inhibitors. High content imaging is an emerging technology that utilizes an automated microscope to capture cellular images from a large number of wells in a tissue culture plate. The images can subsequently be analyzed by imaging software to provide very detailed information about the cells in question. The technology has been used previously to find small molecule regulators of G protein-coupled receptors (14Oakley R.H. Hudson C.C. Cruickshank R.D. Meyers D.M. Payne Jr., R.E. Rhem S.M. Loomis C.R.

PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12958Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Using this approach we developed an assay to quantify binding of Aβ to CHO cells stably transfected with CD36. Using this assay we screened a library of FDA-approved drugs and identified ursolic acid as an inhibitor of Aβ-CD36 interactions. Our data suggest that cell-based high content screening (HCS) of small molecule libraries is an effective method for discovering novel pharmacologic inhibitors of receptors involved in AD progression and that ursolic acid has potential as a therapeutic agent for AD by its ability to block interaction of Aβ to CD36. Hilyte-Fluor 488 (HF488) human Aβ 1–42 was obtained from Anaspec (Fremont, CA). Soluble Aβ was prepared by dissolving in DMSO. DAPI, calcein, Cell Mask Deep Red, and Cell Mask Red were from Invitrogen. Black-sided, and clear-bottom 384-well plates were from Becton Dickinson. FITC was from Sigma. Human Aβ 1–42 (unlabeled) was from American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). Aβ was made fibrillar as described previously (8Coraci I.S. Husemann J. Berman J.W. Hulette C. Dufour J.H. Campanella G.K.

Briefly, 500 μg of Aβ was incubated with 100 μg of FITC dissolved in DMSO for 30 min with shaking at room temperature. The Aβ was then dialyzed against PBS to remove excess FITC and the protein concentration determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Human CD36 cDNA was obtained from Open Biosystems, and 5′ NotI and 3′ XbaI ends were added via PCR and cloned into pCDNA3.1+. CHO-CD36 and control vector-transfected CHO cells were generated previously in our laboratory (17Means T.K. Mylonakis E. Tampakakis E. Colvin R.A. Seung E. Puckett L. Tai M.F. Stewart C.R.

Briefly, 3 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected into CHO cells with Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown under geneticin selection, and positive colonies were picked, sorted by antibody staining, and confirmed stable by qPCR. CHO-CD36 and control vector-transfected CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep), and grown at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Cells were plated into 384-well tissue culture plates with Multidrop (Thermo-Fisher) automated liquid handler. CHO and CHO-CD36 were plated at 10,000 cells/well in triplicate in a 384-well plate, the plate was sealed with a gas-permeable plate sealer, and cells were allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, the medium was changed and replaced with 1 μm HF488 β-amyloid 1–42 (HF488 Aβ) in fresh medium. Uptake was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed in PBS using an automated plate washer for a total of four washes. For IN-Cell imaging, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and washed in PBS. The cytoplasm was stained with Cell Mask Deep Red according to the manufacturer's instructions, and nuclei were stained with DAPI. Plates were imaged with an In-Cell 1000 automated high content microscope (General Electric), with three fields taken per well. Image analysis was performed with In-Cell software (General Electric), and results were expressed as the average percentage of β-amyloid signal/well. t test statistical analysis was used, and a p value of <0.05 was considered significant. 1408 FDA-approved compounds, selected for their likelihood to cross the blood-brain barrier, were transferred using a robotic liquid handler into 22 columns a 384-well plate where columns 1–23 previously plated CHO-CD36 and column 24 contained CHO cells. Columns 23 and 24 had DMSO added at a concentration of 0.1%. Compounds were allowed to settle onto the cells for 30 min before HF488 Aβ uptake assay, and cell staining was performed as described above. Imaging of each well was done in triplicate by In-Cell, and “hits” were determined as being six times below the S.D. of the positive control column. Primary mouse microglia were isolated as described previously (18Hickman S.E. Allison E.K. El Khoury J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8354-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Brains from C57/BL6 mice were perfused with PBS/1 mm EDTA and chopped with double razor blades in Hibernate containing 2 mm EDTA without CaCl2 (BrainBits, Springfield, IL). Brains were triturated in MACS C tubes (Miltenyi Biotec, Columbus, OH) between incubations at 37C. The brain homogenate was passed over a 100 micron filter and separated by Percoll gradient. Microglia were isolated by CD11b magnetic bead binding (Miltenyi Biotec, Columbus, OH). CD36-CHO or primary microglia treated with either ursolic acid or volume equivalent of DMSO were resuspended in PBS/0.1% FBS. Anti-human CD36-PE, or isotype control IgM-PE (BD Pharmingen) for CHO, or anti-mouse CD36-Alexa 647 or isotype control IgG-Alexa 647 for primary microglia (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) was added at 1:100 for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with PBS/0.1% FBS and analyzed on a C6 flow cytometer (Accuri, Ann Arbor, MI). CD36-CHO or primary microglia treated with either 50 μm ursolic acid for CD36-CHO or 100 μm ursolic acid for primary microglia or volume equivalent of DMSO and RNA was harvested using a Micro RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 100 ng of RNA was transformed to cDNA using an Invitrogen first strand synthesis kit and qPCR for human CD36, mouse CD36, mouse or CHO GAPDH (see supplemental Fig. 1 for sequences), was performed on Lightcycler 480 (Roche Applied Science). Microglia or CHO cells were seeded in triplicate in a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, the medium was changed and replaced with 1 μm HF488 Aβ-containing medium, either with ursolic acid at 50 μm or the volume equivalent of DMSO. Uptake was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS and detached by scraping. To differentiate between internalized and cell surface-bound Aβ, we incubated the cells with trypan blue as described (19Thomas C.A. Li Y. Kodama T. Suzuki H. Silverstein S.C. El Khoury J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Trypan blue quenches extracellular fluorescence but does not affect intracellular fluorescence, allowing the quantification of internalized Aβ. Cells were analyzed on a C6 sampler flow cytometer. 1 μm HF488 Aβ was electrophoresed on a 4–16% NativePAGE or 10% reducing gel, transferred to PVDF using iBlot (Invitrogen), and probed for Aβ according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling Technologies). Densitometry was performed with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Cells were seeded at 0.1 × 106/well of an 8-well chamber slide and allowed to adhere for 48 h. 1 μm HF488 Aβ was incubated with the cells overnight. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI. Cells were imaged by epifluorescence microscopy at a magnification of ×40 using a Nikon Eclipse ME600 (Melville, NY). Cells were seeded at 0.5 ×106/well in a 48-well tissue culture plate and allowed to adhere overnight. Ursolic acid or the volume equivalent of DMSO was added to the wells in a dose-dependent manner and incubated for 2 h. The cells were washed with PBS. and 2 μm calcein, and 1 μg/ml DAPI were added to the cells for 30 min. Cells were washed and imaged at ×20 with appropriate filters, as described previously (6El Khoury J.B. Moore K.J. Means T.K. Leung J. Terada K. Toft M. Freeman M.W. Luster A.D. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) DAPI (blue)-stained cells were considered dead or dying, whereas calcein (green) cells were considered alive. N9 cells were seeded in triplicate of a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of ursolic acid or DMSO volume equivalent for 30 min followed by 50 μg/ml fibrillar Aβ and 100 μg/ml DHR 123 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped, and analyzed on a C6 sampler flow cytometer. We have shown previously that Bowes melanoma cells stably transfected with CD36 gain the ability to adhere to Aβ-coated surfaces (8Coraci I.S. Husemann J. Berman J.W. Hulette C. Dufour J.H.

To test whether CHO-CD36 are also capable of binding Aβ in solution we incubated these cells with 1 μm soluble HF488 Aβ for 2 h as described under “Experimental Procedures” and measured cell-associated Aβ by flow cytometry. As seen in Fig. 1A, CHO-CD36 cells had a 3-fold higher cell-associated Aβ compared with CHO cells (CHO, 5530 ± 409; CHO-CD36, 16,515 ± 892, p < 0.003). Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that HF488 Aβ was indeed cell-associated (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that similar to its ability to bind fibrillar Aβ, CD36 can also mediate binding to soluble Aβ. To determine the optimum length of time for HF488 Aβ uptake, and to provide the largest signal to background ratio between CHO-CD36 and CHO cells, we incubated these cells with HF488 Aβ and measured cell-associated Aβ at various time points using the In-Cell analyzer. As seen in Fig. 2, the best signal to background binding of HF488 Aβ to CHO-CD36 and CHO cells occurred at 2 h (p < 0.04). CHO-CD36 has 3-fold ratio over CHO of average percent amyloid-β signal/well (CHO 5.34 ± 0.51 CHO-CD36 16.64 ± 1.22). For this reason, all of the assays described below were performed for 2 h. To identify the concentration of HF488 Aβ that gives the highest signal to background ratio we incubated CHO and CHO-CD36 cells with increasing concentrations of HF488 Aβ and measured cell-associated fluorescence using In-Cell. As seen in Fig. 3A, 1 μm HF488 Aβ showed the highest ratio of CHO-CD36 to CHO cell-associated fluorescence.FIGURE 3Characterization of binding/uptake of CHO-CD36 cells to Aβ.

For this purpose, we incubated CHO and CHO-CD36 cells adherent to a 384-well plate with 1 μm soluble HF488 Aβ or fibrillar FITC-Aβ and measured cell-associated fluorescence. As expected, cell association of both soluble and fibrillar Aβ was quantifiable using In-Cell (HF488 Aβ p < 3 × 10−7, fibrillar FITC Aβ p < 0.01) (Fig. 3B). So, for all subsequent experiments cells were incubated with 1 μm HF488 Aβ for 2 h, and we measured cell-associated fluorescence using In-Cell. The reagents in the compound library to be screened are dissolved in DMSO, with a final concentration of 0.1% DMSO/well. To determine whether DMSO affects cell binding to HF488 Aβ, we incubated CHO and CHO-CD36 cells with 1 μm HF488 Aβ dissolved in increasing concentrations of DMSO and measured cell-associated fluorescence by In-Cell. Concentrations of up to 0.5% DMSO did not significantly affect association of HF488 Aβ with CHO or CHO-CD36 cells (Fig. 3C). To assess intra- and interplate variability in our In-Cell assay, we seeded CHO-CD36 cells in 23 columns of a 384-well plate, and CHO cells were seeded in the last column. We then added HF488 Aβ in 0.1% DMSO, Ham's F12, 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep to the cells using a robotic liquid handler and incubated the cells at 37 °C for 2 h and performed the assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In-Cell analysis of each column of CHO-CD36 cells showed a significant ability of these cells to bind HF488 Aβ over CHO cells (p value ≥ 0.00001 for each column over CHO) (Fig. 4), demonstrating good intra- and interplate robustness of the assay. This assay was performed in quadruplicate plates. CHO-CD36 cells were plated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and individual FDA-approved compounds (supplemental Table 1) were added to columns 1–22 of a 384-well plate at a concentration of 10 μm each. Columns 23–24 were spotted with an equivalent concentration of DMSO using a robotic liquid handler. Each compound plate was performed in duplicate. In-Cell analysis determined several hits as being below six times the S.D. of the positive control. These included ursolic acid, ellipticine, zoxazolamine, and homomoschatoline. Among these compounds of interest was ursolic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenic acid, which has previously been shown to bind to CD36 (20Ikeda Y. Murakami A. Fujimura Y. Tachibana H. Yamada K. Masuda D. Hirano K.. Yamashita S. Ohigashi H. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 4854-4864Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine whether the observed effect of ursolic acid was due to down-regulation of the expression of CD36 on CD36-CHO and primary microglia, we incubated these cells with ursolic acid, or volume equivalent of DMSO for the duration of the uptake assay (2 h). We then measured surface expression and mRNA levels of CD36 by flow cytometry and qPCR, respectively. As seen in Fig. 5A, surface expression of CD36 was not affected by ursolic acid treatment. Similarly, CD36 mRNA levels were also unaffected by ursolic acid treatment (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that ursolic acid does not down-regulate CD36 expression at the protein or mRNA level. To confirm that ursolic acid blocks binding of Aβ to CD36, we incubated CHO-CD36 cells with 1 μm HF488 Aβ and increasing concentrations of ursolic acid and measured cell-associated Aβ by flow cytometry. Ursolic acid blocked binding of Aβ to CHO-CD36 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). The ursolic acid effect started to plateau at 20 μm and reached maximal inhibition (∼64%) at a concentration of 100 μm (Fig. 6A). To determine whether ursolic acid blocks binding of both Aβ 1–40 and 1–42 to CD36, we incubated CHO-CD36 cells with HF488 Aβ 1–40 and HF488 Aβ 1–42 in the presence of 50 μm ursolic acid. At this concentration, ursolic acid blocked CD36-mediated binding of HF488 Aβ 1–40 by ∼50% and nearly completely blocked binding of HF488 Aβ 1–42 to CHO-CD36 cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6B), indicating that ursolic acid blocks binding of both Aβ 1–40 and 1–42 to CD36 albeit to different degrees. To determine whether the HF488 Aβ 1–42 used in our experiments was in monomeric, oligomeric, or large aggregate forms, we used native and denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Aβ antibodies and analysis by ImageJ densitometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 6C shows that >75% of our HF488 Aβ preparations were in oligomeric form between 4-mers and 7-mers. These data indicate that ursolic acid is a competitive inhibitor of binding of neurotoxic forms of Aβ to CD36. CD36 is a major microglial receptor for Aβ (6El Khoury J.B. Moore K.J. Means T.K.

To determine whether ursolic inhibits binding of Aβ to microglia, we incubated primary mouse microglia with 1 μm HF488 Aβ and 50 μm ursolic acid. Both primary microglia (Fig. 7A) and N9 microglia (Fig. 7B) bound significantly less HF488 Aβ in the presence of ursolic acid (p < 0.05). These data indicate that ursolic acid is a competitive inhibitor of Aβ binding to microglia and suggest that ursolic acid and/or its derivatives have the potential for use as therapeutics agents in AD. Binding of Aβ to CD36 induces production of ROS and cytokines (6El Khoury J.B. Moore K.J. Means T.K. Leung J. Terada K. Toft M. Freeman M.W. Luster A.D. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) to determine whether the concentrations of ursolic that block binding of Aβ to N9 microglia also inhibit Aβ-induced microglial activation, we incubated N9 microglia with increasing concentrations of ursolic acid and measured ROS production using the DHR 123 assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At concentrations of 20 μm or more, ursolic acid blocked Aβ-induced ROS production by N9 microglia (Fig. 7C). These data indicate that at concentrations that block binding of Aβ to microglia, ursolic acid also blocks activation of these cells by Aβ. These data further support a potential therapeutic role for ursolic acid and/or its derivatives in AD. Data shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate ursolic acid reduces binding of Aβ to N9 microglia. Because microglia can phagocytose and clear Aβ, and binding is necessary for phagocytosis to occur, inhibiting Aβ uptake and internalization by microglia may prove deleterious during plaque formation in the brain because it could lead to reduced Aβ clearance and increased accumulation. To test this possibility, we incubated N9 microglia with HF488 Aβ 1–42 and either 50 μm ursolic acid or the volume equivalent of DMSO and measured HF488 Aβ 1–42 uptake after 2 h. To measure the amount of internalized Aβ, extracellular fluorescence was quenched with trypan blue, and intracellular HF488 Aβ 1–42 was measured by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 8, internalization of HF488 Aβ 1–42 by N9 microglia is unaffected by ursolic acid. This suggests that the effects of ursolic acid are specific to CD36 and that Aβ binding to other known Aβ receptors such as SCARA-1 and the ability of these receptors to clear Aβ are not affected by ursolic acid. AD is a chronic degenerative disorder of the brain associated with a sterile inflammatory response. This response is believed to be caused by Aβ deposition and microglial activation, ultimately leading to neuronal degeneration and decreased cognitive abilities and dementia (3Akiyama H. Barger S.

In this study, we sought to develop a method to identify inhibitors of Aβ-CD36 interactions and successfully used a HCS approach for this purpose. HCS uses a powerful automated fluorescent microscope to capture a large number of images per field, allowing thousands of cells to be imaged in one experiment (22Giuliano K.A. Haskins J.R. Taylor D.L. ASSAY Drug Dev. Technol. 2003; 1: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The resulting data can be resolved into single cell analyses allowing a detailed examination of the effects of treatments on the cells. The advantage of this method over high throughput screening includes the ability to review a series of images and reanalyze them without having to repeat large datasets. Our results presented here support the benefits of this approach to identify inhibitors of Aβ binding to CHO-CD36 cells. The Aβ binding/uptake assay was successfully miniaturized to a 384-well plate format and tested for reproducibility and sensitivity. As proof of concept, we tested the feasibility of such an HCS approach using an FDA-approved library of compounds specially selected for their likelihood of penetrating the blood-brain barrier. From the compound library we identified ursolic acid as an inhibitor of CD36-Aβ interactions. We validated our findings using flow cytometry. We found that at concentrations ≤100 μm, ursolic acid successfully blocked the binding of Aβ to CHO-CD36 cells and to primary microglia. This inhibition of Aβ binding was not due to down-regulation of surface CD36 expression, nor was the mRNA level of CD36 affected. The ability of the microglia to bind to Aβ was decreased upon treatment with ursolic acid; however, this treatment did not eliminate uptake of Aβ by the cell, as observed in Fig. 8, indicating that ursolic acid blocks CD36-mediated Aβ signaling and ROS production without affecting the ability of other scavenger receptors such as SCARA-1, also expressed on the surface of microglia to bind and mediate uptake and clearance of Aβ. Ursolic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid found occurring naturally in a variety of edible and medicinal plants such as rosemary (23Tokuda H. Ohigashi H. Koshimizu K. Ito Y. Cancer Lett. 1986; 33: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Ursolic acid has long been known to have anti-inflammatory properties, as previous studies have shown inhibition of inflammation in arthritis and dermatitis models with ursolic acid treatment (21Máñez S. Recio M.C. Giner R.M. Ríos J.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 334: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Kang S.Y. Yoon S.Y. Roh D.H. Jeon M.J. Seo H.S. Uh D.K. Kwon Y.B. Kim H.W. Han H.J.

Although our results need to be validated in vivo using a mouse model of AD, to our knowledge this is the first report that describes a role for ursolic acid in blocking the interaction of Aβ with microglia and to suggest a potential use for this compound and/or its derivatives for treatment of AD. This is also the first development and optimization of a HCS to investigate small molecule inhibitors of uptake/binding of Aβ to microglial receptors. Because no effective treatments exist to delay or stop progression of AD and because ursolic acid is a prototypic member of a large family of naturally occurring compounds, our data provide a molecular basis for exploring the potential use of ursolic acid and/or its derivatives for therapy of this devastating disorder.

https://openalex.org/W2007848144,"To investigate the mechanism of regulation of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) by phospholamban (PLB), we expressed Cerulean-SERCA and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-PLB in adult rabbit ventricular myocytes using adenovirus vectors. SERCA and PLB were localized in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and were mobile over multiple sarcomeres on a timescale of tens of seconds. We also observed robust fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from Cerulean-SERCA to YFP-PLB. Electrical pacing of cardiac myocytes elicited cytoplasmic Ca(2+) elevations, but these increases in Ca(2+) produced only modest changes in SERCA-PLB FRET. The data suggest that the regulatory complex is not disrupted by elevations of cytosolic calcium during cardiac contraction (systole). This conclusion was also supported by parallel experiments in heterologous cells, which showed that FRET was reduced but not abolished by calcium. Thapsigargin also elicited a small decrease in PLB-SERCA binding affinity. We propose that PLB is not displaced from SERCA by high calcium during systole, and relief of functional inhibition does not require dissociation of the regulatory complex. The observed modest reduction in the affinity of the PLB-SERCA complex with Ca(2+) or thapsigargin suggests that the binding interface is altered by SERCA conformational changes. The results are consistent with multiple modes of PLB binding or alternative binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2133880037,"Dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge is required for directed cell migration. Cofilin, a small actin-binding protein with F-actin severing activities, is a key enzyme initiating such actin remodeling processes. Cofilin activity is tightly regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events that are mediated by LIM kinase (LIMK) and the phosphatase slingshot (SSH), respectively. Protein kinase D (PKD) is a serine/threonine kinase that inhibits actin-driven directed cell migration by phosphorylation and inactivation of SSH. Here, we show that PKD can also regulate LIMK through direct phosphorylation and activation of its upstream kinase p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4). Therefore, active PKD increases the net amount of phosphorylated inactive cofilin in cells through both pathways. The regulation of cofilin activity at multiple levels may explain the inhibitory effects of PKD on barbed end formation as well as on directed cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W1965733051,"Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) is a splicing factor whose improper cellular localization is a central component of myotonic dystrophy. In myotonic dystrophy, the lack of properly localized MBNL1 leads to missplicing of many pre-mRNAs. One of these events is the aberrant inclusion of exon 5 within the MBNL1 pre-mRNA. The region of the MBNL1 gene that includes exon 5 and flanking intronic sequence is highly conserved in vertebrate genomes. The 3'-end of intron 4 is non-canonical in that it contains a predicted branch point that is 141 nucleotides from the 3'-splice site and an AAG 3'-splice site. Using a minigene that includes exon 4, intron 4, exon 5, intron 5, and exon 6 of MBNL1, we showed that MBNL1 regulates inclusion of exon 5. Mapping of the intron 4 branch point confirmed that branching occurs primarily at the predicted distant branch point. Structure probing and footprinting revealed that the highly conserved region between the branch point and 3'-splice site is primarily unstructured and that MBNL1 binds within this region of the pre-mRNA. Deletion of the MBNL1 response element eliminated MBNL1 splicing regulation and led to complete inclusion of exon 5, which is consistent with the suppressive effect of MBNL1 on splicing."

https://openalex.org/W2028164195,"Changes in food availability alter the output of hypothalamic nuclei that underlie energy homeostasis. Here, we asked whether food deprivation impacts the ability of GABA synapses in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), an important integrator of satiety signals, to undergo activity-dependent changes. GABA synapses in DMH slices from satiated rats exhibit endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (LTDGABA) in response to high-frequency stimulation of afferents. When CB1Rs are blocked, however, the same stimulation elicits long-term potentiation (LTPGABA), which manifests presynaptically and requires heterosynaptic recruitment of NMDARs and nitric oxide (NO). Interestingly, NO signaling is required for eCB-mediated LTDGABA. Twenty-four hour food deprivation results in a CORT-mediated loss of CB1R signaling and, consequently, GABA synapses only exhibit LTPGABA. These observations indicate that CB1R signaling promotes LTDGABA and gates LTPGABA. Furthermore, the satiety state of an animal, through regulation of eCB signaling, determines the polarity of activity-dependent plasticity at GABA synapses in the DMH."

Both events led to enhanced detection of PrP aggregates and a significant increase of PrPSc in persistently prion-infected cells, which could be reversed by overexpression of proteins of the cellular quality control.

Increasing evidence suggests that events taking place in these compartments play a modulating role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders (reviewed in Refs. 15Lindholm D. Wootz H.

Besides processing, folding, and post-translational modification of nascent proteins, ER exerts a stringent quality control that ensures that only those molecules that undergo correct maturation reach their target cellular compartments. Incorrectly assembled proteins are normally retained in the ER and subjected to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This includes retrograde translocation through the ER membrane into the cytosol, deglycosylation, and covalent binding to ubiquitin by its lysine residues. Proteins are thereby marked for degradation by the 26 S proteasome complex (17Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A.

Accumulation of misfolded proteins and alteration of ER homeostasis lead to perturbation of ER functions and ER stress, defined as an imbalance between the cellular demand for ER function and ER capacity to cope with excessive protein load. To reduce this excessive burden, cells trigger the unfolded protein response, which signals attenuation of protein translation, up-regulation of molecular chaperones and folding enzymes, and degradation of malfolded proteins by ERAD (18Shen X.

Impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasomal system (UPS) can contribute to ER stress, whereas the UPS itself has been shown to be compromised during acute ER stress (20Menéndez-Benito V. Verhoef L.G.

Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). These molecules might represent ERAD substrates retro-translocated from the ER or arise during acute ER dysfunctions, when a pre-emptive quality control prevents translocation of PrP molecules into the ER and promotes their degradation by the proteasome as a defense mechanism against protein overflow (31Kang S.W.

Upon ER stress, misfolded PrP molecules were described to reach the plasma membrane and increase the rate of PrPSc replication when used as a substrate for protein misfolding cyclic amplification (35Hetz C. Castilla J. Soto C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12725-12733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the involvement of proteasome and ER homeostasis in PrPc processing in the secretory pathway, and in PrPSc propagation in persistently prion-infected cells. We performed studies in different cell lines with physiological, endogenous expression of PrPc or transfected with PrPc. Inhibition of proteasomal activity as well as induction of ER stress significantly affected the total level of PrPc. This resulted in accumulation of aggregated PrP species, which were extensively transported through the secretory pathway to the cell surface. Under these conditions, we detected a significant increase of PrPSc levels in chronically prion-infected cells. Conversely, overexpression of selected molecules of the cellular quality control decreased the accumulation of both aggregated species and PrPSc. Further, we show that deletion of the N-terminal and central domain of PrPc reduced the capacity of the cellular quality control to interact with PrP. These results evidence a new correlation between failures in cellular quality control and PrPSc propagation indicating that misfolded prion protein, which should be a substrate for ERAD degradation, can be recycled to the secretory pathway and become an additional substrate for PrPSc formation. Overall, these studies add to the understanding of molecular requirements for cellular prion propagation and point to mechanisms that also might play a role in prion de novo generation as relevant in sporadic prion diseases.

Briefly, hippocampi were excised, incubated with trypsin, and rinsed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) complemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Single cell suspensions were obtained by mechanical dissociation. Approximately 1.5 × 106 viable cells were plated in poly-l-lysine-coated 6-well plates in neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 and antibiotics (Invitrogen). Amounts (10 μm) of the antimitotics uridine and fluorodeoxyuridine (Sigma) were added to prevent astrocyte proliferation. Each week, one-third of the medium was replaced with fresh medium. 1 mm EDTA was applied to cultured cells to detach them from dishes. Cells were counted and subsequently centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 rpm and then lysed in cold lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate). Post-nuclear lysates were supplemented with 0.5 mm Pefabloc protease inhibitor prior to precipitation with methanol. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 2.500 × g, and the pellets were re-dissolved in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) with the addition of gel loading buffer (7% SDS, 30% glycerin, 20% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Bromphenol Blue in 90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). After boiling for 10 min at 95 °C, aliquots from equal cell numbers were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Membranes were blocked with nonfat dry milk (5%) in TBST (0.05% Tween 20, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8), incubated overnight with appropriate antibody at 4 °C, as indicated, and stained using an enhanced chemiluminescence blotting kit from GE Healthcare. For solubility assay, post-nuclear cell lysates were supplemented with 0.5 mm Pefabloc protease inhibitor and N-lauryl sarcosine to 1%, and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge. Soluble fractions (supernatant) were precipitated with methanol. Insoluble fractions (pellet) were resuspended in TNE and analyzed in immunoblot or radioimmune precipitation assays. When necessary, samples were treated with 0.1 unit/μl peptide N-glycosidase F at 37 °C overnight to remove N-linked oligosaccharides and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were exposed to an x-ray film (Kodak). Aliquots of post-nuclear lysates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml proteinase K (PK); the proteolysis was stopped by addition of protease inhibitor Pefabloc. Samples were precipitated with methanol and analyzed in an immunoblot assay. For detection of PrP surface expression in compound-treated cells, 1 mm EDTA was applied to detach cells from dishes. Cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 rpm and 4 °C, and then resuspended in FACS buffer (2.5% FCS, 0.05% sodium azide, in PBS) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cells were incubated with mAb 4H11 (1:10) in FACS buffer for 45 min on ice and washed three times with FACS buffer. Secondary antibodies (FITC-labeled, Dianova) were incubated for 45 min on ice. After washing with FACS buffer, 7-aminoactinomycin D was added for staining of dead cells. For detection of intracellular PrP, cells were fixed in Roti-Histofix 4% (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), and the following steps were performed in saponin- buffer (0.1% in FACS buffer). Flow cytometry was performed in a FACS Canto II cell sorter from BD Biosciences. N2a or HpL3-4 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips (Marienfeld, Lauda-Königshofen, Germany) at low density 1–3 days prior to staining. 24 h after seeding, HpL3-4 cells were transiently transfected with wtPrP. 16 h before fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde, DMSO, MG132, or tunicamycin were added to the culture medium. After sequential treatment for 10 min each with 50 mm NH4Cl/20 mm glycine, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2% gelatine, mAb 4H11 was added in gelatine for 30 min at room temperature for detection of PrP molecules, while specific antibodies against molecules of the Golgi compartment and ER (as described above) were applied. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antisera obtained from Invitrogen. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Germany) before mounting the slides on anti-fading solution (Mowiol/DABCO, Roth) and kept at 4 °C. Confocal laser scanning was carried out using a Fluoview FV10i LSM 510 laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, a protocol was adapted from Jin and colleagues (45Jin T. Gu Y. Zanusso G. Sy M. Kumar A. Cohen M. Gambetti P. Singh N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38699-38704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected HpL3-4 cells were treated for 16 h with 5 μm MG132 or 2.5 μg/ml tunicamycin, and then washed with PBS and lysed on ice in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4. A mixture of protease inhibitors was added immediately after lysis. Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 800 × g, and PrP was precipitated from clarified cell lysates with mAb 4H11 for 3 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the protein-antibody complexes for 90 min at 4 °C. Complexes bound to protein A-agarose were washed with a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1% N-lauryl sarcosine, and 0.1% Pefabloc, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer. Precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and developed with the indicated antibodies for detection of proteins bound to PrP. Membrane preparation was performed according to a previous study (46Ganley I.G. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17890-17899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). HpL3-4 cells transiently transfected with wtPrP or deletion constructs were rinsed three times in PBS and once in Hepes 10 mm, pH 7.4, and then incubated for 15 min in Hepes supplemented with protease inhibitors, on ice. Cells were scraped off in homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and homogenized with a 22-gauge needle. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C and 3,000 × g, the post-nuclear supernatant were then spun for 15 min at 100,000 × g and 4 °C in a TL 100.2 rotor centrifuge. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was removed, and the pellets (membrane fraction) were resuspended in homogenization buffer. Proteins were analyzed with 4H11 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Surface localization of PrPc and aggregates was assessed by biotinylation. Upon reaching 70–80% confluence, transiently transfected HpL3-4 cells were rinsed with cold PBS. After 20-min incubation on ice with 250 μg/ml membrane-impermeable Sulfo-biotin-X-NHS (Pierce), the cells were rinsed with cold PBS. Cells were incubated with 20 mm glycine/50 mm NH4Cl 10 min on ice for quenching and rinsed again with cold PBS before harvesting with lysis buffer on ice. Post-nuclear lysates were subjected to solubility assay as described. Insoluble fractions were resuspended in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate in PBS) supplemented with 1% SDS before boiling at 95 °C for 10 min then brought to 1000 μl with lysis buffer and supplemented with Pefabloc and N-lauryl sarcosine to 1%. All samples were incubated with mAb 4H11 (1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the protein-antibody complexes for 90 min at 4 °C. Immunoadsorbed proteins were washed in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with 1% SDS at 4 °C and subsequently boiled in gel loading buffer to recover precipitated PrP before analysis by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Photodensitometric analysis of immunoblots was performed using the ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). Quantitative data are shown as mean ± S.D. For evaluation of statistical significance of the data, we used Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) and applied the paired t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered as significant. In line with the work done by other groups, we set out to analyze how proteasomal dysfunction and ER stress are involved in the processing and turnover of PrPc in cell culture models, thereby focusing on PrP in the secretory pathway. Perturbation of cellular environment and clearance pathways can lead to accumulation of misfolded, aggregated PrP species. Conventionally, aggregation of PrP molecules is evaluated by their solubility in non-ionic detergent upon high speed centrifugation of cell lysates. For this purpose, mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells expressing endogenous PrP were treated for 16 h with the proteasomal inhibitors MG132 or lactacystin (5 μm) or ER stress was induced with tunicamycin (2,5 μg/ml), an agent that prevents N-glycosylation, or with thapsigargin (1 μm), which depletes ER-Ca2+. Upon lysis, we performed ultracentrifugation in the presence of 1% Sarkosyl to separate aggregated proteins in the pellets from soluble ones in the supernatants. Soluble and insoluble PrP levels in post-nuclear lysates of equal number of cells upon treatment were visualized in immunoblot analysis with anti-PrP mAb 4H11 (Fig. 1A). Induction of ER stress was verified by detection of the specific markers Grp78/BiP and GAD153/CHOP (Fig. 1A, lower panels), whereas analysis of cells transfected with a vector coding for a GFP-tagged reporter for proteasomal activity confirmed proteasomal impairment upon MG132 treatment (data not shown). In mock treated cells, PrP partitioned mainly in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 5). Conversely, all compounds used increased formation of aggregated PrP molecules (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–4 and 10). As expected, tunicamycin-induced aggregates were unglycosylated PrP (Fig. 1A, lane 2), whereas MG132 and lactacystin led to accumulation of insoluble PrP molecules comprising mainly fully glycosylated isoforms (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 10). For better comparison of the signals, proteins were deglycosylated with peptide N-glycosidase F in an additional experiment (Fig. 1, B and C), and comparable results were obtained with L929 fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. S1). Taken together, these studies confirm that induction of acute ER stress as well as inhibition of proteasomal degradation lead to an extensive accumulation of detergent-insoluble PrP aggregates in all cell lines tested here. In a subsequent set of experiments we monitored the repercussion of proteasomal impairment and ER stress on the expression levels of total cellular PrP. We therefore treated L929 fibroblasts expressing endogenous PrP for 16 h with MG132, tunicamycin, lactacystin, or thapsigargin and visualized PrP amount in post-nuclear lysates of equal number of cells in immunoblot analysis with mAb 4H11 (Fig. 2A). Up-regulation of Grp78/BiP (Fig. 2A, lower panels) confirmed ER stress induction. In tunicamycin- and thapsigargin-treated cells PrP levels were attenuated compared with mock treated cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 2, and 5). Conversely, treatment with MG132 or lactacystin led to a significant increase of all PrP-glycoforms in the tested cell line (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). These findings were verified in HpL3-4 mouse hippocampal cells transiently transfected with PrPc and primary hippocampal neurons of C57BL/6 mice in immunoblot (Fig. 2A, lower part) and in FACS analysis in N2a (Fig. 2, B and C), L929, and HpL3-4 (data not shown) cells. We subsequently confirmed that the increase in cellular PrPc was not due to up-regulation of PrP mRNA levels by comparing the relative transcript levels by real-time PCR (supplemental Fig. S1). Taken together, these studies show that ER stress and proteasomal impairment affect cellular PrP levels in different ways. The findings described so far confirm once again the importance of the early secretory pathway for PrP metabolism. Our subsequent experiments concentrated on the cellular localization where PrP aggregates accumulate under these conditions. We therefore investigated PrP localization in confocal microscopy studies (Fig. 3). N2a cells were treated with tunicamycin or MG132 for 16 h and stained with 4H11 for detection of PrP, after permeabilization. As expected, in mock treated cells, PrP showed the characteristic surface localization (Fig. 3, a–c). Interestingly, upon induction of ER stress, cell surface localization"

In this study, we found that expressing polyQ-htt in neuronal cultures significantly decreased the amplitude and frequency of AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC), while expressing wild-type huntingtin (WT-htt) increased mEPSC. AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission was also impaired in a transgenic mouse model of HD expressing polyQ-htt. The effect of polyQ-htt on mEPSC was mimicked by knockdown of HAP1 and occluded by the dominant negative HAP1. Moreover, we found that huntingtin affected mESPC via a mechanism depending on the kinesin motor protein, KIF5, which controls the transport of GluR2-containing AMPARs along microtubules in dendrites. The GluR2/KIF5/HAP1 complex was disrupted and dissociated from microtubules in the HD mouse model. Together, these data suggest that AMPAR trafficking and function is impaired by mutant huntingtin, presumably due to the interference of KIF5-mediated microtubule-based transport of AMPA receptors.

We observed a striking and selective up-regulation in the binding of a recombinant soluble form of siglec-E, an inhibitory siglec, which is expressed on several myeloid cell types including antigen-presenting dendritic cells.

https://openalex.org/W1983412356,"Gene looping, defined as the interaction of the promoter and the terminator regions of a gene during transcription, requires transcription factor IIB (TFIIB). We have earlier demonstrated association of TFIIB with the distal ends of a gene in an activator-dependent manner (El Kaderi, B., Medler, S., Raghunayakula, S., and Ansari, A. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 25015-25025). The presence of TFIIB at the 3' end of a gene required its interaction with cleavage factor 1 (CF1) 3' end processing complex subunit Rna15. Here, employing affinity chromatography and glycerol gradient centrifugation, we show that TFIIB associates with poly(A) polymerase and the entire CF1 complex in yeast cells. The factors required for general transcription such as TATA-binding protein, RNA polymerase II, and TFIIH are not a component of the TFIIB complex. This holo-TFIIB complex was resistant to MNase digestion. The complex was observed only in the looping-competent strains, but not in the looping-defective sua7-1 strain. The requirement of Rna15 in gene looping has been demonstrated earlier. Here we provide evidence that poly(A) polymerase (Pap1) as well as CF1 subunits Rna14 and Pcf11 are also required for loop formation of MET16 and INO1 genes. Accordingly, cross-linking of TFIIB to the 3' end of genes was abolished in the mutants of Pap1, Rna14, and Pcf11. We further show that in sua7-1 cells, where holo-TFIIB complex is not formed, the kinetics of activated transcription is altered. These results suggest that a complex of TFIIB, CF1 subunits, and Pap1 exists in yeast cells. Furthermore, TFIIB interaction with the CF1 complex and Pap1 is crucial for gene looping and transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2039193512,"Characterization of the polymorphic structural range of Aβ oligomers is important to the understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity. Yet for highly polymorphic ensembles, experimental structural elucidation is difficult. Here, we use a combination of NMR solvent protection experiments and computational structural screening to identify major species in the amyloid conformational ensemble. We examined the polymorphic pentamer and fibril seeds of Aβ42 and its mutants and compared the theoretical backbone amide protection obtained from simulations with experimental hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange protection ratio. We observed that highly flexible pentamers do not share structural similarities with fibril seed oligomers, except the turn regions. We found that a novel amyloid structural motif of a triple β-sheet, with the N-terminal residues interacting with the core (Lys(17)-Glu(22)) β-sheet region, correlates with H/D exchange protection. The triple β-sheet Aβ42 oligomer has a minimal exposure of hydrophobic residues and is further stabilized by the E22Q (Dutch) mutation in Alzheimer disease. The experimental H/D exchange solvent protection ratio implies that triple β-sheet fibrils and globulomers could coexist in the Aβ42 ensemble, pointing to a broad heterogeneous aggregate population. Our results suggest that an approach that combines computational modeling with NMR protection data can be a useful strategy for obtaining clues to the preferred conformational species of the assemblies in solution and help in alleviating experimental difficulties and consequently possible errors in the exchange data for Aβ42 fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W2031700109,"The most common cause for adverse cardiac events by antidepressants is acquired long QT syndrome (acLQTS), which produces electrocardiographic abnormalities that have been associated with syncope, torsade de pointes arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. acLQTS is often caused by direct block of the cardiac potassium current I(Kr)/hERG, which is crucial for terminal repolarization in human heart. Importantly, desipramine belongs to a group of tricyclic antidepressant compounds that can simultaneously block hERG and inhibit its surface expression. Although up to 40% of all hERG blockers exert combined hERG block and trafficking inhibition, few of these compounds have been fully characterized at the cellular level. Here, we have studied in detail how desipramine inhibits hERG surface expression. We find a previously unrecognized combination of two entirely different mechanisms; desipramine increases hERG endocytosis and degradation as a consequence of drug-induced channel ubiquitination and simultaneously inhibits hERG forward trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum. This unique combination of cellular effects in conjunction with acute channel block may explain why tricyclic antidepressants as a compound class are notorious for their association with arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Taken together, we describe the first example of drug-induced channel ubiquitination and degradation. Our data are directly relevant to the cardiac safety of not only tricyclic antidepressants but also other therapeutic compounds that exert multiple effects on hERG, as hERG trafficking and degradation phenotypes may go undetected in most preclinical safety assays designed to screen for acLQTS."
https://openalex.org/W2043788728,"The ficolin-mediated complement pathway plays an important role in vertebrate immunity, but it is not clear whether this pathway exists in invertebrates. Here we identified homologs of ficolin pathway components from the cephalochordate amphioxus and investigated whether they had been co-opted into a functional ficolin pathway. Four of these homologs, ficolin FCN1, serine protease MASP1 and MASP3, and complement component C3, were highly expressed in mucosal tissues and gonads, and were significantly up-regulated following bacterial infection. Recombinant FCN1 could induce hemagglutination, discriminate among sugar components, and specifically recognize and aggregate several bacteria (especially Gram-positive strains) without showing bactericidal activity. This suggested that FCN1 is a dedicated pattern-recognition receptor. Recombinant serine protease MASP1/3 formed complexes with recombinant FCN1 and facilitated the activation of native C3 protein in amphioxus humoral fluid, in which C3 acted as an immune effector. We conclude that amphioxus have developed a functional ficolin-complement pathway. Because ficolin pathway components have not been reported in non-chordate species, our findings supported the idea that this pathway may represent a chordate-specific innovation in the evolution of the complement system.

https://openalex.org/W2068131930,"The frequency with which the yeast [PSI(+)] prion form of Sup35 arises de novo is controlled by a number of genetic and environmental factors. We have previously shown that in cells lacking the antioxidant peroxiredoxin proteins Tsa1 and Tsa2, the frequency of de novo formation of [PSI(+)] is greatly elevated. We show here that Tsa1/Tsa2 also function to suppress the formation of the [PIN(+)] prion form of Rnq1. However, although oxidative stress increases the de novo formation of both [PIN(+)] and [PSI(+)], it does not overcome the requirement of cells being [PIN(+)] to form the [PSI(+)] prion. We use an anti-methionine sulfoxide antibody to show that methionine oxidation is elevated in Sup35 during oxidative stress conditions. Abrogating Sup35 methionine oxidation by overexpressing methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSRA) prevents [PSI(+)] formation, indicating that Sup35 oxidation may underlie the switch from a soluble to an aggregated form of Sup35. In contrast, we were unable to detect methionine oxidation of Rnq1, and MSRA overexpression did not affect [PIN(+)] formation in a tsa1 tsa2 mutant. The molecular basis of how yeast and mammalian prions form infectious amyloid-like structures de novo is poorly understood. Our data suggest a causal link between Sup35 protein oxidation and de novo [PSI(+)] prion formation."
https://openalex.org/W1984645285,"Glycogen synthase is a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycogen and has an essential role in glucose homeostasis. The three-dimensional structures of yeast glycogen synthase (Gsy2p) complexed with maltooctaose identified four conserved maltodextrin-binding sites distributed across the surface of the enzyme. Site-1 is positioned on the N-terminal domain, site-2 and site-3 are present on the C-terminal domain, and site-4 is located in an interdomain cleft adjacent to the active site. Mutation of these surface sites decreased glycogen binding and catalytic efficiency toward glycogen. Mutations within site-1 and site-2 reduced the V(max)/S(0.5) for glycogen by 40- and 70-fold, respectively. Combined mutation of site-1 and site-2 decreased the V(max)/S(0.5) for glycogen by >3000-fold. Consistent with the in vitro data, glycogen accumulation in glycogen synthase-deficient yeast cells (Δgsy1-gsy2) transformed with the site-1, site-2, combined site-1/site-2, or site-4 mutant form of Gsy2p was decreased by up to 40-fold. In contrast to the glycogen results, the ability to utilize maltooctaose as an in vitro substrate was unaffected in the site-2 mutant, moderately affected in the site-1 mutant, and almost completely abolished in the site-4 mutant. These data show that the ability to utilize maltooctaose as a substrate can be independent of the ability to utilize glycogen. Our data support the hypothesis that site-1 and site-2 provide a ""toehold mechanism,"" keeping glycogen synthase tightly associated with the glycogen particle, whereas site-4 is more closely associated with positioning of the nonreducing end during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2000326267,"Mycoplasmas contain glycoglycerolipids in their plasma membrane as key structural components involved in bilayer properties and stability. A membrane-associated glycosyltransferase (GT), GT MG517, has been identified in Mycoplasma genitalium, which sequentially produces monoglycosyl- and diglycosyldiacylglycerols. When recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, the enzyme was functional in vivo and yielded membrane glycolipids from which Glcβ1,6GlcβDAG was identified as the main product. A chaperone co-expression system and extraction with CHAPS detergent afforded soluble protein that was purified by affinity chromatography. GT MG517 transfers glucosyl and galactosyl residues from UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal to dioleoylglycerol (DOG) acceptor to form the corresponding β-glycosyl-DOG, which then acts as acceptor to give β-diglycosyl-DOG products. The enzyme (GT2 family) follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. kcat is about 5-fold higher for UDP-Gal with either DOG or monoglucosyldioleoylglycerol acceptors, but it shows better binding for UDP-Glc than UDP-Gal, as reflected by the lower Km, which results in similar kcat/Km values for both donors. Although sequentially adding glycosyl residues with β-1,6 connectivity, the first glycosyltransferase activity (to DOG) is about 1 order of magnitude higher than the second (to monoglucosyldioleoylglycerol). Because the ratio between the non-bilayer-forming monoglycosyldiacylglycerols and the bilayer-prone diglycosyldiacylglycerols contributes to regulate the properties of the plasma membrane, both synthase activities are probably regulated. Dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (anionic phospholipid) activates the enzyme, kcat linearly increasing with dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol concentration. GT MG517 is shown to be encoded by an essential gene, and the addition of GT inhibitors results in cell growth inhibition.

Similar glycolipids with a wider structural diversity are widespread in Gram-positive bacteria, in which the headgroups linked to diacylglycerol contain glucosyl, galactosyl, or mannosyl units with diverse glycosidic linkages (1Hölzl G. Dörmann P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2007; 46: 225-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).

In non-photosynthetic Gram-positive bacteria, sequentially acting GTs are also found, in which a single enzyme transfers the first and second (and eventually a third or more) glycosyl unit. The enzymes from Bacillus and Staphylococcus belong to family GT28 and have been shown to produce mono-, di-, and oligoglucoglycerolipids starting with DAG as primary acceptor (3Kiriukhin M.Y.

Two different GTs belonging to family GT4 have been identified as mono- and diglucosyldiacylglycerol synthases, respectively, responsible for the sequential glycosylation of the precursor diacylglycerol and regulation of the ratio between non-bilayer and bilayer-forming glycolipids (32Karlsson O.P.

More recently, Mycoplasma pneumoniae has been shown to contain a processive GT2 producing mainly galactoglycerolipids (38Klement M.L. Ojemyr L. Tagscherer K.E. Widmalm G. Wieslander A. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1444-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Due to the fundamental role of glycoglycerolipids in membrane stability in mycoplasmas and the fact that these lipid structures are absent in the animal host cells of mycoplasma infections, we hypothesize that GTs involved in their biosynthesis are potential targets for drug discovery. GT4 enzymes from A. laidlawii have been well characterized (32Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikström S. Wieslander A. J. Biol.

However, genome-sequenced mycoplasmas (more than 18 different species) contain mainly GT2 enzymes. Experimentally, only the MPN483 gene product from M. pneumoniae has been identified as a glycolipid synthase (38Klement M.L. Ojemyr L. Tagscherer K.E. Widmalm G. Wieslander A. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1444-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is responsible for the synthesis of most of the glycoglycerolipids found in the plasma membrane (processive enzyme with broad specificity), but this study characterized the enzyme in crude membrane extracts, where other membrane components may interfere or regulate the observed activity. Because GT2 enzymes are the most common glycosyltransferases in pathogenic mycoplasmas and are encoded by essential genes (as shown by gene inactivation in Mycoplasma genitalium (39Glass J.I. Assad-Garcia N. Alperovich N. Yooseph S. Lewis M.R. Maruf M. Hutchison 3rd, C.A. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

With the aim of better understanding the kinetic properties of processive (or sequentially acting) GT2 enzymes, we here address the recombinant expression and purification of a novel GT from M. genitalium for detailed kinetic characterization of the isolated enzyme. M. genitalium is the smallest free-living organism considered a minimal cell model (39Glass J.I. Assad-Garcia N. Alperovich N. Yooseph S. Lewis M.R. Maruf M. Hutchison 3rd, C.A. Smith H.O.

Due to its reduced genome of only 580 kb and about 480 genes encoding for proteins, it lacks many metabolic pathways like amino acid, nucleotide, fatty acid, and cholesterol biosynthesis and maintains a reduced energy metabolism devoid of Krebs cycle (23Razin S.

M. genitalium is a human pathogen involved in urogenital diseases such as acute and chronic non-gonococcal urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammation (45Horner P.J. Gilroy C.B. Thomas B.J.

Here we report a chaperone co-expression system that has allowed the overproduction and subsequent purification of the membrane-associated GT MG517. We provide for the first time the kinetic parameters for the first (monoglycosyldiacylglycerol synthase) and second (diglycosyldiacylglycerol synthase) glycosyl transfer activities catalyzed by a GT2 glycolipid synthase in isolated form. Inhibition of this GT activity is shown to inhibit mycoplasma growth, supporting our hypothesis of GT2 glycolipid synthases as potential therapeutic targets against mycoplasma infections. 20 ml of SP4 medium (47Trully J.G. Razin S. Trully J.G. Molecular and Diagnostic Procedures in Mycoplasmology. 1. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1975: 33-39Google Scholar) supplemented with 5 g/liter glucose (or [14C6]glucose, 15 μCi, in labeling experiments) in 150-cm2 Falcon flasks were inoculated with 50 μl of M. genitalium glycerinate stock and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere until exponential (3.5 days) or stationary (6 days) phase, depending on its use for GT activity assays or lipid extraction, respectively. Cells were washed with 5 ml of PBS and resuspended in 5 ml of PBS by direct scraping of the surface. After centrifugation, the cellular pellet was resuspended in reaction buffer when used for activity assays or extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) when used for lipid analysis. For cell growth inhibition assays, PPMP and N-(n-nonyl)-deoxygalactonojirimycin (C9J) (inhibitors of GT MG517, as shown below) dissolved in 100 μl of ethanol were added to 5 ml of culture medium (in 25-cm2 Falcon flasks) before inoculation (with 7 μl of M. genitalium glycerinate) to give final inhibitor concentrations of 0–500 μm. Cell growth was followed by monitoring the pH of the medium, which drops from 7 to 5 within 6 days for a control M. genitalium culture (without inhibitor) (43Güell M. van Noort V. Yus E. Chen W.H. Leigh-Bell J. Michalodimitrakis K. Yamada T. Arumugam M. Doerks T. Kühner S. Rode M. Suyama M. Schmidt S. Gavin A.C. Bork P. Serrano L. Science. 2009; 326: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). M. genitalium cells grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to stationary phase (6 days) were scraped, washed, and resuspended in Lysis buffer A (67 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 16.7 mm ammonium sulfate, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6.7 mm MgCl2, 6.7 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1.67 μm SDS, and 50 μg/ml proteinase K). The cell lysate was directly used as template in hot start polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to amplify the three ORFs, mg025, mg060, and mg517. After restriction digestion and ligation to a pUC18 vector, electrocompetent Escherichia coli DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation mixtures, and positive transformants were verified by DNA sequencing. All Trp-coding UGA codons present in mg025 (two codons; Trp-218 and Trp-273), mg060 (five codons; Trp-88, Trp-126, Trp-131, Trp-227, and Trp-287) and mg517 (four codons; Trp-170, Trp-197, Trp-268, and Trp-275) were mutated to UGG for recombinant protein expression in E. coli. Next, the codon-adapted genes in pUC18 vectors were subcloned into pET38b(+) between NdeI and AvrII sites for protein expression of the full-length proteins under the control of a T7 promoter. The final constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with each vector for protein expression. Detailed protocols and primer sequences are given in the supplemental material (Table S1). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring each plasmid (pET38b(+)-mg025, pET38b(+)-mg060, or pET38b(+)-mg517) were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. When the culture reached an OD of 0.3, a heat shock at 42 °C for 30 min was applied. Then IPTG (1 mm) was added, and cells were grown for 16 h at 20 °C. After centrifugation at 4 °C, the cell pellet was directly used for lipid analysis (in vivo glycolipid biosynthesis) or for the preparation of spheroblasts (for in vitro GT activity assays). The cellular pellet of M. genitalium or recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3) expressing the corresponding genes was subjected to lipid extraction with chloroform/methanol (2:1) (v/v). The organic fraction, dried with MgSO4 and concentrated under vacuum, was analyzed by TLC developed with chloroform/methanol/water 65:35:4 (v/v) and stained with different reagents for lipid identification (48Zweig C.

Numerous cell adhesion molecules have been implicated in target recognition, but how these proteins are precisely trafficked and targeted is poorly understood. To identify components that affect synaptic specificity, we carried out a forward genetic screen in the Drosophila eye. We identified a gene, named ric1 homologue (rich), whose loss leads to synaptic specificity defects. Loss of rich leads to reduction of N-Cadherin in the photoreceptor cell synapses but not of other proteins implicated in target recognition, including Sec15, DLAR, Jelly belly, and PTP69D. The Rich protein binds to Rab6, and Rab6 mutants display very similar phenotypes as the rich mutants. The active form of Rab6 strongly suppresses the rich synaptic specificity defect, indicating that Rab6 is regulated by Rich. We propose that Rich activates Rab6 to regulate N-Cadherin trafficking and affects synaptic specificity.

To achieve this, neurons integrate numerous signals that allow them to decide when to extend their growth cones, to follow a specific route, to determine when to fasciculate or defasciculate, and when to stop and form synaptic connections. Improper synapse formation may lead to cognitive diseases and mental retardation such as autism spectrum disorders (McAllister, 2007McAllister A.K. Dynamic aspects of CNS synapse formation.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 425-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, Südhof, 2008Südhof T.C.

Hence, providing a molecular framework to understand how neurons form proper synapses remains an important endeavor. The Drosophila visual system is an excellent model to untangle this type of question because of its stereotyped structure, well documented cellular behavior, accessibility to genetic manipulation, and because the homologs of numerous fly proteins play similar roles in vertebrates (Kunes and Steller, 1993Kunes S. Steller H. Topography in the Drosophila visual system.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993Meinertzhagen I.A. Hanson T.E.

The adult Drosophila compound eye contains ∼800 small units called ommatidia, each of which comprises eight photoreceptor (PR) cells, R1–R8. R1–R6 cells are outer PR cells, that synapse in the first optic ganglion, the lamina, to form a primary visual map. In the lamina, terminals of PR cells and postsynaptic neurons form repeated modules called cartridges. Each cartridge contains six PR terminals that originate from six different ommatidia. Hence, each cartridge receives input from a single point in space. Improper organization of the cartridges often leads to visual map disruption and abnormal optomotor behavior (Clandinin and Zipursky, 2000Clandinin T.R. Zipursky S.L. Afferent growth cone interactions control synaptic specificity in the Drosophila visual system.Neuron. 2000; 28: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The inner PR cells, R7 and R8, project their axons through the lamina and stop in two distinct layers, M6 and M3, in the medulla where they make precise synaptic connections with the postsynaptic cells (Kunes and Steller, 1993Kunes S.

The formation of specific synaptic connections between R cells and postsynaptic cells relies upon a complex bidirectional interaction between R cells and their targets. To date, many molecules have been identified that play pivotal roles in this targeting process (Giagtzoglou et al., 2009Giagtzoglou N. Ly C.V. Bellen H.J.

CadN mediated homophilic interactions between pre- and postsynaptic cells are thought to be key for synaptic partner selection. However, it is still unclear how the cell type specific function of CadN is achieved since CadN is widely expressed in the brain (Lee et al., 2001Lee C.H. Herman T. Clandinin T.R. Lee R. Zipursky S.L. N-cadherin regulates target specificity in the Drosophila visual system.Neuron. 2001; 30: 437-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, CadN undergoes both constitutive and activity dependent endocytosis and recycling, which is critical for synaptic plasticity (Tai et al., 2007Tai C.Y. Mysore S.P. Chiu C. Schuman E.M. Activity-regulated N-cadherin endocytosis.Neuron. 2007; 54: 771-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the CadN expression pattern is highly dynamic during fly eye development but how it is regulated is unknown (Matthews et al., 2008Matthews B.J. Corty M.M. Grueber W.B. Of cartridges and columns: new roles for cadherins in visual system development.Neuron. 2008; 58: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, Nern et al., 2008Nern A. Zhu Y. Zipursky S.L. Local N-cadherin interactions mediate distinct steps in the targeting of lamina neurons.Neuron. 2008; 58: 34-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is therefore interesting to establish how trafficking of CadN contributes to the dynamic changes of its expression pattern and determines PR cell targeting specificity. Here, we present evidence that Rab6, and its potential GEF protein Rich, control PR cell target selection by regulating CadN. Rab6 is a small GTPase that is present in the Golgi apparatus as well as cytoplasmic vesicles (Del Nery et al., 2006Del Nery E. Miserey-Lenkei S. Falguières T. Nizak C. Johannes L. Perez F. Goud B.

Rab6 recruits the dynein motor complex and plays an important role in microtubule dependent retrograde transport from the endosome to the Golgi and from the Golgi to the ER (Girod et al., 1999Girod A.

In addition, Rab6 also directs targeting of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane (Coutelis and Ephrussi, 2007Coutelis J.B. Ephrussi A.

Rab6 and the secretory pathway affect oocyte polarity in Drosophila.Development. 2007; 134: 3419-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Like other GTPases, Rab6 alternates between a GTP-bound active form and a GDP-bound inactive form. The GEF proteins unload GDP from Rab GTPases to generate active GTP loaded Rabs (Stenmark, 2009Stenmark H. Rab GTPases as coordinators of vesicle traffic.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar). To date, the only Rab6 GEF that has been characterized is a yeast protein complex comprised of two proteins Ric1p and Rgp1p. The Ric1p-Rgp1p complex binds to Ypt6p, the yeast Rab6 homolog, in a nucleotide-dependent manner. The purified complex stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange on Ypt6p (Siniossoglou et al., 2000Siniossoglou S. Peak-Chew S.Y. Pelham H.R. Ric1p and Rgp1p form a complex that catalyses nucleotide exchange on Ypt6p.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Rab6 is highly conserved in eukaryotes. However, both Ric1 and Rgp1 are only present in budding yeast, although related proteins containing RIC1 domains as well as other domains or Rgp1 domains can be identified in higher eukaryotes. In a forward genetic screen, we isolated a complementation group in which the PR cells display defects in synaptic specificity. We mapped the lesions to a novel gene CG9063 that encodes a protein containing a RIC1 domain as well as other domains. Our data indicate that this protein is required for proper synaptic specificity in the eye and antenna lobe (AL) by regulating CadN trafficking via Rab6. To isolate new genes involved in synapse development and function, we carried out an F1 genetic screen in the Drosophila visual system (Ohyama et al., 2007Ohyama T. Verstreken P. Ly C.V. Rosenmund T. Rajan A. Tien A.C. Haueter C. Schulze K.L. Bellen H.J. Huntingtin-interacting protein 14, a palmitoyl transferase required for exocytosis and targeting of CSP to synaptic vesicles.J.

By creating clones of randomly induced mutations with the eyFLP system, we identify mutations that fail to evoke a postsynaptic response in electroretinograms (ERGs). Lack of an “on” and “off” response indicates aberrant communication between the presynaptic photoreceptors (R1–R6) and the postsynaptic lamina neurons (L1–3). These defects can be due to defects in synaptic transmission or a failure in synapse formation or synaptic partner selection (Mehta et al., 2005Mehta S.Q. Hiesinger P.R. Beronja S. Zhai R.G. Schulze K.L. Verstreken P. Cao Y. Zhou Y. Tepass U. Crair M.C. Bellen H.J. Mutations in Drosophila sec15 reveal a function in neuronal targeting for a subset of exocyst components.Neuron. 2005; 46: 219-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). From a screen of about 50,000 mutagenized chromosomes on arm 3L, we isolated several essential complementation groups, including one which consists of two homozygous lethal alleles: 3L61 and 3L62. The eyFLP mosaic mutant animals display small “on” and “off” transients in ERGs (Figure 1A ), indicating that the mutant photoreceptors fail to transmit information to their targets. Note that the amplitude of depolarizations in these mutant are fairly normal, indicating that the mutant photoreceptors can capture photons and produce graded potentials, suggesting that the phototransduction pathway is essentially normal. To determine whether the failure to evoke a postsynaptic response is due to defects in R cell connectivity, we investigated the morphology of the terminals of the outer PR cells, R1–R6, in the lamina. We labeled the R2–R5 with Ro-tau-lacZ (Garrity et al., 1999Garrity P.A. Lee C.H. Salecker I. Robertson H.C. Desai C.J. Zinn K. Zipursky S.L. Retinal axon target selection in Drosophila is regulated by a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase.Neuron. 1999; 22: 707-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; see Figures S1A and S1B available online) in the third-instar larval brains and the R1–R6 with Rh1 GFP (Ratnakumar and Desplan, 2004bRatnakumar, K., and Desplan, C. (2004b). P{rh1-GAL4} and P{Rh4-GAL4} insertions FlyBase. http://flybase.org/reports/FBrf0183003.html.Google Scholar; Figures S1C and S1D) in the adult brains. In the eyFLP; 3L61 mutant animals, the outer PR axons correctly target to the lamina layer at both stages, indicating that 3L61 is not required for the lamina layer targeting of the outer PR cells. To analyze cartridge organization and ultrastructural features of the R1–R6 axon termini, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the lamina. Photoreceptor terminals were identified based on the presence of glial invaginations (capitate projections) (Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993Meinertzhagen I.A. Hanson T.E. The development of the optic lobe.in: Martinez-Arias M.B.A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Sprin Harbor, NY1993: 1363-1491Google Scholar). Although the mutant epithelial glial cells are thinner than in wild-type, the cartridges are readily identifiable in 3L61 and 3L62 mutants. The mutant cartridges contain a highly variable number of PR cell terminals ranging from 3 to 8 (Figures 1B and 1C). However, in these missorted cartridges, active zone integrity, vesicle density, and capitate projections are normal (Figure 1B) as is often observed in targeting mutants (Hiesinger et al., 2006Hiesinger P.R. Zhai R.G. Zhou Y. Koh T.W. Mehta S.Q. Schulze K.L. Cao Y. Verstreken P. Clandinin T.R. Fischbach K.F. et al.Activity-independent prespecification of synaptic partners in the visual map of Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1835-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In summary, the axons of the outer PR target to the correct layer but proper cartridge formation is impaired. To determine if the terminals of R7 and R8 are layered correctly in the M6 and M3 layers of the lamina, we revealed them with Chaoptin (mAb24B10). Staining of the eyFLP; 3L6 mutant medulla revealed a few “gaps” as if some R7 terminals are “missing” (Figure 1D). This pattern is similar to that observed in CadN (Lee et al., 2001Lee C.H. Herman T. Clandinin T.R. Lee R. Zipursky S.L. N-cadherin regulates target specificity in the Drosophila visual system.Neuron. 2001; 30: 437-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and Liprin α mutants (Choe et al., 2006Choe K.M. Prakash S. Bright A. Clandinin T.R. Liprin-alpha is required for photoreceptor target selection in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11601-11606Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, Hofmeyer et al., 2006Hofmeyer K. Maurel-Zaffran C. Sink H. Treisman J.E. Liprin-alpha has LAR-independent functions in R7 photoreceptor axon targeting.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11595-11600Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in which R7 axons fail to terminate at the M6 layer, but rather target the M3 layer. However, the observed “gaps” may also be caused by a loss of R7 cells. We therefore stained third-instar larval eye discs with anti-Elav (Figures S2A and S2B) and 24B10 antibodies (Figures S2C and S2D) to reveal the differentiation of neurons and R cells. To determine if specific PR cells were properly identified, we also labeled R4 cells with mΔGFP (Cooper and Bray, 1999Cooper M.T. Bray S.J. Frizzled regulation of Notch signalling polarizes cell fate in the Drosophila eye.Nature. 1999; 397: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar; Figures S2E and S2F), R7 cells with 181Gal4 GFP (Lee et al., 2001Lee C.H. Herman T. Clandinin T.R. Lee R. Zipursky S.L. N-cadherin regulates target specificity in the Drosophila visual system.Neuron. 2001; 30: 437-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar; Figures S2C and S2D), and R8 cells with anti-Senseless (Nolo et al., 2000Nolo R. Abbott L.A. Bellen H.J. Senseless, a Zn finger transcription factor, is necessary and sufficient for sensory organ development in Drosophila.Cell. 2000; 102: 349-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar; Figures S2A and S2B). We observed no difference in staining pattern for any of the markers between 3L6 mutant and wild-type cells, indicating that the differentiation of PR cells is not affected in the mutants. We then analyzed retinal thick sections of adult flies and did not observe loss of R7 cells in the 3L6 mutants (Figures S2G and S2H), although a rare ommatidium has an abnormal morphology. In contrast, labeling of the R7 terminals with UAS-Synaptotagmin GFP (SytGFP) drived by Pan-R7-Gal4 (Ratnakumar and Desplan, 2004aRatnakumar, K., and Desplan, C. (2004a). P{ninaE-EGFP.P} and P{Pan-R7-GAL4} insertions. FlyBase. http://flybase.org/reports/FBrf0179876.html.Google Scholar), showed that about 20% (19.7% ± 3%, n = 268) of all R7 cell terminals fail to reach their target layer M6 but target the M3 layer (Figures 2A, 2B, 2A ′, and 2B′) in the adult brains of eyFLP; 3L61 mutants. Note that the targeting defect is an underestimate (see Figure 5B) since we did not label the mutant clones and the 3L61 mutant clones are small because of a growth disadvantage with respect to heterozygous cells. Finally, we assessed the projection pattern of R8 cells by labeling them with Rh6-GFP (Ratnakumar and Desplan, 2003Ratnakumar, K., and Desplan, C. (2003). Rh-GAL4 and Rh-GFP insertions. FlyBase. http://flybase.org/reports/FBrf0173259.html.Google Scholar). 3L6 mutant animals do not exhibit any obvious R8 targeting defects (Figures 2C, 2D, 2C′, and 2D′). Since the phenotypes associated with loss of 3L6 are specific and interesting, we performed meiotic recombination mapping using P elements (Zhai et al., 2003Zhai R.G. Hiesinger P.R. Koh T.W. Verstreken P. Schulze K.L. Cao Y. Jafar-Nejad H. Norga K.K. Pan H. Bayat V. et al.Mapping Drosophila mutations with molecularly defined P element insertions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 10860-10865Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Rough mapping placed 3L6 in the 77A4–79F4 cytological interval. Deficiency mapping mapped 3L6 to 79C2–80A4. As recombination frequencies are extremely low in this interval, we generated four small overlapping deficiency using FRT bearing P elements and PiggyBac insertions (Parks et al., 2004Parks A.L.

Complementation tests narrowed the putative gene down to six genes and sequencing revealed two premature stop codons in CG9063 at amino acid (aa) 380 (3L61) and 1196 (3L62) (Figure 3A).

https://openalex.org/W2093930782,"Mutations in the X-linked gene cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) have been found in patients with epileptic encephalopathy characterized by early onset intractable epilepsy, including infantile spasms and other types of seizures, severe developmental delay, and often the development of Rett syndrome-like features. Despite its clear involvement in proper brain development, CDKL5 functions are still far from being understood. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the endogenous kinase in primary murine hippocampal neurons. CDKL5 was localized both in nucleus and cytoplasm and, conversely to proliferating cells, did not undergo constitutive shuttling between these compartments. Nevertheless, glutamate stimulation was able to induce the exit of the kinase from the nucleus and its subsequent accumulation in the perinuclear cytoplasm. Moreover, we found that sustained glutamate stimulation promoted CDKL5 proteasomal degradation. Both events were mediated by the specific activation of extrasynaptic pool of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Proteasomal degradation was also induced by withdrawal of neurotrophic factors and hydrogen peroxide treatment, two different paradigms of cell death. Altogether, our results indicate that both subcellular localization and expression of CDKL5 are modulated by the activation of extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and suggest regulation of CDKL5 by cell death pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2059492547,"Vascular calcification impairs vessel compliance and increases the risk of cardiovascular events. We found previously that liver X receptor agonists, which regulate intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, augment PKA agonist- or high phosphate-induced osteogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Because cholesterol is an integral component of the matrix vesicles that nucleate calcium mineral, we examined the role of cellular cholesterol metabolism in vascular cell mineralization. The results showed that vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from LDL receptor null (Ldlr(-/-)) mice, which have impaired cholesterol uptake, had lower levels of intracellular cholesterol and less osteogenic differentiation, as indicated by alkaline phosphatase activity and matrix mineralization, compared with WT cells. PKA activation with forskolin acutely induced genes that promote cholesterol uptake (LDL receptor) and biosynthesis (HMG-CoA reductase). In WT cells, inhibition of cholesterol uptake by lipoprotein-deficient serum attenuated forskolin-induced matrix mineralization, which was partially reversed by the addition of cell-permeable cholesterol. Prolonged activation of both uptake and biosynthesis pathways by cotreatment with a liver X receptor agonist further augmented forskolin-induced matrix mineralization. Inhibition of either cholesterol uptake, using Ldlr(-/-) cells, or of cholesterol biosynthesis, using mevastatin-treated WT cells, failed to inhibit matrix mineralization due to up-regulation of the respective compensatory pathway. Inhibition of both pathways simultaneously using mevastatin-treated Ldlr(-/-) cells did inhibit forskolin-induced matrix mineralization. Altogether, the results suggest that up-regulation of cholesterol metabolism is essential for matrix mineralization by vascular cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062650172,"2-Cysteine (Cys) peroxiredoxins (Prxs), which include mammalian Prxs I-IV, possess two conserved Cys residues that are readily oxidized by H(2)O(2) to form a disulfide. In the case of Prx I-III, the disulfide is reduced by thioredoxin, thus enabling these proteins to function as peroxidases. Prx IV was shown previously to be synthesized as a 31-kDa polypeptide with an NH(2)-terminal signal peptide that is subsequently cleaved to generate a 27-kDa form of the protein that is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. A form of Prx IV, larger than 27 kDa revealed by immunoblot analysis was suggested to represent the unprocessed, 31-kDa form, but this larger form was detected only in spermatids of the postpubertal testis. We now show that the larger form of Prx IV (here designated Prx IV-L) detected in the testis is actually a product of alternative transcription of the Prx IV gene that is encoded by newly identified exon 1A together with exons 2-7 that are shared with the 27-kDa form (designated Prx IV-S). Prx IV-L was detected in spermatids but not in mature sperm, it could form disulfide-linked dimers but not higher order oligomers via oxidation, and it was resistant to hyperoxidation unless additional reductant was added, suggesting that its peroxidase activity is limited in vivo. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Prx IV-S gene is present in all vertebrates examined, whereas the Prx IV-L gene was detected only in placental mammals. We suggest that Prx IV-L functions as an H(2)O(2) sensor that mediates protein thiol oxidation required for the maturation of spermatozoa in placental mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1979783383,"Apicomplexan parasites, such as the malaria-causing Plasmodium, utilize an actin-based motor for motility and host cell invasion. The actin filaments of these parasites are unusually short, and actin polymerization is under strict control of a small set of regulatory proteins, which are poorly conserved with their mammalian orthologs. Actin depolymerization factors (ADFs) are among the most important actin regulators, affecting the rates of filament turnover in a multifaceted manner. Plasmodium has two ADFs that display low sequence homology with each other and with the higher eukaryotic family members. Here, we show that ADF2, like canonical ADF proteins but unlike ADF1, binds to both globular and filamentous actin, severing filaments and inducing nucleotide exchange on the actin monomer. The crystal structure of Plasmodium ADF1 shows major differences from the ADF consensus, explaining the lack of F-actin binding. Plasmodium ADF2 structurally resembles the canonical members of the ADF/cofilin family."
https://openalex.org/W2025749078,"Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are chloride channels that mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission and are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) family. The interface between the ligand binding domain and the transmembrane domain of pLGICs has been proposed to be crucial for channel gating and is lined by a number of charged and aromatic side chains that are highly conserved among different pLGICs. However, little is known about specific interactions between these residues that are likely to be important for gating in α1 GlyRs. Here we use the introduction of cysteine pairs and the in vivo nonsense suppression method to incorporate unnatural amino acids to probe the electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions of five highly conserved side chains near the interface, Glu-53, Phe-145, Asp-148, Phe-187, and Arg-218. Our results suggest a salt bridge between Asp-148 in loop 7 and Arg-218 in the pre-M1 domain that is crucial for channel gating. We further propose that Phe-145 and Phe-187 play important roles in stabilizing this interaction by providing a hydrophobic environment. In contrast to the equivalent residues in loop 2 of other pLGICs, the negative charge at Glu-53 α1 GlyRs is not crucial for normal channel function. These findings help decipher the GlyR gating pathway and show that distinct residue interaction patterns exist in different pLGICs. Furthermore, a salt bridge between Asp-148 and Arg-218 would provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the pathophysiologically relevant hyperekplexia, or startle disease, mutant Arg-218 → Gln."
https://openalex.org/W2007649253,"In plasma cells, immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) secretory-specific mRNA is made in high abundance as a result of both increased promoter proximal poly(A) site choice and weak splice-site skipping. Ell2, the eleven-nineteen lysine rich leukemia gene, is a transcription elongation factor that is induced ∼6-fold in plasma cells and has been shown to drive secretory-specific mRNA production. Reducing ELL2 by siRNA, which reduced processing to the secretion-specific poly(A) site, also influenced the methylations of histone H3K4 and H3K79 on the IgH gene and impacted positive transcription factor b (pTEFb), Ser-2 carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation, and polyadenylation factor additions to RNA polymerase II. The multiple lineage leukemia gene (MLL) and Dot1L associations with the IgH gene were also impaired in the absence of ELL2. To investigate the link between histone modifications, transcription elongation, and alternative RNA processing in IgH mRNA production, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation on cultured mouse B and plasma cells bearing the identical IgH γ2a gene. In the plasma cells, as compared with the B cells, the H3K4 and H3K79 methylations extended farther downstream, past the IgH enhancer to the end of the transcribed region. Thus the downstream H3K4 and H3K79 methylation of the IgH associated chromatin in plasma cells is associated with increased polyadenylation and exon skipping, resulting from the actions of ELL2 transcription elongation factor."
https://openalex.org/W2037413610,"Rab27, a small GTPase, is generally recognized as an important regulator of secretion that interacts with Rab27-specific effectors to regulate events in a wide variety of cells, including endocrine and exocrine cells. However, the mechanisms governing the spatio-temporal regulation of GTPase activity of Rab27 are not firmly established, and no GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specific for Rab27 has been identified in secretory cells. We previously showed that expression of EPI64, a Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC)-domain-containing protein, in melanocytes inactivates endogenous Rab27A on melanosomes (Itoh, T., and Fukuda, M. (2006) J.

In this study, we investigated the effect of EPI64 on Rab27 in isoproterenol (IPR)-stimulated amylase release from rat parotid acinar cells. Subcellular fractionation and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that EPI64 was enriched on the apical plasma membrane of parotid acinar cells. We found that an antibody against the TBC/Rab-GAP domain of EPI64 inhibited the reduction in levels of the endogenous GTP-Rab27 in streptolysin-O-permeabilized parotid acinar cells and suppressed amylase release in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that the levels of EPI64 mRNA and EPI64 protein increased after IPR stimulation, and that treatment with actinomycin D or antisense-EPI64 oligonucleotides suppressed the increase of EPI64 mRNA/EPI64 protein and the amount of amylase released. Our findings indicated that EPI64 acted as a physiological Rab27-GAP that enhanced GTPase activity of Rab27 in response to IPR stimulation, and that this activity is required for IPR-induced amylase release.

We found that an antibody against the TBC/Rab-GAP domain of EPI64 inhibited the reduction in levels of the endogenous GTP-Rab27 in streptolysin-O-permeabilized parotid acinar cells and suppressed amylase release in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that the levels of EPI64 mRNA and EPI64 protein increased after IPR stimulation, and that treatment with actinomycin D or antisense-EPI64 oligonucleotides suppressed the increase of EPI64 mRNA/EPI64 protein and the amount of amylase released. Our findings indicated that EPI64 acted as a physiological Rab27-GAP that enhanced GTPase activity of Rab27 in response to IPR stimulation, and that this activity is required for IPR-induced amylase release."
https://openalex.org/W1974004170,"Recent crystal structures of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) show the remarkable structural diversity of extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), implying its potential role in ligand binding and ligand-induced receptor conformational selectivity. Here we have applied molecular modeling and mutagenesis studies to the TM4/ECL2 junction (residues Pro174(4.59)–Met180(4.66)) of the human gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor, which uniquely has one functional type of receptor but two endogenous ligands in humans. We suggest that the above residues assume an α-helical extension of TM4 in which the side chains of Gln174(4.60) and Phe178(4.64) face toward the central ligand binding pocket to make H-bond and aromatic contacts with pGlu1 and Trp3 of both GnRH I and GnRH II, respectively. The interaction between the side chains of Phe178(4.64) of the receptor and Trp3 of the GnRHs was supported by reciprocal mutations of the interacting residues. Interestingly, alanine mutations of Leu175(4.61), Ile177(4.63), and Met180(4.66) decreased mutant receptor affinity for GnRH I but, in contrast, increased affinity for GnRH II. This suggests that these residues make intramolecular or intermolecular contacts with residues of transmembrane (TM) domain 3, TM5, or the phospholipid bilayer, which couple the ligand structure to specific receptor conformational switches. The marked decrease in signaling efficacy of I177A and F178A also indicates that IIe177(4.63) and Phe178(4.64) are important in stabilizing receptor-active conformations. These findings suggest that the TM4/ECL2 junction is crucial for peptide ligand binding and, consequently, for ligand-induced receptor conformational selection.

It is of fundamental importance to understand how these receptors, which share a common architecture, are activated by a variety of structurally diverse ligands. In this way, therapeutics that are better targeted to mimic or block these molecules can be designed. The crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin provided the first structural insight into this family of receptors (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar) and aided much of our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of GPCR activation, in combination with a number of biochemical and biophysical studies. G protein-coupled receptor transmembrane domain extracellular loop gonadotropin-releasing hormone inositol phosphate adrenergic receptor Protein Data Bank molecular dynamics. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor is a member of the rhodopsin-like subfamily of GPCRs. GnRH I is released in pulses from the hypothalamus into the portal blood system where it is transported to the anterior pituitary gland. Here it binds to GnRH receptors expressed on gonadotrope cells, which predominantly causes Gq/11 activation. The resultant signaling pathway brings about the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to regulate steroidogenesis and gametogenesis. As such, GnRH analogues are used extensively to treat many hormone-dependent diseases, including infertility, endometriosis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and breast cancer (2Millar R.P. Lu Z.L. Pawson A.J. Flanagan C.A. Morgan K. Maudsley S.R. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 235-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). However, it has become evident that GnRH also acts on many cells outside of the pituitary gland. There are two endogenous ligands, hypothalamic GnRH I and extrahypothalamic GnRH II, despite there being only one functional receptor subtype expressed in humans. Both ligands exert their effects through the same receptor subtype, although they exhibit distinct pharmacological and signaling profiles (3Millar R.P. Pawson A.J. Morgan K. Rissman E.F. Lu Z.L. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2008; 29: 17-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Different physiological outcomes are proposed to be mediated by different receptor coupling to Gs (4Ulloa-Aguirre A. Stanislaus D. Arora V. Väänänen J. Brothers S. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2472-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or Gi/o (5Gründker C. Völker P. Emons G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2369-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) in addition to the classical Gq/11 pathway, but this remains controversial (6White C.D. Coetsee M. Morgan K. Flanagan C.A. Millar R.P. Lu Z.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 2520-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that the human GnRH receptor can activate other Gq/11-independent signaling pathways such as G12/13 (7Lu, Z. L. (2010) 92nd Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, San Diego, June 19–22, 2010, pp. 3–217, The Endocrine Society, Chevy Chase, MD.Google Scholar). Hence, the divergent signaling is believed to be mediated by different receptor-active conformations induced by differential ligand-receptor interactions. Binding of GnRH I and II to the GnRH receptor may cause different intramolecular interactions to be broken, allowing the receptor to adopt varied conformations and thus enabling divergent signaling pathways. We have termed this ligand-induced selective signaling (3Millar R.P. Pawson A.J. Morgan K. Rissman E.F. Lu Z.L. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2008; 29: 17-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Lu Z.L. Coetsee M. White C.D. Millar R.P. J. Biol.

Investigations into the structure of the GnRH receptor and identification of ligand binding contacts between GnRH and its receptor will enable refinement of molecular models for structure-based drug design. Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies and modeling have identified multiple contact sites of the GnRH receptor with its ligands (2Millar R.P. Lu Z.L. Pawson A.J. Flanagan C.A. Morgan K.

As these peptide ligands are larger than many biogenic amines, the binding pocket for GnRH is located toward the extracellular side of the receptor rather than buried further down the TM domains. It is likely to involve interactions with the extracellular loops as well as the TM domains. Interestingly, the molecular model of GnRH I docking to the human GnRH receptor suggests a potential interaction between Trp3 of the ligand with a region at the extracellular end of TM4 leading into ECL2 (12Stewart A.J.

Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar). In rhodopsin the ECL2 has two short anti-parallel β-sheets that form a stable cap over the covalently bound ligand 11-cis-retinal. Conversely, the ECL2 regions in β1-AR and β2-AR form an α-helix that is constrained by two disulfide bonds and is more solvent-exposed to allow diffusion of ligands into the binding pocket (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the ECL2 region in the A2A adenosine receptor lacks any prominent secondary structure, with random coils and low electron density in the middle portion of the loop indicating a more mobile structure. Functionally, ECL2 is implicated in ligand binding (18Shi L. Javitch J.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 19Conner M. Hawtin S.R. Simms J.

Therefore, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of residues Pro173(4.59)–Met180(4.66) (receptor residues are identified by the amino acid sequence number followed in parentheses by Ballesteros and Weinstein numbering, where the position of the most conserved amino acid in the TM domain, X, is designated X.50) was employed to better understand the role of this TM4/ECL2 junction of the GnRH receptor in terms of structure, ligand binding, and function. Our studies have demonstrated that Phe178(4.64) is a contact site in the human GnRH receptor for GnRH I and GnRH II binding, presumably through aromatic pi interactions with Trp3 of GnRH. Molecular modeling indicates that the residues surrounding Phe178(4.64) form an extended α-helical structure from the extracellular end of TM4 into ECL2, with mutagenesis studies suggesting that certain residues play a role in ligand-dependent receptor conformational selection. This may lead to different ligand-induced selective signaling as suggested in previous studies (8Lu Z.L. Coetsee M. White C.D. Millar R.P. J. Biol.

After 28 h, cells were washed as described above and labeled overnight with 1 μCi/ml d-[myo-3H]inositol in inositol-free DMEM containing 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Before the IP assay was conducted, the medium was removed, and cells were washed again as above. Cells were then preincubated with 0.5 ml of buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 8 mm glucose, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml BSA containing 10 mm LiCl) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of GnRH peptides for an additional 60 min. This was shown to be within the linear period of the assay. The stimulation was terminated by the removal of the medium and the addition of 200 μl of 10 mm formic acid. The 3H-labeled IPs were isolated from the formic acid extracts using 300 μl of Dowex AG 1-X8 ion exchange resin in 96-well MultiScreen filtration plates, collected with 1 m ammonium formate/0.1 m formic acid, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Binding curves were fitted to a one-site model of binding using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego), yielding an IC50 value. The mutant receptor expression levels (Rexp) were expressed relative to a wild-type control included in each transfection. IP dose-response curves were fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response model, yielding a basal activity, a maximum response (Emax), and an EC50 value.

In our current GnRH receptor models, the 7-TM domains were constructed based on β2-AR and opsin, whereas the ECLs and intracellular loops were modeled ab initio by means of a molecular mechanics-based algorithm implemented in LOOPER (28Spassov V.Z. Flook P.K. Yan L. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which often finds near native loop conformations. Because of the length limitation (maximum 25 amino acids) of the LOOPER program and the fact that ECL2 is pinned to the extracellular end of TM3 by a highly conserved disulfide bond (Cys114–Cys196), the ECL2 of GnRH receptor was built as N (Gly172–Cys196, ECL2a)- and C-terminal segments (Cys196–Ala209, ECL2b) by LOOPER. The models were then subjected to energy minimization and MD simulations in the membrane environments. Our molecular modeling shows that the residues at the N terminus of ECL2 (Gly172(4.58)–Met180(4.66)) of the human GnRH receptor form a helical extension from TM4 (Fig. 1B), which leaves ECL2 with a trajectory similar to that of β-ARs. It is noteworthy that Phe178 faces toward the binding pocket in the current model, but it pointed away from the binding pocket in the rhodopsin-based homology models prior to refinements. To validate our modeling predictions, Ala-scanning mutagenesis studies were applied to the residues from Pro173(4.59) to Met180(4.66) of the human GnRH receptor. When 125I-[His5,d-Tyr6]GnRH I, a traditional, labeled peptide agonist in the laboratory, was used for receptor binding assays, we found that Ala mutation of Phe178(4.64) displayed little binding. Because mutations of the GnRH receptor often have less effect on the mutant receptor binding affinity for peptide antagonists (10Coetsee M. Millar R.P. Flanagan C.A. Lu Z.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10305-10313Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Stewart A.J. Sellar R. Wilson D.J. Millar R.P. Lu Z.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), 125I-Teverelix, a water-soluble peptide antagonist, was applied to validate the mutant receptor binding. Surprisingly, the mutant F178A displayed a markedly increased receptor cell surface expression level as compared with the wild type (see below). Hence, we used 125I-Teverelix as a labeled ligand for all receptor binding assays. This preliminary result indicated that Ala mutation of Phe178(4.64) led to a markedly decreased receptor binding affinity for peptide agonist but not a decreased receptor expression. In view of the fact that the Ala mutation of Phe178(4.64) caused a large effect on [His5,d-Tyr6]GnRH I binding affinity, we further mutated this residue to Trp and Leu to examine the role of the aromatic ring in GnRH binding. Homologous competition binding experiments of 125I-Teverelix on intact cells transiently transfected with wild-type and mutant receptors demonstrated little or only a marginal shift in affinity for any of the mutants compared with the pIC50 of the wild-type receptor, 8.34 ± 0.11 (4.6 nm, Table 1). The mutants P173A, L175A, Y176A, and R179A gave 3–6-fold increases in the IC50 values. Therefore, in most cases, the B0 values of the specific binding measured in the absence of competitive ligands reflect the relative expression levels (Rexp) of receptors on the cell surface. Overall there were reductions in cell surface expression of the mutant receptors except for the F178A mutant, which displayed approximately a 3-fold increase in cell surface expression (Table 1). The cell surface expression levels of the mutants with greatly reduced Rexp (less than one-fourth of the wild type: L175A, F178L, and R179A mutant receptors) were rescued by a non-peptide antagonist, NBI-42902 (26Tucci F.C.

We propose that this cell-permeant small molecule may also act as a pharmacological chaperone to stabilize the receptor structure, increasing trafficking through the ER, preventing degradation of misfolded receptors in a fashion similar to that of IN3 (8Lu Z.L.

Here we provide evidence that GPBP-1 accumulates in the cytoplasm of differentiating mouse myoblasts prior to myosin synthesis. Myoblasts deficient in GPBP-1 display defective myofibril formation, whereas myofibrils assemble with enhanced efficiency in those overexpressing GPBP-1. We also show that GPBP-1 targets the previously unidentified GIP130 (GPBP-interacting protein of 130 kDa), which binds to myosin and promotes its myofibrillar assembly. This report reveals that GPBP-1 directs myofibril formation, an observation that expands its reported role in supramolecular organization of structural proteins to the intracellular compartment."
