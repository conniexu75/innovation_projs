Glutamic and aspartic acids, glutamine, glutathione, and y-aminobutyric acid were isolated from blood, brain, and liver, and their specific activities were determined. The data indicate a significant incorporation of CO2 into the amino acids of the cerebral cortex, presumably by way of the citric acid cycle. Without simultaneous ammonia infusion, the specific activity of aspartic acid is 3 times that of glutamine, whereas in the presence of ammonia the ratios of specific activity of both compounds are closer to unity or reversed. The data suggest that in the presence of ammonia the oxaloacetic acid is channeled into glutamine formation. y-Aminobutyric acid iso- lated from the tissue, as well as that obtained after decarboxyla- tion of glutamic acid or glutamine, has less than 5% of the counts of the precursor. These findings give additional support to the assumption that the operation of a CO2 fixation mech- anism in brain is similar to that in liver. Additional data on the compartmentation of glutamic acid and glutamine synthesis are presented."

The number of reactive SH groups is two per @ chain (i.e. eight per mole), although the same j3 chains in hemoglobin A contain only o?ze reactive -SH group per chain. 2. Hemoglobin H has no Bohr effect. 3. Its oxygen affinity is approximately 10 times that of hemo- globin A and its oxygen dissociation curve shows no evidence of heme-heme interaction. This behavior is duplicated by hemoglobin A in 6 M urea as shown by Rosi-Fanelli et at. 4. It is concluded that interactions between (Y and @ chains are essential for the normal oxygen affinity of hemoglobin A as well as for the variation of this parameter with oxygenation and pH value.

https://openalex.org/W2043968066,The eyes of living immersed herring and silversides are farsighted and require greater hypermetropic correction for lateral vision than for anterior vision. Comparisons of lens-to-retina distances in frozen material with focal lengths of lenses are consistent with the degree of hypermetropy found by retinoscopy.

https://openalex.org/W1596787672,The pharmacodynamic effects of lipid-soluble material in human seminal plasma and male accessory glands have been shown by researchers who demonstrated that such material stimulates different smooth muscle organs and contains a blood pressure-lowering principle. Prostaglandins E1 and F1 have both been identified in the male organs of sheep. Prostaglandin E1 causes a lowering of blood pressure while both of these prostaglandins stimulate smooth muscle activity. An experiment is described wherein human seminal plasma samples were subjected to laboratory procedures including paper chromatography column chromatography and treatment with alkali. Mass spectrometry and cocrystallization exposed the existence of prostaglandin E1 in the human seminal samples.

https://openalex.org/W2033036408,"A single exposure of mice of a low-leukemic strain (C57B1/6) to 400 r of total-body x-irradiation caused the early appearance of a factor which, though not itself capable of inducing leukemia in adult C57B1 recipients, did cause its appearance when the recipients also received urethan by injection. Positive results were obtained with seven different tissues from irradiated animals, whether urethan was injected 1 day or 30 days after the irradiation. No such effect was obtained in either series in the absence of urethan treatment. When urethan was injected into normal C57B1 mice, or into mice previously implanted with tissues from nonirradiated mice, only marginal leukemogenic activity was evinced. The possible involvement of a precursor virus is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2047735235,"WE have prepared deuterated bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (Armour, lot 381–059) by the procedures of Hermans and Scheraga1. Both RNaseH20 (all but 20 exchangeable H's exchanged) and RNase all-deuterated crystallized from 55 per cent (v/v) aqueous 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (deuterated solvent) in form II2. The intensities of the X-ray reflexions along the principal axes were identical within experimental precision to those of non-deuterated crystals out to 2θ = 60° (1.5 Å. resolution); at higher angles RNase gives poor reflexions. The lattice constants were identical to those of undeuterated crystals within the normal variation (± 0.05 Å. and ± 0.03°). The small differences between deuterium bonds and hydrogen bonds do not change the structure of RNase within the limits observable by X-ray diffraction. Detectable changes might be produced in the case of a crystallizable protein with a transition temperature near room temperature instead of the high transition temperature (61° C.) of RNase2."

https://openalex.org/W2039843790,"HEDGES1 pointed out that critical condition and mobilization of material are factors common to the Liesegang phenomenon. Mobilization occurs when the critical condition is being approached, with the material diffusing from the zones which become clear spaces to those which become rings. Spiers and Augustin2, in their theory of the one-dimensional immunodiffusional problem, assumed a zone of reaction in which antigen and antibody combine to form non-diffusing complexes, causing diffusion of the antibody into the zone. Here, experimental evidence is given that inward diffusion actually occurs during precipitation with specific proteins as well as with crystalloids, and results in the occurrence of the translucent zone."
