https://openalex.org/W2018838463,"Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of loci for common diseases, but, for the majority of these, the mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility remain unknown. Most associated variants are not correlated with protein-coding changes, suggesting that polymorphisms in regulatory regions probably contribute to many disease phenotypes. Here we describe the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, which will establish a resource database and associated tissue bank for the scientific community to study the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in human tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1973431219,"Two-photon intravital imaging is used here to define the regulation of interstitial neutrophil migration at local sites of cell death upon sterile tissue injury and infection; leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is shown to act between neutrophils as a signal relay molecule that acts to enhance the radius of neutrophil recruitment within the inflamed interstitium, and also to control, in concert with integrin receptors, dense neutrophil clustering for tight wound seal formation. Neutrophils, key components of the innate immune defence system, also help in wound healing after tissue damage. How these cells leave the bloodstream to reach sites of infection or damage has been well characterized, but less is known about how they find their way outside the bloodstream and move to the site of infection or damage. Using intravital dynamic two-photon imaging Ronald Germain and colleagues examine the behaviour of neutrophils in a new model of skin sterile cell damage. The study shows that neutrophil production of the lipid leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is required for long-distance neutrophil recruitment and initial cluster formation. Subsequent dense cluster formation and the rearrangement of the collagen fibre network at centre of the wound, generating a collagen-free zone and sealing off the wound from surrounding tissue, requires LTB4 as well as integrins. Neutrophil recruitment from blood to extravascular sites of sterile or infectious tissue damage is a hallmark of early innate immune responses, and the molecular events leading to cell exit from the bloodstream have been well defined1,2. Once outside the vessel, individual neutrophils often show extremely coordinated chemotaxis and cluster formation reminiscent of the swarming behaviour of insects3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. The molecular players that direct this response at the single-cell and population levels within the complexity of an inflamed tissue are unknown. Using two-photon intravital microscopy in mouse models of sterile injury and infection, we show a critical role for intercellular signal relay among neutrophils mediated by the lipid leukotriene B4, which acutely amplifies local cell death signals to enhance the radius of highly directed interstitial neutrophil recruitment. Integrin receptors are dispensable for long-distance migration12, but have a previously unappreciated role in maintaining dense cellular clusters when congregating neutrophils rearrange the collagenous fibre network of the dermis to form a collagen-free zone at the wound centre. In this newly formed environment, integrins, in concert with neutrophil-derived leukotriene B4 and other chemoattractants, promote local neutrophil interaction while forming a tight wound seal. This wound seal has borders that cease to grow in kinetic concert with late recruitment of monocytes and macrophages at the edge of the displaced collagen fibres. Together, these data provide an initial molecular map of the factors that contribute to neutrophil swarming in the extravascular space of a damaged tissue. They reveal how local events are propagated over large-range distances, and how auto-signalling produces coordinated, self-organized neutrophil-swarming behaviour that isolates the wound or infectious site from surrounding viable tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1963557285,"Epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of epilepsies with poor prognosis, of which the majority are of unknown etiology. We perform targeted massively parallel resequencing of 19 known and 46 candidate genes for epileptic encephalopathy in 500 affected individuals (cases) to identify new genes involved and to investigate the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in known genes. Overall, we identified pathogenic mutations in 10% of our cohort. Six of the 46 candidate genes had 1 or more pathogenic variants, collectively accounting for 3% of our cohort. We show that de novo CHD2 and SYNGAP1 mutations are new causes of epileptic encephalopathies, accounting for 1.2% and 1% of cases, respectively. We also expand the phenotypic spectra explained by SCN1A, SCN2A and SCN8A mutations. To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of cases with epileptic encephalopathies to undergo targeted resequencing. Implementation of this rapid and efficient method will change diagnosis and understanding of the molecular etiologies of these disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1994270731,"Oxidative damage from elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes to ischemia-reperfusion injury in myocardial infarction and stroke. The mechanism by which the increase in ROS occurs is not known, and it is unclear how this increase can be prevented. A wide variety of nitric oxide donors and S-nitrosating agents protect the ischemic myocardium from infarction, but the responsible mechanisms are unclear. Here we used a mitochondria-selective S-nitrosating agent, MitoSNO, to determine how mitochondrial S-nitrosation at the reperfusion phase of myocardial infarction is cardioprotective in vivo in mice. We found that protection is due to the S-nitrosation of mitochondrial complex I, which is the entry point for electrons from NADH into the respiratory chain. Reversible S-nitrosation of complex I slows the reactivation of mitochondria during the crucial first minutes of the reperfusion of ischemic tissue, thereby decreasing ROS production, oxidative damage and tissue necrosis. Inhibition of complex I is afforded by the selective S-nitrosation of Cys39 on the ND3 subunit, which becomes susceptible to modification only after ischemia. Our results identify rapid complex I reactivation as a central pathological feature of ischemia-reperfusion injury and show that preventing this reactivation by modification of a cysteine switch is a robust cardioprotective mechanism and hence a rational therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2012509205,"Neurons in the prefrontal cortex exhibit diverse behavioural correlates, an observation that has been attributed to cell-type diversity. To link identified neuron types with network and behavioural functions, we recorded from the two largest genetically defined inhibitory interneuron classes, the perisomatically targeting parvalbumin (PV) and the dendritically targeting somatostatin (SOM) neurons in anterior cingulate cortex of mice performing a reward foraging task. Here we show that PV and a subtype of SOM neurons form functionally homogeneous populations showing a double dissociation between both their inhibitory effects and behavioural correlates. Out of several events pertaining to behaviour, a subtype of SOM neurons selectively responded at reward approach, whereas PV neurons responded at reward leaving and encoded preceding stay duration. These behavioural correlates of PV and SOM neurons defined a behavioural epoch and a decision variable important for foraging (whether to stay or to leave), a crucial function attributed to the anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, PV neurons could fire in millisecond synchrony, exerting fast and powerful inhibition on principal cell firing, whereas the inhibitory effect of SOM neurons on firing output was weak and more variable, consistent with the idea that they respectively control the outputs of, and inputs to, principal neurons. These results suggest a connection between the circuit-level function of different interneuron types in regulating the flow of information and the behavioural functions served by the cortical circuits. Moreover, these observations bolster the hope that functional response diversity during behaviour can in part be explained by cell-type diversity."
https://openalex.org/W1661597557,"It is widely accepted that the complex dynamics characteristic of recurrent neural circuits contributes in a fundamental manner to brain function. Progress has been slow in understanding and exploiting the computational power of recurrent dynamics for two main reasons: nonlinear recurrent networks often exhibit chaotic behavior and most known learning rules do not work in robust fashion in recurrent networks. Here we address both these problems by demonstrating how random recurrent networks (RRN) that initially exhibit chaotic dynamics can be tuned through a supervised learning rule to generate locally stable neural patterns of activity that are both complex and robust to noise. The outcome is a novel neural network regime that exhibits both transiently stable and chaotic trajectories. We further show that the recurrent learning rule dramatically increases the ability of RRNs to generate complex spatiotemporal motor patterns, and accounts for recent experimental data showing a decrease in neural variability in response to stimulus onset."

https://openalex.org/W2046073277,"A complex interaction of signalling events, including the Wnt pathway, regulates sprouting of blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature during angiogenesis. Here we show that two distinct mutations in the (uro)chordate-specific gumby (also called Fam105b) gene cause an embryonic angiogenic phenotype in gumby mice. Gumby interacts with disheveled 2 (DVL2), is expressed in canonical Wnt-responsive endothelial cells and encodes an ovarian tumour domain class of deubiquitinase that specifically cleaves linear ubiquitin linkages. A crystal structure of gumby in complex with linear diubiquitin reveals how the identified mutations adversely affect substrate binding and catalytic function in line with the severity of their angiogenic phenotypes. Gumby interacts with HOIP (also called RNF31), a key component of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex, and decreases linear ubiquitination and activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription. This work provides support for the biological importance of linear (de)ubiquitination in angiogenesis, craniofacial and neural development and in modulating Wnt signalling."
https://openalex.org/W1992641640,"Monocytes play an important part in the clearance of pathogens during infection. Yasmine Belkaid and her colleagues now report that inflammatory monocytes can also have a regulatory role. Specifically, these cells can mitigate the tissue damage induced by neutrophils during infection of mice with Toxoplasma gondii by releasing prostaglandin E2 in response to commensal bacteria. The commensal flora can promote both immunity to pathogens and mucosal inflammation. How commensal-driven inflammation is regulated in the context of infection remains poorly understood. Here, we show that during acute mucosal infection of mice with Toxoplasma gondii, inflammatory monocytes acquire a tissue-specific regulatory phenotype associated with production of the lipid mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Notably, in response to commensals, inflammatory monocytes can directly inhibit neutrophil activation in a PGE2-dependent manner. Further, in the absence of inflammatory monocytes, mice develop severe neutrophil-mediated pathology in response to pathogen challenge that can be controlled by PGE2 analog treatment. Complementing these findings, inhibition of PGE2 led to enhanced neutrophil activation and host mortality after infection. These data demonstrate a previously unappreciated dual action of inflammatory monocytes in controlling pathogen expansion while limiting commensal-mediated damage to the gut. Collectively, our results place inflammatory monocyte–derived PGE2 at the center of a commensal-driven regulatory loop required to control host-commensal dialog during pathogen-induced inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2124756504,"Transposable element (TE)-derived sequences comprise half of the human genome and DNA methylome and are presumed to be densely methylated and inactive. Examination of genome-wide DNA methylation status within 928 TE subfamilies in human embryonic and adult tissues identified unexpected tissue-specific and subfamily-specific hypomethylation signatures. Genes proximal to tissue-specific hypomethylated TE sequences were enriched for functions important for the relevant tissue type, and their expression correlated strongly with hypomethylation within the TEs. When hypomethylated, these TE sequences gained tissue-specific enhancer marks, including monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) and occupancy by p300, and a majority exhibited enhancer activity in reporter gene assays. Many such TEs also harbored binding sites for transcription factors that are important for tissue-specific functions and showed evidence of evolutionary selection. These data suggest that sequences derived from TEs may be responsible for wiring tissue type-specific regulatory networks and may have acquired tissue-specific epigenetic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2147953935,"Genetic mapping on fully sequenced individuals is transforming understanding of the relationship between molecular variation and variation in complex traits. Here we report a combined sequence and genetic mapping analysis in outbred rats that maps 355 quantitative trait loci for 122 phenotypes. We identify 35 causal genes involved in 31 phenotypes, implicating new genes in models of anxiety, heart disease and multiple sclerosis. The relationship between sequence and genetic variation is unexpectedly complex: at approximately 40% of quantitative trait loci, a single sequence variant cannot account for the phenotypic effect. Using comparable sequence and mapping data from mice, we show that the extent and spatial pattern of variation in inbred rats differ substantially from those of inbred mice and that the genetic variants in orthologous genes rarely contribute to the same phenotype in both species."
https://openalex.org/W2069463866,"Lipid droplets have a key role in the assembly of hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles in liver cells. Jake Liang and colleagues now report that a host factor, IκB kinase-α is required for efficient production of HCV by increasing cellular lipid droplet content through its regulation of lipogenic genes in infected cells. The findings provide insight into some of the metabolic changes induced by HCV infection and may offer a new potential therapeutic target. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) interacts extensively with host factors to not only establish productive infection but also trigger unique pathological processes. Our recent genome-wide siRNA screen demonstrated that IκB kinase-α (IKK-α) is a crucial host factor for HCV. Here we describe a new nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-independent and kinase-mediated nuclear function of IKK-α in HCV assembly. HCV, through its 3′ untranslated region, interacts with DEAD box polypeptide 3, X-linked (DDX3X) to activate IKK-α, which translocates to the nucleus and induces a CBP/p300-mediated transcriptional program involving sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). This innate pathway induces lipogenic genes and enhances core-associated lipid droplet formation to facilitate viral assembly. Chemical inhibitors of IKK-α suppress HCV infection and IKK-α–induced lipogenesis, offering a proof-of-concept approach for new HCV therapeutic development. Our results show that HCV uses a novel mechanism to exploit intrinsic innate responses and hijack lipid metabolism, which may contribute to high chronicity rates and the pathological hallmark of steatosis in HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2105096193,"Our understanding of the bile acid metabolism is limited by the fact that previous analyses have primarily focused on a selected few circulating bile acids; the bile acid profiles of the liver and gastrointestinal tract pools are rarely investigated. Here, we determined how chronic ethanol consumption altered the bile acids in multiple body compartments (liver, gastrointestinal tract, and serum) of rats. Rats were fed a modified Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet with 38% of calories as ethanol (the amount equivalent of 4–5 drinks in humans). While conjugated bile acids predominated in the liver (98.3%), duodenum (97.8%), and ileum (89.7%), unconjugated bile acids comprised the largest proportion of measured bile acids in serum (81.2%), the cecum (97.7%), and the rectum (97.5%). In particular, taurine-conjugated bile acids were significantly decreased in the liver and gastrointestinal tract of ethanol-treated rats, while unconjugated and glycine-conjugated species increased. Ethanol consumption caused increased expression of genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis, efflux transport, and reduced expression of genes regulating bile acid influx transport in the liver. These results provide an improved understanding of the systemic modulations of bile acid metabolism in mammals through the gut-liver axis.—Xie, G., Zhong, W., Li, H., Li, Q., Qiu, Y., Zheng, X., Chen, H., Zhao, X., Zhang, S., Zhou, Z., Zeisel, S.

https://openalex.org/W2059315304,"The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 has critical roles in immune signalling, but how mutations in SHP-1 cause inflammatory disease in humans remains poorly defined. Mice homozygous for the Tyr208Asn amino acid substitution in the carboxy terminus of SHP-1 (referred to as Ptpn6(spin) mice) spontaneously develop a severe inflammatory syndrome that resembles neutrophilic dermatosis in humans and is characterized by persistent footpad swelling and suppurative inflammation. Here we report that receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1)-regulated interleukin (IL)-1α production by haematopoietic cells critically mediates chronic inflammatory disease in Ptpn6(spin) mice, whereas inflammasome signalling and IL-1β-mediated events are dispensable. IL-1α was also crucial for exacerbated inflammatory responses and unremitting tissue damage upon footpad microabrasion of Ptpn6(spin) mice. Notably, pharmacological and genetic blockade of the kinase RIP1 protected against wound-induced inflammation and tissue damage in Ptpn6(spin) mice, whereas RIP3 deletion failed to do so. Moreover, RIP1-mediated inflammatory cytokine production was attenuated by NF-κB and ERK inhibition. Together, our results indicate that wound-induced tissue damage and chronic inflammation in Ptpn6(spin) mice are critically dependent on RIP1-mediated IL-1α production, whereas inflammasome signalling and RIP3-mediated necroptosis are dispensable. Thus, we have unravelled a novel inflammatory circuit in which RIP1-mediated IL-1α secretion in response to deregulated SHP-1 activity triggers an inflammatory destructive disease that proceeds independently of inflammasomes and programmed necrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2022755336,"Objectives To analyze the clinical and immunological characteristics at enrollment in a large prospective cohort of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and to investigate the association between serum BAFF, beta2-microglobulin and free light chains of immunoglobulins and systemic disease activity at enrollment. Methods Three hundred and ninety five patients with pSS according to American-European Consensus Criteria were included from fifteen centers of Rheumatology and Internal Medicine in the “Assessment of Systemic Signs and Evolution of Sjögren's Syndrome” (ASSESS) 5-year prospective cohort. At enrollment, serum markers were assessed as well as activity of the disease measured with the EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI). Results Patient median age was 58 (25th–75th: 51–67) and median disease duration was 5 (2–9) years. Median ESSDAI at enrollment was 2 (0–7) with 30.9% of patients having features of systemic involvement. Patients with elevated BAFF, beta2-microglobulin and kappa, lambda FLCS had higher ESSDAI scores at enrollment (4 [2]–[11] vs 2 [0–7], P = 0.03; 4 [1]–[11] vs 2 [0–7], P< 0.0001); 4 [2]–[10] vs 2 [0–6.6], P< 0.0001 and 4 [2–8.2] vs 2 [0–7.0], P = 0.02, respectively). In multivariate analysis, increased beta2-microglobulin, kappa and lambda FLCs were associated with a higher ESSDAI score. Median BAFF and beta2-microglobulin were higher in the 16 patients with history of lymphoma (1173.3(873.1–3665.5) vs 898.9 (715.9–1187.2) pg/ml, P = 0.01 and 2.6 (2.2–2.9) vs 2.1 (1.8–2.6) mg/l, P = 0.04, respectively). Conclusion In pSS, higher levels of beta2-microglobulin and free light chains of immunoglobulins are associated with increased systemic disease activity."
https://openalex.org/W2093999424,"Life-history traits controlling the duration and timing of developmental phases in the life cycle jointly determine fitness. Therefore, life-history traits studied in isolation provide an incomplete view on the relevance of life-cycle variation for adaptation. In this study, we examine genetic variation in traits covering the major life history events of the annual species Arabidopsis thaliana: seed dormancy, vegetative growth rate and flowering time. In a sample of 112 genotypes collected throughout the European range of the species, both seed dormancy and flowering time follow a latitudinal gradient independent of the major population structure gradient. This finding confirms previous studies reporting the adaptive evolution of these two traits. Here, however, we further analyze patterns of co-variation among traits. We observe that co-variation between primary dormancy, vegetative growth rate and flowering time also follows a latitudinal cline. At higher latitudes, vegetative growth rate is positively correlated with primary dormancy and negatively with flowering time. In the South, this trend disappears. Patterns of trait co-variation change, presumably because major environmental gradients shift with latitude. This pattern appears unrelated to population structure, suggesting that changes in the coordinated evolution of major life history traits is adaptive. Our data suggest that A. thaliana provides a good model for the evolution of trade-offs and their genetic basis."
https://openalex.org/W2146246868,"Hospitalization for major surgery or critical illness often associates with cognitive decline. Inflammation and dysregulation of the innate immune system can exert broad effects in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS), yet the mechanisms underlying memory impairment after surgery remain poorly understood and without effective therapy. Endogenous regulation of acute inflammation is providing novel approaches to treat several disease states including sepsis, pain, obesity and diabetes. Resolvins are potent endogenous lipid mediators biosynthesized during the resolution phase of acute inflammation that display immunoresolvent actions. Here, using a mouse model of surgery-induced cognitive decline we report that orthopedic surgery affects hippocampal neuronal-glial function, including synaptic transmission and plasticity. Systemic prophylaxis with aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1: 7S,8R,17R-trihydroxy-4Z,9E,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid, as little as 100 ng dose per mouse) improved memory decline following surgery and abolished signs of synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, delayed administration 24 h after surgery also attenuated signs of neuronal dysfunction postoperatively. AT-RvD1 also limited peripheral damage by modulating the release of systemic interleukin (IL)-6 and improved other clinical markers of tissue injury. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel role of AT-RvD1 in modulating the proinflammatory milieu after aseptic injury and protecting the brain from neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. These findings provide novel and safer approaches to treat postoperative cognitive decline and potentially other forms of memory dysfunctions.—Terrando, N., Gómez-Galán, M., Yang, T., Carlström, M., Gustavsson, D., Harding, R.

https://openalex.org/W2023013441,"Bernard Keavney, Judith Goodship and colleagues report a genome-wide association study of congenital heart disease and identify a region on chromosome 4p16 associated with risk of atrial septal defect. We carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of congenital heart disease (CHD). Our discovery cohort comprised 1,995 CHD cases and 5,159 controls and included affected individuals from each of the 3 major clinical CHD categories (with septal, obstructive and cyanotic defects). When all CHD phenotypes were considered together, no region achieved genome-wide significant association. However, a region on chromosome 4p16, adjacent to the MSX1 and STX18 genes, was associated (P = 9.5 × 10−7) with the risk of ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) in the discovery cohort (N = 340 cases), and this association was replicated in a further 417 ASD cases and 2,520 controls (replication P = 5.0 × 10−5; odds ratio (OR) in replication cohort = 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19–1.65; combined P = 2.6 × 10−10).

https://openalex.org/W2015091165,"Microsomal cytochrome b5 (cytb5) is a membrane-bound protein that modulates the catalytic activity of its redox partner, cytochrome P4502B4 (cytP450). Here, we report the first structure of full-length rabbit ferric microsomal cytb5 (16 kDa), incorporated in two different membrane mimetics (detergent micelles and lipid bicelles). Differential line broadening of the cytb5 NMR resonances and site-directed mutagenesis data were used to characterize the cytb5 interaction epitope recognized by ferric microsomal cytP450 (56 kDa). Subsequently, a data-driven docking algorithm, HADDOCK (high ambiguity driven biomolecular docking), was used to generate the structure of the complex between cytP4502B4 and cytb5 using experimentally derived restraints from NMR, mutagenesis, and the double mutant cycle data obtained on the full-length proteins. Our docking and experimental results point to the formation of a dynamic electron transfer complex between the acidic convex surface of cytb5 and the concave basic proximal surface of cytP4502B4. The majority of the binding energy for the complex is provided by interactions between residues on the C-helix and β-bulge of cytP450 and residues at the end of helix α4 of cytb5. The structure of the complex allows us to propose an interprotein electron transfer pathway involving the highly conserved Arg-125 on cytP450 serving as a salt bridge between the heme propionates of cytP450 and cytb5. We have also shown that the addition of a substrate to cytP450 likely strengthens the cytb5-cytP450 interaction. This study paves the way to obtaining valuable structural, functional, and dynamic information on membrane-bound complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1991019845,"Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-related chronic inflammation and interleukin-6 (IL-6) contribute to the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, we characterized TAMs and IL-6 expression in 212 biopsied NPC and 119 non-tumor nasopharyngeal epithelium (NPE) tissues by tissue array. In comparison with that in the NPE tissues, more TAM infiltrates and a higher density of IL-6 expression were detected in NPC tissues, which were associated with the poor survival of NPC patients. In contrast, little or no LPLUNC1, a regulator of inflammation, expression was detected in NPC tissues, and the levels of LPLUNC1 expression in the NPC were associated negatively with the numbers of TAMs and the levels of IL-6 expression, but positively with the survival of NPC patients. Induction of LPLUNC1 overexpression in NPC cells mitigated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1β expression or treatment of THP-1 macrophages with LPLUNC1 inhibited spontaneous and LPS-induced IL-6 expression in vitro. IL-6-promoted NPC cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, accompanied by increasing cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 expression and the Stat3 activation, but inhibiting Bax and p21 expression. Induction of LPLUNC1 overexpression inhibited NPC cell proliferation, induced NPC cell arrest, promoted NPC cell apoptosis even after IL-6 stimulation and inhibited the growth of implanted NPC tumors in vivo, which were associated with decreasing cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 expression and the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/Stat3 activation, but enhancing Bax and p21 expression. These results suggest that LPLUNC1 can inhibit inflammation and NPC growth by downregulating the Stat3 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2035393182,"Many tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are silenced through synergistic layers of epigenetic regulation including abnormal DNA hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands, repressive chromatin modifications and enhanced nucleosome deposition over transcription start sites. The protein complexes responsible for silencing of many of such TSGs remain to be identified. Our previous work demonstrated that multiple silenced TSGs in colorectal cancer cells can be partially reactivated by DNA demethylation in cells disrupted for the DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3B (DNMT1 and 3B) or by DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi). Herein, we used proteomic and functional genetic approaches to identify additional proteins that cooperate with DNMTs in silencing these key silenced TSGs in colon cancer cells. We discovered that DNMTs and the core components of the NuRD (Mi-2/nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) nucleosome remodeling complex, chromo domain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) occupy the promoters of several of these hypermethylated TSGs and physically and functionally interact to maintain their silencing. Consistent with this, we find an inverse relationship between expression of HDAC1 and 2 and these TSGs in a large panel of primary colorectal tumors. We demonstrate that DNMTs and NuRD cooperate to maintain the silencing of several negative regulators of the WNT and other signaling pathways. We find that depletion of CHD4 is synergistic with DNMT inhibition in reducing the viability of colon cancer cells in correlation with reactivation of TSGs, suggesting that their combined inhibition may be beneficial for the treatment of colon cancer. Since CHD4 has ATPase activity, our data identify CHD4 as a potentially novel drug target in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2040564571,"The cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/retinoblastoma (RB)-axis is a critical modulator of cell cycle entry and is aberrant in many human cancers. New nodes of therapeutic intervention are needed that can delay or combat the onset of malignancies. The antitumor properties and mechanistic functions of PD-0332991 (PD; a potent and selective CDK4/6 inhibitor) were investigated using human prostate cancer (PCa) models and primary tumors. PD significantly impaired the capacity of PCa cells to proliferate by promoting a robust G1-arrest. Accordingly, key regulators of the G1-S cell cycle transition were modulated including G1 cyclins D, E and A. Subsequent investigation demonstrated the ability of PD to function in the presence of existing hormone-based regimens and to cooperate with ionizing radiation to further suppress cellular growth. Importantly, it was determined that PD is a critical mediator of PD action. The anti-proliferative impact of CDK4/6 inhibition was revealed through reduced proliferation and delayed growth using PCa cell xenografts. Finally, first-in-field effects of PD on proliferation were observed in primary human prostatectomy tumor tissue explants. This study shows that selective CDK4/6 inhibition, using PD either as a single-agent or in combination, hinders key proliferative pathways necessary for disease progression and that RB status is a critical prognostic determinant for therapeutic efficacy. Combined, these pre-clinical findings identify selective targeting of CDK4/6 as a bona fide therapeutic target in both early stage and advanced PCa and underscore the benefit of personalized medicine to enhance treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W2032516771,"Breast cancer is the most common solid tumor and the second most common cause of death in women. Despite a large body of literature and progress in breast cancer research, many molecular aspects of this complex disease are still poorly understood, hindering the design of specific and effective therapeutic strategies. To identify the molecules important in breast cancer progression and metastasis, we tested the in vivo effects of inhibiting the functions of various kinases and genes involved in the regulation/modulation of the cytoskeleton by downregulating them in mouse PyMT mammary tumor cells and human breast cancer cell lines. These kinases and cytoskeletal regulators were selected based on their prognostic values for breast cancer patient survival. PyMT tumor cells, in which a selected gene was stably knocked down were injected into the tail veins of mice, and the formation of tumors in the lungs was monitored. One of the several genes found to be important for tumor growth in the lungs was NIMA-related kinases 2 (Nek2), a cell cycle-related protein kinase. Furthermore, Nek2 was also important for tumor growth in the mammary fat pad. In various human breast cancer cell lines, Nek2 knockdown induced aneuploidy and cell cycle arrest that led to cell death. Significantly, the breast cancer cell line most sensitive to Nek2 depletion was of the triple negative breast cancer subtype. Our data indicate that Nek2 has a pivotal role in breast cancer growth at primary and secondary sites, and thus may be an attractive and novel therapeutic target for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1994143432,"The surveillance of acid-base homeostasis is concerted by diverse mechanisms, including an activation of sensory afferents. Proton-evoked activation of rodent sensory neurons is mainly mediated by the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 and acid-sensing ion channels. In this study, we demonstrate that extracellular acidosis activates and sensitizes the human irritant receptor TRPA1 (hTRPA1). Proton-evoked membrane currents and calcium influx through hTRPA1 occurred at physiological acidic pH values, were concentration-dependent, and were blocked by the selective TRPA1 antagonist HC030031. Both rodent and rhesus monkey TRPA1 failed to respond to extracellular acidosis, and protons even inhibited rodent TRPA1. Accordingly, mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons lacking TRPV1 only responded to protons when hTRPA1 was expressed heterologously. This species-specific activation of hTRPA1 by protons was reversed in both mouse and rhesus monkey TRPA1 by exchange of distinct residues within transmembrane domains 5 and 6. Furthermore, protons seem to interact with an extracellular interaction site to gate TRPA1 and not via a modification of intracellular N-terminal cysteines known as important interaction sites for electrophilic TRPA1 agonists. Our data suggest that hTRPA1 acts as a sensor for extracellular acidosis in human sensory neurons and should thus be taken into account as a yet unrecognized transduction molecule for proton-evoked pain and inflammation. The species specificity of this property is unique among known endogenous TRPA1 agonists, possibly indicating that evolutionary pressure enforced TRPA1 to inherit the role as an acid sensor in human sensory neurons.Background: Extracellular acidosis mediates pain and inflammation by activating sensory afferent neurons.Results: Protons activate and sensitize human TRPA1 in a strongly species-specific manner encoded by transmembrane domains 5 and 6.Conclusion: Our data identify TRPA1 as an ion channel likely to mediate acid-induced pain in humans.Significance: Protons are the first known endogenous agonists of TRPA1 with species-specificity for human TRPA1. The surveillance of acid-base homeostasis is concerted by diverse mechanisms, including an activation of sensory afferents. Proton-evoked activation of rodent sensory neurons is mainly mediated by the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 and acid-sensing ion channels. In this study, we demonstrate that extracellular acidosis activates and sensitizes the human irritant receptor TRPA1 (hTRPA1). Proton-evoked membrane currents and calcium influx through hTRPA1 occurred at physiological acidic pH values, were concentration-dependent, and were blocked by the selective TRPA1 antagonist HC030031. Both rodent and rhesus monkey TRPA1 failed to respond to extracellular acidosis, and protons even inhibited rodent TRPA1. Accordingly, mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons lacking TRPV1 only responded to protons when hTRPA1 was expressed heterologously. This species-specific activation of hTRPA1 by protons was reversed in both mouse and rhesus monkey TRPA1 by exchange of distinct residues within transmembrane domains 5 and 6. Furthermore, protons seem to interact with an extracellular interaction site to gate TRPA1 and not via a modification of intracellular N-terminal cysteines known as important interaction sites for electrophilic TRPA1 agonists. Our data suggest that hTRPA1 acts as a sensor for extracellular acidosis in human sensory neurons and should thus be taken into account as a yet unrecognized transduction molecule for proton-evoked pain and inflammation. The species specificity of this property is unique among known endogenous TRPA1 agonists, possibly indicating that evolutionary pressure enforced TRPA1 to inherit the role as an acid sensor in human sensory neurons. Background: Extracellular acidosis mediates pain and inflammation by activating sensory afferent neurons. Results: Protons activate and sensitize human TRPA1 in a strongly species-specific manner encoded by transmembrane domains 5 and 6. Conclusion: Our data identify TRPA1 as an ion channel likely to mediate acid-induced pain in humans. Significance: Protons are the first known endogenous agonists of TRPA1 with species-specificity for human TRPA1. Protons interact with and modulate numerous membrane proteins within the peripheral and central nervous system and can act as excitatory or inhibitory cotransmitters regulating neuronal activity. Both ischemia and inflammation are often accompanied by pain, and the activation and sensitization of peripheral sensory neurons in both of these conditions are largely evoked by protons (1.Basbaum A.I.

Molecular physiology of proton transduction in nociceptors.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological evidence for a direct proton-evoked activation of sensory neurons was presented decades ago (3.Krishtal O.A. Pidoplichko V.I. Receptor for protons in the membrane of sensory neurons.Brain Res. 1981; 214: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and, meanwhile, the identities of several membrane proteins acting as proton sensors have been identified (4.Holzer P. Acid-sensitive ion channels and receptors.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 194: 283-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) 4The abbreviations used are: ASIC, acid-sensing ion channel; hTRPA1, human hTRPA1; mTRPA1, mouse TRPA1; rTRPA1; rhTRPA1, rhesus monkey TRPA1; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; AITC, allyl isothiocyanate; pA, picoampere; TM, transmembrane; TRP, transient receptor potential; BCTC, 4-(3-chloro-2-pyridinyl)-N-[4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenyl]-1-piperazinecarboxamide. are expressed in a large population of sensory neurons and seem to contribute to acute and inflammatory pain (1.Basbaum A.I.

ASICs generate transient Na+ currents upon modest extracellular acidification (pH < 7.0), and this response is potentiated by lactate and adenosine triphosphate, which are both released during ischemia (7.Birdsong W.T.

Stronger acidosis (pH < 6.3) also activates the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 (9.Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. The capsaicin receptor. A heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway.Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7050) Google Scholar), and more modest acidification sensitizes TRPV1 for activation by other TRPV1 agonists (10.Tominaga M. Caterina M.J. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A. Gilbert H. Skinner K. Raumann B.E. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. The cloned capsaicin receptor integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli.Neuron. 1998; 21: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar). Similar to ASICs, TRPV1 is required for nociceptive and inflammatory pain (1.Basbaum A.I. Bautista D.M. Scherrer G. Julius D.

Taking these properties of ASICs and TRPV1 into account, it is commonly assumed that they are key molecules for proton-evoked activation of sensory neurons and, thus, for proton-evoked pain (4.Holzer P. Acid-sensitive ion channels and receptors.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 194: 283-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). For obvious reasons, however, cellular studies exploring the mechanisms mediating proton-evoked activation in human sensory neurons are rare. TRPA1 is known as a receptor for a large variety of exogenous and endogenous irritants and is crucially involved in several types of pain-related behavior in rodents (11.Nilius B. Prenen J. Owsianik G. Irritating channels. The case of TRPA1.J. Physiol. 2011; 589: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12.Patapoutian A. Tate S. Woolf C.J. Transient receptor potential channels. Targeting pain at the source.Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2009; 8: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). It has been reported that both intracellular acidosis and alkalosis can activate rodent TRPA1 (13.Fujita F. Uchida K. Moriyama T. Shima A. Shibasaki K. Inada H. Sokabe T. Tominaga M.

(14.Wang Y.Y. Chang R.B. Allgood S.D. Silver W.L. Liman E.R. A TRPA1-dependent mechanism for the pungent sensation of weak acids.J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) claims that extracellular acidosis fails to activate rodent TRPA1, a previous study suggested that extracellular protons can evoke a calcium influx through human TRPA1 expressed in HEK-293 cells (16.Takahashi N. Mizuno Y. Kozai D. Yamamoto S. Kiyonaka S. Shibata T. Uchida K. Mori Y. Molecular characterization of TRPA1 channel activation by cysteine-reactive inflammatory mediators.Channels. 2008; 2: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) TRPA1 is indeed subject to a significant species specificity, and several exogenous agonists and antagonists have been shown to elicit different effects on human and rodent TRPA1 (17.Chen J.

We therefore asked if extracellular protons interact with TRPA1 in a species-specific manner. By employing patch clamp and ratiometric calcium imaging in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, we obtained data revealing the molecular basis for an unambiguous species specificity of proton-evoked activation of human TRPA1. The plasmids for human TRPA1 (hTRPA1) and hTRPA1-C621S/C641S/C665S (hTRPA1–3C) were provided by Dr. Sven-Eric Jordt (New Haven, CT). Mouse TRPA1 (mTRPA1); the chimeras mTRPA1-hTM5/6 and hTRPA1-mTM5/6; and the mutants hTRPA1-FGFATLIAM hTRPA1-FATL, hTRPA1-IAM, hTRPA1-V875G, and hTRPA1-S873L/T874L were provided by Dr. Ardem Patapoutian (La Jolla, CA). Rat TRPA1 (rTRPA1) was provided by Dr. David Julius (San Francisco, CA). Rhesus monkey TRPA1 (rhTRPA1) and the mutants were provided by Dr. Jun Chen (Abbott Laboratories, IL). All other mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II XL kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with a modified primer design (23.Liu H. Naismith J.H. An efficient one-step site-directed deletion, insertion, single and multiple-site plasmid mutagenesis protocol.BMC Biotechnol. 2008; 8: 91Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Fidelity of mutagenesis was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Plasmids were transiently expressed in HEK293t cells by using a nanofectin transfection kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (PAA, Pasching, Austria). To visualize expression for patch clamp experiments, cells were cotransfected with pEGFP-N1 (0.5 μg, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). After transfection, cells were replated into Petri dishes and used within 12–24 h for patch clamp recordings. Stably expressing hTRPA1-HEK293t cells were established by use of G418 (800 μg/ml). HEK-293t cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and was adjusted with KOH. The external calcium-free solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4) and was adjusted with tetramethylammonium hydroxide. For calcium-containing experiments we used 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (or 10 mm MES), 10 mm glucose, and 2 mm CaCl2. The osmolarity of all solutions was adjusted with glucose to 290–300 mosmol/liter. Patch pipettes were fabricated with borosilicate glass (Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) using a conventional puller (DMZ-Universal Puller, Zeitz Instrumente, Martinsried, Germany) and heat-polished to give a pipette resistance of 3–5 MΩ. Only one EGFP-cotransfected fluorescent cell/dish was used for experiments. Test solutions were applied via a gravity-driven perfusion system. Whole cell recordings were performed using a HEKA Electronics USB 10 amplifier combined with Patchmaster software (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany). Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 2 kHz. Offline analyses were carried out using Fitmaster software (HEKA) and Origin software (Origin 8.5.1 G, Origin Lab, Northampton, MA). Mean values and data for dose response curves are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed with Student's t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). For calcium imaging, DRG and HEK cells were stained by the fluorescent dye FURA-2 AM (5 μm) and 0.02% pluronic (both from Invitrogen) for 30 min. After a 15-min washout to allow ester hydrolysis, coverslips were placed in a glass chamber on an Olympus IX71 inverse microscope and superfused constantly with extracellular fluid (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES). Acetic solutions (pH 5, 6, and 6.4), carvacrol (250 μm), AITC (100 μm), and capsaicin (0.3 μm) were applied using a control unit-operated, seven-channel, gravity-driven common-outlet superfusion system. A 60 mm potassium (DRG cells) or 10 μm ionomycin stimulus (HEK cells) was applied as a control at the end of each experiment. Ca2+ influx was observed by FURA-2 excitation at 340 and 380 nm with a Polychrome V monochromator (Till Photonics). Emission was detected with corresponding filter at 510 nm. Images were exposed for 200 μs at a rate of 1 Hz with a 12-bit CCD camera (Imago Sensicam QE, Till Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). Fluorescence absorbance was analyzed with the integrated TILLvisION 4.0.1.3 software (Till Photonics). Ratios were calculated after background subtraction by setting regions of interest. Averaged results are reported as mean ± S.E. of the area under the curve (Δ ratio F340/380 nm). Culturing of DRG neurons from C57Bl/6 mice and from congenic TRPA1 as well as TRPV1 knockout mice was performed as described previously (24.Eberhardt M.J. Filipovic M.R. Leffler A. de la Roche J. Kistner K. Fischer M.J. Fleming T. Zimmermann K. Ivanovic-Burmazovic I. Nawroth P.P. Bierhaus A. Reeh P.W. Sauer S.K.

Chem. 2012; 287: 28291-28306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were killed by CO2 inhalation, and DRGs from all levels were excised and transferred to DMEM containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma Aldrich, Germany). Following treatment with 1 mg/ml collagenase and 0.1 mg/ml protease for 30 min (both from Sigma Aldrich), ganglia were dissociated using a fire-polished, silicone-coated Pasteur pipette. Isolated cells were transferred onto poly-D-lysine-coated (200 μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) coverslips and cultured in TNB 100 medium supplemented with TNB 100 lipid protein complex, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, penicillin (all from Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), and mouse NGF (100 ng/ml, Almone Laboratories, Tel Aviv, Israel) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were used for experiments within 24 h after plating. TRPA1+/− mice were provided by Drs. Kelvin Kwan and David Corey (Harvard, Boston, MA), whereas TRPV1+/− mice were a gift from Dr. John Davis (formerly of Glaxco-Smith-Kline, Harlow, UK). All procedures of this study were approved by the animal protection authorities (local district government, Ansbach, Germany). For transfection of DRG neurons with hTRPA1, DRGs from TRPA1/TRPV1 double knockout mice were used and prepared as described above. Following dissociation of DRGs, neurons were immediately transferred into electroporation cuvettes containing 100 μl of nucleofector solution and 10 μg of hTRPA1 cDNA. Cells were electroporated with an Amaxa nucleofector, program A-033 (Lonza) and plated on coverslips after a 5-min recovery period in Ca2+-free medium. Neurons that underwent the electroporation procedure without added cDNA were used as controls. Stock solutions of 100 mm carvacrol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 mm HC-030031 (Tocris, Bristol, UK) were prepared in DMSO. 1 m L-lactic acid, 100 mm DL-dithiothreitol, 100 mm amiloride, and 100 mm acrolein (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in distilled water. All stock solutions were stored at −20 °C. We first asked whether protons evoke different effects on human TRPA1 and rodent TRPA1. HEK-293t cells expressing hTRPA1, mTRPA1, or rTRPA1 were examined by means of whole cell patch clamp recordings. Because of the voltage dependence of TRPA1, currents evoked by most agonists typically exhibit an outward rectification (25.Samad A. Sura L. Benedikt J. Ettrich R. Minofar B. Teisinger J. Vlachova V. The C-terminal basic residues contribute to the chemical- and voltage-dependent activation of TRPA1.Biochem. J. 2011; 433: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of protons on hTRPA1, mTRPA1, rTRPA1, and non-transfected HEK-293t cells were first explored with 500 ms-long voltage ramps from −100 mV to 100 mV (Fig. 1). Acidic solutions with pH 7.4, 7.0, 6.4, 6.0, and 5.4 elicited a concentration-dependent activation of outwardly rectifying membrane currents on hTRPA1 with a threshold around pH 7.0 and a calculated EC50 value of 6.5 ± 0.1 (n = 6; Fig. 1, A and B). These currents were fully reversible and could be reproduced even after several applications of protons (data not shown). As is demonstrated in Fig. 1C, 100 μm of the selective TRPA1 blocker HC030031 completely and reversibly inhibited pH-evoked membrane currents in cells expressing hTRPA1 (n = 6). These proton-evoked membrane currents were never observed in control experiments on non-transfected HEK-293t cells at pH values down to pH 5.4 (Fig. 1D). However, many non-transfected cells generated a prominent outward current when pH 5.0 was applied, i.e. an effect that did not require expression of TRPA1 (data not shown). This current was reported to originate from a constitutively expressed proton-activated outwardly rectifying anion channel activated by very low pH values (26.Lambert S. Oberwinkler J. Characterization of a proton-activated, outwardly rectifying anion channel.J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 191-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, membrane currents were only investigated down to pH 5.4. In contrast to hTRPA1, both mTRPA1 (n = 12, Fig. 1E) and rTRPA1 (n = 6, F) failed to generate membrane currents when acidic solutions down to pH 5.4 were applied. To mimic a more physiological situation, we next examined proton-evoked effects in cells held constantly at −60 mV. In this configuration, protons evoked slowly activating and persistent inward currents in cells expressing hTRPA1 (Fig. 2A). These responses were concentration-dependent (pH 7.0, 43 ± 12 pA, n = 6; pH 6.0, 130 ± 26 pA, n = 5; pH 5.4, 231 ± 58 pA, n = 17) and inhibited by 100 μm HC-030031 (n = 6, Fig. 2A). Another typical property of TRPA1 is a pronounced potentiation by extracellular calcium (27.Wang Y.Y. Chang R.B. Waters H.N. McKemy D.D. Liman E.R. The nociceptor ion channel TRPA1 is potentiated and inactivated by permeating calcium ions.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32691-32703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Accordingly, 2 mm Ca2+-induced an impressive increase of proton-evoked currents through hTRPA1 (615 ± 122%, n = 6, Fig. 2B). Again, HEK-293t cells expressing mTRPA1 (Fig. 2C, n = 13) or rTRPA1 (data not shown) never generated persistent inward currents upon application of acidic solutions down to pH 5.4. Although most non-transfected cells did not produce any proton-evoked inwards currents (Fig. 2D), some non-transfected and transfected cells generated transient inward currents when challenged by acidic solutions (Fig. 2E). These currents were blocked by amiloride (100 μm, Fig. 2E) and have been reported previously to originate from constitutively expressed ASIC1a channels in HEK-293 cells (28.Gunthorpe M.J. Smith G.D. Davis J.B. Randall A.D. Characterisation of a human acid-sensing ion channel (hASIC1a) endogenously expressed in HEK293 cells.Pflugers Arch. 2001; 442: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because of their distinct kinetic properties, ASIC-like currents could easily be isolated from the slow inward currents mediated by hTRPA1. In HEK-293t cells expressing mTRPA1, we noticed that application of pH 5.4 induced a decrease in leak currents (Fig. 2C). Because this effect might be due to an inhibition of open TRPA1 channels, we further explored this effect by applying pH 5.4 on inward currents induced by acrolein or carvacrol on either hTRPA1 or mTRPA1. Although protons potentiated acrolein-evoked currents of hTRPA1 (+107 ± 37%, n = 6, Fig. 2F), they inhibited currents generated by mTRPA1 (-41 ± 6%, n = 5, G). The same species-specific differences were observed for carvacrol-evoked currents, i.e. potentiation of hTRPA1 (+210 ± 9%, n = 6, Fig. 2H) and inhibition of mTRPA1 (-91 ± 5%, n = 5, I). To substantiate the findings obtained by whole cell patch clamp recordings, we next performed Ca2+ imaging experiments. As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, the acidic solutions pH 6.4, 6.0, and 5.0 evoked an immediate (< 30 s) and only partly reversible increase of [Ca2+]i in a subset of cells responding to carvacrol (i.e. cells expressing hTRPA1; pH 6.4, 21% (31/148); pH 6.0, 45% (63/140); and pH 5.0, 48% (72/150)). In contrast, non-transfected HEK-293t cells (n = 670) and cells expressing mTRPA1 (n = 107) or rTRPA1 (n = 184) never displayed an increase of [Ca2+]i when challenged with pH 5.0 (Fig. 3, B and C). The area under the curve for proton-evoked increases of [Ca2+]i, calculated for the 60-s long application of protons, was significantly larger for hTRPA1 as compared with non-transfected cells and cells expressing mTRPA1 or rTRPA1 (Fig. 3D) (pH 5.0, all p < 0.001, analysis of variance). In contrast, the area under the curve for pH 5.0-evoked responses on mTRPA1- and rTRPA1-expressing cells were not significantly different from the area under the curve calculated for untransfected cells (p > 0.6, analysis of variance). When comparing the data obtained with patch clamp recordings as compared with those obtained with calcium imaging, the only relevant difference seems to be the finding that the majority of cells expressing hTRPA1 failed to evoked a detectable proton-evoked response in Ca2+ imaging experiments. We believe that this discrepancy between the two methods is due to an inhomogeneous transfection efficacy and the fact that protons are rather weak TRPA1 agonists as compared with carvacrol. Although patch clamp experiments only include vital cells displaying a strong expression of EGFP (and, thus, also hTRPA1), calcium imaging experiments covering large populations of cells also include cells with a low expression of hTRPA1. Nevertheless, both methods strongly indicate that hTRPA1, but not rodent TRPA1, can be directly activated by extracellular acidosis. The lack of proton-evoked responses of mTRPA1 is supported by previous studies on mouse DRG neurons, suggesting that TRPV1 is the predominant proton receptor in mouse DRG neurons (29.Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Impaired nociception and pain sensation in mice lacking the capsaicin receptor.Science. 2000; 288: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2898) Google Scholar, 30.Leffler A. Mönter B. Koltzenburg M. The role of the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 and acid-sensing ion channels (ASICS) in proton sensitivity of subpopulations of primary nociceptive neurons in rats and mice.Neuroscience. 2006; 139: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We wanted to exclude the possibility that an improper functionality of recombinant mTRPA1 in HEK-293t cells is the reason for the lack of proton sensitivity observed in our experiments. We performed Ca2+ imaging experiments on DRG neurons derived from wild-type C56BL/6, TRPV1-null, TRPA1-null, and TRPV1/TRPA1-null mice. If mTRPA1 would mediate proton-evoked responses in DRG neurons, it should be best observed in DRG neurons lacking TRPV1. However, no increase of [Ca2+]i was observed when pH 5.0 was applied for 5 min to TRPV1-null DRG neurons (Fig. 4A, n = 181). As expected, the application of pH 5.0 on wild-type DRG neurons resulted in a large increase of [Ca2+]i in 51% of all neurons (n = 35, Fig. 4B). When the TRPV1 antagonist BCTC was coapplied with pH 5.0, this TRPV1-mediated proton response was blocked completely in neurons derived from TRPA1−/− neurons (n = 118, Fig. 4C). In agreement with our patch clamp data on mTRPA1 in HEK-293t cells, pH 5.0 inhibited TRPA1-mediated responses evoked by both 50 μm AITC (n = 83, Fig. 4D) and 300 μm carvacrol (n = 93, E). These data confirm that extracellular protons inhibit rather than activate mTRPA1 and that this effect is independent of the expression system. A related question was whether proton-evoked activation of hTRPA1 was due to an overexpression in HEK-293t cells. Therefore, DRG neurons derived from TRPV1/TRPA1 double knockout mice were transfected with hTRPA1 by electroporation. This procedure rendered 13% of all neurons sensitive to the TRPA1 agonist AITC (48/379). 21% (10/48) of all AITC-sensitive DRG neurons also responded briskly to the application of pH 5.0 (Fig. 4F). Thus, again, only a fraction of cells expressing hTRPA1 responded to protons. Importantly, both AITC and pH 5.0 did not evoke any increase of [Ca2+]i in DRG neurons in which a sham transfection was performed without hTRPA1 cDNA (n = 108) (Fig. 4F). We also observed hTRPA1-mediated membrane currents being activated by pH 5.4 in transfected neuroblastoma ND7/23 cells (n = 4) (Fig. 4G).FIGURE 2Protons activate inward currents through hTRPA1. Currents were recorded in cells held at −60 mV. A, typical inward current evoked by pH 5.4 in a cell expressing hTRPA1.

https://openalex.org/W1984285831,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the major public health problems in Western countries. Recently, the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion, which results in the aberrant expression of the transcription factor ERG, has been shown to be the most common gene rearrangement in PCa. Previous studies have determined the contributions of this fusion in PCa disease initiation and/or progression in vitro and in vivo. In this study on TMPRSS2:ERG regulation in PCa, we used an androgen receptor and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion double-negative PCa cell model: PC3c. In three cell clones with different TMPRSS2:ERG expression levels, ectopic expression of the fusion resulted in significant induction of cell migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. In agreement with this phenotype, high-throughput microarray analysis revealed that a set of genes, functionally associated with cell motility and invasiveness, were deregulated in a dose-dependent manner in TMPRSS2:ERG-expressing cells. Importantly, we identified increased MMP9 (Metalloproteinase 9) and PLXNA2 (Plexin A2) expression in TMPRSS2:ERG-positive PCa samples, and their expression levels were significantly correlated with ERG expression in a PCa cohort. In line with these findings, there was evidence that TMPRSS2:ERG directly and positively regulates MMP9 and PLXNA2 expression in PC3c cells. Moreover, PLXNA2 upregulation contributed to TMPRSS2:ERG-mediated enhancements of PC3c cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, and importantly, PLXNA2 expression was upregulated in metastatic PCa tumors compared with localized primary PCa tumors. This study provides novel insights into the role of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in PCa metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2038608495,"Human colorectal cancers are known to possess multiple mutations, though how these mutations interact in tumor development and progression has not been fully investigated. We have previously described the FCPIK3ca* murine colon cancer model, which expresses a constitutively activated phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) in the intestinal epithelium. The expression of this dominantly active form of PI3K results in hyperplasia and invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas. These cancers form via a non-canonical mechanism of tumor initiation that is mediated through activation of PI3K and not through aberrations in WNT signaling. Since the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene is mutated in the majority of human colon cancers and often occurs simultaneously with PIK3CA mutations, we sought to better understand the interaction between APC and PIK3CA mutations in the mammalian intestine. In this study, we have generated mice in which the expression of a constitutively active PI3K and the loss of APC occur simultaneously in the distal small intestine and colon. Here, we demonstrate that expression of a dominant active PI3K synergizes with loss of APC activity resulting in a dramatic change in tumor multiplicity, size, morphology and invasiveness. Activation of the PI3K pathway is not able to directly activate WNT signaling through the nuclear localization of CTNNB1 (β-catenin) in the absence of aberrant WNT signaling. Alterations at the transcriptional level, including increased CCND1, may be the etiology of synergy between these activated pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2119112373,"The subcellular distribution and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was examined in skeletal muscle of healthy humans. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from m.v. lateralis before and after a 2 h bout of cycling exercise. VEGF localization was conducted on preparations of teased muscle fibers by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal microscopy (CM). Muscle interstitial fluid was sampled from microdialysis probes placed in the thigh muscle. TEM and CM analysis revealed two primary sites of localization of VEGF: in vesicles located in the subsarcolemmal regions and between the contractile elements within the muscle fibers; and in pericytes situated on the skeletal muscle capillaries. Quantitation of the subsarcolemmal density of VEGF vesicles, calculated on top of myonuclei, in the muscle fibers revealed a ~50% increase (P<0.05) after exercise. The observation of more VEGF vesicles close to sarcolemma after exercise, combined with a 5-fold increase (P<0.05) in VEGF in the interstitial fluid, suggest that VEGF-containing vesicles redistribute to sarcolemma and that VEGF is secreted to the extracellular fluid. This study provides the first evidence in humans for a mechanism by which skeletal muscle fibers can control capillary growth by releasing VEGF from intracellular vesicles during contraction.—Hoier, B., Prats, C., Qvortrup, K., Pilegaard, H., Bangsbo, J., Hellsten, Y., Subcellular localization and mechanism of secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor in human skeletal muscle.

https://openalex.org/W2004574087,"LMAN1 (ERGIC-53) is a key mammalian cargo receptor responsible for the export of a subset of glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. Together with its soluble coreceptor MCFD2, LMAN1 transports coagulation factors V (FV) and VIII (FVIII). Mutations in LMAN1 or MCFD2 cause the genetic bleeding disorder combined deficiency of FV and FVIII (F5F8D). The LMAN1 carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) binds to both glycoprotein cargo and MCFD2 in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. To understand the biochemical basis and regulation of LMAN1 binding to glycoprotein cargo, we solved crystal structures of the LMAN1-CRD bound to Man-α-1,2-Man, the terminal carbohydrate moiety of high mannose glycans. Our structural data, combined with mutagenesis and in vitro binding assays, define the central mannose-binding site on LMAN1 and pinpoint histidine 178 and glycines 251/252 as critical residues for FV/FVIII binding. We also show that mannobiose binding is relatively independent of pH in the range relevant for endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi traffic, but is sensitive to lowered Ca(2+) concentrations. The distinct LMAN1/MCFD2 interaction is maintained at these lowered Ca(2+) concentrations. Our results suggest that compartmental changes in Ca(2+) concentration regulate glycoprotein cargo binding and release from the LMAN1·MCFD2 complex in the early secretory pathway."

Coenzyme Q: biosynthesis and functions.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 396: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Q is composed of a fully substituted benzoquinone ring to which is attached a polyisoprenyl tail with a number of isoprenyl units varying from one species to another (6 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 10 in humans, and 8 in Escherichia coli). Biosynthesis of Q is a highly conserved pathway that involves a large number of genes that have been identified mostly from seminal genetic studies using S. cerevisiae and E. coli (3Tran U.C. Clarke C.F. Endogenous synthesis of coenzyme Q in eukaryotes.Mitochondrion. 2007; 7: S62-S71Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 4Meganathan R. Ubiquinone biosynthesis in microorganisms.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 131-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our genetic understanding of Q biosynthesis is still incomplete, and very few Q biosynthetic proteins have been isolated and characterized biochemically. Biosynthesis of Q8 in E. coli requires 9 Ubi proteins (UbiA–H and UbiX); most of them are involved in reactions that modify the aromatic ring of the 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HB) universal precursor (Fig. 1). After prenylation of 4-HB catalyzed by UbiA, UbiX and UbiD are proposed to be involved in the decarboxylation (5Gulmezian M. Hyman K.R. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Javor G.T.

Three methylation (reactions d, f, and h, Fig. 1) and three hydroxylation reactions (on C5, C1, and C6, reactions c, e, and g, respectively) follow to yield Q8.

The genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the aerobic C1- and C6-hydroxylation reactions have been identified as ubiH and ubiF, respectively (8Kwon O. Kotsakis A. Meganathan R.

UbiF and UbiH share 32% of sequence identity and are defined as members of class A flavoprotein monooxygenases from sequence analysis (10van Berkel W.J. Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Flavoprotein monooxygenases, a diverse class of oxidative biocatalysts.J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 670-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), even though they have not been isolated in pure form and characterized in vitro. In contrast, the gene responsible for the C5-hydroxylation reaction in E. coli (reaction c on Fig. 1) remains unknown. UbiB has been proposed to be involved in this reaction based on the accumulation of OPP (Fig. 1) in a ubiB− strain (11Cox G.B. Young I.G. McCann L.M. Gibson F. Biosynthesis of ubiquinone in Escherichia coli K-12: location of genes affecting metabolism of 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 2-octaprenylphenol.J.

However, accumulation of OPP does not necessarily reflect a defect in C5-hydroxylation because a strain deficient in the methyltransferase UbiG also accumulates OPP (13Hsu A.Y. Poon W.W.

Moreover, the primary sequence of UbiB does not contain any motif characteristic for hydroxylases but instead displays conserved motifs found in a superfamily of ancestral kinases (14Lagier-Tourenne C.

Searching the gene responsible for the C5-hydroxylation, we reasoned that visC, a gene of unknown function, could be a good candidate to investigate because it locates immediately downstream of ubiH within the same operon (9Nakahigashi K. Miyamoto K. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H.

Furthermore, visC is predicted to encode a protein with the typical domains shared by flavoprotein monooxygenases and with 30 and 39% sequence identity to UbiH and UbiF, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1) (10van Berkel W.J. Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Flavoprotein monooxygenases, a diverse class of oxidative biocatalysts.J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 670-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report genetic and biochemical experiments that unambiguously establish that VisC participates in coenzyme Q8 biosynthesis by catalyzing the aerobic C5-hydroxylation reaction. We therefore propose to change the name of VisC into UbiI. We succeeded in purifying the protein and crystallizing a truncated form of UbiI. The crystal structure shows a high degree of similarity with that of para-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) a well characterized FAD-dependent monooxygenase (15Entsch B. Cole L.J. Ballou D.P.

The mobile phase used to analyze yeast extracts was 5% isopropyl alcohol, 20% acetonitrile, and 75% of a mix of 98% methanol and 2% lithium perchlorate (1 m). Quinones were quantified with an ESA Coulochem III electrochemical detector and a 5011A analytical cell (E1, −650 mV; E2, 650 mV). Hydroquinones present in samples were oxidized with a precolumn 5020 guard cell set in oxidizing mode (E, +650 mV). Different volumes of the standard Q solutions were injected in the same conditions to correct for sample loss during the organic extraction on the basis of the recovery of the Q internal standard. Standard curves for Q4 and Q10 were used for Q6 and Q8 quantification, respectively. 12 liters of LB culture of ΔubiI cells in stationary phase were centrifuged (4000 rpm, 15 min), and cell pellet mass was determined (30 g). Lipid extraction was performed for at least ten cycles at 50 °C with 150 ml of acetone using a Soxhlet extractor. The extract was concentrated with a rotary evaporator, resuspended in chloroform and applied on a silica column (M60; Macherey Nagel). Elution of molecules was realized with 100% of chloroform. Compounds of interest were collected in glass tubes, and 4-HP8 was further purified by HPLC with 40% acetonitrile, 40% ethanol, and 20% of a mix of 90% isopropyl alcohol and 10% of water. Oxidized and reduced forms of 4-HP8 were purified based on their characteristic UV spectra (see supplemental Fig. S3D). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX 300 MHz spectrometer with D6-ethanol as solvent. Mass spectrometry measurements were carried out as described in the supplemental Materials and Methods. Overexpression of UbiI was achieved by using BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain (Novagen) transformed with pET-ubiI-His6. The cultures were grown at 37 °C until they reached A600 = 0.4 and then shifted to 20 °C for induction. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.1 mm, and growth continued overnight. All subsequent operations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 30% glycerol (v/v), and 1 mm Pefabloc (VWR). After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 90 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 30% glycerol (v/v). UbiI was eluted with 250 mm imidazole, and after imidazole removal by ultrafiltration with Amicon Ultra 30K columns (Millipore), the purified protein was found to be >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. The purified protein was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 30% glycerol (v/v). Selenomethionylated UbiI was overexpressed according to the indicated protocol (18Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Atomic structures of the human immunophilin FKBP-12 complexes with FK506 and rapamycin.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) and purified with the same protocol as the native UbiI. To optimize the conditions of limited proteolysis, experiments were first conducted on an analytical scale (500 μg of UbiI) where ratios of enzyme (trypsin) over substrate (UbiI) ranged from 1:15 to 1:1000 (w/w) in a final volume of 200 μl. Digestion time was then optimized for a fixed enzyme over substrate ratio. Tryptic digestion analysis was performed by SDS-PAGE. Large scale preparation of cleaved UbiI was then carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30% glycerol (v/v) at a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml. After 2 h of incubation of UbiI (21 mg) with trypsin (42 μg) at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of Pefabloc (1 mm), followed by analytical SDS-PAGE. The N-terminal 40-kDa domain, which lacks the C-terminal His6 tag, was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin by collecting the flow-through and concentrated to 6–8 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol. Mass spectrometry analysis (MALDI-TOF) was performed to delineate the C-terminal boundary of the N-terminal 40-kDa domain of UbiI, with the MASCOT software and Findpept tool (SiCaPS platform of IMAGIF (Gif-sur-Yvette, France). SEC-MALLS experiments were performed to determine the oligomeric state of the protein, in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol (IMAGIF Structural and Proteomic Biology Unit, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Crystals were grown at 19 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. 1 μl of protein (6–8 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 μl of precipitant solution consisting of 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.2 m MgCl2, which led to plate crystals within 2–3 days. For the selenomethionylated protein, the precipitant solution was 0.1 m Bistris propane, pH 9.0, 14% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.15 m MgCl2. Data collection and structure determination were carried out as described in the supplemental Materials and Methods. A potential binding site of FAD in UbiItr was explored using docking calculations. Comparing the binding site residues of FAD in PHBH (1PBE) with those in the crystal structure of UbiItr, we noted that a number of residues are not favorably oriented to allow the docking of FAD. Preliminary to docking calculations, a UbiItr monomer was thus prepared as follows: (i) Rotamers of Arg-49, Arg-35, and Asp-164 were selected to allow the one-step insertion of a rigid model of FAD in its extended conformation as observed in 1PBE. (ii) The binding site residues were further energy minimized using CHARMm in Discovery Studio 3.1. The resulting protein structure was then used as the receptor, and FAD was docked as a flexible ligand using Autodock software (19Trott O. Olson A.J. AutoDock Vina: improving the speed and accuracy of docking with a new scoring function, efficient optimization, and multithreading.J. Comput. Chem. 2010; 31: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (7925) Google Scholar). The docking results place FAD in a range of plausible positions spanning the length of the binding pocket of UbiItr. Among the best docked structures, we detail here a potential location of the FAD cofactor in UbiI selected for its highest similarity with the conformation observed in 1PBE. There is a rather good correspondence for ligand-receptor interactions between PHBH-FAD (1PBE) and the modeled UbiItr-FAD complex (supplemental Table S4). We constructed a ΔubiI strain in which the ORF of ubiI has been replaced with a kanamycin resistance cassette. ΔubiI cells display a growth comparable with WT cells both on glucose and on succinate media (supplemental Fig. S2A) unlike ΔubiH cells, as observed previously (9Nakahigashi K. Miyamoto K. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. Isolation and characterization of a light-sensitive mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 with a mutation in a gene that is required for the biosynthesis of ubiquinone.J.

Evaluation of the cellular content in electroactive isoprenoid quinones by using ECD of lipid extracts after separation by HPLC (17Ozeir M. Mühlenhoff U. Webert H. Lill R. Fontecave M. Pierrel F.

Involvement of mitochondrial ferredoxin and para-aminobenzoic acid in yeast coenzyme Q biosynthesis.Chem. Biol. 2010; 17: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) revealed that Q8 content in ΔubiI cells accounted for only 7% of that in WT cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, an unknown electroactive compound X could be detected (Fig. 2B). The levels of the isoprenoid naphthoquinones, demethylmenaquinone and menaquinone (MK8), were not significantly different in WT and ΔubiI cells (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2B). Transformation of ΔubiI cells with a plasmid containing the ubiI ORF restored Q8 content and abolished the accumulation of compound X (Fig. 2, A and B). ΔubiI cells grown anaerobically had a content of Q8 comparable with that in WT cells (Fig. 2, C and D), and accumulation of compound X was abolished. As expected, a strong increase in MK8 content was observed in cells grown anaerobically (21Shestopalov A.I. Bogachev A.V. Murtazina R.A. Viryasov M.B. Skulachev V.P. Aeration-dependent changes in composition of the quinone pool in Escherichia coli: evidence of post-transcriptional regulation of the quinone biosynthesis.FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Reversion of the Q8 biosynthetic defect by anaerobic growth of ΔubiI cells is reminiscent of the phenotype of a ΔubiH strain (22Alexander K. Young I.G. Alternative hydroxylases for the aerobic and anaerobic biosynthesis of ubiquinone in Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4750-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, C and D). Collectively, these data establish that UbiI is involved in aerobic Q8 biosynthesis but not in MK8 biosynthesis. Compound X was purified from ΔubiI cells and found to be present in two redox states. Analysis by high resolution mass spectrometry in positive mode gave a m/z ratio (M+H+) of 655.5445 for reduced compound X and 653.5297 for the oxidized form corresponding respectively to chemical formulas of C46H70O2 +H+ (M = C46H70O2: 654.53755; ppm, 1.3) and C46H68O2 +H+ (M = C46H68O2: 652.5219; ppm, 0). Fragmentation of the 653.5 molecular ion yielded a characteristic tropylium-like ion (C7H7O2+), often found for aromatic compounds containing a benzyl unit, in addition to fragments corresponding to loss of methine, methylene, or methyl groups of an octaprenyl tail in the molecule (supplemental Fig. S3A). These data are consistent with compound X being a phenyl ring functionalized with an octaprenyl tail and either two OH groups in the reduced (quinol) C46H70O2 molecule or two keto groups in the oxidized (quinone) C46H68O2 molecule (supplemental Fig. S3B). The 1H NMR spectrum of the purified C46H70O2 compound shows well defined peaks both in the aromatic and aliphatic regions (supplemental Fig. S3C). Most of the signals in the 3.2–5.3 ppm region could be attributed to the vinylic and allylic protons of the octaprenyl substituent. The aromatic region of the spectrum shows more relevant information. Three distinguishable massifs, each corresponding to a unique proton, can be observed at 6.44 ppm (doublet of doublet with 4J and 3J coupling constants), 6.57 ppm (doublet with a 4J coupling constant), and 6.61 ppm (doublet with a 3J coupling constant) (Fig. 2E). These results confirm a 1,2,4-trisubstitution of the phenyl ring. The NMR spectrum of the commercially available 2-methyl-4-hydroxyphenol shows a highly similar pattern with close chemical shifts and coupling constants (Fig. 2E). The NMR data thus establish that the two hydroxyl groups of the C46H70O2 compound are in para relative position. Accordingly, the UV spectra of oxidized and reduced forms of compound X and of 2-methyl-4-hydroxyphenol are comparable (supplemental Fig. S3, D and E). Collectively, all of these data identify 4-HP8 (Fig. 2F) as the compound that accumulates in ΔubiI cells. Drastic decrease of Q8 and accumulation of 4-HP8, lacking a OH or a OCH3 group at C5 are strong indications that the C5-hydroxylation reaction is deficient in E. coli ΔubiI cells and that UbiI functions as a C5-hydroxylase in Q8 biosynthesis. To verify this hypothesis, we tested whether heterologous expression of UbiI was able to complement a S. cerevisiae Δcoq6 strain which lacks the C5-hydroxylase Coq6 (17Ozeir M. Mühlenhoff U. Webert H. Lill R. Fontecave M. Pierrel F. Coenzyme Q biosynthesis: Coq6 Is required for the C5-hydroxylation reaction and substrate analogs rescue Coq6 deficiency.Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In combination with Coq8 overexpression, required for maintaining the integrity of the Q biosynthetic complex in S. cerevisiae (23Xie L.X. Ozeir M. Tang J.Y. Chen J.Y. Jaquinod S.K. Fontecave M. Clarke C.F. Pierrel F. Overexpression of the Coq8 kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae coq-null mutants allows for accumulation of diagnostic intermediates of the coenzyme Q6 biosynthetic pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23571-23581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the mitochondria-targeted E. coli UbiI protein was found to partially restore respiratory growth of Δcoq6 cells on lactate-glycerol medium, a process that requires coenzyme Q (Fig. 3A). HPLC-ECD analysis of cellular lipid extracts of Δcoq6/Coq8+UbiI cells demonstrated the presence of Q6 together with 4-HP6 (Fig. 3B) whereas Δcoq6/Coq8 cells accumulated exclusively 4-HP6 (17Ozeir M. Mühlenhoff U. Webert H. Lill R. Fontecave M. Pierrel F. Coenzyme Q biosynthesis: Coq6 Is required for the C5-hydroxylation reaction and substrate analogs rescue Coq6 deficiency.Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Complementation by UbiI is not optimal but is nevertheless significant because Δcoq6/Coq8+UbiI cells contain approximately 12% of the amount of Q6 present in Δcoq6/Coq6 cells (Fig. 3C). These results establish that UbiI can function as a C5-hydroxylase in S. cerevisiae. ΔubiI cells synthesize a small amount of Q8 (Fig. 2A), reflecting that the C5-hydroxylation activity, although limited, is still taking place. To test the involvement of genes of the Q pathway in this biosynthetic activity, we constructed ΔubiF ΔubiI and ΔubiE ΔubiI mutants. ΔubiE cells accumulate the biosynthetic intermediate C2-demethyl-C6-demethoxy-Q8 (DDMQ8, peak at 6.87 min in Fig. 4A), as published before (7Lee P.T. Hsu A.Y. Ha H.T. Clarke C.F. A C-methyltransferase involved in both ubiquinone and menaquinone biosynthesis: isolation and identification of the Escherichia coli ubiE gene.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1748-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Deletion of ubiI in a ΔubiE strain led to the accumulation of 4-HP8 and of a diminished amount of DDMQ8 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, deletion of ubiI in the ΔubiF strain caused the expected accumulation of 4-HP8 but also the complete disappearance of DMQ8 (Fig. 4B), showing that the C5-hydroxylation reaction is totally abolished in the ΔubiF ΔubiI strain. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the residual C5-hydroxylase activity observed in ΔubiI cells is provided by UbiF, the C6-monooxygenase. We overexpressed and purified the UbiI-His6 protein which contains a C-terminal His6 tag. However, the protein was cofactor-free, as shown by UV-visible spectroscopy, and highly unstable, with a significant propensity to aggregate and precipitate. Limited trypsin proteolysis of UbiI-His6 generated a soluble fragment (molecular mass ∼40 kDa, supplemental Fig. S4A). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the UbiItr (supplemental Fig. S4B) together with the result that UbiItr does not bind to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, suggested that ∼35 residues at the C terminus had been removed (two cleavage sites after residue 364 and 365, respectively), as confirmed below by the crystal structure of UbiItr. The truncated UbiItr protein expressed from a plasmid was not able to complement the ΔubiI strain because the quinone profile was similar to that of ΔubiI cells containi"
https://openalex.org/W2031767743,"Malignant cells achieve replicative immortality by two alternative mechanisms, a common one dependent on de novo synthesis of telomeric DNA by telomerase, and a rare one based on telomere recombination known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforms human B-lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines with unlimited growth potential in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that newly EBV-infected cells exhibit multiple signs of telomere dysfunction, including the occurrence of extra-chromosomal telomeres, telomere fusion and telomere length heterogeneity, and undergo progressive increase in telomere length without a parallel increase in telomerase activity. This phenotype is accompanied by the accumulation of telomere-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and telomeric-sister chromatid exchange, suggesting that EBV infection promotes the activation of ALT. Newly infected cells also display a significant reduction of telomere-associated TRF2 and express low levels of TRF1, TRF2, POT1 and ATRX, pointing to telomere de-protection as an important correlate of ALT activation. Collectively, these findings highlight the involvement of recombination-dependent mechanisms for maintenance of telomere homeostasis in EBV-induced B-cell immortalization."
https://openalex.org/W2029405803,"Nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1 (NAF-1) (synonyms: Cisd2, Eris, Miner1, and Noxp70) is a [2Fe-2S] cluster protein immune-detected both in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial outer membrane. It was implicated in human pathology (Wolfram Syndrome 2) and in BCL-2 mediated antagonization of Beclin 1-dependent autophagy and depression of ER calcium stores. To gain insights about NAF-1 functions, we investigated the biochemical properties of its 2Fe-2S cluster and sensitivity of those properties to small molecules. The structure of the soluble domain of NAF-1 shows that it forms a homodimer with each protomer containing a [2Fe-2S] cluster bound by 3 Cys and one His. NAF-1 has shown the unusual abilities to transfer its 2Fe-2S cluster to an apo-acceptor protein (followed in vitro by spectrophotometry and by native PAGE electrophoresis) and to transfer iron to intact mitochondria in cell models (monitored by fluorescence imaging with iron fluorescent sensors targeted to mitochondria). Importantly, the drug pioglitazone abrogates NAF-1's ability to transfer the cluster to acceptor proteins and iron to mitochondria. Similar effects were found for the anti-diabetes and longevity-promoting antioxidant resveratrol. These results reveal NAF-1 as a previously unidentified cell target of anti-diabetes thiazolidinedione drugs like pioglitazone and of the natural product resveratrol, both of which interact with the protein and stabilize its labile [2Fe-2S] cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2029559005,"Emerging evidence indicates that Nanog is intimately involved in tumorigenesis, in part, through regulation of the cancer-initiating cell (CIC) population. However, the regulation and role of Nanog in tumorigenesis are still poorly understood. In this study, human Nanog was identified to be phosphorylated by human protein kinase Cɛ at multiple residues, including T200 and T280. Our work indicated that phosphorylation at T200 and T280 modulates Nanog function through several regulatory mechanisms. Results with phosphorylation-insensitive and phosphorylation-mimetic mutant Nanog revealed that phosphorylation at T200 and T280 enhance Nanog protein stability. Moreover, phosphorylation-insensitive T200A and T280A mutant Nanog had a dominant-negative function to inhibit endogenous Nanog transcriptional activity. Inactivation of Nanog was due to impaired homodimerization, DNA binding, promoter occupancy and p300, a transcriptional co-activator, recruitment resulting in a defect in target gene-promoter activation. Ectopic expression of phosphorylation-insensitive T200A or T280A mutant Nanog reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion, migration and the CIC population in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. The in vivo cancer-initiating ability was severely compromised in HNSCC cells expressing phosphorylation-insensitive T200A or T280A mutant Nanog; 87.5% (14/16), 12.5% (1/8), and 0% (0/8) for control, T200A, and T280A, respectively. Nanog occupied the Bmi1 promoter to directly transactivate and regulate Bmi1. Genetic ablation and rescue experiments demonstrated that Bmi1 is a critical downstream signaling node for the pleiotropic, pro-oncogenic effects of Nanog. Taken together, our study revealed, for the first time, that post-translational phosphorylation of Nanog is essential to regulate Bmi1 and promote tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2068159421,"We have recently documented that the Ca(2+)-permeable TRPV4 channel, which is abundantly expressed in distal nephron cells, mediates cellular Ca(2+) responses to elevated luminal flow. In this study, we combined Fura-2-based [Ca(2+)]i imaging with immunofluorescence microscopy in isolated split-opened distal nephrons of C57BL/6 mice to probe the molecular determinants of TRPV4 activity and subcellular distribution. We found that activation of the PKC pathway with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate significantly increased [Ca(2+)]i responses to flow without affecting the subcellular distribution of TRPV4. Inhibition of PKC with bisindolylmaleimide I diminished cellular responses to elevated flow. In contrast, activation of the PKA pathway with forskolin did not affect TRPV4-mediated [Ca(2+)]i responses to flow but markedly shifted the subcellular distribution of the channel toward the apical membrane. These actions were blocked with the specific PKA inhibitor H-89. Concomitant activation of the PKA and PKC cascades additively enhanced the amplitude of flow-induced [Ca(2+)]i responses and greatly increased basal [Ca(2+)]i levels, indicating constitutive TRPV4 activation. This effect was precluded by the selective TRPV4 antagonist HC-067047. Therefore, the functional status of the TRPV4 channel in the distal nephron is regulated by two distinct signaling pathways. Although the PKA-dependent cascade promotes TRPV4 trafficking and translocation to the apical membrane, the PKC-dependent pathway increases the activity of the channel on the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2002484499,"Prolactin controls the development and function of milk-producing breast epithelia but also supports growth and differentiation of breast cancer, especially luminal subtypes. A principal signaling mediator of prolactin, Stat5, promotes cellular differentiation of breast cancer cells in vitro, and loss of active Stat5 in tumors is associated with antiestrogen therapy failure in patients. In luminal breast cancer, progesterone induces a cytokeratin-5 (CK5)-positive basal cell-like population. This population possesses characteristics of tumor stem cells including quiescence, therapy resistance and tumor-initiating capacity. Here we report that prolactin counteracts induction of the CK5-positive population by the synthetic progestin (Pg) R5020 in luminal breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. CK5-positive cells were chemoresistant as determined by fourfold reduced rate of apoptosis following docetaxel exposure. Pg-induction of CK5 was preceded by marked upregulation of BCL6, an oncogene and transcriptional repressor critical for the maintenance of leukemia-initiating cells. Knockdown of BCL6 prevented induction of CK5-positive cell population by Pg. Prolactin suppressed Pg-induced BCL6 through Jak2-Stat5 but not Erk- or Akt-dependent pathways. In premenopausal but not postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, tumor protein levels of CK5 correlated positively with BCL6, and high BCL6 or CK5 protein levels were associated with unfavorable clinical outcome. Suppression of Pg-induction of CK5-positive cells represents a novel prodifferentiation effect of prolactin in breast cancer. The present progress may have direct implications for breast cancer progression and therapy as loss of prolactin receptor-Stat5 signaling occurs frequently and BCL6 inhibitors currently being evaluated for lymphomas may have value for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2047987355,"Matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP1) is an important mediator of tumorigenesis, inflammation and tissue remodeling through its ability to degrade critical matrix components. Recent studies indicate that stromal-derived MMP1 may exert direct oncogenic activity by signaling through protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) in carcinoma cells; however, this has not been established in vivo. We generated an Mmp1a knockout mouse to ascertain whether stromal-derived Mmp1a affects tumor growth. Mmp1a-deficient mice are grossly normal and born in Mendelian ratios; however, deficiency of Mmp1a results in significantly decreased growth and angiogenesis of lung tumors. Coimplantation of lung cancer cells with wild-type Mmp1a+/+ fibroblasts completely restored tumor growth in Mmp1a-deficient animals, highlighting the critical role of stromal-derived Mmp1a. Silencing of PAR1 expression in the lung carcinoma cells phenocopied stromal Mmp1a-deficiency, thus validating tumor-derived PAR1 as an Mmp1a target. Mmp1a secretion is controlled by the ability of its prodomain to facilitate autocleavage, whereas human MMP1 is efficiently secreted because of stable pro- and catalytic domain interactions. Taken together, these data demonstrate that stromal Mmp1a drives in vivo tumorigenesis and provide proof of concept that targeting the MMP1-PAR1 axis may afford effective treatments of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1987944017,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infection causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Modulation of the transcriptional control of cellular genes by HTLV-1 is thought to be associated with the development of ATL. The viral protein HTLV-1 basic leucine-zipper factor (HBZ) has been shown to dysregulate the activity of cellular transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate that HBZ is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway through an association with growth arrest and DNA damage gene 34 (GADD34). The N-terminal region of HBZ interacts with the C-terminal region of GADD34. HBZ contains a functional nuclear export signal (NES) sequence within its N-terminal region and it is exported from the nucleus via the CRM1-dependent pathway. Nuclear export of HBZ is essential for its interaction with GADD34 and increased phosphorylation of S6 kinase, which is an established downstream target of the mTOR pathway. Starvation-induced autophagy is significantly suppressed by the overexpression of HBZ. These findings indicate that HBZ is actively exported to the cytoplasm, where it dysregulates the function of cellular factors."
https://openalex.org/W1995710258,"Aggregation and accumulation of Aβ42 play an initiating role in Alzheimer's disease (AD); thus, selective lowering of Aβ42 by γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) remains a promising approach to AD therapy. Based on evidence suggesting that steroids may influence Aβ production, we screened 170 steroids at 10 μM for effects on Aβ42 secreted from human APP-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. Many acidic steroids lowered Aβ42, whereas many nonacidic steroids actually raised Aβ42. Studies on the more potent compounds showed that Aβ42-lowering steroids were bonafide GSMs and Aβ42-raising steroids were inverse GSMs. The most potent steroid GSM identified was 5β-cholanic acid (EC50=5.7 μM; its endogenous analog lithocholic acid was virtually equipotent), and the most potent inverse GSM identified was 4-androsten-3-one-17β-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (EC50=6.25 μM). In addition, we found that both estrogen and progesterone are weak inverse GSMs with further complex effects on APP processing. These data suggest that certain endogenous steroids may have the potential to act as GSMs and add to the evidence that cholesterol, cholesterol metabolites, and other steroids may play a role in modulating Aβ production and thus risk for AD. They also indicate that acidic steroids might serve as potential therapeutic leads for drug optimization/development.—Jung, J. I., Ladd, T. B., Kukar, T., Price, A. R., Moore, B. D., Koo, E.

https://openalex.org/W2021755549,"Multiple genetic alterations are associated with prostate carcinogenesis. Tumor-suppressor genes phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (Pten) and androgen upregulated gene 19 (U19), which encodes ELL-associated factor 2 (EAF2), are frequently inactivated or downregulated in advanced prostate cancers. Previous studies showed that EAF2 knockout caused tumors in multiple organs and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in mice. However, EAF2-knockout mice did not develop prostate cancer even at 2 years of age. To further define the roles of EAF2 in prostate carcinogenesis, we crossed the Pten+/- and EAF2+/- mice in the C57/BL6 background to generate EAF2-/-Pten+/-, Pten+/-, EAF2-/- and wild-type mice. The prostates from virgin male mice with the above four genotypes were analyzed at 7 weeks, 19 weeks and 12 months of age. Concomitant loss of EAF2 function and inactivation of one Pten allele induced spontaneous prostate cancer in 33% of the mice. Prostatic tissues from intact EAF2-/- Pten+/- mice exhibited higher levels of phospho-Akt, -p44/42 and microvessel density. Moreover, phospho-Akt remained high after castration. Consistently, there was a synergistic increase in prostate epithelial proliferation in both intact and castrated EAF2-/-Pten+/- mice. Using laser-capture microdissection coupled with real-time reverse transcription-PCR, we confirmed that co-downregulation of EAF2 and Pten occurred in >50% clinical prostate cancer specimens with Gleason scores of 8-9 (n=11), which is associated with poor prognosis. The above findings together demonstrated synergistic functional interactions and clinical relevance of concurrent EAF2 and Pten downregulation in prostate carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2011913495,"Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in mammalian cell lines positively regulates the G2/M transition. The molecular mechanism underlying this biological phenomenon remains poorly understood. Ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) is a key downstream element of the MAPK cascade. Our previous studies established roles of RSK2 in Cdc25C activation during progesterone-induced meiotic maturation of Xenopus oocytes. In this study we demonstrate that both recombinant RSK and endogenous RSK in Xenopus egg extracts phosphorylate all three isoforms of human Cdc25 at a conserved motif near the catalytic domain. In human HEK293 and PC-3mm2 cell lines, RSK preferentially phosphorylates Cdc25A and Cdc25B in mitotic cells. Phosphorylation of the RSK sites in these Cdc25 isoforms increases their M-phase-inducing activities. Inhibition of RSK-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc25 inhibits G2/M transition. Moreover, RSK is likely to be more active in mitotic cells than in interphase cells, as evidenced by the phosphorylation status of T359/S363 in RSK. Together, these findings indicate that RSK promotes G2/M transition in mammalian cells through activating phosphorylation of Cdc25A and Cdc25B."
https://openalex.org/W1992687321,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) initiates infection by adhering to integrin receptors on target cells, followed by cell entry and disassembly of the virion through acidification within endosomes. Mild heating of the virions also leads to irreversible dissociation into pentamers, a characteristic linked to reduced vaccine efficacy. In this study, the structural stability of intra- and inter-serotype chimeric SAT2 and SAT3 virus particles to various conditions including low pH, mild temperatures or high ionic strength, was compared. Our results demonstrated that while both the SAT2 and SAT3 infectious capsids displayed different sensitivities in a series of low pH buffers, their stability profiles were comparable at high temperatures or high ionic strength conditions. Recombinant vSAT2 and intra-serotype chimeric viruses were used to map the amino acid differences in the capsid proteins of viruses with disparate low pH stabilities. Four His residues at the inter-pentamer interface were identified that change protonation states at pH 6.0. Of these, the H145 of VP3 appears to be involved in interactions with A141 in VP3 and K63 in VP2, and may be involved in orientating H142 of VP3 for interaction at the inter-pentamer interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2022160043,"Specialized cytochromes P450 or catalase-related hemoproteins transform fatty acid hydroperoxides to allene oxides, highly reactive epoxides leading to cyclopentenones and other products. The stereochemistry of the natural allene oxides is incompletely defined, as are the structural features required for their cyclization. We investigated the transformation of 9S-hydroperoxylinoleic acid with the allene oxide synthase CYP74C3, a reported reaction that unexpectedly produces an allene oxide-derived cyclopentenone. Using biphasic reaction conditions at 0 °C, we isolated the initial products and separated two allene oxide isomers by HPLC at -15 °C. One matched previously described allene oxides in its UV spectrum (λmax 236 nm) and NMR spectrum (defining a 9,10-epoxy-octadec-10,12Z-dienoate). The second was a novel stereoisomer (UV λmax 239 nm) with distinctive NMR chemical shifts. Comparison of NOE interactions of the epoxy proton at C9 in the two allene oxides (and the equivalent NOE experiment in 12,13-epoxy allene oxides) allowed assignment at the isomeric C10 epoxy-ene carbon as Z in the new isomer and the E configuration in all previously characterized allene oxides. The novel 10Z isomer spontaneously formed a cis-cyclopentenone at room temperature in hexane. These results explain the origin of the cyclopentenone, provide insights into the mechanisms of allene oxide cyclization, and define the double bond geometry in naturally occurring allene oxides."
https://openalex.org/W2084350924,"In secretory cells, several exocytosis-coupled forms of endocytosis have been proposed including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, kiss-and-run endocytosis, cavicapture, and bulk endocytosis. These forms of endocytosis can be induced under different conditions, but their detailed molecular mechanisms and functions are largely unknown. We studied exocytosis and endocytosis in mast cells with both perforated-patch and whole-cell configurations of the patch clamp technique using cell capacitance measurements in combination with amperometric serotonin detection. We found that intact mast cells exhibit an early endocytosis that follows exocytosis induced by compound 48/80. Direct observation of individual exocytic and endocytic events showed a higher percentage of capacitance flickers (27.3%) and off-steps (11.4%) in intact mast cells than in dialyzed cells (5.4% and 2.9%, respectively). Moreover, we observed a type of endocytosis of large pieces of membrane that were likely formed by cumulative fusion of several secretory granules with the cell membrane. We also identified ""large-capacitance flickers"" that occur after large endocytosis events. Pore conductance analysis indicated that these transient events may represent ""compound cavicapture,"" most likely due to the flickering of a dilated fusion pore. Using fluorescence imaging of individual exocytic and endocytic events we observed that granules can fuse to granules already fused with the plasma membrane, and then the membranes and dense cores of fused granules are internalized. Altogether, our results suggest that stimulated exocytosis in intact mast cells is followed by several forms of compensatory endocytosis, including kiss-and-run endocytosis and a mechanism for efficient retrieval of the compound membrane of several secretory granules through a single membrane fission event."
https://openalex.org/W2066391783,"In bacteria, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are vital for the uptake of nutrients and cofactors. Based on differences in structure and activity, ABC importers are divided into two types. Type I transporters have been well studied and employ a tightly regulated alternating access mechanism. Less is known about Type II importers, but much of what we do know has been observed in studies of the vitamin B12 importer BtuC2D2. MolB2C2 (formally known as HI1470/71) is also a Type II importer, but its substrate, molybdate, is ∼10-fold smaller than vitamin B12. To understand mechanistic differences among Type II importers, we focused our studies on MolBC, for which alternative conformations may be required to transport its relatively small substrate. To investigate the mechanism of MolBC, we employed disulfide cross-linking and EPR spectroscopy. From these studies, we found that nucleotide binding is coupled to a conformational shift at the periplasmic gate. Unlike the larger conformational changes in BtuCD-F, this shift in MolBC-A is akin to unlocking a swinging door: allowing just enough space for molybdate to slip into the cell. The lower cytoplasmic gate, identified in BtuCD-F as “gate I,” remains open throughout the MolBC-A mechanism, and cytoplasmic gate II closes in the presence of nucleotide.

B. 2009; 364: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). For this class of importers, nucleotide binding and hydrolysis at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) drive the transmembrane domains (TMDs) to alternate between inward- and outward-facing conformations (6.Davidson A.L.

For ABC importers, the role of substrate specificity has been delegated to a periplasmic binding protein (PBP), which scavenges substrate from the periplasm and delivers it to the transporter (13.Quiocho F.A.

Most of our understanding of Type II ABC importers has been gained in studies of the vitamin B12 importer BtuCD. This large-substrate Type II importer employs a peristaltic transport mechanism (17.Korkhov V.M. Mireku S.A. Locher K.P. Structure of AMP-PNP-bound vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD-F.Nature. 2012; 490: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Based on EPR studies and the recently elucidated structure (17.Korkhov V.M. Mireku S.A. Locher K.P.

Substrate acceptance appears to be in the transition from the outward-facing nucleotide-free state (19.Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. The E. coli BtuCD structure: a framework for ABC transporter architecture and mechanism.Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) to the nucleotide-bound state (17.Korkhov V.M. Mireku S.A. Locher K.P. Structure of AMP-PNP-bound vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD-F.Nature. 2012; 490: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Type I and II importers differ both mechanistically and structurally. For the Type I importer MalFGK2, ATP can be hydrolyzed with high efficiency only in the presence of substrate-loaded PBP (20.Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12837-12842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Many Type I importers contain a C-terminal regulatory domain that prevents ATP hydrolysis when bound to substrate (22.Gerber S. Comellas-Bigler M. Goetz B.A. Locher K.P. Structural basis of trans-inhibition in a molybdate/tungstate ABC transporter.Science. 2008; 321: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In contrast, MolBC and BtuCD can hydrolyze ATP in the absence of PBP or substrate in vitro (23.Borths E.L. Poolman B. Hvorup R.N. Locher K.P. Rees D.C. In vitro functional characterization of BtuCD-F, the Escherichia coli ABC transporter for vitamin B12 uptake.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16301-16309Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and contain no known regulatory domain. Like BtuC2, MolB2 (the TMD homodimer) is composed of 20 transmembrane helices as opposed to the 10–12 helices commonly found in Type I transporters. The binding proteins MolA (16.Tirado-Lee L. Lee A. Rees D.C. Pinkett H.W.

Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. The structure of Escherichia coli BtuF and binding to its cognate ATP binding cassette transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16642-16647Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (for MolBC and BtuCD, respectively) fall in the same structural groups: class III and cluster A (13.Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 24.Berntsson R.P. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Slotboom D.J. Poolman B. A structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These PBPs do not undergo significant conformational change upon substrate binding, differing from binding proteins known to associate with Type I transporters (24.Berntsson R.P. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Slotboom D.J. Poolman B. A structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). To determine whether the BtuCD-F system of transport applies to a small-substrate Type II importer, in this study, we focused on the molybdate importer MolB2C2 and the cognate PBP MolA (16.Tirado-Lee L. Lee A. Rees D.C. Pinkett H.W.

MolA was found to bind both molybdate and the structurally similar oxyanion tungstate (16.Tirado-Lee L. Lee A. Rees D.C. Pinkett H.W.

Because molybdate is a substrate shared between a Type I importer (ModBC-A) and a Type II importer (MolBC-A), we have the opportunity to focus on one of two molybdate transport systems present in the organism H. influenzae. The results of our investigation suggest that MolBC-A utilizes a peristaltic pumping mechanism similar to BtuCD-F, but differences can be found at two of the three gates. The Stratagene QuikChange kit was used to generate the following MolB mutations: N89C, L91C, N93C, I151C, L148C, I171C, D173C, L178C, S180C, V182C, and L185C. Mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. MolA-binding protein was cloned and purified as described by Tirado-Lee et al. (16.Tirado-Lee L. Lee A. Rees D.C. Pinkett H.W. Classification of a Haemophilus influenzae ABC transporter HI1470/71 through its cognate molybdate periplasmic binding protein, MolA.Structure. 2011; 19: 1701-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). MolBC was expressed and purified as described (25.Pinkett H.W. Lee A.T. Lum P. Locher K.P. Rees D.C. An inward-facing conformation of a putative metal-chelate-type ABC transporter.Science. 2007; 315: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) with slight modifications for spin labeling. For spin-labeled samples, protein-loaded nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was allowed to mix with 0.1 mm S-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)methyl methanesulfonothioate (MTSL) for at least 10 h. MTSL-labeled samples were then extensively washed on the nickel column, eluted, and dialyzed before concentration to ∼200 μm using a Millipore Ultra-4 filter device (molecular mass cutoff of 50 kDa). In brief, MolBC cross-linking mutants were purified and concentrated under reducing conditions. In the presence of 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, ligands (MolA and/or beryllium fluoride (BeFx) + ATP-Mg2+) were incubated with each mutant. BeFx trapping was required to maintain MolBC in the nucleotide-bound state throughout the ensuing incubations and dialyses. 2-Mercaptoethanol was removed via dialysis. Cross-linking was promoted by the addition of 0.5 mm CuCl2, following by quenching with 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Excess copper and N-ethylmaleimide were removed by dialysis. Final samples were analyzed for cross-linking by SDS-polyacrylamide gel shift and ATP hydrolysis activity by enzyme-linked inorganic phosphate assay (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). Phosphatidylcholine lipid extract (Sigma P5638) was dissolved in reconstitution buffer (25 mm Tris and 100 mm NaCl) to a concentration of 50 mg/ml and then clarified and destabilized with 40 mm sodium cholate (Sigma). MolBC was mixed with cholate-destabilized phosphatidylcholine solution in a 1:10 (w/w) ratio. Washed and dried Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) were added to the phosphatidylcholine, cholate, and protein solution, increasing the sample volume by at least by 50%. After 12 h of incubation, the Bio-Beads were removed, and the sample was diluted ∼70 times in reconstitution buffer and centrifuged at 150,000 × g. Proteoliposomes were resuspended in reconstitution buffer. Continuous wave (CW) EPR spectra were measured as described previously (21.Orelle C. Ayvaz T. Everly R.M. Klug C.S. Davidson A.L. Both maltose-binding protein and ATP are required for nucleotide-binding domain closure in the intact maltose ABC transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12837-12842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The scan width of all spectra was 250 G, and the spectra presented were cropped to the values stated in the figure legends. The ligands used for CW-EPR spectroscopy were as follows: MolA at 2-fold molar excess over MolBC; 10 mm ATP + 1.5 mm EDTA; and 16.5 mm MgCl2. Ligands were serially added to recovered protein samples and then incubated for at least 10 min (60 min for MolA) before being rescanned. Unlike BeFx trapping, the use of ATP-EDTA allowed the nucleotide to be hydrolyzed for subsequent analysis. ATP-EDTA and the nucleotide analog Mg-AMP-PNP had similar effects on CW-EPR spectra. Mg-AMP-PNP was preferred in studies that did not require hydrolysis, such as preliminary CW-EPR samples and double electron-electron resonance (DEER)-EPR. Given the known activity for each mutant (supplemental Table 1), a 10-min incubation after the addition of Mg2+ allowed ample time for each sample to hydrolyze the given amount of ATP and reach an equilibrium (post-hydrolysis) state, where ADP-bound MolBC dominates the transporter population. CW-EPR spectra were collected at room temperature (296 K). For spectra showing coupled spins, Gaussian-fitted distance distributions were calculated using the Short Distances program written by Altenbach et al. (26.Altenbach C. Oh K.J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Estimation of inter-residue distances in spin labeled proteins at physiological temperatures: experimental strategies and practical limitations.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The fitting program was set to calculate the optimal fit and was not limited by a requirement that all fitting peaks sum to 100% of spin in the sample. When needed for distance calculation of a given mutant with particular ligands, a pseudo sum-of-singles spectrum was measured for the same mutant with the same ligands. The sum-of-singles CW-EPR spectrum was determined by analyzing a sample labeled with a 3:1 ratio of diamagnetic acetoxy-MTSL to paramagnetic MTSL. The low residual and χ2 values indicate good fitting of the simulated CW-EPR spectra to the observed spectra (supplemental Fig. 2, B and D). The 2011 version of MMM was used to predict spin coupling distances from crystal structures (27.Polyhach Y. Bordignon E. Jeschke G. Rotamer libraries of spin labelled cysteines for protein studies.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2011; 13: 2356-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). All protein structure graphics were made with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). Spectra and charts were graphed using Grapher 9 software (Golden Software Inc., Golden, CO). To study the nucleotide- and PBP-induced helical rearrangements of MolBC-A, we utilized site-directed spin labeling EPR spectroscopy and disulfide cross-linking in a detergent environment. Both techniques employ cysteine mutations at specific sites along or near the MolBC translocation pathway, which is made up of the core helices and loops around TM5 and TM5a (Fig. 1A). All MolBC mutants, including spin-labeled EPR spectroscopy mutants, were assayed to ensure their ability to bind and hydrolyze nucleotide in a detergent and lipid environment. Activities in detergent (supplemental Table 1) and lipid (supplemental Table 2) are comparable to published activity levels of BtuCD (23.Borths E.L. Poolman B. Hvorup R.N. Locher K.P. Rees D.C. In vitro functional characterization of BtuCD-F, the Escherichia coli ABC transporter for vitamin B12 uptake.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16301-16309Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As expected from studies with BtuCD, a notable decrease in activity was observed upon reconstitution. Size exclusion chromatography was used to ensure that unloaded MolA (PBP) and MolBC formed a complex in the absence and presence of nucleotide (data not shown). Based on our own study of MolBC-A complex formation 5A. J. Rice and H. W. Pinkett, unpublished data. and the recently published study comparing molybdate transporters MolBC-A from H. influenzae (Type II) and ModBC-A from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Type I) (28.Vigonsky E. Ovcharenko E. Lewinson O. Two molybdate/tungstate ABC transporters that interact very differently with their substrate binding proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 5440-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the studies reported here were conducted in the absence of the substrate molybdate. Although ModBC-A forms a tight complex in the presence of molybdate, MolBC-A shows a decrease in affinity in the presence of increasing concentrations of substrate and nucleotide. For the conditions tested, the addition of molybdate enhances the dissociation of MolA and MolBC. The addition of MolA to concentrations sufficient to overcome this low affinity would result in excessive dilution of MolBC. Moreover, the fast dissociation would make it difficult to test a homogeneous population of MolBC-A in the presence of nucleotide. We began our study of the periplasmic gate with the two TM5a helices that occlude the translocation pathway. To understand how these helices rearrange themselves in the presence of nucleotide and PBP, we independently spin-labeled TM5a at two sites, S180C and L185C, and the loop proceeding TM5a at D173C (Fig. 1A). With the periplasmic gate spin-labeled, CW spectra were recorded in the absence of nucleotide (apo) and then with ATP (plus excess EDTA to remove magnesium). The latter spectra represent the state with nucleotide bound but not hydrolyzed. At residues S180C, L185C, and D173C, CW-EPR spectroscopy showed an increase in spin label mobility in the presence of ATP (Fig. 1B). With the addition of MgCl2, ATP was hydrolyzed (Fig. 1C), and the mobility at all three sites returned to an apo-like state as demonstrated by the similarities between the apo and ATP + MgCl2 spectra. The nucleotide-dependent increase in mobility at all three sites can be attributed to a conformational change at TM5a. Specifically, increased mobility could represent additional flexibility (or conformational substates) allowed in TM5a and the adjacent loop. It is also possible that the mobility changes could represent a subtle rearrangement of helices at the periplasmic gate, which removes tertiary contacts at all three spin-labeled sites. DEER-EPR data of TM5a, probed at S180C, further suggest that this mobility shift or helical rearrangement at the periplasmic gate could be due to a very subtle nucleotide-dependent separation of TM5a (supplemental Fig. 1B). To understand the effects of both MolA and nucleotide at the periplasmic gate, L185C and S180C were analyzed by CW-EPR spectroscopy (size exclusion chromatography showed that spin labeling at D173C prevented MolA binding to MolBC). In the presence of MolA, mobility at L185C was effectively increased upon binding ATP (Fig. 2B), but when the transporter was allowed to hydrolyze ATP-Mg, mobility returned to an apo-like state (Fig. 2C). The results at L185C indicate the same conformational changes in the presence or absence of MolA, where again, L185C goes from an immobile to a mobile state before returning to an apo-like post-hydrolysis conformation. The spin label at S180C assumed a more immobile conformation in the presence of MolA (Fig. 2A). Given the location of Ser-180 at the binding interface of MolA and MolBC and the highly immobile conformation assumed by the spin label at S180C, it is possible that MolA interacts directly with the spin label at this site. No further changes were observed upon the addition of nucleotide in CW-EPR (Fig. 2, B and C) or DEER-EPR (supplemental Fig. 1B) studies. Although the periplasmic side of TM5a at site S180C appears to be held firm in the presence of MolA, five residues away on TM5a, L185C shows nucleotide-dependent mobility even in the presence of binding protein. We can think of these results in the periplasmic gate as a subtle shift from a locked occluded conformation to an unlocked conformation upon nucleotide binding. The ATP-bound conformation may allow TM5a more flexibility or at least fewer tertiary contacts with adjacent helices that would immobilize the spin label. This unlocked state may represent the step of the transport cycle in which it is possible for molybdate to slip past the TM5a occlusion into the translocation pathway. In the apo crystal structure (Fig. 3A), the translocation pathway is closed at the periplasmic gate by residues of TM5a (25.Pinkett H.W. Lee A.T. Lum P. Locher K.P. Rees D.C. An inward-facing conformation of a putative metal-chelate-type ABC transporter.Science. 2007; 315: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The proximity of TM5a V182C and L178C to the respective sites on the adjacent TMD subunit was confirmed by selective disulfide cross-linking. In the apo form and in the presence of MolA, the residues at the periplasmic gate efficiently cross-linked (Fig. 3B). However, when trapped in the ATP-bound state with BeFx and ADP-Mg2+, less cross-linking was observed at both sites. Furthermore, when L178C or V182C cross-linked, there was a proportional decrease in the rate of ATP turnover, except for the BeFx-treated samples (Fig. 3C). Cross-linking and activity results with the apo and MolA-bound samples indicate that NBD activity is directly coupled to a conformational shift at the periplasmic gate. In this ATP-dependent change, the occlusion at TM5a unlocks and is free to open, which disrupts disulfide cross-linking. This subtle unlocking of the periplasmic gate represents the open state that may be permeable to substrate. Because both TM5 and TM5a make up the translocation pathway, we were curious if the periplasmic side of TM5 also undergoes rearrangement during the transport mechanism of MolBC-A. DEER-EPR spectroscopy was used to measure the distances between spin labels at I171C (supplemental Fig. 1C), where there is a slight decrease in the inter-spin distance in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide Mg-AMP-PNP. Because the periplasmic side of TM5 is separated by >1 nm, a larger conformational change at this site would be needed to impact the translocation mechanism. These findings indicate that the periplasmic gate is limited to TM5a and not TM5. “Cytoplasmic gate I” identified in the apo-BtuCD structure (19.Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. The E. coli BtuCD structure: a framework for ABC transporter architecture and mechanism.Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) is represented in MolBC by the cytoplasmic side of TM5. To determine the conformational changes at gate I, nearby sites were probed via EPR spectroscopy. CW-EPR allows us to quantify spin coupling when the inter-spin distance is 0.8–1.8 nm; coupling at greater distances cannot be measured with this technique, but the percent of uncoupled spins can be approximated during analysis. A non-cross-linking site along TM5, I151C (Fig. 4A), showed significant spin coupling in the apo state, suggesting a close proximity of spin labels (three distances were calculated: 20.9% at 0.6 nm, 20.6% at 0.9 nm, and 13.3% at 1.3 nm) (supplemental Fig. 2A). From the crystal structure, the inter-spin distance at Ile-151 was predicted to be 0.7 ± 0.3 nm. The addition of ATP and EDTA resulted in a loss of spin coupling, demonstrated by the diminished spectral broadening in the ATP-bound sample relative to the apo sample (Fig. 4B) and the increase in non-interacting spin from 34 to 107% (supplemental Fig. 2A). Non-interacting spin in the apo sample is likely due to incomplete spin labeling. Hydrolysis of ATP-Mg returned some population of spin coupling to an apo-like state (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that the cytoplasmic side of TM5 opens widely upon ATP binding and returns to an apo-like state after ATP-Mg hydrolysis. MolA did not appear to have an effect on the mobility or coupling of MolBC at I151C in the apo state (Fig. 4D). Whether ATP was added to the MolBC-A complex or MolA was added to ATP-bound MolBC, the same widely separated TM5 conformation at the cytoplasmic gate was obtained (Fig. 4E). In the presence or absence of MolA, the post-hydrolysis state was similar to the apo state (Fig. 4F). The crystal structure of apo-MolBC shows cytoplasmic gate I in a slightly open conformation (Fig. 3A), which is supported by EPR spectroscopy in the apo state. These results were further confirmed with selective cross-linking experiments of L148C. Leu-148 can be found at the cytoplasmic side of TM5 (Fig. 3A). Compared with sites at the periplasmic gate, L148C shows minimal cross-linking in the apo and MolA-bound states (Fig. 2. B and C). When trapped with BeFx, there is still minimal cross-linking at L148C. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic side of TM5 may be too far apart to efficiently form a disulfide bond. Through these studies, we have shown that cytoplasmic gate I moves from a partially open conformation to a widely separated conformation. As the cytoplasmic side of TM5 swings out from a partially open state to a widely separated state, the space forming the translocation pathway will increase in size. It is possible that another helix or loop surrounding the translocation pathway may be drawn into this space and form a second cytoplasmic gate, as is seen in BtuCD-F. To explore the possibility of a second cytoplasmic gate in MolBC, residues of the loop connecting TM2 and TM3 were tested for changes in cross-linking and EPR spin coupling. When spin-labeled at N93C (Fig. 5A) and analyzed by CW-EPR spectroscopy (Fig. 5B), three distances could be observed in apo-MolBC, with the majority of spin (48.1%) centered 0.9 nm (supplemental Fig. 2C). This result fits the distance predicted from the apo crystal structure: 0.9 ± 0.2 nm. Upon ATP binding, the greater part of the spin shifted to 0.6 nm (53.7%) (supplemental Fig. 2C). When ATP hydrolysis was enabled by the addition of MgCl2, the distribution of distances at N93C + MTSL returned to an apo-like state (Fig. 5C). The same conformational changes were observed in the presence of MolA (supplemental Fig. 2C). Throughout the nucleotide cycle, 22–31% of spin remains non-interacting, which is likely due to incomplete spin labeling. These results suggest that the proximity of spin label at N93C narrows when in the ATP-bound state and support the presence of a second cytoplasmic gate in MolBC. To verify that the loop between TM2 and TM3 could form a closed conformation, three sites along the loop were tested for disulfide cross-linking. In all four conditions tested (apo, MolA-bound, BeFx/ADP-Mg2+-trapped, and MolA/BeFx/ADP-Mg2+-trapped), MolBC L91C formed disulfide bonds (Fig. 5D), which is directly comparable to cross-linking of the homologous BtuC mutant L85C (17.Korkhov V.M. Mireku S.A. Locher K.P. Structure of AMP-PNP-bound vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD-F.Nature. 2012; 490: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The flanking sites N89C and N93C formed disulfide cross-links with or without MolA, but only when trapped in a nucleotide-bound state. These results suggest that it is possible to form a closed conformation at gate II, especially for MolBC in the nucleotide-bound state. Details of the mechanistic differences within the family of Type II transporters continue to unfold. From our results, it is immediately clear that the mechanism of MolBC-A has diverged from other ABC transporters, although it bears some similarity to BtuCD-F. The mechanism of BtuCD involves three gates (one periplasmic gate and two cytoplasmic gates) that accept vitamin B12 from PBP into a translocation chamber. Substrate acceptance appears to be in the transition from the outward-facing nucleotide-free state (19.Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. The E. coli BtuCD structure: a framework for ABC transporter architecture and mechanism.Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) to the nucleotide-bound state (17.Korkhov V.M. Mireku S.A. Locher K.P. Structure of AMP-PNP-bound vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD-F.Nature. 2012; 490: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis is believed to collapse the translocation chamber (29.Hvorup R.N. Goetz B.A. Niederer M. Hollenstein K. Perozo E. Locher K.P. Asymmetry in the structure of the ABC transporter-binding protein complex BtuCD-BtuF.Science. 2007; 317: 1387-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), forcing substrate into the cytoplasm. The mechanistic differences between these two Type II transporters is first apparent at the periplasmic gate, the point of entry for substrates. Based on the crystal structure, TM5a would need to shift during the transport of substrate as it is the point of occlusion in the translocation pathway. As anticipated, the CW-EPR spectroscopy and disulfide cross-linking experiments presented here show that nucleotide binding induces a subtle conformational change at the occluding TM5a helices. This conformational change loosens ternary contacts with adjacent helices and perhaps allows TM5a to assume a more mobile state. Either interpretation of the data may indicate the substrate-permeable (unlocked) state of the periplasmic gate. Moreover, when sites at the periplasmic gate are cross-linked, ATP turnover is inhibited, suggesting that the NBD and periplasmic gate are strongly coupled. Unlike BtuCD, movement at the periplasmic gate is much more subtle, with the shift of TM5a likely to be the only change at the periplasmic gate that impacts the transport mechanism. In other words, the periplasmic gate in MolBC appears to be smaller and offers a more narrow opening than that in BtuCD. However, unlocking of the periplasmic gate is certainly driven by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Although gate I (at the cytoplasmic end of TM5) undergoes significant conformational changes during the nucleotide cycle, it does not appear to assume a closed conformation. In MolBC, cytoplasmic gating appears to rely on gate II at the loop between TM2 and TM3. Cross-linking studies suggest that a closed conformation at gate II is accessible throughout the nucleotide cycle. With a distinct narrowing of inter-spin distance observed via CW-EPR spectroscopy, we conclude that the nucleotide-bound state promotes closure at gate II. This conclusion is supported by our EPR spectroscopy studies of gate I, where TM5 helices appear close together in the apo state (as in the crystal structure) yet widely separated in the presence of nucleotide. Given the arrangement of helices at the cytoplasmic side of the translocation pathway, when gate II is closed, gate I may be forced to a more open conformation. Our in-detergent results show what conformational movements are possible given the inherent folding of MolBC. Combining these results, we propose the mechanism shown in Fig. 6A. In the absence of nucleotide, the periplasmic gate is locked (closed), and the cytoplasmic gates are open (State 1) (Fig. 6B). When ATP binds, the NBDs close around nucleotide. This classical conformational change of the NBDs rearranges the TMD helices of MolBC, which allows the periplasmic gate to unlock and permits substrate to slip into the translocation pathway (State 2). Concurrently, when ATP is bound, cytoplasmic gate II closes, and gate I is forced to a widely separated conformation (Fig. 6C). We speculate that a translocation chamber is formed when cytoplasmic gate II is closed, and binding protein caps the unlocked periplasmic gate (State 3). After ATP hydrolysis, the periplasmic gate locks, and the cytoplasmic gates assume an apo-like partially open state (State 4). As expected from similarities in structure and activity, we found that MolBC-A (25.Pinkett H.W. Lee A.T. Lum P. Locher K.P. Rees D.C. An inward-facing conformation of a putative metal-chelate-type ABC transporter.Science. 2007; 315: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and BtuCD-F (23.Borths E.L. Poolman B. Hvorup R.N. Locher K.P. Rees D.C. In vitro functional characterization of BtuCD-F, the Escherichia coli ABC transporter for vitamin B12 uptake.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16301-16309Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 30.Lewinson O. Lee A.T. Locher K.P. Rees D.C. A distinct mechanism for the ABC transporter BtuCD-BtuF revealed by the dynamics of complex formation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) share a similar mechanism, but this work also highlighted notable differences between the small- and large-substrate transporters. For MolBC-A, changes at the periplasmic gate are very limited, represented by a narrow opening of the occlusion or perhaps unlocking of a mobile gate. In MolBC-A, the small size of molybdate could allow for this subtle unlocking (opening) of the periplasmic gate, as this is all that is needed for substrate to permeate the TM5a occlusion. The limited opening and locking mechanism found in MolBC could explain mechanistic differences between the Type II transporters at cytoplasmic gate I. In the apo state, the periplasmic gate of MolBC is closed, so cytoplasmic gate I does not need to protect the transporter from channel formation, as it does in apo-BtuCD. In the nucleotide-bound state, gate II is closed and thus prevents gate I from closing. Relative to Type II importers, it appears that MolBC has adopted a more limited conformational shift to accept substrate from binding protein. This contrasts with the peristaltic means of transport observed in BtuCD-F (17.Korkhov V.M. Mireku S.A. Locher K.P. Structure of AMP-PNP-bound vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD-F.Nature. 2012; 490: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), where the TMD helices of the Type II importer wrap around and isolate substrate upon acceptance from PBP. The correlation between size of the translocation pathway and cognate substrate is emphasized in the recent structure of the Type II heme transporter HmuUV from Yersinia pestis, where the arrangement of helices allows for a smaller translocation pathway (31.Woo J.S. Zeltina A. Goetz B.A. Locher K.P. X-ray structure of the Yersinia pestis heme transporter HmuUV.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 1310-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Compared with vitamin B12 BtuCD, the periplasmic gate of HmuUV is notably smaller. This makes sense because the size of cobalamin is twice the size of heme (31.Woo J.S. Zeltina A. Goetz B.A. Locher K.P. X-ray structure of the Yersinia pestis heme transporter HmuUV.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 1310-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Studies with other Type II importers will be required to determine whether the mechanism presented for MolBC-A is common for the transport of even smaller substrates. We thank K. J. Tanaka and C.

To better understand how TUTs add uridines to RNAs, we focused on a putative TUT from Xenopus laevis, XTUT7. We determined that XTUT7 catalyzed the addition of uridines to RNAs. Mutational analysis revealed that a truncated XTUT7 enzyme, which contained solely the nucleotidyl transferase and poly(A) polymerase-associated domains, was sufficient for catalytic activity. XTUT7 activity decreased upon removal of the CCHC zinc finger domains and a short segment of basic amino acids (the basic region). This basic region bound nucleic acids in vitro. We also demonstrated that XTUT7 repressed translation of a polyadenylated RNA, to which it added a distinct number of uridines. We generated a predicted structure of the XTUT7 catalytic core that indicated histidine 1269 was likely important for uridine specificity. Indeed, mutation of histidine 1269 broadened the nucleotide specificity of XTUT7 and abolished XTUT7-dependent translational repression. Our data reveal key aspects of how XTUT7 adds uridines to RNAs, highlight the role of the basic region, illustrate that XTUT7 can repress translation, and identify an amino acid important for uridine specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1979369938,"Dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is one of the most frequent events in human cancer. However, the clinical benefits of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors have not yet achieved their predicted potential in many of the most prevalent human cancers. Of interest, treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) patients with rapamycin provided the first evidence of the antineoplastic activity of mTOR inhibitors in humans, becoming the standard of care for KS arising in renal transplant patients. Thus, the study of KS may provide a unique opportunity to dissect the contribution of specific mTOR downstream targets to cancer development. The KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent for KS, and the KSHV-encoded oncogene viral-G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) promotes the potent activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway by both direct and paracrine mechanisms. We focused on a direct target of mTOR, EIF4EBP1/2/3 (4EBP), which inhibits the translation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eiF4E)-bound mRNAs. 4EBP phosphorylation by mTOR relieves its inhibitory activity, hence resulting in increased eiF4E-dependent mRNA translation. We developed a paracrine transformation model, recapitulating the cellular composition of KS lesions, in which vGPCR-expressing cells promote the rapid proliferation of endothelial cells, thus expressing KSHV-latent genes by the release of growth factors. Using this model, we show here that the accumulation of dephosphorylated 4EBP in response to rapamycin or by the expression of an mTOR-insensitive mutant of 4EBP1 is sufficient to disrupt the eiF4E function downstream of mTOR to a similar extent than the mTOR catalytic inhibitor Torin2 and to halt KS development. We also provide evidence that eiF4E contributes to paracrine neoplastic, signaling through the release of pro-angiogenic factors that are acting on endothelial cells, expressing KSHV-latent genes. These findings may provide a preclinical platform and the rationale for the development of novel mTOR, inhibiting agents that may selectively disrupt the mTOR-4EBP interaction for the treatment of KS and other tumor lesions, exhibiting hyperactive mTOR pathway function."
https://openalex.org/W2152867097,"The Lim Domain Only 2 (LMO2) leukaemia oncogene encodes an LIM domain transcriptional cofactor required for early haematopoiesis. During embryogenesis, LMO2 is also expressed in developing tail and limb buds, an expression pattern we now show to be recapitulated in transgenic mice by an enhancer in LMO2 intron 4. Limb bud expression depended on a cluster of HOX binding sites, while posterior tail expression required the HOX sites and two E-boxes. Given the importance of both LMO2 and HOX genes in acute leukaemias, we further demonstrated that the regulatory hierarchy of HOX control of LMO2 is activated in leukaemia mouse models as well as in patient samples. Moreover, Lmo2 knock-down impaired the growth of leukaemic cells, and high LMO2 expression at diagnosis correlated with poor survival in cytogenetically normal AML patients. Taken together, these results establish a regulatory hierarchy of HOX control of LMO2 in normal development, which can be resurrected during leukaemia development. Redeployment of embryonic regulatory hierarchies in an aberrant context is likely to be relevant in human pathologies beyond the specific example of ectopic activation of LMO2."
https://openalex.org/W2049394607,"The planar lipid bilayer technique has a distinguished history in electrophysiology but is arguably the most technically difficult and time-consuming method in the field. Behind this is a lack of experimental consistency between laboratories, the challenges associated with painting unilamellar bilayers, and the reconstitution of ion channels into them. While there has be a trend towards automation of this technique, there remain many instances where manual bilayer formation and subsequent membrane protein insertion is both required and advantageous. We have developed a comprehensive method, which we have termed “wicking”, that greatly simplifies many experimental aspects of the lipid bilayer system. Wicking allows one to manually insert ion channels into planar lipid bilayers in a matter of seconds, without the use of a magnetic stir bar or the addition of other chemicals to monitor or promote the fusion of proteoliposomes. We used the wicking method in conjunction with a standard membrane capacitance test and a simple method of proteoliposome preparation that generates a heterogeneous mixture of vesicle sizes. To determine the robustness of this technique, we selected two ion channels that have been well characterized in the literature: CLIC1 and α-hemolysin. When reconstituted using the wicking technique, CLIC1 showed biophysical characteristics congruent with published reports from other groups; and α-hemolysin demonstrated Type A and B events when threading single stranded DNA through the pore. We conclude that the wicking method gives the investigator a high degree of control over many aspects of the lipid bilayer system, while greatly reducing the time required for channel reconstitution."
https://openalex.org/W1994860469,"In this work, a collimated helium beam was used to activate a thiol-poly(ethylene glycol) (SH-PEG) monolayer on gold to selectively capture proteins in the exposed regions. Protein patterns were formed at high throughput by exposing a stencil mask placed in proximity to the PEG-coated surface to a broad beam of helium particles, followed by incubation in a protein solution. Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) spectra showed that SH-PEG molecules remain attached to gold after exposure to beam doses of 1.5-60 µC/cm(2) and incubation in PBS buffer for one hour, as evidenced by the presence of characteristic ether and methoxy peaks at 1120 cm(-1) and 2870 cm(-1), respectively. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) spectra showed that increasing beam doses destroy ether (C-O) bonds in PEG molecules as evidenced by the decrease in carbon C1s peak at 286.6 eV and increased alkyl (C-C) signal at 284.6 eV. XPS spectra also demonstrated protein capture on beam-exposed PEG regions through the appearance of a nitrogen N1s peak at 400 eV and carbon C1s peak at 288 eV binding energies, while the unexposed PEG areas remained protein-free. The characteristic activities of avidin and horseradish peroxidase were preserved after attachment on beam-exposed regions. Protein patterns created using a 35 µm mesh mask were visualized by localized formation of insoluble diformazan precipitates by alkaline phosphatase conversion of its substrate bromochloroindoyl phosphate-nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP-NBT) and by avidin binding of biotinylated antibodies conjugated on 100 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Patterns created using a mask with smaller 300 nm openings were detected by specific binding of 40 nm AuNP probes and by localized HRP-mediated deposition of silver nanoparticles. Corresponding BSA-passivated negative controls showed very few bound AuNP probes and little to no enzymatic formation of diformazan precipitates or silver nanoparticles."
