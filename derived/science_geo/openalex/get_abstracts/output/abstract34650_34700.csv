https://openalex.org/W2076684492,"Transgenic mice that overproduce the hepatitis B virus large envelope polypeptide and accumulate toxic quantities of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) within the hepatocyte develop severe, prolonged hepatocellular injury that initiates a programmed response within the liver, characterized by inflammation, regenerative hyperplasia, transcriptional deregulation, and aneuploidy. This response inexorably progresses to neoplasia. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in this model corresponds to the frequency, severity, and age of onset of liver cell injury, which itself corresponds to the intrahepatic concentration of HBsAg and is influenced by genetic background and sex. Thus, the inappropriate expression of a single structural viral gene is sufficient to cause malignant transformation in this model. These results suggest that severe, prolonged cellular injury induces a preneoplastic proliferative response that fosters secondary genetic events that program the cell for unrestrained growth."
https://openalex.org/W2011952922,"One action of cyclosporin A thought to be central to many of its immunosuppressive effects is its ability to inhibit the early events of T lymphocyte activation such as lymphokine gene transcription in response to signals initiated at the antigen receptor. Cyclosporin A was found to specifically inhibit the appearance of DNA binding activity of NF-AT, AP-3, and to a lesser extent NF-kappa B, nuclear proteins that appear to be important in the transcriptional activation of the genes for interleukin-2 and its receptor, as well as several other lymphokines. In addition, cyclosporin A abolished the ability of the NF-AT binding site to activate a linked promoter in transfected mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes and in lymphocytes from transgenic mice. These results indicate that cyclosporin A either directly inhibits the function of nuclear proteins critical to T lymphocyte activation or inhibits the action of a more proximal member of the signal transmission cascade leading from the antigen receptor to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2159922116,"The maternal morphogen dorsal (dl) plays a key role in the establishment of dorsal-ventral polarity in Drosophila. We present evidence that the graded distribution of dl protein is initiated by selective nuclear transport. The dl protein is uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm of early embryos, but approximately 90 min after fertilization, dl protein present in ventral but not dorsal regions is selectively transported to the nucleus. Mutations in maternally active genes that regulate dl disrupt this transport process, resulting in an inactive, cytoplasmically localized form of the dl protein. Selective nuclear transport of dl protein was reproduced in tissue culture cells. The wild-type dl protein is largely restricted to the cytoplasm, while truncated proteins are predominantly localized within the nucleus. Transient cotransfection assays suggest that dl activates expression from several promoters in an apparently sequence-independent manner. We discuss the role of nuclear transport as a regulated process in gene expression and development."
https://openalex.org/W2011779891,"A system is described that allows use of recombinant DNA technology to modify the genome of influenza virus, a negative-strand RNA virus, and to engineer vectors for the expression of foreign genes. Recombinant RNA is expressed from plasmid DNA in which the coding sequence of the influenza A virus NS gene is replaced with that of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. When transfected with purified influenza A virus polymerase proteins--in the presence of helper virus--the recombinant RNA is amplified, expressed, and packaged into virus particles, which can be passaged several times. The data indicate that the 22 5' terminal and the 26 3' terminal bases of the influenza A virus RNA are sufficient to provide the signals for RNA transcription, RNA replication, packaging of RNA into influenza virus particles."
https://openalex.org/W2083758347,"dorsal is one of the maternally active dorsal-ventral polarity genes of Drosophila and is homologous to the vertebrate proto-oncogene c-rel. In wild-type embryos, the dorsal protein is found in the cytoplasm during cleavage. After the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the embryo, a ventral-to-dorsal gradient of nuclear dorsal protein is established. The formation of the nuclear gradient is disrupted in mutant embryos from other maternally active dorsal-ventral polarity genes: in dorsalized embryos only cytoplasmic protein is observed, while in ventralized embryos the nuclear gradient is shifted dorsally. My findings suggest that nuclear localization is critical for dorsal to function as a morphogen and that the distribution of the dorsal protein determines cell fate along the dorsal-ventral axis."
https://openalex.org/W1503394109,"A cDNA clone encoding the high affinity Ca2+-binding protein (HACBP) of rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum was isolated and sequenced. The cDNA encoded a protein of 418 amino acids, but a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein indicates that a 17-residue NH2-terminal signal sequence was removed during synthesis. This was confirmed by studies of in vitro translation of mRNA encoding the protein. Structural predictions did not reveal any potential transmembrane segments in the protein. The COOH-terminal sequence of the high affinity Ca2+-binding protein, Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu, is the same as that proposed to be an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (Munro, S., and Pelham, H. R. B. (1987) Cell 48, 899-907). All of these characteristics suggest that the protein is localized in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The mature protein of Mr 46,567 contains 109 acidic and 52 basic amino acids. Structural predictions suggest that the first half of the molecule forms a globular domain of 8 anti-parallel beta-strands with a helix-turn-helix motif at the extreme NH2 terminus. The next one-third of the sequence is proline-rich. This segment can be subdivided into a charged region which contains a 17-amino acid repeat, followed by a proline, serine, and threonine-rich segment extending from Pro-246 to Thr-316. Thirty-seven acidic residues are clustered within 56 amino acids at the COOH terminus of the protein. Although the protein binds 1 mol of Ca2+/mol with high affinity, no EF-hand consensus sequence was observed in the protein. The acidic COOH terminus, however, could account for the low affinity, high capacity Ca2+ binding observed in the protein. In agreement with other involved laboratories, we have chosen the name calreticulin for the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1553185642,"An autoinducer required for the growth-dependent development of luminescence in Vibrio harveyi has been purified, structurally identified, and chemically synthesized. The autoinducer, which is excreted by the cells, was extracted with chloroform from conditioned media in which V. harveyi cells had been grown. The concentrated extract was separated on a silica gel column and the autoinducer activity further purified by thin layer, paper, and high performance liquid chromatography. The structure of the partially purified autoinducer was identified by 1H NMR and mass spectrometry as N-(beta-hydroxybutyryl)homoserine lactone. This compound was chemically synthesized by condensation of beta-hydroxybutyrate with alpha-amino-gamma-butyrolactone hydrobromide using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide as a carboxyl group activator. The pure synthetic autoinducer gave the characteristic NMR and mass spectra, co-migrated with the natural autoinducer on thin layer plates, and specifically stimulated induction of luminescence of V. harveyi. Light emission of a regulatory dark mutant of V. harveyi could be stimulated over 1000-fold by the addition of N-(beta-hydroxybutyryl)homoserine lactone, reaching intensities comparable to that of the native strain. The similarity in structure of the autoinducer of V. harveyi to that of Vibrio fischeri suggests that the regulation of luminescence induction in these bacteria may be related in spite of their differences in lux gene organization."
https://openalex.org/W2130938952,Cells from the human leukemia cell line HL-60 undergo terminal differentiation when exposed to inducing agents. Differentiation of these cells is always accompanied by withdrawal from the cell cycle. Here we describe the isolation of a cDNA encoding a novel serine protease that is present in HL-60 cells and is down-regulated during induced differentiation of these cells. We have named this protease myeloblastin. Down-regulation of myeloblastin mRNA occurs with both monocytic and granulocytic inducers. Myeloblastin mRNA is undetectable in fully differentiated HL-60 cells as well as in human peripheral blood monocytes. We found that regulation of myeloblastin mRNA in HL-60 cells is serum dependent. Inhibition of myeloblastin expression by an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation of promyelocyte-like leukemia cells.
https://openalex.org/W2035391953,"Autophosphorylation of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase converts it from a Ca2(+)-dependent to a Ca2(+)-independent or autonomous kinase, a process that may underlie some long-term enhancement of transient Ca2+ signals. We demonstrate that the neuronal alpha subunit clone expressed in COS-7 cells (alpha-CaM kinase) is sufficient to encode the regulatory phenomena characteristic of the multisubunit kinase isolated from brain. Activity of alpha-CaM kinase is highly dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin. It is converted by autophosphorylation to an enzyme capable of Ca2(+)-independent (autonomous) substrate phosphorylation and autophosphorylation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we separately eliminate five putative autophosphorylation sites within the regulatory domain and directly examine their individual roles. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity is fully retained by each mutant, but Thr286 is unique among the sites in being indispensable for generation of an autonomous kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2059000943,"In situ hybridization was used to localize cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) mRNAs in the adult mouse CNS. The PKA holoenzyme contains two catalytic (C) subunits and a regulatory (R) subunit dimer. Our studies demonstrate expression of two isoforms of C (C alpha and C beta) and four isoforms of R (RI alpha, RI beta, RII alpha, and RII beta) in the CNS. mRNAs for C alpha, RI alpha, and RI beta preferentially localize in the neocortex, caudate-putamen, hypothalamus, thalamus, and hippocampus. Hybridization with C beta and RII beta probes is clearly distinguished from the C alpha-like pattern by a reduced level of hybridization in the thalamus and by a relative increase in expression in the dentate gyrus compared with cell layers CA1-3 in the hippocampus. RII alpha transcripts are very specifically localized in the medial habenula. The differential expression of PKA subunit genes suggests that functional differences in cAMP responses within neural tissues may be mediated by the biochemical properties of specific PKA isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2063380435,"A human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line that was transplanted into immune-deficient SCID mice proliferated in the hematopoietic tissues, invaded various organs, and led to the death of the mice. The distribution of leukemic cells in SCID mice was similar to the course of the disease in children. A-1 cells marked with a retrovirus vector showed clonal evolution after the transplant. SCID mice that were injected with bone marrow from three patients with non-T ALL had leukemic cells in their bone marrow and spleen. This in vivo model of human leukemia is an approach to understanding leukemic growth and progression and is a novel system for testing new treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2081370552,"By incorporating rat brain plasma membrane vesicles into planar lipid bilayers, we have found and characterized four types of Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels. The unitary conductances of these channels are 242 +/- 14 pS, 236 +/- 16 pS, 135 +/- 10 pS, and 76 +/- 6 pS in symmetrical 150 mM KCI buffers. These channels share a number of properties. They are all activated by depolarizing voltages, activated by micromolar concentrations of internal Ca2+ with a Hill coefficient for Ca2+ activation of between 2 and 3, noninactivating under our assay conditions, blocked by low millimolar concentrations of TEA from the outside, apamin-insensitive, and very selective for K+ over Na+ and Cl-. Three of the four channels are also blocked by nanomolar concentrations of charybdotoxin. One of the high conductance Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels is novel in that it is not blocked by charybdotoxin and exhibits gating kinetics highlighted by long closed times and long open times. This family of closely related Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels may share structural domains underlying particular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1983122167,"Two precursor cell subpopulations have been isolated from the spleen cells of nonimmune mice. The major B cell subpopulation binds high levels of the J11D monoclonal antibody and, upon T cell-dependent antigenic stimulation, gives rise to primary antibody-forming cell clones but not secondary B cells. A minority of the 10%-14% of Ia+ precursors that bind low levels of J11D (J11Dlo) also generate antibody-forming cell clones after primary stimulation. However, over 70% of J11Dlo precursors yield no primary antibody-forming cell clones but instead give rise to secondarily responsive B cells. The existence of a distinct precursor cell subpopulation that is responsible for the generation of B cell memory is further evidenced by the distribution of variable region clonotypes among J11Dlo primary precursors, which resembles the clonotype patterns of secondary B cells, and by the accumulation of somatic mutations in their clonal progeny."
https://openalex.org/W2019378493,"The ability of plant cells to translate dicistronic mRNAs that mimic a segment of the polycistronic 35S RNA from cauliflower mosaic virus has been tested. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and beta-glucuronidase open reading frames (ORFs) were fused in-frame to the second viral cistron (ORF I). Efficient reporter expression from the corresponding plasmids in plant protoplasts was observed only upon cotransfection with viral DNA. The trans-activating gene maps at ORF VI, which is expressed from a separate, monocistronic messenger (19S RNA). Deletion analysis shows that trans-activation selectively enhances downstream gene expression; the high expression of the upstream ORF is not further increased. The major reporter transcript remained bicistronic upon trans-activation, and its abundance varied only to a limited extent. Results indicate that trans-activation enhances the translation of downstream ORFs on polycistronic mRNAs derived from cauliflower mosaic virus."
https://openalex.org/W1525488707,"Abstract Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induces a marked decrease in adhesion of MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells to laminin-coated surfaces, but does not significantly alter adhesion to fibronectin- or collagen-coated surfaces. We provide evidence that this effect is due to a switch in the repertoire of cell adhesion receptors in response to TGF-beta. MG-63 cells express high levels of alpha 3 beta 1-integrin, which is a polyspecific laminin/collagen/fibronectin receptor, and low levels of alpha 2 beta 1- and alpha 5 beta 1-integrins, which are collagen and fibronectin receptors, respectively. No other integrins of the beta 1-class could be detected in MG-63 cells. Treatment with TGF-beta 1 induces a marked (approximately 60%) decrease in the level of expression of alpha 3-integrin subunit mRNA and protein and a concomitant 8-fold increase in alpha 2-subunit expression. These responses become maximal 7-12 h after addition of TGF-beta 1 to the cells. Expression of alpha 5- and beta 1-integrin subunits also increases in response to TGF-beta 1, but to a lesser extent than alpha 2-subunit expression. Thus, as a result of TGF-beta action, the alpha 2 beta 1-collagen and alpha 5 beta 1-fibronectin receptors replace the alpha 3 beta 1-laminin/collagen/fibronectin receptor as the predominant integrins of the beta 1-class in MG-63 cells. These results suggest that one of the effects of TGF-beta is to modify the adhesive behavior of certain tumor cells by changing the binding specificity of the complement of integrins that they express."
https://openalex.org/W1995089204,"Monoclonal antibody Cat-301 was previously shown to recognize a surface-associated antigen on subsets of mammalian CNS neurons whose expression is regulated by neuronal activity early in an animal's postnatal life. We now present the partial purification and characterization of the Cat-301 antigen and demonstrate that it is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Extracellular localization of the Cat-301 epitope is demonstrated by staining live, intact neurons in situ. Extraction of the antigen from membranes in the absence of detergent indicates that it is either a peripheral membrane protein or a component of an extracellular matrix. The Cat-301 antigen migrates on Western blots of SDS gels with a molecular weight of ∼680,000 dalton and is purified by DEAE chromatography and Sepharose gel filtration in 8 M urea (pH 4.9) buffer. The antigen is sensitive to chondroitinase ABC, indicating that it is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence that the biochemically characterized antigen is indeed the histologically detected species by using a second antibody, Cat-304, that produces, immunohistological staining patterns identical to those of Cat-301 and reacts with the purified antigen, but at a distinct epitope. Our earlier developmental findings and the present localization and biochemical results suggest that the antigen may play a role in the maturation of functional connections between neurons, perhaps through stabilization of axosomatic and axodendritic synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2065918017,"We have used cDNA probes specific for three of the major brain microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), MAP1, MAP2, and MAP5, to study the timing of appearance, relative abundance, and intracellular compartmentalization of MAP gene transcripts in developing rat brain. The MAP1 probe hybridizes throughout the brain, in both grey and white matter. MAP2 mRNA is detected only in grey matter and appears in cerebral neurons only after they have ceased dividing and have migrated to the cortical plate. The MAP5 cDNA hybridizes throughout the embryonic brain, but by P12, MAP5 mRNA distribution is restricted to relatively immature areas. MAP2 mRNA, found in dendrites in the developing brain, persists in some adult dendrites. MAP5 mRNA, like beta-tubulin mRNA, is found only in the cell bodies of developing neurons, indicating that the protein must be transported from the soma into processes. MAP1 mRNA is found only in the proximal regions of cortical pyramidal cell dendrites in both developing and adult brain. The diverse distributions of MAP gene transcripts emphasize the importance of these proteins in generating heterogeneity of microtubule function and indicate that MAP compartmentalization within neurons is regulated in part by differential mRNA transport."
https://openalex.org/W2018478517,"The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) plays an integral role in cell interactions during neural development, with the binding of heparan sulfate proteoglycan to the amino-terminal region of N-CAM being required for N-CAM function. In the present study we have used synthetic peptides (HBD-1 and HBD-2), derived from the primary amino acid sequence of rat N-CAM, to identify the region of N-CAM that binds heparan sulfate. The 28 amino acid HBD-1 synthetic peptide was shown to bind both [3H]heparin and dissociated retinal cells. Retinal cells also attach to a substratum of HBD-2 peptide, but fail to bind to a control peptide containing a scrambled amino acid sequence of HBD-2. The HBD-2 peptide also inhibits retinal cell adhesion to N-CAM, demonstrating the physiological importance of the amino acid sequence encoded by the HBD peptide. These data therefore permit the localization of a heparin binding domain to a 17 amino acid region of immunoglobulin-like loop 2."
https://openalex.org/W1701123637,"Abstract A platelet aggregation inhibitory protein, bitistatin, was isolated from the venom of the puff adder Bitis arietans. This protein is a single-chain peptide containing 83 amino acids and 7 disulfide bonds. Bitistatin contains the sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid and shows considerable homology to two previously described snake venom platelet aggregation inhibitors, trigramin and echistatin. Bitistatin inhibited human and canine platelet aggregation initiated by 10 microM ADP in vitro with IC50 values of 237 +/- 13 and 28 +/- 3 nM, respectively. In order to assess the antithrombotic potential of bitistatin, a canine model of platelet-dependent coronary thrombus formation was utilized. Injection of bitistatin at 10-100 micrograms/kg (0.7-7 nmol/kg, intravenously (i.v.] resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of both platelet aggregation ex vivo and platelet-dependent cyclical flow reductions. The effective dose to inhibit cyclical flow reductions was 30 micrograms/kg, i.v. A higher dose of bitistatin (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) inhibited cyclical flow reductions for 160 +/- 29 min as well as attenuated ex vivo platelet aggregation. Bitistatin at 100 micrograms/kg, i.v. prolonged the bleeding time 4 x normal at 15 min post-administration but returned to normal at 3 h. Thus, in a canine model of in vivo platelet aggregation, bitistatin is an effective antiplatelet agent to inhibit periodic cyclical flow reductions. Bitistatin also exhibits reversible effects of ex vivo platelet aggregation as well as on bleeding time."

https://openalex.org/W2025375270,"B2 genes are rodent-specific middle repetitive elements transcribed by RNA polymerase III. They are expressed in the ectoderm and mesoderm but not in the embryonic or extraembryonic endoderm of early mouse embryos. This tissue specificity is mimicked in vitro by embryonal carcinoma and embryonic stem cell lines. Nuclear run-on experiments show that the down-regulation of B2 genes during F9 embryonal carcinoma cell differentiation into endoderm occurs at the transcriptional level and that other class III genes, including those encoding tRNA, show a similar response. We have used cell-free extracts to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible. The specific down-regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase III during F9 cell differentiation is due to a reduction in the activity of the general class III transcription factor TFIIIB."
https://openalex.org/W2069590357,"Developing motoneurons in zebrafish embryos follow a stereotyped sequence of axonal outgrowth and accurately project their axons to cell-specific target muscles. During axonal pathfinding, an identified motoneuron pioneers the peripheral motor pathway. Growth cones of later motoneurons interact with the pioneer via contact, coupling, and axonal fasciculation. In spite of these interactions, ablation of the pioneer motoneuron does not affect the ability of other identified motoneurons to select the pathways that lead to appropriate target muscles. We conclude that interactions between these cells during pathfinding are not required for accurate pathway selection."

https://openalex.org/W1552207560,"It has been hypothesized on the basis of studies on BC3H-1 myocytes that diacylglycerol generation with activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in the stimulation of glucose transport in muscle by insulin (Standaert, M. L., Farese, R. V., Cooper, R. D., and Pollet, R. J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8696-8705). In the present study, we used the rat epitrochlearis muscle to evaluate the possibility that PKC activity mediates the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin in mammalian skeletal muscle. Phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens (PLC-Cp), which generates diacylglycerol from membrane phospholipids, and 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) induced increases in glucose transport activity (assessed using 3-O-methylglucose transport) that were approximately 80 and approximately 20% as great, respectively, as that induced by a maximal insulin stimulus. PLC-Cp and PMA both caused a approximately 2-fold increase in membrane-associated PKC activity. In contrast, insulin did not affect PKC activity. These findings argue against a role of diacylglycerol-mediated PKC activation in the stimulation of skeletal muscle glucose transport by insulin. They also show that the BC3H-1 myocyte is not a good model for studying regulation of glucose transport in skeletal muscle. Neither the submaximal nor maximal effects of PLC-Cp and insulin on glucose transport were additive, suggesting that PLC-Cp interferes with insulin action. The maximal effects of PLC-Cp and hypoxia or muscle contractions were also not additive. However, the submaximal effects of hypoxia and PLC-Cp were completely additive. These findings raise the possibility that PLC-Cp stimulates glucose transport by the exercise/hypoxia-activated, not the insulin-activated, pathway in skeletal muscle. Exposure to PLC-Cp activated glycogen phosphorylase and potentiated twitch tension in response to electrical stimulation, providing evidence that PLC-Cp increases cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. Dantrolene, an inhibitor of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, completely blocked both the activation of phosphorylase and the stimulation of glucose transport by PLC-Cp. These findings provide evidence that an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration is involved in the activation of glucose transport in skeletal muscle by PLC-Cp."
https://openalex.org/W2011193313,"The role of cell-cell interactions in the development of bipotential glial progenitor cells in cultures of rat cerebellum and optic nerve was studied. In the cerebellar cultures, progenitor cells divide slowly and most of their progeny develop into additional progenitor cells. Progenitor cells isolated from postconfluent cultures of cerebellum, however, develop rapidly into oligodendrocytes when grown in a serum-free medium. Factors secreted or shed into the medium by young cerebellar interneurons stimulate optic nerve progenitor cells to divide and promote the survival of progenitor cells. These factors appear to alter the function of the internal clock that regulates the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation. These results suggest that the neuronal microenvironment can influence the lineage decisions of multipotential glial progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1964665312,DNA has been volatilized by pulsed laser ablation of a thin film of a frozen aqueous DNA solution. The target film was irradiated in vacuum by a pulsed laser at power densities sufficient to ablate the ice matrix. The expanding ablated water vapor entrained embedded DNA molecules and expelled them into the gas phase. Ejection of DNA molecules as large as 410 kilodaltons was verified by collection of the ablation products and subsequent mass analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with autoradiographic detection.
https://openalex.org/W1490124511,"DNA polymerase gamma has been purified over 10,000-fold from mitochondria of Xenopus laevis ovaries. We have developed a novel technique which specifically photolabels DNA polymerases. This procedure, the DNA polymerase trap, was used to identify a catalytic subunit of 140,000 Da from X. laevis DNA polymerase gamma. Additional catalytically active polypeptides of 100,000 and 55,000 Da were identified in the highly purified enzyme. These appear to be products of degradation of the 140,000-Da subunit. The DNA polymerase trap, which does not require large amounts of enzyme or renaturation from sodium dodecyl sulfate, is an alternative to the classic activity gel."
https://openalex.org/W1576865226,"Abstract The receptor on human myeloid cells that mediates cellular adherence consists of a heterodimer complex (designated CD11b/CD18). This receptor complex plays a critical role in leukocyte chemotaxis, adherence to vascular endothelium, and phagocytosis. We investigated expression of the CD11b subunit of this adherence receptor complex in various leukocyte populations. As previously described for the CD18 subunit, enhanced CD11b surface antigen and mRNA expression are present in peripheral blood granulocytes, as well as in chemically induced, differentiating HL-60 cells. However, in contrast to CD18 mRNA expression, which is transcriptionally regulated in differentiating HL-60 cells, the steady state levels of CD11b mRNA appear to be post-transcriptionally regulated in these cells. Thus, although the steady state levels of mRNA for the individual subunits of the CD11b/CD18 adherence receptor complex generally parallel each other during human myeloid differentiation, the mechanisms responsible for regulating these levels are distinctly different."
https://openalex.org/W1499613770,"Abstract Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a lymphokine which stimulates the proliferation of normal and transformed multilineage hematopoietic cells. Recently we reported that bryostatin 1, a macrocyclic lactone and potent activator of protein kinase C, could stimulate normal multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro in the absence of added polypeptide growth factors. We have now used the murine IL-3-dependent cell line FDC-P1, derived from normal murine marrow cells, to examine the early biochemical events associated with stimulation of hematopoietic cells. We find that both IL-3 and bryostatin 1 are mitogenic and stimulate the growth of FDC-P1 cells. Cells grown for extended periods in the presence of bryostatin 1 (1 nM) alone retain IL-3 responsiveness, indicating that bryostatin 1 does not induce an IL-3-independent state. Protein phosphorylation studies in cells treated with either IL-3 or bryostatin 1 indicate that both stimulators can mediate the rapid (within 5 min) serine-specific phosphorylation of several nuclear envelope polypeptides, including lamin B. Both IL-3- and bryostatin 1-mediated nuclear envelope phosphorylation is dose-dependent, occurring at concentrations which are mitogenic to FDC-P1 cells. The extent of nuclear envelope phosphorylation mediated by IL-3 and bryostatin 1 correlates with the mitogenic response. Furthermore, both mitogens mediate the rapid immunologic translocation of protein kinase C to the nuclear envelope where phosphorylation occurs. These data indicate that the early mitogenic signal(s) generated by IL-3 and bryostatin 1 may converge at the level of the nuclear envelope, perhaps through a protein kinase C-like activity which mediates phosphorylation of specific nuclear envelope polypeptides such as lamin B."
https://openalex.org/W1973430047,"Motor neurons regulate the quantity and distribution of acetylcholine receptors (AChR) in the muscles they innervate. Here, we report that an AChR alpha subunit gene fragment contains cis-acting regulatory sequences that confer neural regulation as well as tissue-specific regulation of transcription. An 850 bp fragment from the 5' end of the chicken AChR alpha gene fused to the reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), has been introduced into the genomes of several lines of transgenic mice. Expression of CAT enzyme activity in these mice is tissue-specific; the onset of expression in embryonic muscle correlates well with that of many other muscle-specific proteins. Most importantly, CAT enzyme is down-regulated 100-fold soon after birth, an effect that can be completely reversed by denervation."
https://openalex.org/W1592121394,"Brain myelin membrane preparations contain a metalloproteinase activity which degrades myelin basic protein (MBP). The activity was associated with lentil lectin-binding glycoproteins solubilized from myelin and could be detected in the presence of the detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS). The metalloproteinase represented about 5% of this glycoprotein fraction and was isolated from it by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, CM-Sepharose, and Superose 6. The proteinase had an apparent relative molecular weight (Mr) of approximately 58,000 both by gel filtration and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Mr value was unaffected by the presence of reducing agents but was diminished to about 52,000 by treating the proteinase with endoglycosidase F. The purified proteinase cleaved many bonds in MBP but did not generate trichloroacetic acid-soluble products. Two major polypeptides, putatively MBP1-73 and MBP74-170, were prominent in digests of MBP by either the purified enzyme or myelin membranes. The proteinase was active between pH 7 and 9 and was inhibited by phenanthroline and dithiothreitol but not phosphoramidon or inhibitors of serine or cysteine proteinases. Histones, but not azocasein, also served as substrates for the proteinase. From its enzymic and molecular characteristics the myelin-derived metalloproteinase appears distinct from previously described enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2138459029,"Following their sexual cycle, hypotrichous ciliated protozoa transform a copy of a chromosomal micronucleus into a macronucleus containing small, linear DNA molecules. A frequent event during macronuclear development is the removal of short segments of DNA (internal eliminated sequences: IESs) by a process equivalent to DNA breakage and rejoining. In this study we used a polymerase chain reaction procedure to demonstrate that free circular forms of IESs are present in cells undergoing macronuclear development. Sequencing of the junctions of the free circular IESs suggests that they share 12 nucleotides with the macronuclear DNA molecules that are generated following IES removal. The results provide evidence that IESs are removed by an active DNA breakage and rejoining process, which may involve staggered cuts in the substrate DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1984661003,"RAPsyn (also known as 43K protein), a mouse muscle protein localized to the synaptic membrane, is thought to be involved in the localization of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. We have characterized the transcriptional regulation of the RAPsyn gene and the synthesis of the RAPsyn protein during muscle cell differentiation. Nuclear run-on experiments and RNAase protection analyses showed that mRNA encoding RAPsyn, but not the acetylcholine receptor subunits, is present in undifferentiated muscle cells. The RAPsyn protein present in undifferentiated and differentiated muscle cells cannot be distinguished by peptide maps, turnover rates, cellular subfractionation, or ability to incorporate myristate. Whereas the amount of acetylcholine receptor subunit mRNA is increased approximately 100-fold after denervation, the amount of RAPsyn mRNA is increased just 2- to 3-fold. We conclude that the expression of RAPsyn and the acetylcholine receptor is not coordinately regulated in mouse muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1553993431,"Abstract Xenopus laevis DNA polymerase gamma co-purifies with a tightly associated 3'----5' exonuclease. The purified enzyme lacks 5'----3' exonuclease and endonuclease activity. The ratio of the 3'----5' exonuclease activity to DNA polymerase gamma activity remains constant over the final three chromatographic procedures. In addition, these activities co-sediment under partially denaturing conditions in the presence of ethylene glycol. The associated 3'----5' exonuclease activity removes a terminally mismatched nucleotide more rapidly than a correctly base-paired 3'-terminal residue, as expected if this exonuclease has a proofreading function. The 3'----5' exonuclease has the ability to release a terminal phosphorothioated nucleotide, a property shared with T4 DNA polymerase, but not with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I."
https://openalex.org/W1500255296,"Oligomerization of band 3 protein has been recently indicated as an early event in senescent or damaged red cell membrane followed by specific deposition of anti-band 3 antibodies and binding of complement C3 fragments. The band 3-anti-band 3-C3b complex is recognized by homologous monocytes, and phagocytosis ensues. This study shows that recognition of the anti-band 3-C3b complex by the monocyte C3b receptor type one (CR1) plays a crucial role in the process of removal of damaged red cells. Indeed, blocking of monocyte CR1 with an anti-CR1 monoclonal antibody abrogated phagocytosis of diamide-treated red cells. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid mediator involved in inflammatory processes. Nanomolar (R)-PAF enhanced the CR1-dependent phagocytosis of diamide-treated human red cell and of sheep red cells coated with C3b, induced the fast translocation of protein kinase C to monocyte membrane compartment, and stimulated the phosphorylation of monocyte CR1. The biologically inert lyso-PAF and the enantiomer (S)-PAF were inactive. PAF receptor antagonists and inhibitors of protein kinase C blocked the enhancement of phagocytosis induced by PAF. Protein kinase C translocation, phosphorylation of CR1, and stimulation of this receptor to an active state capable of mediating phagocytosis represent a novel pathway by which PAF interferes with red cell homeostasis and possibly modulates inflammatory reactions and host mechanisms against infections."
https://openalex.org/W2071570989,"A prohormone (P1) of locust adipokinetic hormone I (AKH I) is shown here to be a homodimer of a 41 residue subunit called the A-chain. The A-chain, from the N terminal, consists of AKH 1 (10 amino acids starting with pyroglutamate) followed by a Gly-Lys-Arg processing site and then a 28 residues called the a chain containing a single cysteine and a potential Arg-Lys processing site. When processed each molecule of the homodimer precursor yields two copies of AKH I and one α chain homodimer. We call the α-α homodimer product of P1 processing AKH precursor related peptide 1 or APRP 1. The Arg-Lys dibasic pair found within the α chain is not cleaved in vivo. Our results show that neuropeptide precursors can be dimers and that dimer products can be synthesized by processing of a pre-formed dimer precursor rather than by dimerization of independent subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2077976291,"The ARD protein is a Drosophila homolog of vertebrate nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) polypeptides. Here, an analysis of transcripts of the corresponding ard gene is presented. In situ hybridization experiments revealed ard gene expression in nervous tissue only. During development, ard transcripts are prevalent in late embryos, pupae, and newly eclosed flies. Both the spatial and the temporal pattern of ard gene expression is consistent with the ARD protein being part of a neuronal AChR that is produced in large amounts during major periods of neuronal differentiation. In situ hybridization with an intron-specific probe indicated codistribution of immature and mature ard RNAs in pupae and adult flies. In addition to the mature 3.2 kb RNA species, two larger immature transcripts are found in newly eclosed flies but not in embryos, suggesting a developmentally regulated processing of ard RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1601846008,"Abstract This work describes the purification of FAP, a feto-acinar pancreatic protein associated with the ontogenesis, differentiation, and transformation of the human exocrine pancreas. The protein was purified to homogeneity from pancreatic juices of patients with pancreatic pathology by a two-step chromatographic procedure which consisted of size exclusion on Sephacryl S-200 and affinity on heparin-Sepharose. The final preparation gave a single band at Mr 110,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after Coomassie stain or autoradiography of the 125I-labeled protein. Immunodetection with the murine monoclonal antibody mAb J28 in nitrocellulose replicas demonstrated a main Mr 110,000 component and trace components in the Mr 100,000-80,000 range. The immunopattern was identical to that in the original crude pancreatic secretion, therefore showing that the molecular characteristics of the protein, i.e. molecular mass, microheterogeneity, and immunoreactivity, were not altered along the purification procedure. FAP was identified as an acidic protein (isoelectric point 4.2-4.8) consisting of a single polypeptide chain having no free SH residues. Analysis of the amino acid composition showed a high proline content. Twenty-two residues of the N-terminal sequence were determined. No significant homology between this peptide and other proteins was found following a search of the NBRF-18 data bank. Sugar analysis showed the presence of mannose which is consistent with N-linked carbohydrate chains and an unusual high ratio in N-acetylgalactosamine residues suggesting the presence of many O-linked carbohydrate chains. Sequential deglycosylation with neuraminidase, hexosaminidase, and O-glycanase yield a single Mr 58,000 peptide showing that, relative to a molecular mass of 110,000, the carbohydrate moiety of FAP accounts for at least 47% of its apparent Mr by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W2026838351,"We recently showed that a nerve growth factor-human growth hormone (NGF-hGH) fusion gene containing the promoter and 750 bp of 5' flanking region is transcriptionally active in the NGF-secreting L929 mouse fibroblast cell line. For the present experiments, we extended the 5' flank by 5 kb and constructed transgenic mice. These mice began to secrete hGH into saliva at puberty. hGH was detected immunocytochemically in the granulated convoluted tubular cells of the submandibular gland (SMG). SMG levels of hGH mRNA were 10-fold higher in adult males than in females. hGH mRNA was very abundant in SMG, moderately abundant in heart, brain, and kidney, rare in skin and adrenal gland, and undetectable in lung, liver, and spleen. Thus, the NGF-hGH gene reflects NGF gene expression. We conclude that basal NGF gene transcription is regulated by sequences in the cloned NGF gene fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1511858736,"Abstract We recently reported that the translational control of protein synthesis by glucose 6-phosphate in gel-filtered, rabbit reticulocyte lysate is exerted on the activity of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2B, the factor that catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to eIF-2, by a mechanism that is independent of the phosphorylation of eIF-2 (alpha subunit). We now demonstrate that two other conditions regulate the activity of eIF-2B in rabbit reticulocyte lysate: polyamines (spermidine and spermine) and amino acid deficiency. In the absence of added polyamines, protein synthesis in gel-filtered lysate is reduced to about 70% and eIF-2B activity to about 35% of optimal. The former is likely a result of the latter, since we find that reticulocyte lysate has about twice the eIF-2B necessary to recycle the eIF-2.GDP generated under conditions of optimal protein synthesis. In contrast, the reduction in eIF-2B activity (to about 50% of optimal) occurring in the absence of added amino acids in unfractionated or gel-filtered lysate is insufficient, by itself, to slow the rate of protein synthesis, and the inhibition of protein synthesis that does occur with amino acid deficiency is exerted on polypeptide chain elongation, not initiation. The reduction in eIF-2B activity occurring with amino acid deficiency cannot be reversed by adding more glucose 6-phosphate or polyamines nor can the reduced eIF-2B activity seen with polyamine deficiency be overcome by increasing the glucose 6-phosphate, suggesting that these three components regulate eIF-2B activity by different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2084515829,"The contacts a growing neuron's axon makes with its synaptic targets are believed to inhibit further growth at the axon tip. Inhibition of axon growth has been difficult to examine in vivo, where studies have focused on populations of neurons with multiple targets, making the influence of a single target difficult to determine. Results of a direct test of the influence of synapse formation on axon growth are presented for the axon of the S interneuron in the leech, which has a single synaptic target that can decidedly inhibit growth at the axon's tip during regeneration in adults. Surprisingly, in embryos, after synapsing with its target, each S cell axon grew for several days, including growth at its tip, nearly doubling its length. Therefore, synaptic contact with the target does not stop further growth at the axon's tip."
https://openalex.org/W2012950062,"The hypotheses that selective formation of nerve-muscle connections depends upon intrinsic cellular properties, endowed either by the cell's rostral-caudal position in the embryo or its lineage, were tested directly in Xenopus embryonic cell cultures. The position or the lineage of embryonic cells was traced in vitro by previous injection of fluorophore-conjugated dextran molecules into individual blastomeres. Synaptic efficacy was assayed by recording synaptic currents from neurite-contacted muscle cells in the culture, and the physical affinity of neurites for muscle cells of different positional or clonal origins was assayed by counting the frequency of association between the neurites' growth cones and the muscle cells. Both assays showed no apparent preference between nerve and muscle cells of similar rostral-caudal positions or clonal origins, suggesting that there is little position- or lineage-dependent selectivity in the initial nerve-muscle interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2035735652,"A novel 100 pS K(+)-selective ion channel is frequently observed in cell-attached membrane patches from cultured Aplysia neurons. The activity of this channel is moderately voltage-dependent, but channel openings are rare and brief even when the patch is strongly depolarized. However, the activity of the channel is increased dramatically by the addition of the lectin concanavalin A (Con A), to the patch pipette. The channel is also activated by Con A in the bathing medium, suggesting that the lectin's action is via an as yet unidentified intracellular second messenger. In the one single-channel patch studied, Con A had no effect on the channel mean open time; rather it decreased the average duration of the long closed times between bursts of openings. Thus Con A increases either the open probability of single channels, the number of functional channels in the patch, or both. The functional significance of the Con A-induced modulation of K+ channel activity remains to be determined."

https://openalex.org/W1497584137,"It was previously shown (Sayre, L. M., Arora, P. K., Feke, S. C., and Urbach, F. L. (1986) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108, 2464-2466) that 1,3,3-trimethyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium salt (the 3,3-dimethyl analogue of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium ion or MPDP+) is a good model for MPDP+ on the basis of its redox potential and was used to show that MPDP+ is unlikely to possess reactivity characteristics which could contribute to the neurotoxicity observed with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 3,3-Dimethyl-MPTP and 3,3-dimethyl-MPDP+ are now shown to interact with monoamine oxidase similar to MPTP and MPDP+, but only in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol (beta-ME). In the absence of beta-ME, mixed competitive-noncompetitive inhibition kinetics are observed for 3,3-dimethyl-MPTP and 3,3-dimethyl-MPDP+, whereas competitive inhibition kinetics are exhibited by MPTP. In the presence of beta-ME, however, 3,3-dimethyl-MPTP also is a competitive inhibitor. 3,3-Dimethyl-MPTP and 3,3-dimethyl-MPDP+ also are time-dependent inactivators of monoamine oxidase, having identical kinetic constants, as is the case with MPTP and MPDP+. In the presence of beta-ME, but not glutathione, the rate of inactivation increases dramatically. When [beta-ME] and [3,3-dimethyl-MPTP] or [3,3-dimethyl-MPDP+] are varied, there is an optimal concentration of 1.0 mM for all three at which maximal inactivation rates are obtained. Another dramatic effect of the beta-ME is to lower the partition ratio for inactivation from greater than 50 to about one. This suggests that the effect of the beta-ME toward inactivation may be to induce a conformational change in the enzyme, which reorients an active site nucleophile for attack on the activated species. Support for involvement of an active site nucleophile is the finding that inactivation does not lead to a flavin adduct. Three possible mechanisms for inactivation of monoamine oxidase by MPTP and MPDP+ are suggested."
