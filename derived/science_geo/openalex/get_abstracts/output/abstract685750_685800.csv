https://openalex.org/W4200613736,"Extensive sampling of neural activity during rich cognitive phenomena is critical for robust understanding of brain function. Here we present the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), in which high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging responses to tens of thousands of richly annotated natural scenes were measured while participants performed a continuous recognition task. To optimize data quality, we developed and applied novel estimation and denoising techniques. Simple visual inspections of the NSD data reveal clear representational transformations along the ventral visual pathway. Further exemplifying the inferential power of the dataset, we used NSD to build and train deep neural network models that predict brain activity more accurately than state-of-the-art models from computer vision. NSD also includes substantial resting-state and diffusion data, enabling network neuroscience perspectives to constrain and enhance models of perception and memory. Given its unprecedented scale, quality and breadth, NSD opens new avenues of inquiry in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence."

This study aimed to assess factors related to parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. A nationwide internet-based cross-sectional study was conducted between May 25 and June 3, 2021 in Japan. The target population was parents of children aged 3-14 years who resided in Japan, and agreed to answer the online questionnaire. Parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (their intention to vaccinate their child) and related factors were analyzed using logistic regression models. Interaction effects of gender of parents and their level of social relationship satisfaction related to parental vaccine hesitancy was tested using log likelihood ratio test (LRT). Social media as the most trusted information source increased parental vaccine hesitancy compared to those who trusted official information (Adjusted Odds Ratio: aOR 2.80, 95% CI 1.53-5.12). Being a mother and low perceived risk of infection also increased parental vaccine hesitancy compared to father (aOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.57-3.74) and those with higher perceived risk of infection (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.04-2.32) respectively. People with lower satisfaction to social relationships tended to be more hesitant to vaccinate their child among mothers in contrast to fathers who showed constant intention to vaccinate their child regardless of the level of satisfaction to social relationship (LRT p = 0.021). Our findings suggest that dissemination of targeted information about COVID-19 vaccine by considering means of communication, gender and people who are isolated during measures of social distancing may help to increase parental vaccine acceptance."
https://openalex.org/W4226174907,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2) is linked to risk of neurodegenerative disease. However, the function of TREM2 in neurodegeneration is still not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of microglial TREM2 in TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-related neurodegeneration using virus-mediated and transgenic mouse models. We found that TREM2 deficiency impaired phagocytic clearance of pathological TDP-43 by microglia and enhanced neuronal damage and motor impairments. Mass cytometry analysis revealed that human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) induced a TREM2-dependent subpopulation of microglia with high CD11c expression and phagocytic ability. Using mass spectrometry (MS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, we further demonstrated an interaction between TDP-43 and TREM2 in vitro and in vivo as well as in human tissues from individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We computationally identified regions within hTDP-43 that interact with TREM2. Our data highlight that TDP-43 is a possible ligand for microglial TREM2 and that this interaction mediates neuroprotection of microglia in TDP-43-related neurodegeneration. Using mouse models of TDP-43 neurodegeneration, this study demonstrates that microglial TREM2 binds TDP-43 and thus mediates its phagocytic clearance. TDP-43 may serve as a possible ligand for microglial TREM2 in TDP-43-related neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4200121553,"Large clinical trials and real-world studies have demonstrated that the beneficial effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on renal outcomes regardless of the presence of diabetes. However, the mechanism remains obscure. Here, we analyze the anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects of dapagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, on renal alternations using the ischemia/reperfusion-induced fibrosis model. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis showed that the accumulation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites and upregulation of inflammation in fibrosis renal cortical tissue were mitigated by dapagliflozin treatment. Moreover, dapagliflozin markedly relieved the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin and hypoxia inducible factor-1α signaling and restored tubular cell-preferred fatty acid oxidation. Notably, NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation was strikingly blocked by dapagliflozin. We further demonstrated that the immunomodulatory metabolite itaconate derived from the TCA cycle was significantly boosted as a result of decreased isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 and increased immune-responsive gene 1 and mitochondrial citrate carrier in dapagliflozin-treated mice, which contributed to the inhibitory effect of dapagliflozin on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, administration of cell-permeable itaconate surrogate prevented activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and protected kidney against fibrosis development. Our results identify a novel mechanism coupling metabolism and inflammation for kidney benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in progressive chronic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W4226396365,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease of humans caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first case was identified in China in December 2019 the disease has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. In this article, we present an agent-based model of COVID-19 in Luxembourg, and use it to estimate the impact, on cases and deaths, of interventions including testing, contact tracing, lockdown, curfew and vaccination. Our model is based on collation, with agents performing activities and moving between locations accordingly. The model is highly heterogeneous, featuring spatial clustering, over 2000 behavioural types and a 10 minute time resolution. The model is validated against COVID-19 clinical monitoring data collected in Luxembourg in 2020. Our model predicts far fewer cases and deaths than the equivalent equation-based SEIR model. In particular, with R 0 = 2.45, the SEIR model infects 87% of the resident population while our agent-based model infects only around 23% of the resident population. Our simulations suggest that testing and contract tracing reduce cases substantially, but are less effective at reducing deaths. Lockdowns are very effective although costly, while the impact of an 11pm-6am curfew is relatively small. When vaccinating against a future outbreak, our results suggest that herd immunity can be achieved at relatively low coverage, with substantial levels of protection achieved with only 30% of the population fully immune. When vaccinating in the midst of an outbreak, the challenge is more difficult. In this context, we investigate the impact of vaccine efficacy, capacity, hesitancy and strategy. We conclude that, short of a permanent lockdown, vaccination is by far the most effective way to suppress and ultimately control the spread of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4200308547,"In the last years the rapid expansion of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strains have become a major health problem. Efflux pumps are a group of transport proteins that contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) on the antimicrobial action of imipenem and cefepime on clinical strains of A. baumannii.A total of 49 non-duplicate clinical samples were collected during January through December of 2018 from patients hospitalized in the Hospital Regional Docente de Cajamarca. Of the 49 samples obtained, the confirmatory identification of A. baumannii was performed on 47 samples by molecular methods. The amplification of the blaOXA-51-like gene was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was calculated using the microdilution method in culture broth. The susceptibility to both antibiotics (cefepime and imipenem) was evaluated in the presence and absence of the inhibitor carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP).A total of 47 strains of A. baumannii were isolated: 97.87% (46/47) were resistant to Imipenem, 2.13% (1/47) of them were classified as intermediate and none of these strains were susceptible. On the other hand, 51.06% (24/47) of isolates were resistant to cefepime; 19.15% (9/47) intermediate and 29.79% (14/47) susceptible. We considered a significant difference in antibiotic susceptibility if the MIC changed at least 4 dilutions, after the addition of the inhibitor. In the case of CCCP in addition to imipenem, 2.1% (1/47) had a significant change of 4 or more reductions in MIC, 59.6% (28/47) achieved a change equal or less than 3 dilutions and 17.0% (8/47) did not have any change. In the case of CCCP with cefepime the percentage of strains with the significant change of MIC was 8.5% (4/47). On the other hand, 53.2% (24/47) presented a reduction equal or less than 3 dilutions and 12.8% (6/47) did not show changes.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the use of CCCP may improve the antibiotic effect of imipenem and cefepime on clinical strains of A. baumannii. The relevance of this study is that it provides evidence that this efflux pump inhibitor may be an alternative treatment against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii."
https://openalex.org/W4200560430,"By September 2020, COVID-19 had claimed the lives of almost 1 million people worldwide, including more than 400,000 in the U.S. and Europe [1] To slow the spread of the virus, health officials advised social distancing, regular handwashing, and wearing a face covering [2]. We hypothesized that public adherence to the health guidance would be influenced by prevailing social norms, and the prevalence of these behaviors among others. We focused on mask-wearing behavior during fall 2020, and coded livestream public webcam footage of 1,200 individuals across seven cities. Results showed that only 50% of participants were correctly wearing a mask in public, and that this percentage varied as a function of the mask-wearing behavior of close and distant others in the immediate physical vicinity. How social normative information might be used to increase mask-wearing behavior is discussed. ""Cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus-particularly when used universally within a community setting"" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield in July 2020."
https://openalex.org/W4200300947,"Vascular calcification (VC), in which vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergo differentiation and osteogenic transition, is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent findings show that nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is an evolutionarily conserved antioxidant and beneficial in preventing vascular senescence and calcification. The roles of NRF2 in the initiation and progression of VC in CKD still need further investigation. CKD-associated VC model rats exhibited significant upregulation of NRF2, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), osteogenic markers such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2) and osteopontin (OPN), and β-catenin compared to CKD rats. Immunohistochemistry further verified these results. In addition, rat aortic VSMCs were isolated and subjected to four treatments: normal control, phosphorus-induced (Pi), Pi + NRF2 activator DMF, and Pi + NRF2 inhibitor ML385. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and calcium deposition of the four treatments were determined. The mRNA and protein expression levels of NRF2, NQO1, and haem oxygenase 1 (HO1) and the osteogenic markers ALP, Runx1, OPN, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), and β-catenin were quantified by RT-PCR and western blotting. VSMC apoptosis was calculated by flow cytometry. The in vitro results suggested that intracellular oxidative stress and calcification were closely associated with NRF2 activity and that the activation of NRF2 could significantly suppress osteogenic transition and apoptosis in VSMCs. Thus, this study indicated that the NRF2-related antioxidant pathway can positively respond to and protect against the initiation and progression of VC in CKD by reducing oxidative stress. This study may contribute insights facilitating the application of the NRF2 antioxidative system as a therapeutic treatment for vascular diseases such as CKD."
https://openalex.org/W4200425672,"Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) adults are the smallest of the five Pacific salmon native to the western Pacific Ocean. Pink salmon are also the most abundant of these species and account for a large proportion of the commercial value of the salmon fishery worldwide. A two-year life history of pink salmon generates temporally isolated populations that spawn either in even-years or odd-years. To uncover the influence of this genetic isolation, reference genome assemblies were generated for each year-class and whole genome re-sequencing data was collected from salmon of both year-classes. The salmon were sampled from six Canadian rivers and one Japanese river. At multiple centromeres we identified peaks of Fst between year-classes that were millions of base-pairs long. The largest Fst peak was also associated with a million base-pair chromosomal polymorphism found in the odd-year genome near a centromere. These Fst peaks may be the result of a centromere drive or a combination of reduced recombination and genetic drift, and they could influence speciation. Other regions of the genome influenced by odd-year and even-year temporal isolation and tentatively under selection were mostly associated with genes related to immune function, organ development/maintenance, and behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W4200052593,"Introduction European societies are rapidly becoming multicultural. Cultural diversity presents new challenges and opportunities to communities that receive immigrants and migrants, and highlights the need for culturally safe healthcare. Universities share a responsibility to build a fair and equitable society by integrating cultural content in the nursing curricula. This paper aims to analyze European student nurses´ experience of learning cultural competence and of working with patients from diverse cultural backgrounds. Materials and methods A phenomenological approach was selected through a qualitative research method. 7 semi-structured focus groups with 5–7 students took place at the participants’ respective universities in Spain, Belgium, Turkey and Portugal. Results 5 themes and 16 subthemes emerged from thematic analysis. Theme 1, concept of culture/cultural diversity, describes the participants’ concept of culture; ethnocentricity emerged as a frequent element in the students’ discourse. Theme 2, personal awareness, integrates the students’ self-perception of cultural competence and their learning needs. Theme 3, impact of culture, delves on the participants’ perceived impact of cultural on both nursing care and patient outcomes. Theme 4, learning cultural competence, integrates the participants’ learning experiences as part of their nursing curricula, as part of other academic learning opportunities and as part of extra-academic activities. Theme 5, learning cultural competence during practice placements, addresses some important issues including witnessing unequal care, racism, prejudice and conflict, communication and language barriers, tools and resources and positive attitudes and behaviors witnesses or displayed during clinical practice. Conclusion The participants’ perceived level of cultural competence was variable. All the participants agreed that transcultural nursing content should be integrated in the nursing curricula, and suggested different strategies to improve their knowledge, skills and attitudes. It is important to listen to the students and take their opinion into account when designing cultural teaching and learning activities."
https://openalex.org/W4200301493,"As many U.S. states implemented stay-at-home orders beginning in March 2020, anecdotes reported a surge in alcohol sales, raising concerns about increased alcohol use and associated ills. The surveillance report from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism provides monthly U.S. alcohol sales data from a subset of states, allowing an investigation of this potential increase in alcohol use. Meanwhile, anonymized human mobility data released by companies such as SafeGraph enables an examination of the visiting behavior of people to various alcohol outlets such as bars and liquor stores. This study examines changes to alcohol sales and alcohol outlet visits during COVID-19 and their geographic differences across states. We find major increases in the sales of spirits and wine since March 2020, while the sales of beer decreased. We also find moderate increases in people's visits to liquor stores, while their visits to bars and pubs substantially decreased. Noticing a significant correlation between alcohol sales and outlet visits, we use machine learning models to examine their relationship and find evidence in some states for likely panic buying of spirits and wine. Large geographic differences exist across states, with both major increases and decreases in alcohol sales and alcohol outlet visits."
https://openalex.org/W4200337018,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the mainstay of therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) but up to 60% of patients have inadequate response to therapy. Acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) play important roles in nociception. This study aimed to investigate whether the increased expression of ASICs results in neuronal hyperexcitability in GERD. Esophageal biopsies were taken from GERD patients and healthy subjects to compare expression of ASIC1 and 3. Next, gene and protein expression of ASIC1 and 3 from esophageal mucosa and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons were measured by qPCR, Western-blot and immunofluorescence in rodent models of reflux esophagitis (RE), non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), and sham operated groups. Excitability of DRG neurons in the GERD and sham groups were also tested by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We demonstrated that ASIC1 and 3 expression were significantly increased in patients with RE compared with healthy controls. This correlated positively with symptom severity of heartburn and regurgitation (p < .001). Next, ASIC1 and 3 gene and protein expression in rodent models of RE and NERD were similarly increased in esophageal mucosa as well as T3-T5 DRG neurons compared with sham operation. DRG neurons from RE animals showed hyperexcitability compared with sham group. However, intrathecal injection of ASIC specific inhibitors, PcTx1 and APTEx-2, as well as silencing ASIC1 and 3 genes with specific siRNAs prevented visceral hypersensitivity. Overall, upregulation of ASIC1 and 3 may lead to visceral hypersensitivity in RE and NERD and may be a potential therapeutic target for PPI non-responsive patients."
https://openalex.org/W4200347212,"Mitochondrial dysfunction or loss of homeostasis is a central hallmark of many human diseases. Mitochondrial homeostasis is mediated by multiple quality control mechanisms including mitophagy, a form of selective autophagy that recycles terminally ill or dysfunctional mitochondria in order to preserve mitochondrial integrity. Our prior studies have shown that members of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family localize to the mitochondria and may play important roles in mediating mitochondrial health in the corneal epithelium, an integral tissue that is required for the maintenance of optical transparency and vision. Importantly, the IGF-binding protein-3, IGFBP-3, is secreted by corneal epithelial cells in response to stress and functions to mediate intracellular receptor trafficking in this cell type. In this study, we demonstrate a novel role for IGFBP-3 in mitochondrial homeostasis through regulation of the short isoform (s)BNIP3L/NIX mitophagy receptor in corneal epithelial cells and extend this finding to non-ocular epithelial cells. We further show that IGFBP-3-mediated control of mitochondrial homeostasis is associated with alterations in lamellar cristae morphology and mitochondrial dynamics. Interestingly, both loss and gain of function of IGFBP-3 drive an increase in mitochondrial respiration. This increase in respiration is associated with nuclear accumulation of IGFBP-3. Taken together, these findings support a novel role for IGFBP-3 as a key mediator of mitochondrial health in mucosal epithelia through the regulation of mitophagy and mitochondrial morphology."
https://openalex.org/W4200114907,"Migrants are underrepresented in population health surveys. Offering translated survey instruments has been shown to increase migrant representation. While 'team translation' represents current best practice, there are relatively few published examples describing how it has been implemented. The purpose of this paper is to document the process, results and lessons from a project to translate an English-language sexual health and blood-borne virus survey into Khmer, Karen, Vietnamese and Traditional Chinese.The approach to translation was based on the TRAPD (Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pretesting, and Documentation) model. The English-language survey was sent to two accredited, independent translators. At least one bilingual person was chosen to review and compare the translations and preferred translations were selected through consensus. Agreed translations were pretested with small samples of individuals fluent in the survey language and further revisions made.Of the 51 survey questions, only nine resulted in identical independent translations in at least one language. Material differences between the translations related to: (1) the translation of technical terms and medical terminology (e.g. HIV); (2) variations in dialect; and (3) differences in cultural understandings of survey concepts (e.g. committed relationships).Survey translation is time-consuming and costly and, as a result, deviations from TRAPD 'best practice' occurred. It is not possible to determine whether closer adherence to TRAPD 'best practice' would have improved the quality of the resulting translations. However, our study does demonstrate that even adaptations of the TRAPD method can identify issues that may not have been apparent had non-team-based or single-round translation approaches been adopted. Given the dearth of clear empirical evidence about the most accurate and feasible method of undertaking translations, we encourage future researchers to follow our example of making translation data publicly available to enhance transparency and enable critical appraisal."
https://openalex.org/W4200193910,"Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) has been frequently overexpressed in many types of malignancy, suggesting its oncogenic function. It recognizes phosphorylated serine or threonine (pSer/Thr) of a target protein and isomerizes the adjacent proline (Pro) residue, thereby altering folding, subcellular localization, stability, and function of target proteins. The oncogenic transcription factor, Nrf2 harbors the pSer/Thr-Pro motif. This prompted us to investigate whether Pin1 could bind to Nrf2 and influence its stability and function in the context of implications for breast cancer development and progression. The correlation between Pin1 and Nrf2 in the triple-negative breast cancer cells was validated by RNASeq analysis as well as immunofluorescence staining. Interaction between Pin1 and Nrf2 was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation and an in situ proximity ligation assay. We found that mRNA and protein levels of Pin1 were highly increased in the tumor tissues of triple-negative breast cancer patients and the human breast cancer cell line. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of Pin1 enhanced the ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2. In contrast, the overexpression of Pin1 resulted in the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus, without affecting its transcription. Notably, the phosphorylation of Nrf2 at serine 215, 408, and 577 is essential for its interaction with Pin1. We also identified phosphorylated Ser104 and Thr277 residues in Keap1, a negative regulator of Nrf2, for Pin1 binding. Pin1 plays a role in breast cancer progression through stabilization and constitutive activation of Nrf2 by competing with Keap1 for Nrf2 binding."
https://openalex.org/W4200263212,"The objective of this study were to examine the effects of diets containing spineless cactus associated with hays of different legume species [gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), ""catingueira"" (Caesalpinia bracteosa), ""sabiá"" (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth) and ""catanduva"" (Piptadenia moniliformis Benth)] on the intake, digestibility, performance and carcass traits of lambs. Twenty-four ½ Santa Inês × ½ Soinga lambs with an average body weight of 21.4 ± 2.53 kg were distributed into four treatments in a completely randomized design. Treatments consisted of diets formulated with the association of spineless cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica Mill) and hay of four legume species, namely, ""catanduva"", ""sabiá"" ""catingueira"" and gliricidia. The lowest intakes (P<0.05) of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and total carbohydrates occurred in the animals that received the diet containing catingueira hay. However, there were no diet effects (P>0.05) on the intakes of crude protein (CP), ether extract and non-fibrous carbohydrates. The diets also did not change (P>0.05) the weight gain (0.197 kg/day) or final weight (33.18 kg) of the lambs or the apparent digestibility coefficients of DM, OM, CP and NDF. Consequently, the parameters of live weight at slaughter (34.10 kg), hot carcass weight (14.81 kg), cold carcass weight (14.66 kg), hot carcass yield (45.60%) and cold carcass yield (45.07%) exhibited the no response to treatment. In addition to these variables, the diets also did not influence subcutaneous fat thickness (2.54 mm), longissimus muscle area (13.34 cm2), morphometric measurements of the carcass, or the proportions of muscle and fat. Therefore, legume hays associated with spineless cactus can be used to feed ½ Santa Inês × ½ Soinga lambs in the feedlot, as this strategy provides heavy animals at the time of slaughter and carcasses with desirable degrees of muscularity and adiposity."
https://openalex.org/W4200393060,"Phosphorylation by serine-threonine and tyrosine kinases is critical for determining protein function. Array-based platforms for measuring reporter peptide signal levels allow for differential phosphorylation analysis between conditions for distinct active kinases. Peptide array technologies like the PamStation12 from PamGene allow for generating high-throughput, multi-dimensional, and complex functional proteomics data. As the adoption rate of such technologies increases, there is an imperative need for software tools that streamline the process of analyzing such data. We present Kinome Random Sampling Analyzer (KRSA), an R package and R Shiny web-application for analyzing kinome array data to help users better understand the patterns of functional proteomics in complex biological systems. KRSA is an All-In-One tool that reads, formats, fits models, analyzes, and visualizes PamStation12 kinome data. While the underlying algorithm has been experimentally validated in previous publications, we demonstrate KRSA workflow on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in male (n = 3) and female (n = 3) subjects to identify differential phosphorylation signatures and upstream kinase activity. Kinase activity differences between males and females were compared to a previously published kinome dataset (11 female and 7 male subjects) which showed similar global phosphorylation signals patterns."
https://openalex.org/W4226113085,"Camps of forcibly displaced populations are considered to be at risk of large COVID-19 outbreaks. Low screening rates and limited surveillance led us to conduct a study in Dagahaley camp, located in the Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya to estimate SARS-COV-2 seroprevalence and, mortality and to identify changes in access to care during the pandemic.To estimate seroprevalence, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among a sample of individuals (n = 587) seeking care at the two main health centres and among all household members (n = 619) of community health workers and traditional birth attendants working in the camp. A rapid immunologic assay was used (BIOSYNEX® COVID-19 BSS [IgG/IgM]) and adjusted for test performance and mismatch between the sampled population and that of the general camp population. To estimate mortality, all households (n = 12860) were exhaustively interviewed in the camp about deaths occurring from January 2019 through March 2021.In total 1206 participants were included in the seroprevalence study, 8% (95% CI: 6.6%-9.7%) had a positive serologic test. After adjusting for test performance and standardizing on age, a seroprevalence of 5.8% was estimated (95% CI: 1.6%-8.4%). The mortality rate for 10,000 persons per day was 0.05 (95% CI 0.05-0.06) prior to the pandemic and 0.07 (95% CI 0.06-0.08) during the pandemic, representing a significant 42% increase (p<0.001). Médecins Sans Frontières health centre consultations and hospital admissions decreased by 38% and 37% respectively.The number of infected people was estimated 67 times higher than the number of reported cases. Participants aged 50 years or more were among the most affected. The mortality survey shows an increase in the mortality rate during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic. A decline in attendance at health facilities was observed and sustained despite the easing of restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W4200155449,"Background Gauteng province, with 26.3% of South Africa’s population, is the commercial and industrial powerhouse of the country. During the first epidemic wave in 2020, Gauteng accounted for 32.0% of South Africa’s reported COVID-19 cases. Aim The aim of this study was to describe the health system response to the COVID-19 pandemic during the first epidemic wave in Gauteng province and to explore the perspectives of key informants on the provincial response. Material and methods Using an adapted Pandemic Emergency Response Conceptual Framework, this was a qualitative case study design consisting of 36 key informant interviews and a document analysis. We used thematic analysis to identify themes and sub-themes from the qualitative data. Results Our case study found that Gauteng developed an innovative, multi-sectoral and comprehensive provincial COVID-19 response that aimed to address the dual challenge of saving lives and the economy. However, the interviews revealed multiple perspectives, experiences, contestations and contradictions in the pandemic response. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and amplified the fragilities of existing systems, reflected in the corruption on personal protective equipment, poor data quality and inappropriate decisions on self-standing field hospitals. Rooted in a chronic under-investment and insufficient focus on the health workforce, the response failed to take into account or deal with their fears, and to incorporate strategies for psychosocial support, and safe working environments. The single-minded focus on COVID-19 exacerbated these fragilities, resulting in a de facto health system lockdown and reported collateral damage. The key informants identified missed opportunities to invest in primary health care, partner with communities and to include the private health sector in the pandemic response. Conclusion Gauteng province should build on the innovations of the multi-sectoral response to the COVID-19 pandemic, while addressing the contested areas and health system fragilities."
https://openalex.org/W4200240159,"Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a leading cause of blindness in the elderly, is routinely treated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors that have limited efficacy and potentially adverse side effects. An unmet clinical need is to develop novel therapies against other angiogenic factors for alternative or combination treatment to improve efficacy and safety. We recently described secretogranin III (Scg3) as a disease-selective angiogenic factor, causally linked to diabetic retinopathy and acting independently of the VEGF pathway. An important question is whether such a disease-selective Scg3 pathway contributes to other states of pathological angiogenesis beyond diabetic retinopathy. By applying a novel in vivo endothelial ligand binding assay, we found that the binding of Scg3 to CNV vessels in live mice was markedly increased over background binding to healthy choriocapillaris and blocked by an Scg3-neutralizing antibody, whereas VEGF showed no such differential binding. Intravitreal injection of anti-Scg3 humanized antibody Fab (hFab) inhibited Matrigel-induced CNV with similar efficacy to the anti-VEGF drug aflibercept. Importantly, a combination of anti-Scg3 hFab and aflibercept synergistically alleviated CNV. Homozygous deletion of the Scg3 gene markedly reduced CNV severity and abolished the therapeutic activity of anti-Scg3 hFab, but not aflibercept, suggesting a role for Scg3 in VEGF-independent CNV pathogenesis and therapy. Our work demonstrates the stringent disease selectivity of Scg3 binding and positions anti-Scg3 hFab as a next-generation disease-targeted anti-angiogenic therapy for CNV."

The effective candidate was confirmed to be Bacillus marisflavi after 16S rRNA sequencing. The synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed by UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Atomic Force Microscopic (AFM) analysis showed spherical nanoparticles. Size analysis using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) showed particles of nano size averaging 78.77 nm. The diameter of the particles analyzed by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) showed 101.6 nm with a poly-dispersive index of 0.3. Finally the elemental nature of the nanoparticles was identified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). LC50 and LC90 values for the ovicidal, larvicidal and pupicidal efficacy of the AgNPs against the egg, larvae and pupae of Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles stephensi respectively were evaluated. The present study revealed that the nanoparticles have an excellent toxic effect against the disease transmitting vector mosquitoes. Hence, the rapid synthesis of AgNPs would be an appropriate eco-friendly tool for biocontrol of vector mosquitoes."

The present study was aimed to profile the whole microbial community structure and their predictive gene functionality of pe poke samples prepared in different fermentation periods viz. 3 day (3ds), 4 days (4ds), 5 days (5ds) and sun-dried sample (Sds). The pH of samples was 7.6 to 8.7, microbial load was 2.1-3.9 x 108 cfu/g with dynamic viscosity of 4.0±1.0 to 8.0±1.0cP. Metataxonomic profile of pe poke samples showed different domains viz. bacteria (99.08%), viruses (0.65%), eukaryota (0.08%), archaea (0.03%) and unclassified sequences (0.16%). Firmicutes (63.78%) was the most abundant phylum followed by Proteobacteria (29.54%) and Bacteroidetes (5.44%). Bacillus thermoamylovorans was significantly abundant in 3ds and 4ds (p<0.05); Ignatzschineria larvae was significantly abundant in 5ds (p<0.05), whereas, Bacillus subtilis was significantly abundant in Sds (p <0.05). A total of 172 species of Bacillus was detected. In minor abundance, the existence of bacteriophages, archaea, and eukaryotes were also detected. Alpha diversity analysis showed the highest Simpson's diversity index in Sds comparable to other samples. Similarly, a non-parametric Shannon's diversity index was also highest in Sds. Good's coverage of 0.99 was observed in all samples. Beta diversity analysis using PCoA showed no significant clustering. Several species were shared between samples and many species were unique to each sample. In KEGG database, a total number of 33 super-pathways and 173 metabolic sub-pathways were annotated from the metagenomic Open Reading Frames. Predictive functional features of pe poke metagenome revealed the genes for the synthesis and metabolism of wide range of bioactive compounds including various essential amino acids, different vitamins, and enzymes. Spearman's correlation was inferred between the abundant species and functional features."
https://openalex.org/W4200334885,"The systematic screening of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals is a powerful tool for controlling community transmission of infectious disease on college campuses. Faced with a paucity of testing in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities developed molecular diagnostic laboratories focused on SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing on campus and in their broader communities. We established the UC Santa Cruz Molecular Diagnostic Lab in early April 2020 and began testing clinical samples just five weeks later. Using a clinically-validated laboratory developed test (LDT) that avoided supply chain constraints, an automated sample pooling and processing workflow, and a custom laboratory information management system (LIMS), we expanded testing from a handful of clinical samples per day to thousands per day with the testing capacity to screen our entire campus population twice per week. In this report we describe the technical, logistical, and regulatory processes that enabled our pop-up lab to scale testing and reporting capacity to thousands of tests per day."

These algorithms use a combination of serologic and/or non-serologic biomarkers to assess the duration of infection. We evaluated the performance of four MAAs for individual-level recency assessments.Samples were obtained from 220 seroconverters (infected <1 year) and 4,396 non-seroconverters (infected >1 year) enrolled in an HIV prevention trial (HPTN 071 [PopART]); 28.6% of the seroconverters and 73.4% of the non-seroconverters had HIV viral loads ≤400 copies/mL. Samples were tested with two laboratory-based assays (LAg-Avidity, JHU BioRad-Avidity) and a point-of-care assay (rapid LAg). The four MAAs included different combinations of these assays and HIV viral load. Seroconverters on antiretroviral treatment (ART) were identified using a qualitative multi-drug assay.The MAAs identified between 54 and 100 (25% to 46%) of the seroconverters as recently-infected. The false recent rate of the MAAs for infections >2 years duration ranged from 0.2%-1.3%. The MAAs classified different overlapping groups of individuals as recent vs. non-recent. Only 32 (15%) of the 220 seroconverters were classified as recent by all four MAAs. Viral suppression impacted the performance of the two LAg-based assays. LAg-Avidity assay values were also lower for seroconverters who were virally suppressed on ART compared to those with natural viral suppression.The four MAAs evaluated varied in sensitivity and specificity for identifying persons infected <1 year as recently infected and classified different groups of seroconverters as recently infected. Sensitivity was low for all four MAAs. These performance issues should be considered if these methods are used for individual-level recency assessments."

https://openalex.org/W4200232258,"Pupillometry, thanks to its strong relationship with cognitive factors and recent advancements in measuring techniques, has become popular among cognitive or neural scientists as a tool for studying the physiological processes involved in mental or neural processes. Despite this growing popularity of pupillometry, the methodological understanding of pupillometry is limited, especially regarding potential factors that may threaten pupillary measurements' validity. Eye blinking can be a factor because it frequently occurs in a manner dependent on many cognitive components and induces a pulse-like pupillary change consisting of constriction and dilation with substantive magnitude and length. We set out to characterize the basic properties of this ""blink-locked pupillary response (BPR),"" including the shape and magnitude of BPR and their variability across subjects and blinks, as the first step of studying the confounding nature of eye blinking. Then, we demonstrated how the dependency of eye blinking on cognitive factors could confound, via BPR, the pupillary responses that are supposed to reflect the cognitive states of interest. By building a statistical model of how the confounding effects of eye blinking occur, we proposed a probabilistic-inference algorithm of de-confounding raw pupillary measurements and showed that the proposed algorithm selectively removed BPR and enhanced the statistical power of pupillometry experiments. Our findings call for attention to the presence and confounding nature of BPR in pupillometry. The algorithm we developed here can be used as an effective remedy for the confounding effects of BPR on pupillometry."
https://openalex.org/W4200277809,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a cause of vascular endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage, which are characterized as hallmarks of dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, which become a severe global health emergency with substantial morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are still no promising therapeutics to alleviate the dengue-associated vascular hemorrhage in a clinical setting. In the present study, we first observed that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression level was highly suppressed in severe DENV-infected patients. In contrast, the overexpression of HO-1 could attenuate DENV-induced pathogenesis, including plasma leakage and thrombocytopenia, in an AG129 mouse model. Our data indicate that overexpression of HO-1 or its metabolite biliverdin can maintain endothelial integrity upon DENV infection in vitro and in vivo. We further characterized the positive regulatory effect of HO-1 on the endothelial adhesion factor vascular endothelial-cadherin to decrease DENV-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Subsequently, we confirmed that two medicinal plant-derived compounds, andrographolide, and celastrol, widely used as a nutritional or medicinal supplement are useful to attenuate DENV-induced plasma leakage through induction of the HO-1 expression in DENV-infected AG129 mice. In conclusion, our findings reveal that induction of the HO-1 signal pathway is a promising option for the treatment of DENV-induced vascular pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W4200583998,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought profound changes to all corners of society and affected people in every aspect of their lives. This survey-based study investigated how household food related matters such as food sourcing and consumption behaviors of 2,126 Chinese consumers in different age groups changed approximately two months into the COVID-19 quarantine. A new food sourcing mechanism, community-based online group grocery-ordering (CoGGO), was widely adopted by households, particularly among the youngest group studied (18-24 years of age). The same group showed a higher confidence in the food supply system during the quarantine and a greater propensity for weight gain while staying-at-home. The more mature age group (≥35 years of age) showed heightened vigilance and awareness, with fewer grocery-shopping trips, a higher tendency for purchasing extra food, and less tendency to waste food. Survey findings of the new food-sourcing mechanism, attitudes to food, and changes in behavior among different age groups provide valuable insights to guide policies and management interventions to address matters pertaining to food supply and distribution, food access and household food security, and food waste reduction."
https://openalex.org/W4200285284,"Vitamin D deficiency is associated with risk of several common cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Here we have utilized patient derived epithelial organoids (ex vivo) and CRC cell lines (in vitro) to show that calcitriol (1,25OHD) increased the expression of the CRC tumor suppressor gene, CDH1, at both the transcript and protein level. Whole genome expression analysis demonstrated significant differential expression of a further six genes after 1,25OHD treatment, including genes with established links to carcinogenesis GADD45, EFTUD1 and KIAA1199. Furthermore, gene ontologies relevant to carcinogenesis were enriched by 1,25OHD treatment (e.g., 'regulation of Wnt signaling pathway', 'regulation of cell death'), with common enriched processes across in vitro and ex vivo cultures including 'negative regulation of cell proliferation', 'regulation of cell migration' and 'regulation of cell differentiation'. Our results identify genes and pathways that are modifiable by calcitriol that have links to CRC tumorigenesis. Hence the findings provide potential mechanism to the epidemiological and clinical trial data indicating a causal association between vitamin D and CRC. We suggest there is strong rationale for further well-designed trials of vitamin D supplementation as a novel CRC chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent."
https://openalex.org/W4200605409,"The global crop sector is estimated to contribute about 10.4% of global GHGs annually. The Canadian crop sector is assessed as adding about 6.5% to total national emissions. These estimates over report the impact of farming as they ignore the complex interaction of cropping with the environment and the role land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) play in sequestering carbon. This study quantifies the contribution of land use to GHG emissions and removals in the Canadian Prairies crop sector between 1985 and 2016. The modeling effort explores how different farming practices (i.e., conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT), zero tillage (ZT), summerfallow, crop rotations, and residue retention) and input usage rates (i.e., fertilizer and fuel) affect GHG emissions in different soil climate zones and provinces in the Prairies region. The adoption of sustainable practices led to an 80% decline in GHG emissions in the crop sector between 1985 and 2016. Since 2005, the baseline for Canada's Paris commitment, sectoral emissions dropped 53%, more than is required to meet the 2030 target. Most promising, the crop sector was a net GHG sink between 2013 and 2016 in Alberta and between 2006 and 2016 in Saskatchewan. As positive as these developments have been, more can be done by directing research to identify options for reducing GHGs in Manitoba (which made only minimal improvements as farmers there faced conditions requiring continuous use of conventional tillage practices), to explore better nitrogen management (a major continuing source of GHG from cropping) and by searching for low carbon transport options."
https://openalex.org/W4200200258,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows patients with serious illnesses to access investigational drugs for “compassionate use” outside of clinical trials through expanded access (EA) Programs. The federal Right-to-Try Act created an additional pathway for non-trial access to experimental drugs without institutional review board or FDA approval. This removal of oversight amplifies the responsibility of physicians, but little is known about the role of practicing physicians in non-trial access to investigational drugs. We undertook semi-structured interviews to capture the experiences and opinions of 21 oncologists all with previous EA experience at a major cancer center. We found five main themes. Participants with greater EA experience reported less difficulty accessing drugs through the myriad of administrative processes and drug company reluctance to provide investigational products while newcomers reported administrative hurdles. Oncologists outlined several rationales patients offered when seeking investigational drugs, including those with stronger health literacy and a good scientific rationale versus others who remained skeptical of conventional medicine. Participants reported that most patients had realistic expectations while some had unrealistic optimism. Given the diverse reasons patients sought investigational drugs, four factors—scientific rationale, risk-benefit ratio, functional status of the patient, and patient motivation—influenced oncologists’ decisions to request compassionate use drugs. Physicians struggled with a “right-to-try” framing of patient access to experimental drugs, noting instead their own responsibility to protect patients’ best interest in the uncertain and risky process of off-protocol access. This study highlights the willingness of oncologists at a major cancer center to pursue non-trial access to experimental treatments for patients while also shedding light on the factors they use when considering such treatment. Our data reveal discrepancies between physicians’ sense of patients’ expectations and their own internal sense of professional obligation to shepherd a safe process for patients at a vulnerable point in their care."
https://openalex.org/W4200227369,"To stem the HIV epidemic among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), prevention programs must target services towards those most at risk for HIV. This paper investigates approaches to estimate HIV risk and map the spatial heterogeneity of at-risk populations in three countries: Eswatini, Haiti and Mozambique.We analyzed HIV biomarker and risk factor data from recent population-based household surveys. We characterized risk using three approaches: complementary log-log regression, latent class analysis (LCA), and presence of at least one risk factor. We calculated the proportion and 95 percent confidence intervals of HIV-negative AGYW at risk across the three methods and employed Chi-square tests to investigate associations between risk classification and HIV status. Using geolocated survey data at enumeration clusters and high-resolution satellite imagery, we applied algorithms to predict the number and proportion of at-risk AGYW at hyperlocal levels.The any-risk approach yielded the highest proportion of at-risk and HIV-negative AGYW across five-year age bands: 26%-49% in Eswatini, 52%-67% in Haiti, and 32%-84% in Mozambique. Using LCA, between 8%-16% of AGYW in Eswatini, 37%-62% in Haiti, and 56%-80% in Mozambique belonged to a high vulnerability profile. In Haiti and Mozambique, the regression-based profile yielded the lowest estimate of at-risk AGYW. In general, AGYW characterized as ""at risk"" across the three methods had significantly higher odds of HIV infection. Hyperlocal maps indicated high levels of spatial heterogeneity in HIV risk prevalence and population density of at-risk AGYW within countries.Characterizing risk among AGYW can help HIV prevention programs better understand the differential effect of multiple risk factors, facilitate early identification of high-risk AGYW, and design tailored interventions. Hyperlocal mapping of these at-risk populations can help program planners target prevention interventions to geographic areas with populations at greatest risk for HIV to achieve maximal impact on HIV incidence reduction."
https://openalex.org/W4200271224,"A majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections are transmitted from a minority of infected subjects, some of which may be symptomatic or pre-symptomatic. We aimed to quantify potential infectiousness among asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) in relation to prior or later symptomatic disease. We previously (at the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic) performed a cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 infections among 27,000 healthcare workers (HCWs) at work in the capital region of Sweden. We performed both SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and serology. Furthermore, the cohort was comprehensively followed for sick leave, both before and after sampling. In the present report, we used the cohort database to quantify potential infectiousness among HCWs at work. Those who had sick leave either before or after sampling were classified as post-symptomatic or pre-symptomatic, whereas the virus-positive subjects with no sick leave were considered asymptomatic. About 0.2% (19/9449) of HCW at work were potentially infectious and pre-symptomatic (later had disease) and 0.17% (16/9449) were potentially infectious and asymptomatic (never had sick leave either before nor after sampling). Thus, 33% and 28% of all the 57 potentially infectious subjects were pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, respectively. When a questionnaire was administered to HCWs with past infection, only 10,5% of HCWs had had no indication at all of having had SARS-CoV-2 infection (""truly asymptomatic""). Our findings provide a unique quantification of the different groups of asymptomatic, potentially infectious HCWs."
https://openalex.org/W4200379488,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate neurological damage in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). This study aimed to investigate the biological roles of lncRNA CEBPA-AS1 in CIRI. Middle cerebral artery occlusion and ischemia-reperfusion injury (MCAO/IR) rat model and oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) cell lines were generated; the expression of CEBPA-AS1 was evaluated by qRT-PCR. The effects of CEBPA-AS1 on cell apoptosis and nerve damage were examined. The downstream microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA of CEBPA-AS1 were predicted and verified. We found that overexpression of CEBPA-AS1 could attenuate MCAO/IR-induced nerve damage and neuronal apoptosis in the rat model. Knockdown of CEBPA-AS1 aggravated cell apoptosis and enhanced the production of LDH and MDA in the OGD/R cells. Upon examining the molecular mechanisms, we found that CEBPA-AS1 stimulated APPL1 expression by combining with miR-340-5p, thereby regulating the APPL1/LKB1/AMPK pathway. In the rescue experiments, CEBPA-AS1 overexpression was found to attenuate OGD/R-induced cell apoptosis and MCAO/IR induced nerve damage, while miR-340-5p reversed these effects of CEBPA-AS1. In conclusion, CEBPA-AS1 could decrease CIRI by sponging miR-340-5, regulating the APPL1/LKB1/AMPK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4200403666,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), the non-coding RNAs of ~22 nucleotides (nt) in length, play a vital role in regulating viral replication. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a single-stranded RNA virus, is a predominant pathogen of acute hepatitis worldwide. Virus-encoded miRNAs regulate the viral life cycle and escape from the host innate immune system. However, it is rarely known about HEV-encoded miRNA (HEV-miR-A6). In the present study, HEV-miR-A6 was screened by microarray, and further identified in vivo and in vitro. HEV-miR-A6 originated from the methylase (MeT) of HEV open reading frame 1 (ORF1) and was highly conserved in eight HEV genotypes. HEV-miR-A6 expression was growing during HEV replication, and significantly increased in acute hepatitis E patients than convalescence patients. Furthermore, HEV-miR-A6 was specifically detected in liver, spleen, kidney and colon by in situ hybridization. To identify the specificity of HEV-miR-A6, its mutants (HEV-miR-A6M1 and HEV-miR-A6M2) were constructed to change the stem-loop structure. Interestingly, over-expression of HEV-miR-A6 or HEV-miR-A6M1 significantly facilitated viral replication, while HEV-miR-A6M2, another mutant completely changed the stem-loop structure was invalid. SIRP-α, a candidate target gene of HEV-miR-A6, was activated when HEV-miR-A6 over-expressed to inhibit the phosphorylation of IRF3, and subsequently suppressed the expression of type I interferon β (IFN-β). The promotion of viral replication by HEV-miR-A6 further identified in vivo. Significant suppression of IFN-β production in the serum of HEV-infected mice pre-treated with HEV-miR-A6 was observed. In summary, HEV-miR-A6 activates SIRP-α to promote viral replication by inhibition of IFN-β expression."

Levels of change of the weekly number of inpatient cases with ischemic stroke diagnosis after the declaration of state of emergency were assessed using interrupted time-series (ITS) analysis. The numbers of patients with various characteristics and treatment approaches were compared. We also performed an ITS analysis for each group (""independent"" or ""dependent"") divided based on components of activities of daily living (ADL) and level of consciousness at hospital admission.A total of 170,294 cases in 567 hospitals were included. The ITS analysis showed a significant decrease in the weekly number of ischemic stroke cases hospitalized (estimated decrease: -156 cases; 95% confidence interval (CI): -209 to -104), which corresponds to -10.4% (95% CI: -13.6 to -7.1). The proportion of decline in the independent group (-21.3%; 95% CI: -26.0 to -16.2) was larger than that in the dependent group (-8.6%; 95% CI: -11.7 to -5.4).Our results show a marked reduction in hospital admissions due to ischemic stroke after the declaration of the state of emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic.

We find that the level of efficiency varies widely over time and appears to cluster. Periods of high efficiency are followed by periods of low efficiency and vice versa. Further, we find that HFT activity is higher during periods of low efficiency. This supports the argument that HFTs seek profits and risk reduction by actively processing information, through limit order additions and cancellations, during periods of lower efficiency and revert to more passive market-making and rebate-generation during periods of higher efficiency. These findings support the argument that the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) is an appropriate description of how prices evolve to incorporate information."
https://openalex.org/W4200436755,"Music is especially valued in human societies, but music-like behavior in the form of song also occurs in a variety of other animal groups including primates. The calling of our primate ancestors may well have evolved into the music of modern humans via multiple selective scenarios. But efforts to uncover these influences have been hindered by the challenge of precisely defining musical behavior in a way that could be more generally applied across species. We propose an acoustic focused reconsideration of ""musicality"" that could help enable independent inquiry into potential ecological pressures on the evolutionary emergence of such behavior. Using published spectrographic images (n = 832 vocalizations) from the primate vocalization literature, we developed a quantitative formulation that could be used to help recognize signatures of human-like musicality in the acoustic displays of other species. We visually scored each spectrogram along six structural features from human music-tone, interval, transposition, repetition, rhythm, and syllabic variation-and reduced this multivariate assessment into a concise measure of musical patterning, as informed by principal components analysis. The resulting acoustic reappearance diversity index (ARDI) estimates the number of different reappearing syllables within a call type. ARDI is in concordance with traditional measures of bird song complexity yet more readily identifies shorter, more subtly melodic primate vocalizations. We demonstrate the potential utility of this index by using it to corroborate several origins scenarios. When comparing ARDI scores with ecological features, our data suggest that vocalizations with diversely reappearing elements have a pronounced association with both social and environmental factors. Musical calls were moderately associated with wooded habitats and arboreal foraging, providing partial support for the acoustic adaptation hypothesis. But musical calling was most strongly associated with social monogamy, suggestive of selection for constituents of small family-sized groups by neighboring conspecifics. In sum, ARDI helps construe musical behavior along a continuum, accommodates non-human musicality, and enables gradualistic co-evolutionary paths between primate taxa-ranging from the more inhibited locational calls of archaic primates to the more exhibitional displays of modern apes."

Regarding the onset of clustering, we estimate that the average size of methane clusters at the onset of clustering is Nc0≅20 at 11 bar. According to our measurements, the average cluster radius r follows the power law of r∝P01.86. Our ion time-of-flight measurements indicate that we have produced energetic deuterium ions with kT = 52±2 keV after laser-cluster interaction using CD4 gas at 50 bar. We find that this ion temperature agrees with the predicted temperature from CD4 clusters at 50 bar with r = 14 nm assuming the Coulomb explosion model."

In order to provide reasonable suggestions for scientific iodine supplementation and improve the health and living standards of the people in Xinjiang, it is necessary to understand the spatial distribution of iodine content in drinking water and explore the influencing factors of spatial heterogeneity of water iodine content distribution.The data of iodine in drinking water arrived from the annual water iodine survey in Xinjiang in 2017. The distribution of iodine content in drinking water in Xinjiang is described from three perspectives: sampling points, districts/counties, and townships/streets. ArcGIS was used for spatial auto-correlation analysis, mapping the distribution of iodine content in drinking water and visualizing the distribution of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model parameter. Kriging method is used to predict the iodine content in water at non-sampling points. GWR software was used to build GWR model in order to find the factors affecting the distribution of iodine content in drinking water.There are 3293 sampling points in Xinjiang. The iodine content of drinking water ranges from 0 to 128 μg/L, the median is 4.15 μg/L. The iodine content in 78.6% of total sampling points are less than 10 μg/L, and only that in the 3.4% are more than 40 μg/L. Among 1054 towns' water samples in Xinjiang, 88.9% of the samples' water iodine content is less than 10 μg/L. Among the 94 studied areas, the median iodine content in drinking water in 87 areas was less than 10 μg/L, those values in 7 areas were between 10-40 μg/L, and the distribution of water iodine content in Xinjiang shows clustered. The GWR model established had found that the effects of soil type and precipitation on the distribution of iodine content in drinking water were statistically significant.The iodine content of drinking water in Xinjiang is generally low, but there are also some areas which their drinking water has high iodine content. Soil type and precipitation are the factors affecting the distribution of drinking water iodine content, and are statistically significant (P<0.05)."

Before and after the monthly preparatory period prior to the season, strength measurements were assessed through the Swift SpeedMat platform, and reactivity of the lower limb muscles was assessed with tensiomyography (TMG). The athletes were also tested before and after the recovery training period. In the test after strength training, all average countermovement jump (CMJ) results improved. Flight time showed an increase with a moderate to large effect, using both legs (5.21%). Among the TMG parameters, time contraction (Tc) changed globally with a decrease (-5.20%). Changes in the results of the test after recovery training were most often not significant.A monthly period of strength training changes the neuromuscular profile of short-track female athletes, with no significant differences between the right and left lower limbs."

Yet, the current prevalence and factors associated with high-risk opioid prescribing in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) remain unclear, making it challenging to address opioid safety in this population. Therefore, we aimed to characterize opioid prescribing patterns among patients with CLD.This retrospective cohort study included patients with CLD identified at a single medical center and followed for one year from 10/1/2015-9/30/2016. Multivariable, multinomial regression was used identify the patient characteristics, including demographics, medical conditions, and liver-related factors, that were associated with opioid prescriptions and high-risk prescriptions (≥90mg morphine equivalents per day [MME/day] or co-prescribed with benzodiazepines).Nearly half (47%) of 12,425 patients with CLD were prescribed opioids over a one-year period, with 17% of these receiving high-risk prescriptions. The baseline factors significantly associated with high-risk opioid prescriptions included female gender (adjusted incident rate ratio, AIRR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.14-1.53), Medicaid insurance (AIRR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.36-2.06), cirrhosis (AIRR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04-1.43) and baseline chronic pain (AIRR = 3.40, 95% CI = 2.94-4.01), depression (AIRR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.60-2.32), anxiety (AIRR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.53-2.22), substance use disorder (AIRR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.67-2.79), and Charlson comorbidity score (AIRR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.22-1.32). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was associated with decreased high-risk opioid prescriptions (AIRR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.47-0.66).Opioid medications continue to be prescribed to nearly half of patients with CLD, despite efforts to curtail opioid prescribing due to known adverse events in this population."
https://openalex.org/W4200296028,"Preventing bites from undetected ticks through bathing practices would benefit public health, but the effects of these practices have been researched minimally. We immersed nymphal and adult hard ticks of species common in the eastern United States in tap water, using temperatures and durations that are realistic for human hot bathing. The effect of (a) different skin-equivalent surfaces (silicone and pig skin), and (b) water temperature was tested on Amblyomma americanum, Dermacentor variabilis and Ixodes scapularis nymphs. Overall, the type of surface had a much larger effect on the nymphs' tendency to stay in contact with the surface than water temperature did. Most nymphs that separated from the surface did so within the first 10 s of immersion, with the majority losing contact due to the formation of an air bubble between their ventral side and the test surface. In addition, adult Ixodes scapularis were tested for the effect of immersion time, temperature, and soap on tick responsiveness. Some individual adults moved abnormally or stopped moving as a result of longer or hotter immersion, but soap had little effect on responsiveness. Taken together, our results suggest that the surface plays a role in ticks' tendency to stay in contact; the use of different bath additives warrants further research. While water temperature did not have a significant short-term effect on tick separation, ticks that have not attached by their mouth parts may be rendered unresponsive and eventually lose contact with a person's skin in a hot bath. It should be noted that our research did not consider potential temperature effects on the pathogens themselves, as previous research suggests that some tickborne pathogens may become less hazardous even if the tick harboring them survives hot-water exposures and later bites the bather after remaining undetected."
https://openalex.org/W4200316796,"Microbial communities are early responders to wetland degradation, and instrumental players in the reversal of this degradation. However, our understanding of soil microbial community structure and function throughout wetland development remains incomplete. We conducted a survey across cranberry farms, young retired farms, old retired farms, flooded former farms, ecologically restored former farms, and natural reference wetlands with no history of cranberry farming. We investigated the relationship between the microbial community and soil characteristics that restoration intends to maximize, such as soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity and denitrification potential. Among the five treatments considered, flooded and restored sites had the highest prokaryote and microeukaryote community similarity to natural wetlands. In contrast, young retired sites had similar communities to farms, and old retired sites failed to develop wetland microbial communities or functions. Canonical analysis of principal coordinates revealed that soil variables, in particular potassium base saturation, sodium, and denitrification potential, explained 45% of the variation in prokaryote communities and 44% of the variation in microeukaryote communities, segregating soil samples into two clouds in ordination space: farm, old retired and young retired sites on one side and restored, flooded, and natural sites on the other. Heat trees revealed possible prokaryotic (Gemmatimonadetes) and microeukaryotic (Rhizaria) indicators of wetland development, along with a drop in the dominance of Nucletmycea in restored sites, a class that includes suspected mycorrhizal symbionts of the cranberry crop. Flooded sites showed the strongest evidence of wetland development, with triple the soil organic matter accumulation, double the cation exchange capacity, and seventy times the denitrification potential compared to farms. However, given that flooding does not promote any of the watershed or habitat benefits as ecological restoration, we suggest that flooding can be used to stimulate beneficial microbial communities and soil functions during the restoration waiting period, or when restoration is not an option."
https://openalex.org/W4200411555,"It has been proposed that ecological theory develops in a pragmatic way. This implies that ecologists are free to decide what, from the knowledge available to them, they will use to build models and learn about phenomena. Because in fields that develop pragmatically knowledge generation is based on the decisions of individuals and not on a set of predefined axioms, the best way to produce theoretical synthesis in such fields is to assess what individuals are using to support scientific studies. Here, we present an approach for producing theoretical syntheses based on the propositions most frequently used to learn about a defined phenomenon. The approach consists of (i) defining a phenomenon of interest; (ii) defining a collective of scientists studying the phenomenon; (iii) surveying the scientific studies about the phenomenon published by this collective; (iv) identifying the most referred publications used in these studies; (v) identifying how the studies use the most referred publications to give support to their studies and learn about the phenomena; (vi) and from this, identifying general propositions on how the phenomenon is approached, viewed and described by the collective. We implemented the approach in a case study on the phenomenon of ecological succession, defining the collective as the scientists currently studying succession. We identified three propositions that synthesize the views of the defined collective about succession. The theoretical synthesis revealed that there is no clear division between ""classical'' and ""contemporary'' succession models, and that neutral models are being used to explain successional patterns alongside models based on niche assumptions. By implementing the pragmatic approach in a case study, we show that it can be successfully used to produce syntheses based on the actual activity of the scientific community studying the phenomenon. The connection between the resulting synthesis and research activity can be traced back through the methodological steps of the approach. This result can be used to understand how knowledge is being used in a field of study and can guide better informed decisions for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W4200457147,"Parotid cancer is relatively rare, and malignancy varies; therefore, novel markers are needed to predict prognosis. Recent advances in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS), useful for visualization of lipid molecules, have revealed the relationship between cancer and lipid metabolism, indicating the potential of lipids as biomarkers. However, the distribution and importance of phospholipids in parotid cancer remain unclear.This study aimed to use MALDI-IMS to comprehensively investigate the spatial distribution of phospholipids characteristically expressed in human parotid cancer tissues.Tissue samples were surgically collected from two patients with parotid cancer (acinic cell carcinoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma). Frozen sections of the samples were assessed using MALDI-IMS in both positive and negative ion modes, with an m/z range of 600-1000. The mass spectra obtained in the tumor and non-tumor regions were compared and analyzed. Ion images corresponding to the peak characteristics of the tumor regions were visualized.Several candidate phospholipids with significantly different expression levels were detected between the tumor and non-tumor regions. The number of unique lipid peaks with significantly different intensities between the tumor and non-tumor regions was 95 and 85 for Cases 1 and 2, respectively, in positive ion mode, and 99 and 97 for Cases 1 and 2, respectively, in negative ion mode. Imaging differentiated the characteristics that phospholipids were heterogeneously distributed in the tumor regions.Phospholipid candidates that are characteristically expressed in human parotid cancer tissues were found, demonstrating the localization of their expression. These findings are notable for further investigation of alterations in lipid metabolism of parotid cancer and may have potential for the development of phospholipids as biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W4200458981,"In low-and middle-income countries, many infants and children remain unregistered in both civil registration and healthcare records, limiting their access to essential rights-based services, including healthcare. A novel biometric registration prototype, applying a non-touch platform using smart phones and tablets to capture physical characteristics of infants and children for electronic registration, was tested in rural Mozambique. This study assessed acceptability and perceived barriers and facilitators to the usability of this biometric registration prototype in Manhiça district, southern Mozambique. The study followed a qualitative design consisting of 5 semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers, 7 focus group discussions with caregivers of infants aged between 0 and 5 years old, and 2 focus group discussions with data collectors involved in the implementation of the biometric registration pilot project. Data were thematically analysed. The results of this study show that there is wide acceptability of the biometric registration prototype among healthcare providers and caregivers. Participants were aware of the benefits of the biometric registration prototype. The perceived benefits included that the biometric registration prototype would solve the inefficiency of paper-based registration, and the perception of biometric registration as “healthcare norm”. Perceived potential barriers to the implementation of the biometric registration prototype included: myths and taboos, lack of information, lack of time, lack of father’s consent, and potential workload among healthcare provider s. In conclusion, the biometric prototype was widely accepted due to its perceived usefulness. However, there is a need to address the perceived barriers, and involvement of children’s fathers and/or other relevant family members in the process of biometric registration."
https://openalex.org/W4200464725,"A large body of research has shown that visually induced self-motion (vection) and cognitive processing may interfere with each other. The aim of this study was to assess the interactive effects of a visual motion inducing vection (uniform motion in roll) versus a visual motion without vection (non-uniform motion) and long-term memory processing using the characteristics of standing posture (quiet stance). As the level of interference may be related to the nature of the cognitive tasks used, we examined the effect of visual motion on a memory task which requires a spatial process (episodic recollection) versus a memory task which does not require this process (semantic comparisons). Results confirm data of the literature showing that compensatory postural response in the same direction as background motion. Repeatedly watching visual uniform motion or increasing the cognitive load with a memory task did not decrease postural deviations. Finally, participants were differentially controlling their balance according to the memory task but this difference was significant only in the vection condition and in the plane of background motion. Increased sway regularity (decreased entropy) combined with decreased postural stability (increase variance) during vection for the episodic task would indicate an ineffective postural control. The different interference of episodic and semantic memory on posture during visual motion is consistent with the involvement of spatial processes during episodic memory recollection. It can be suggested that spatial disorientation due to visual roll motion preferentially interferes with spatial cognitive tasks, as spatial tasks can draw on resources expended to control posture."
https://openalex.org/W4200514923,"Opioid use accelerates normal aging in adults that raises a question on whether it may trans-generationally affect aging and aging biomarkers in the offspring of users as well? In the present research, we investigated the relative telomere length in umbilical cord blood of newborns born to opioid consuming mothers compared to normal controls. Telomere length shortening is a known biomarker of aging and aging related diseases. Its measure at birth or early in life is considered as a predictor of individual health in adulthood. Here, we performed a case-control study to investigate whether maternal opioid use affects newborns relative telomere length (RTL). 57 mother-newborn dyads were included in this study, 30 neonates with opioid using mothers (OM), and 27 with not-opioid using mothers (NOM)). RTL was measured in leukocyte cells genomic DNA using real-time PCR. The correlation of maternal opioid use with neonates telomer length was assessed using logistic regression analysis. The results displayed a significant association between odds ratio of long RTL and maternal opioid use when sensitivity analysis was performed by neonate sex; where the data indicates significantly increased odds ratio of long leukocyte RTL in association with maternal opioid use in male neonates only. Further work is necessary to assess this association in larger samples and test the potential underlying mechanisms for this observation."
