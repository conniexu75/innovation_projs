https://openalex.org/W2094222845,"A significant body of evidence accumulated over the last century suggests a link between hypoxic microenvironments within the infected host and the latent phase of tuberculosis. Studies to test this correlation have identified the M. tuberculosis initial hypoxic response, controlled by the two-component response regulator DosR. The initial hypoxic response is completely blocked in a dosR deletion mutant.We show here that a dosR deletion mutant enters bacteriostasis in response to in vitro hypoxia with only a relatively mild decrease in viability. In the murine infection model, the phenotype of the mutant was indistinguishable from that of the parent strain. These results suggested that additional genes may be essential for entry into and maintenance of bacteriostasis. Detailed microarray analysis of oxygen starved cultures revealed that DosR regulon induction is transient, with induction of nearly half the genes returning to baseline within 24 hours. In addition, a larger, sustained wave of gene expression follows the DosR-mediated initial hypoxic response. This Enduring Hypoxic Response (EHR) consists of 230 genes significantly induced at four and seven days of hypoxia but not at initial time points. These genes include a surprising number of transcriptional regulators that could control the program of bacteriostasis. We found that the EHR is independent of the DosR-mediated initial hypoxic response, as EHR expression is virtually unaltered in the dosR mutant.Our results suggest a reassessment of the role of DosR and the initial hypoxic response in MTB physiology. Instead of a primary role in survival of hypoxia induced bacteriostasis, DosR may regulate a response that is largely optional in vitro and in mouse infections. Analysis of the EHR should help elucidate the key regulatory factors and enzymatic machinery exploited by M. tuberculosis for long-term bacteriostasis in the face of oxygen deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W2035240167,"Background The human brain responds to recognizable signals for sex and for rewarding drugs of abuse by activation of limbic reward circuitry. Does the brain respond in similar way to such reward signals even when they are “unseen”, i.e., presented in a way that prevents their conscious recognition? Can the brain response to “unseen” reward cues predict the future affective response to recognizable versions of such cues, revealing a link between affective/motivational processes inside and outside awareness? Methodology/Principal Findings We exploited the fast temporal resolution of event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the brain response to “unseen” (backward-masked) cocaine, sexual, aversive and neutral cues of 33 milliseconds duration in male cocaine patients (n = 22). Two days after scanning, the affective valence for visible versions of each cue type was determined using an affective bias (priming) task. We demonstrate, for the first time, limbic brain activation by “unseen” drug and sexual cues of only 33 msec duration. Importantly, increased activity in an large interconnected ventral pallidum/amygdala cluster to the “unseen” cocaine cues strongly predicted future positive affect to visible versions of the same cues in subsequent off-magnet testing, pointing both to the functional significance of the rapid brain response, and to shared brain substrates for appetitive motivation within and outside awareness. Conclusions/Significance These findings represent the first evidence that brain reward circuitry responds to drug and sexual cues presented outside awareness. The results underscore the sensitivity of the brain to “unseen” reward signals and may represent the brain's primordial signature for desire. The limbic brain response to reward cues outside awareness may represent a potential vulnerability in disorders (e.g., the addictions) for whom poorly-controlled appetitive motivation is a central feature."
https://openalex.org/W2158855166,"Background Vaccination is a cost-effective counter-measure to the threat of seasonal or pandemic outbreaks of influenza. To address the need for improved influenza vaccines and alternatives to egg-based manufacturing, we have engineered an influenza virus-like particle (VLP) as a new generation of non-egg or non-mammalian cell culture-based candidate vaccine. Methodology/Principal Findings We generated from a baculovirus expression system using insect cells, a non-infectious recombinant VLP vaccine from both influenza A H5N1 clade 1 and clade 2 isolates with pandemic potential. VLPs were administered to mice in either a one-dose or two-dose regimen and the immune responses were compared to those induced by recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA). Both humoral and cellular responses were analyzed. Mice vaccinated with VLPs were protected against challenge with lethal reassortant viruses expressing the H5N1 HA and NA, regardless if the H5N1 clade was homologous or heterologous to the vaccine. However, rHA-vaccinated mice showed considerable weight loss and death following challenge with the heterovariant clade virus. Protection against death induced by VLPs was independent of the pre-challenge HAI titer or cell-mediated responses to HA or M1 since vaccinated mice, with low to undetectable cross-clade HAI antibodies or cellular responses to influenza antigens, were still protected from a lethal viral challenge. However, an apparent association rate of antibody binding to HA correlated with protection and was enhanced using VLPs, particularly when delivered intranasally, compared to rHA vaccines. Conclusion/Significance This is the first report describing the use of an H5N1 VLP vaccine created from a clade 2 isolate. The results show that a non-replicating virus-like particle is effective at eliciting a broadened, cross-clade protective immune response to proteins from emerging H5N1 influenza isolates giving rise to a potential pandemic influenza vaccine candidate for humans that can be stockpiled for use in the event of an outbreak of H5N1 influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2006745977,"Background Light plays a key role in multiple plant developmental processes. It has been shown that root development is modulated by shoot-localized light signaling and requires shoot-derived transport of the plant hormone, auxin. However, the mechanism by which light regulates root development is not largely understood. In plants, the endogenous auxin, indole-3-acetic acid, is directionally transported by plasma-membrane (PM)-localized auxin influx and efflux carriers in transporting cells. Remarkably, the auxin efflux carrier PIN proteins exhibit asymmetric PM localization, determining the polarity of auxin transport. Similar to PM-resident receptors and transporters in animal and yeast cells, PIN proteins undergo constitutive cycling between the PM and endosomal compartments. Auxin plays multiple roles in PIN protein intracellular trafficking, inhibiting PIN2 endocytosis at some concentrations and promoting PIN2 degradation at others. However, how PIN proteins are turned over in plant cells is yet to be addressed. Methodology and Principle Findings Using laser confocal scanning microscopy, and physiological and molecular genetic approaches, here, we show that in dark-grown seedlings, the PM localization of auxin efflux carrier PIN2 was largely reduced, and, in addition, PIN2 signal was detected in vacuolar compartments. This is in contrast to light-grown seedlings where PIN2 was predominantly PM-localized. In light-grown plants after shift to dark or to continuous red or far-red light, PIN2 also accumulated in vacuolar compartments. We show that PIN2 vacuolar targeting was derived from the PM via endocytic trafficking and inhibited by HY5-dependent light signaling. In addition, the ubiquitin 26S proteasome is involved in the process, since its inhibition by mutations in COP9 and a proteasome inhibitor MG132 impaired the process. Conclusions and Significance Collectively, our data indicate that light plays an essential role in PIN2 intracellular trafficking, promoting PM-localization in the presence of light and, on the other hand, vacuolar targeting for protein degradation in the absence of light. Based on these results, we postulate that light regulation of root development is mediated at least in part by changes in the intracellular distribution of auxin efflux carriers, PIN proteins, in response to the light environment."
https://openalex.org/W2102204579,"Coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) is essential for electron transport in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and antioxidant defense. Last year, we reported the first mutations in CoQ(10) biosynthetic genes, COQ2, which encodes 4-parahydroxybenzoate: polyprenyl transferase; and PDSS2, which encodes subunit 2 of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of primary CoQ(10) deficiency have not been well characterized. In this study, we investigated the consequence of severe CoQ(10) deficiency on bioenergetics, oxidative stress, and antioxidant defenses in cultured skin fibroblasts harboring COQ2 and PDSS2 mutations. Defects in the first two committed steps of the CoQ(10) biosynthetic pathway produce different biochemical alterations. PDSS2 mutant fibroblasts have 12% CoQ(10) relative to control cells and markedly reduced ATP synthesis, but do not show increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, signs of oxidative stress, or increased antioxidant defense markers. In contrast, COQ2 mutant fibroblasts have 30% CoQ(10) with partial defect in ATP synthesis, as well as significantly increased ROS production and oxidation of lipids and proteins. On the basis of a small number of cell lines, our results suggest that primary CoQ(10) deficiencies cause variable defects of ATP synthesis and oxidative stress, which may explain the different clinical features and may lead to more rational therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2014670494,"Full-length transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel TRPC4α and shorter TRPC4β lacking 84 amino acids in the cytosolic C terminus are expressed in smooth muscle and endothelial cells where they regulate membrane potential and Ca2+ influx. In common with other “classical” TRPCs, TRPC4 is activated by Gq/phospholipase C-coupled receptors, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Little is also known about any isoform-specific channel regulation. Here we show that TRPC4α but not TRPC4β was strongly inhibited by intracellularly applied phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). In contrast, several other phosphoinositides (PI), including PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3, had no effect or even potentiated TRPC4α indicating that PIP2 inhibits TRPC4α in a highly selective manner. We show that PIP2 binds to the C terminus of TRPC4α but not that of TRPC4β in vitro. Its inhibitory action was dependent on the association of TRPC4α with actin cytoskeleton as it was prevented by cytochalasin D treatment or by the deletion of the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (Thr-Thr-Arg-Leu) that links TRPC4 to F-actin through the sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor and ezrin. PIP2 breakdown appears to be a required step in TRPC4α channel activation as PIP2 depletion alone was insufficient for channel opening, which additionally required Ca2+ and pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o proteins. Thus, TRPC4 channels integrate a variety of G-protein-dependent stimuli, including a PIP2/cytoskeleton dependence reminiscent of the TRPC4-like muscarinic agonist-activated cation channels in ileal myocytes.

(TRPC) proteins are closely related to the prototypical Drosophila TRP and TRPL (dTRPs) both structurally and functionally as they are commonly gated by phospholipase C (PLC) activation (1Ramsey I.S. Delling M. Clapham D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). However, the molecular scenarios of TRPC activation downstream of PLC are diverse and may involve relevant lipids such as diacylglycerol (DAG) in the case of TRPC2, -C3, -C6, and -C7, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation, and/or Ca2+ store depletion in the case of TRPC1 and -C3 (1Ramsey I.S. Delling M. Clapham D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). The activation mechanism for the TRPC4/5 subgroup remains most elusive as none of the above appears to be involved (2Plant T.D. Schaefer M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2005; 371: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Notably, TRPC4/5 are most closely related to dTRPs, and recombinant dTRPL is known to be inhibited by the PLC substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), although PIP2 hydrolysis alone cannot account for dTRPL activation (3Estacion M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 530: 1-19Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, in trp mutants PIP2 depletion in vivo causes inhibition, rather than potentiation, of the dTRPL channels, which then remain insensitive to light until PIP2 is resynthesized (4Hardie R.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 578: 9-24Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Among mammalian TRPs, several members of the TRPV (V1, V5) and TRPM (M4, M5, M7, and M8) families have recently been shown to be regulated by PIP2 (5Rohacs T. Pfluegers Arch. 2007; 453: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Voets T. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 582: 939-944Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas the C termini of several TRPCs (C1, C5, C6, and C7) and TRPV1 bind to anionic lipids directly (7Kwon Y. Hofmann T. Montell C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 491-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In TRPC6, this binding, in competition with calmodulin (CaM), removes its inhibitory action and thus facilitates channel activation (7Kwon Y. Hofmann T. Montell C. Mol.

Here we tested the hypothesis that PIP2 can regulate TRPC4 channel activity. TRPC4 is widely expressed in different tissues, particularly in brain, vascular endothelium, and gastrointestinal smooth muscles (8Freichel M. Vennekens R. Olausson J. Stolz S. Philipp S. Weissgerber P. Flockerzi V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 567: 59-66Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Native functions of TRPC4 include its role in the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and control of endothelial permeability (9Freichel M. Suh S.H. Pfeifer A. Schweig U. Trost C. Weissgerber P.

Paria B.C. Mehta D. Flockerzi V. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Its biophysical properties also resemble muscarinic cation current (mICAT) of the gastrointestinal tract, which is similarly regulated by the PLC system via M3 muscarinic receptors (11Zholos A.V. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2006; 27: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Indeed, evidence is growing that TRPC4 is a critical part of mICAT ((12Lee K.P. Jun J.Y. Chang I.Y. Suh S.H. So I. Kim K.W. Mol. Cells. 2005; 20: 435-441PubMed Google Scholar) and our observations 5V. Tsvilovskyy, M. Freichel, and V. Flockerzi, unpublished observations.5V. Tsvilovskyy, M. Freichel, and V. Flockerzi, unpublished observations. showing the lack of mICAT in TRPC4-deficient mouse ileal myocytes). Two most abundant TRPC4 variants are a “full-length” TRPC4α and shorter TRPC4β (or TRPC4Δ) lacking a stretch of 84 amino acids (781-864 in the case of mouse TRPC4) in the cytosolic C terminus (Δ84AA). The functional implications of their differential tissue expression (13Walker R.L. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1184-C1192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Flockerzi V. Jung C. Aberle T. Meissner M. Freichel M. Philipp S. Nastainczyk W. Maurer P. Zimmermann R. Pfluegers Arch. 2005; 451: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) are intriguing, and they call for further investigations into the differential regulation of TRPC4 isoforms. They form heteromultimers whereby TRPC4α exerts a dominant negative effect ascribed to an autoinhibitory function of the Δ84AA region (15Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Stresow N. Albrecht N. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the nature of this inhibition remains unknown. In this study we found that PIP2 inhibited TRPC4α, but not TRPC4β, suggesting a role of the Δ84AA region in PIP2 interaction with the channel. This was revealed by direct in vitro binding assay. Furthermore, we show that this PIP2-dependent regulation involves cytoskeleton and TRPC4 C-terminal PDZ-interacting domain through which TRPC4/5 are known to associate with NHERF/ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)/actin cytoskeleton (16Tang Y.

Dufour J.F. Krause K.H. Hoth M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3497-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, we found that several other phosphoinositides, which bind to the C termini in other TRPCs (7Kwon Y. Hofmann T. Montell C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 491-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), including PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3, as well as highly negatively charged inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) had no effect or even potentiated TRPC4α indicating that the inhibitory action of PIP2 was highly specific and was not simply a negative charge effect. Overall, PIP2 depletion appears to be a required step in the activation of TRPC4α but not TRPC4β. Additional requirement of TRPC4 channel activation include intracellular Ca2+, pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi/o proteins, and perhaps other undefined components of PLC signaling. The multifaceted gating requirement suggests that TRPC4 channels are capable of integrating a variety of G-protein-dependent stimuli, including a PIP2/cytoskeleton dependence much like the TRPC4-like muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR)-activated cation channels in ileal myocytes. Integration of these stimuli might enable fine-tuning of channel activation as required for coordinated functions of the endothelium or smooth muscles in the intestine and the bladder, as well as neural signaling in the nervous system. Cells and Treatments—HEK293 cells stably expressing mouse TRPC4 (mTRPC4) isoforms were grown under culture conditions as described (16Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and seeded in 35-mm dishes 2 days prior to patch clamp recordings. For cells coexpressing M5AChR, the receptor cDNA in pIREShyg2 vector (BD Biosciences) was transfected to the stable TRPC4 cell lines, and transformants were selected and maintained in the culture medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. Male guinea pigs (300-400 g) were killed by exposure to carbon dioxide (Schedule One of the UK Animals Scientific Procedures Act 1986). Single smooth muscle myocytes from the longitudinal muscle layer of the guinea pig ileum were isolated after collagenase (type 1A, 1 mg ml-1 at 36 °C for 25 min) treatment (18Zholos A.V. Bolton T.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 997-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with cytochalasin D (5 μm) for 2 h at 37 °C, PTX (100 ng/ml) for 16-18 h at 37 °C, and wortmannin (20 or 30 μm) for 10-60 min at 20-23 °C. Total RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Purified single guinea pig ileal myocytes were used for protein and RNA analysis. Myenteric ganglia were removed from cell suspension using cell filtration through 80-μm nylon net filters (Millipore). Total RNA was extracted from ileal myocytes using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. PCR was performed using sense primer 5′-CTGCAAATATCTCTGGGAAG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CTACAATCTTGTGGTCACGTAGT-3′, for predicted products encompassing guinea pig TRPC4 cDNA derived from exons 5 to 9 and the coding sequence for Δ84AA with predicted products of 1422 and 1170 bp for the α and β isoforms, respectively. Protein Preparation and Western Blot—Microsomal membrane proteins were prepared from wild type mouse brain, TRPC4-deficient mouse brain, and smooth muscle cells isolated from guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle. Protein samples (150 μg per lane) were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted, and incubated in the presence of the TRPC4 antibody (14Flockerzi V. Jung C. Aberle T. Meissner M. Freichel M. Philipp S. Nastainczyk W. Maurer P. Zimmermann R. Pfluegers Arch. 2005; 451: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To control protein loading, the filter was stripped and incubated in the presence of a CaVβ2 antibody that recognizes the type 2 β subunit of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (19Weissgerber P. Held B. Bloch W. Kaestner L. Chien K.R. Fleischmann B.K. Lipp P. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated twice with identical results. Coimmunoprecipitation—Cell lysates from untransfected HEK293 cells and stably transfected cell lines were immunoprecipitated using goat anti-actin and goat anti-ezrin antibodies (both were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4. The precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted using a polyclonal anti-TRPC4 antibody against an N-terminal peptide of TRPC4 (16Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In Vitro PIP2 Binding Assay—The C termini of TRPC4α-(733-974) and TRPC4β-(733-890), as well as Δ84AA-(781-864), were synthesized in vitro as maltose-binding protein fusion proteins using the transcription- and translation-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys. The products were incubated with PIP2-agarose beads (Echelon Inc.) in 260 μl of a binding buffer that contained 120 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature. Bound proteins were collected by a brief centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min and washed twice with 1 ml of the same binding buffer. Protein separation and exposure to x-ray film are as described previously (16Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ and Membrane Potential Measurements—Control HEK293 cells and stable cell lines were seeded at 100,000 cells/well in wells of 96-well plates and allowed to grow for 18-24 h. Cells were washed with an extracellular solution and loaded with Fluo4-AM (2 μm) as described (20Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i was measured using a fluid handling integrated fluorescence plate reader, FlexStation (Molecular Devices). Drugs were diluted in extracellular buffer at three times the desired final concentrations and delivered to the sample plate by the integrated robotic 8-channel pipettor at the preprogrammed time points. For membrane potential measurements, the FLIPR membrane potential dye was diluted in the extracellular solution and added to cells following the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Devices). The excitation/emission wavelengths used for Fluo4 and the membrane potential dye were 494/525 and 530/565 nm, respectively. Patch Clamp Recordings and Data Analysis—Whole-cell currents were recorded using borosilicate patch pipettes (2-3 megohms) and an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) interfaced to Digidata 1322A with the pClamp 9 support. Holding potential was -40 mV. Parallel continuous data acquisition was performed using MiniDigi 1A (Molecular Devices) and AxoScope 9 software. TRPC4 currents in HEK293 cells were activated by carbachol application or, alternatively, by infusing 200 μm GTPγS via pipette. mICAT in ileal myocytes was activated by applying carbachol at a sub-maximally effective concentration of 50 μm. Identical external and pipette solutions were used for patch clamp recordings in HEK293 and native cells to ensure compatibility of the results. The external solution contained (mm) the following: CsCl 120, glucose 12, HEPES 10, pH 7.4 (CsOH). The pipette solution contained (mm) the following: CsCl 80, MgATP 1, creatine 5, GTPγS 0.2, d-glucose 5, HEPES 10, BAPTA 10, CaCl2 4.6 ([Ca2+]i = 100 nm), pH 7.4 (CsOH). Carbachol-induced currents were recorded with 1 mm GTP instead of GTPγS. Data were analyzed and plotted using Clampfit 9 (Molecular Devices) and Origin 7 (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Cationic conductance activation curves were obtained from steady-state I-V relationships measured by voltage steps or slow (6-s-long) voltage ramps from 80 to -120 mV (both producing similar I-V curves, e.g. Fig. 1, E and F) and fitted using a modified Boltzmann function as shown in Equation 1, G=Gv1+exp((V-Va)/Sa)+Gs×11+exp((V-Vi)/Si)+Is(Eq. 1) where Gv and Gs are voltage-dependent and -independent components, respectively (Gs is typically <15% of Gv); Va and Vi are the potentials of half-maximal activation and inhibition, respectively; sa and si are corresponding slopes; and Is is the noninactivating component. This formalism accounted for both region of negative slope conductance at potentials less than -40 mV and channel inactivation (or block) at potentials more than -20 mV. Fitting was restricted to potentials of <40 mV because at more depolarized potentials the blockade was somewhat relieved, resulting in an overall characteristic doubly rectifying I-V shape or N-shaped conductance curve. Stock solutions of Me2SO-soluble drugs were made at the following concentrations: 2 mm U-73122 and U-73343, 5 mm cytochalasin D, 10 mm wortmannin. diC8-phosphoinositides (Echelon Research Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT) were dissolved in deionized and deoxygenated water at 0.4 mm or directly in the pipette solution (if applied at concentrations higher than 20 μm) by a 30-min sonication on ice. All other drugs were from Sigma. All values are expressed as means ± S.E. A t test (for two groups) or analysis of variance (for multiple comparisons) followed by Dunnett's test to compare all data versus control were used, and differences were considered statistically significant with p < 0.05. Activation of TRPC4 Is Dependent on Voltage, PLC, and PIP2—TRPC4 channel currents and mICAT in native gastrointestinal myocytes share many biophysical and regulatory properties (2Plant T.D. Schaefer M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2005; 371: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Zholos A.V. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2006; 27: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By examining the expression of TRPC4 in single guinea pig ileal myocytes with myenteric ganglia removed by cell filtration, we found that both TRPC4α and -β isoforms were expressed at the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1A). Importantly, Western blotting showed comparable levels of expression of the two isoforms. Thus, in this study we first investigated regulation of TRPC4α and -β channels stably expressed in HEK293 cells. We then tested relevance of our findings under identical conditions for functional regulation of mICAT, which we used as a native counterpart. We established HEK293 cells stably expressing murine TRPC4α or TRPC4β (Fig. 1B). These isoforms differ in the Δ84AA stretch in the C terminus, which is present in TRPC4α only and which contains two CaM-binding sites as shown schematically in Fig. 1B, bottom inset. In fluorescence membrane potential or intracellular Ca2+ concentration measurements, TRPC4 activity was readily detectable as membrane depolarization in response to carbachol (Fig. 1C) or a more prolonged agonist-induced Ca2+ signal indicative of an enhanced Ca2+ entry (Fig. 1D). This occurred through an endogenous Gq/11-coupled mAChR, most likely the M3 type as an M3 antagonist, p-F-HHSiD, inhibited the responses with a pA2 value of 7.4 (derived from Schild regression analysis; data not shown). In ileal myocytes, carbachol induces robust current responses (Fig. 1E, top inset), which have been shown to occur through synergistic activation of Gi/o-coupled M2 and Gq/11-coupled M3 mAChR (21Zholos A.V. Bolton T.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Zholos A.V. Tsytsyura Y.D. Gordienko D.V. Tsvilovskyy V.V. Bolton T.B. Br. J.

Sci. 2004; 95: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This current shows a characteristic doubly rectifying I-V relationship (Fig. 1E, black curve), which is similar to that of TRPC4 current, especially in case of the TRPC4β isoform (e.g. Fig. 1E, gray line), which shows lesser inactivation at positive potentials (see below). Gating of several TRPVs and TRPMs is efficiently regulated by both membrane potential and phosphoinositides (PIs) (24Nilius B. Mahieu F. Karashima Y. Voets T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas voltage-dependent aspects of TRPC gatings are less well appreciated. Although the origin of TRPC4 voltage dependence is not known, the current shows prominent regulation by membrane potential. This was particularly evident in the voltage-step experiments (Fig. 1F). Thus, stepping the membrane potential negatively from the holding potential of -40 mV resulted in an instantaneous current increase because of increased driving force followed by rapid current relaxations to levels that were smaller than the holding current at -40 mV. Tail currents were also prominent as shown in Fig. 1F (magnified inset) suggesting channel deactivation at negative potentials as well as additional activation at positive potentials. In the same cell, an identical I-V relationship could be obtained by applying a 6-s duration voltage ramp (Fig. 1E, compare gray line, ramp protocol, and circles, voltage step protocol). This justified the use of the slow voltage ramps for evaluation of the steady-state voltage-dependent properties of TRPC4. In this and in the majority of other experiments we mainly analyzed TRPC4 currents induced by intracellular GTPγS because carbachol was rather inefficient (see below). We quantitatively analyzed this voltage dependence by generating TRPC4 conductance curves and fitting them to Equation 1, which can simultaneously approximate either channel activation (between -120 and about -20 mV) and block or activation (positive to about -20 mV) (Fig. 1G). In one well studied case, TRPV6, strong inward rectification occurs because of intracellular Mg2+ channel block (25Voets T. Janssens A. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but its origin in TRPC4 remains unclear. The two TRPC4 isoforms differed (p < 0.0001) in the potentials of half-maximal activation (-55.0 ± 1.6 mV for α-isoform and -38.7 ± 1.9 mV for β-isoform) and the extent of channel inactivation at positive potentials (92.5 ± 0.9% for α-isoform and 76.9 ± 3.9% for β-isoform). The slopes for activation (-22.4 ± 0.5 mV versus -21.8 ± 0.6 mV) and inhibition (8.2 ± 0.1 mV versus 8.0 ± 0.2 mV), as well as the potentials of half-maximal inactivation (-9.5 ± 0.7 mV versus -8.0 ± 0.2 mV) were similar (all values are for α-isoform (n = 47) and β-isoforms (n = 37), respectively). As will be shown later, some of PIs tested in this study produced substantial alteration of this apparently intrinsic TRPC4 voltage dependence raising a possibility that TRPC4 similarly to some other TRPs (24Nilius B. Mahieu F. Karashima Y. Voets T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) is dually regulated by membrane potential and PIs. Both heterologously expressed TRPC4 channels and native mICAT are activated downstream of PLC, but the prime activator in the PLC pathway remains unknown in both cases. The main products of PLC activation, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and DAG (as well as DAG metabolites), do not activate TRPC4 or mICAT to any appreciable extent (2Plant T.D. Schaefer M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2005; 371: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Zholos A.V. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2006; 27: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we focused on the role of the PLC substrate, PIP2, and tested the hypothesis that PIP2 may represent a physiologically important brake on TRPC4 activity. In the fluorescence membrane potential assay, both TRPC4α and -β cell lines displayed similar sensitivity to carbachol with EC50 values of ∼7 μm (Fig. 2, A and B). However, in whole-cell recordings, carbachol failed to induce any significant current in TRPC4β-expressing cells (not shown). By contrast, about two-thirds of TRPC4α-expressing cells responded to carbachol by generating inward currents of variable amplitudes (Fig. 2, C and D). This discrepancy between fluorescence membrane potential assay and the whole-cell recording could be due to the fact that the undisturbed cytosolic environment in the former assay allowed some positive feedback mechanisms, which could be missing in the whole-cell configuration (e.g. limited Ca2+-dependent TRPC4 potentiation because of [Ca2+]i buffering), to amplify channel activation and that small and noisy current responses recorded in voltage clamp experiments were nevertheless sufficient to produce significant membrane depolarization owning to a very high input resistance of these cells. To study the effect of PIP2 on agonist-induced TRPC4α current, we included 20 μm dioctanoyl analog of PIP2 (diC8-PIP2), the more water-soluble short form of PIP2, in the recording pipettes. Under these conditions, none of the 12 tested TRPC4α-expressing cells produced any substantial response to carbachol (Fig. 2, C, bottom trace, and B). Mean current density with PIP2 was significantly lower than without PIP2 (p = 0.015). This finding is in support of the above hypothesis that PLC-mediated breakdown of PIP2 is involved in TRPC4 activation. However, the fact that not all control cells were responsive to the agonist prompted us to establish more appropriate recording conditions to study TRPC4 activation. Intriguingly, overexpression of the Gq-coupled M5AChR failed to improve activation by carbachol of both TRPC4 isoforms in the whole-cell experiments. In fluorescence membrane potential assay, the EC50 to carbachol was reduced 15- and 51-fold for TRPC4α and -β, respectively, without a change in the maximal response (Fig. 2, A and B), showing that the receptor is expressed and can be coupled to TRPC4 activation. The fact that it did not exert an effect on eliciting TRPC4 current in whole-cell recording indicated that PLC activation may not be the sole mechanism of TRPC4 gating (see below), at least under the whole-cell conditions used for recording mICAT. The above mentioned reasons would, of course, make the membrane potential assay mor"
https://openalex.org/W2142477504,"Low birth weight is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) in humans. Detrimental effects of low birth weight are amplified by rapid catch-up growth. Conversely, slow growth during lactation reduces CVD risk. Gestational protein restriction causes low birth weight, vascular dysfunction, and accelerated aging in rats. Atherosclerotic aortic tissue has shortened telomeres, and oxidative stress accelerates telomere shortening through generation of DNA single-strand breaks (ssbs). This study tested the hypothesis that maternal diet influences aortic telomere length through changes in DNA ssbs, antioxidant capacity, and oxidative stress. We used our models of gestational protein restriction followed by rapid catch-up growth (the recuperated group) and protein restriction during lactation (the postnatal low-protein [PLP] group). Southern blotting revealed fewer aortic DNA ssbs and subsequently fewer short telomeres (P<0.05) in the PLP group. This result was associated with reduced (P<0.01) 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, a marker of oxidative stress. PLP animals expressed increased (P<0.01) manganese superoxide-dismutase, copper-zinc superoxide-dismutase, catalase, and glutathione-reductase. Age-dependent changes in antioxidant defense enzymes indicated more protection to oxidative stress in the PLP animals; conversely, recuperated animals demonstrated age-associated impairment of antioxidant defenses. We conclude that maternal diet has a major influence on aortic telomere length. This finding may provide a mechanistic link between early growth patterns and CVD."

By utilizing a population-based study of 1508 cases and 1556 controls, we investigated the associations of dietary intake of choline and two related micronutrients, methionine and betaine, and risk of breast cancer. The highest quintile of choline consumption was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer [odds ratio (OR): 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58-1.00] compared with the lowest quintile. Two putatively functional single nucleotide polymorphisms of choline-metabolizing genes, PEMT -774G>C (rs12325817) and CHDH +432G>T (rs12676), were also found be related to breast cancer risk. Compared with the PEMT GG genotype, the variant CC genotype was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.01-1.67). The CHDH minor T allele was also associated with an increased risk (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.00-1.41) compared with the major G allele. The BHMT rs3733890 polymorphism was also examined but was found not to be associated with breast cancer risk. We observed a significant interaction between dietary betaine intake and the PEMT rs7926 polymorphism (P(interaction)=0.04). Our findings suggest that choline metabolism may play an important role in breast cancer etiology."
https://openalex.org/W2149383303,"Cytochrome P450s (P450) play a key role in oxidative reactions in plant secondary metabolism. Some of them, which catalyze unique reactions other than the standard hydroxylation, increase the structural diversity of plant secondary metabolites. In isoquinoline alkaloid biosyntheses, several unique P450 reactions have been reported, such as methylenedioxy bridge formation, intramolecular C-C phenol-coupling and intermolecular C-O phenol-coupling reactions. We report here the isolation and characterization of a C-C phenol-coupling P450 cDNA (CYP80G2) from an expressed sequence tag library of cultured Coptis japonica cells. Structural analysis showed that CYP80G2 had high amino acid sequence similarity to Berberis stolonifera CYP80A1, an intermolecular C-O phenol-coupling P450 involved in berbamunine biosynthesis. Heterologous expression in yeast indicated that CYP80G2 had intramolecular C-C phenol-coupling activity to produce (S)-corytuberine (aporphine-type) from (S)-reticuline (benzylisoquinoline type). Despite this intriguing reaction, recombinant CYP80G2 showed typical P450 properties: its C-C phenol-coupling reaction required NADPH and oxygen and was inhibited by a typical P450 inhibitor. Based on a detailed substrate-specificity analysis, this unique reaction mechanism and substrate recognition were discussed. CYP80G2 may be involved in magnoflorine biosynthesis in C. japonica, based on the fact that recombinant C. japonica S-adenosyl-L-methionine:coclaurine N-methyltransferase could convert (S)-corytuberine to magnoflorine."
https://openalex.org/W2018012535,"SET domain-containing proteins represent an evolutionarily conserved family of epigenetic regulators, which are responsible for most histone lysine methylation. Since some of these genes have been revealed to be essential for embryonic development, we propose that the zebrafish, a vertebrate model organism possessing many advantages for developmental studies, can be utilized to study the biological functions of these genes and the related epigenetic mechanisms during early development. To this end, we have performed a genome-wide survey of zebrafish SET domain genes. 58 genes total have been identified. Although gene duplication events give rise to several lineage-specific paralogs, clear reciprocal orthologous relationship reveals high conservation between zebrafish and human SET domain genes. These data were further subject to an evolutionary analysis ranging from yeast to human, leading to the identification of putative clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) of this gene family. By means of whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization strategy, we have also carried out a developmental expression mapping of these genes. A group of maternal SET domain genes, which are implicated in the programming of histone modification states in early development, have been identified and predicted to be responsible for all known sites of SET domain-mediated histone methylation. Furthermore, some genes show specific expression patterns in certain tissues at certain stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the development of these systems. These results provide a global view of zebrafish SET domain histone methyltransferases in evolutionary and developmental dimensions and pave the way for using zebrafish to systematically study the roles of these genes during development."
https://openalex.org/W1968524593,"Background The role of ß-catenin signaling in mesodermal lineage formation and differentiation has been elusive. Methodology To define the role of ß-catenin signaling in these processes, we used a Dermo1(Twist2)Cre/+ line to target a floxed β-catenin allele, throughout the embryonic mesenchyme. Strikingly, the Dermo1Cre/+; β-cateninf/− conditional Knock Out embryos largely phenocopy Pitx1−/−/Pitx2−/− double knockout embryos, suggesting that ß-catenin signaling in the mesenchyme depends mostly on the PITX family of transcription factors. We have dissected this relationship further in the developing lungs and find that mesenchymal deletion of β-catenin differentially affects two major mesenchymal lineages. The amplification but not differentiation of Fgf10-expressing parabronchial smooth muscle progenitor cells is drastically reduced. In the angioblast-endothelial lineage, however, only differentiation into mature endothelial cells is impaired. Conclusion Taken together these findings reveal a hierarchy of gene activity involving ß-catenin and PITX, as important regulators of mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2113617378,"Histatin 5 (Hst5) is a human salivary antimicrobial peptide that targets fungal mitochondria. In the human parasitic protozoa Leishmania, the mitochondrial ATP production is essential, as it lacks the bioenergetic switch between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation described in some yeasts. On these premises, Hst5 activity was assayed on both stages of its life cycle, promastigotes and amastigotes (LC(50)=7.3 and 14.4 microM, respectively). In a further step, its lethal mechanism was studied. The main conclusions drawn were as follows: 1) Hst5 causes limited and temporary damage to the plasma membrane of the parasites, as assessed by electron microscopy, depolarization, and entrance of the vital dye SYTOX Green; 2) Hst5 translocates into the cytoplasm of Leishmania in an achiral receptor-independent manner with accumulation into the mitochondrion, as shown by confocal microscopy; and 3) Hst5 produces a bioenergetic collapse of the parasite, caused essentially by the decrease of mitochondrial ATP synthesis through inhibition of F(1)F(0)-ATPase, with subsequent fast ATP exhaustion. By using the Hst5 enantiomer, it was found that the key steps of its lethal mechanism involved no chiral recognition. Hst5 thus constitutes the first leishmanicidal peptide with a defined nonstereospecific intracellular target. The prospects of its development, by its own or as a carrier molecule for other leishmanicidal molecules, into a novel anti-Leishmania drug with a preferential subcellular accumulation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2108248880,"The synaptic serine protease neurotrypsin is considered to be essential for the establishment and maintenance of cognitive brain functions, because humans lacking functional neurotrypsin suffer from severe mental retardation. Neurotrypsin cleaves agrin at two homologous sites, liberating a 90-kDa and a C-terminal 22-kDa fragment from the N-terminal moiety of agrin. Morphological analyses indicate that neurotrypsin is contained in presynaptic terminals and externalized in association with synaptic activity, while agrin is localized to the extracellular space at or in the vicinity of the synapse. Here, we present a detailed biochemical analysis of neurotrypsin-mediated agrin cleavage in the murine brain. In brain homogenates, we found that neurotrypsin exclusively cleaves glycanated variants of agrin. Studies with isolated synaptosomes obtained by subcellular fractionation from brains of wild-type and neurotrypsin-overexpressing mice revealed that neurotrypsin-dependent cleavage of agrin was concentrated at synapses, where the most heavily glycanated variants of agrin predominate. Because agrin has been shown to play an important role in the formation and the maintenance of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system, its local cleavage at the synapse implicates the neurotrypsin/agrin system in the regulation of adaptive reorganizations of the synaptic circuitry in the context of cognitive functions, such as learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W1985158166,"Previous research indicates that a combination vaccine targeting different stages of the malaria life cycle is likely to provide the most effective malaria vaccine. This trial was the first to combine two existing vaccination strategies to produce a vaccine that induces immune responses to both the pre-erythrocytic and blood stages of the P. falciparum life cycle.This was a Phase I/IIa study of a new combination malaria vaccine FFM ME-TRAP+PEV3A. PEV3A includes peptides from both the pre-erythrocytic circumsporozoite protein and the blood-stage antigen AMA-1. This study was conducted at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. The participants were healthy, malaria naïve volunteers, from Oxford. The interventions were vaccination with PEV3A alone, or PEV3A+FFM ME-TRAP. The main outcome measure was protection from malaria in a sporozoite challenge model. Other outcomes included measures of parasite specific immune responses induced by either vaccine; and safety, assessed by collection of adverse event data.We observed evidence of blood stage immunity in PEV3A vaccinated volunteers, but no volunteers were completely protected from malaria. PEV3A induced high antibody titres, and antibodies bound parasites in immunofluorescence assays. Moreover, we observed boosting of the vaccine-induced immune response by sporozoite challenge. Immune responses induced by FFM ME-TRAP were unexpectedly low. The vaccines were safe, with comparable side effect profiles to previous trials. Although there was no sterile protection two major observations support an effect of the vaccine-induced response on blood stage parasites: (i) Lower rates of parasite growth were observed in volunteers vaccinated with PEV3A compared to unvaccinated controls (p = 0.012), and this was reflected in the PCR results from PEV3A vaccinated volunteers. These showed early control of parasitaemia by some volunteers in this group. One volunteer, who received PEV3A alone, was diagnosed very late, on day 20 compared to an average of 11.8 days in unvaccinated controls. (ii). Morphologically abnormal parasites were present in the blood of all (n = 24) PEV3A vaccinated volunteers, and in only 2/6 controls (p = 0.001).

We have shown that FGFR2b signaling regulates SMG proliferation and morphogenesis, which are dependent on laminin-511 and β1 integrin signaling, which reciprocally regulate FGFR and Fgf1 expression (17Steinberg Z.

Both FGF10 and FGF7 bind FGFR2b, but FGF10 mitogenic activity is more heparin-dependent than FGF7 (3Igarashi M. Finch P.W. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol.

FGF10 is highly expressed in the condensing SMG mesenchyme, whereas FGFR2b is in the initial epithelial bud that forms on the end of a single primary duct (20Patel V.N. Rebustini I.T. Hoffman M.P. Differentiation. 2006; 74: 349-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Investigating the mechanisms that control end bud expansion, clefting, duct formation, and differentiation is fundamental to understanding branching morphogenesis. HS protects FGFs from proteolytic degradation; participates in FGF internalization, processing, and nuclear localization; and provides an extracellular reservoir from which FGFs can be released (21Vlodavsky I.

We reported that heparanase, an endoglycosidase that degrades heparan sulfate, modulates the biological activity of FGF10 in the SMG (24Patel V.N. Knox S.M. Likar K.M. Lathrop C.A. Hossain R. Eftekhari S. Whitelock J.M. Elkin M. Vlodavsky I. Hoffman M.P. Development (Cambr.). 2007; 134: 4177-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Heparanase releases FGF10 from perlecan HS in the basement membrane, increasing mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, epithelial clefting, and lateral branch formation, which results in increased branching morphogenesis. We proposed that heparanase-derived HS fragments might influence both the bioavailability and the bioactivity of FGF10, resulting in distinct morphogenic outcomes. Efforts to identify HS structures that bind specific FGFs or FGFRs using heparin-derived oligosaccharide libraries give different results, depending on the FGF, cell type, size of heparin, and type of assay used. To summarize, HS is both a positive and a negative regulator of FGF signaling (25Yates E.A. Guimond S.E. Turnbull J.E. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Guimond S.E. Turnbull J.E. Curr.

Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and the stability of the HS·FGF·FGFR complex correlates with overall O-sulfation rather than the precise distribution of sulfates (29Jastrebova N.

Taken together, binding studies suggest that specific structural features of HS influence specific FGF-receptor interactions in different biological contexts. Our goal is to define the structural requirements of HS that modulate FGF10-mediated biological processes during SMG morphogenesis. Here, we define the HS structure in terms of size and sulfation patterns that modulate FGF10-mediated proliferation and morphogenesis using two complementary model systems: BaF3 cells expressing specific FGFRs and isolated SMG epithelial organ culture, which lacks the endogenous mesenchyme-derived FGF10 and HS. We demonstrate that differences in HS sulfate patterns, and not just charge density, influence morphogenesis and cellular differentiation, resulting in both duct elongation and end bud expansion. The end bud expansion is due to increased FGFR1b signaling, which also results in cell differentiation, suggesting that specific HS structures modulate diverse FGF10 functions during SMG branching morphogenesis. Materials—Human recombinant FGF1 FGF2, FGF7, and FGF10 were purchased from R&D Systems. For BaF3 cell culture, recombinant mouse FGF10 was expressed in a bacterial expression vector, purified by a heparin-Sepharose column, followed by Mono S cation exchange chromatography (30Gitay-Goren H.

Fragments obtained following alkaline depolymerization of heparin (average mass ∼5 kDa; Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) were fractionated on a Sephadex G50 column using ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Fractions were dried and weighed, and size was determined by gradient electrophoresis by comparison with known standards. Following partial heparinase cleavage, the saccharides were separated by high resolution gel filtration as described (34Merry C.L. Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

BaF3 Cells and ex Vivo Submandibular Gland Organ Culture—The pre-B lymphocyte cell line BaF3, expressing FGFRs, was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% interleukin-3-conditioned medium from WEHI-3B cells. The cells expressing the FGFRs were also grown in RPMI 1640 plus 10 ng/ml recombinant FGF1 and 5 μg/ml heparin as previously described (27Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D.

Isolated epithelium were cultured in 15 μl of laminin-111 (1 mg/ml; Trevigen, MD) on track-etched polycarbonate filters (13 mm, 0.1-μm pore size) floated on top of 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 in 50-mm glass bottom microwell dishes (Mat-Tek). The medium was supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 150 μg/ml vitamin C, 50 μg/ml transferrin, and 200 ng/ml FGF10. Heparan sulfate or modified heparin fragments were also added directly to the medium. Up to six gland rudiments were cultured on each filter at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Glands were photographed at 44 h, and the number, width of end buds (measured in pixels and expressed as arbitrary units (AU), and length (AU) of the ducts were measured using MetaMorph software. The number of end buds, width, and length were also multiplied to give a morphogenic index (AU × 103), which is a measure of the complexity and amount of branching morphogenesis. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Detection of Cell Proliferation—BaF3 cells were washed three times and seeded into 96-well microtiter plates (20,000 cells/well) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and the indicated concentration of growth factors, heparin, and oligosaccharides. Fresh growth factors and other supplements were added every other day, and the viable cells were counted on day 5 of incubation. Each data point was preformed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least twice. A representative graph is shown with the means and the range. SMG epithelial proliferation was detected as described (17Steinberg Z. Myers C. Heim V.M. Lathrop C.A. Rebustini I.T. Stewart J.S. Larsen M. Hoffman M.P.

The SMGs were blocked using a mouse on mouse kit (M.O.M. reagents; Dako) and anti-bromodeoxyuridine and anti-α3 integrin rabbit polyclonal antiserum (a gift from Dr. M. DiPersio) were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the M.O.M. incubation buffer, and the appropriate secondary antibodies and SYBR green were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Inhibition of HS-induced End Bud Expansion—Epithelia were cultured as described above with FGF10, HS oligosaccharide, and FGFR inhibitor, SU5402 (1 and 2.5 μm), all added at the beginning of the experiment with Me2SO as a carrier control. SMG epithelia were cultured with recombinant FGFR1b chimera (10 and 15 μg/ml or 125 and 187 nm) (R&D Inc.). Gene expression was measured by RT-PCR after 48 h of culture, and the epithelial morphology was measured as described above. Real Time PCR—DNase-free RNA was prepared from at least six epithelial rudiments using an RNAqueous-4PCR kit and DNase removal reagent (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Real time PCR was performed using primers designed with similar properties by Beacon Designer software (sequences available on request), SYBR-green PCR Master Mix, and a MyIQ real time PCR thermocycler (all from Bio-Rad). Each cDNA (0.5-1 ng) was amplified with 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 62 °C for 30 s. Gene expression was normalized to 29 S. The reactions were run in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated three times. In Situ Hybridization—Digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled single-stranded RNA probes were prepared using the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids for FGFR1b and FGFR2b/PGEM-5Zf (+) were provided by Dr. Rosana Dono (Campus de Luminy, Marseille, France), and in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (36de Vega S.

FGF10 Induces Heparin-dependent Proliferation of HS-deficient BaF3/FGFR2b Cells—The proliferation of BaF3 cells overexpressing either FGFR2b (BaF3/FGFR2b) or FGFR1b (BaF3/FGFR1b) in response to FGFs is dependent on exogenous heparin or HS species (37Rapraeger A.C. Guimond S. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). FGF10 induced a dose-dependent increase in proliferation of BaF3/FGFR2b cells (Fig. 1A) in the presence of 5 μg/ml heparin. However, FGF10 did not induce proliferation in BaF3/FGFR1b cells with 5 μg/ml of heparin (Fig. 1A), suggesting that FGF10 is not a physiological ligand for FGFR1b proliferation. FGF1 increased BaF3/FGFR1b cell proliferation (data not shown), indicating that the cells were functional. Additionally, there was a dose-dependent increase in proliferation with increasing heparin (Fig. 1B) and 1 ng/ml of FGF10, which was an ∼50% maximal response in Fig. 1A. BaF3/FGFR2b cell proliferation was not observed with FGF10 in the absence of heparin. There was a maximal proliferative response with 5-10 μg/ml heparin, but with increasing heparin the proliferation decreased, suggesting that excess heparin bound competitively to FGF10, reducing its effective binding to FGFR and thus proliferation. HS Increases FGF10-dependent Morphogenesis and Proliferation of SMG Epithelium—Changes in SMG epithelial morphogenesis were measured in response to increasing concentrations of FGF10 with either HS or heparin. The results observed with HS (shown) were similar to those with heparin (data not shown). FGF10 alone (100-500 ng/ml) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in duct length (Fig. 1C), with narrow end buds. Further increases in FGF10 up to 1500 ng/ml resulted in longer ducts, as previously reported (17Steinberg Z. Myers C. Heim V.M. Lathrop C.A. Rebustini I.T. Stewart J.S. Larsen M. Hoffman M.P. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). HS alone does not support epithelial growth (not shown). However, HS (0.05-0.5 μg/ml) in combination with FGF10 resulted in more complex epithelial morphogenesis, and with 200 ng/ml FGF10 and 0.1 μg/ml HS or with 100 ng/ml FGF10 and 0.5 μg/ml HS, the epithelium had both elongating ducts and enlarged end buds. However, as concentrations of either HS or FGF10 increased, there was less morphogenesis with large end buds with no ducts (see 500 ng/ml FGF10 and 0.5 μg/ml HS), and with further increases in HS and FGF10, there was complete loss of morphogenesis, and the epithelia formed an amorphous clump of cells (not shown). Importantly, bromodeoxyuridine labeling (Fig. 1D) showed that the end bud expansion with exogenous HS was due to an increased area of proliferation. Epithelia treated with FGF10 alone proliferated mainly at the tips, whereas exogenous HS or heparin (not shown) resulted in more generalized proliferation throughout the end buds (Fig. 1D). FGF10-dependent BaF3/FGFR2b Proliferation and SMG Epithelial Morphogenesis Are Dependent on the Size of Heparin—We used heparin oligosaccharides ranging from dp4 to dp16, to define the minimal size of heparin required for FGF10-mediated (either 1 or 10 ng/ml) BaF3/FGFR2b cell proliferation (Fig. 2A). Heparin fragments shorter than dp10 did not induce FGF10-dependent proliferation when added at 5-50 μg/ml (Fig. 2A) (data not shown); however, there was a 2-fold increase in cell number with dp10 in the presence of 10 ng/ml of FGF10. Longer oligosaccharides activated FGF10 at both growth factor concentrations, and the potency of heparin oligosaccharides longer than dp16 was comparable with full-length heparin. FGF10-mediated SMG morphogenesis was also dependent on the length of heparin-derived oligosaccharides (Fig. 2B). Morphometric analysis (Fig. 2C) involved counting the number of end buds, measuring the length of the ducts (AU) and the width of the end buds (AU), and then multiplying all three parameters to obtain an overall morphogenic index (×103 AU). Increasing the length of the heparin oligosaccharides resulted in a gradual change in epithelial morphogenesis with 200 ng/ml FGF10 (Fig. 2, B and C). Epithelium treated with dp4 heparin fragments appeared similar to the epithelial rudiments cultured with FGF10 alone. However, dp6 and dp8 heparin fragments increased duct elongation, and dp10 fragments also caused end bud expansion and clefting. The increase in duct length with dp6 and dp8 fragments may be due to activation of autocrine FGF1-dependent mechanism (17Steinberg Z. Myers C. Heim V.M. Lathrop C.A. Rebustini I.T. Stewart J.S. Larsen M. Hoffman M.P. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), since FGF1 can activate all FGFRs with oligosaccharides shorter than 8 sugar units (32Ostrovsky O. Berman B. Gallagher J. Mulloy B. Fernig D.G. Delehedde M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2444-2453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The combined morphogenesis graph (Fig. 2C) shows that fragments greater than dp6 have a significant effect on morphogenesis, with dp10 giving the greatest increase, and fragments greater than dp12 appeared similar to heparin. Heparin Sulfation Influences BaF3 Proliferation and SMG Epithelial Morphogenesis—We used selectively desulfated heparins to broadly identify the structural characteristics of heparin required for FGF10 activity. In BaF3/FGFR2b assays, removal of 2-O- or 6-O-sulfates (De-2OS and De-6OS) from heparin (Fig. 3A) reduced proliferation by 75% compared with heparin, whereas removal of N-sulfates (De-NS), de-N-sulfated and reacetylated heparin (DeNSRAC), and completely desulfated heparin (C-DS) reduced proliferation by 92% when compared with heparin (Fig. 3A). Therefore, any reduction in sulfate content reduced FGF10-mediated proliferation of BaF3/FGFR2b cells. SMG epithelial morphogenesis was also influenced by the removal of sulfates from heparin. Epithelia cultured with FGF10 (200 ng/ml) and 0.5 μg/ml heparin underwent extensive budding but no duct elongation (Fig. 3, B and C), and the morphogenic index was similar to epithelium cultured with no heparin, whereas HS, which has a lower overall and more heterogeneous pattern of sulfation, increased duct length and end bud width, resulting in increased morphogenesis compared with heparin. Removal of any sulfates from heparin, de-N-sulfated heparin, 2-O-sulfate, or 6-O-sulfate all resulted in increased morphogenesis compared with heparin, suggesting that overall sulfation does not correlate with morphogenesis. The epithelial morphology with selective desulfation appeared more similar to HS than heparin treatment (Fig. 3, B and C). However, heparin with all O-sulfation removed appeared similar to FGF10 alone, suggesting that O-sulfation was important for FGF10-dependent end bud expansion. Sulfate Patterns Influence Epithelial Morphogenesis and FGFR1b and Fgf1 Expression—Heparin decasaccharide (dp10) libraries with defined sulfate groups have previously been shown to influence FGFR signaling (26Guimond S.E. Turnbull J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1343-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). SMG epithelia were cultured with FGF10 (200 ng/ml) and 0.5 mg/ml of the decasaccharides, and the morphogenesis was measured (Fig. 4, A and B). Decasaccharides containing three sulfate groups per disaccharide unit (IdoA2S-GlcNS6S) resulted in a budding epithelial morphology (Fig. 4A), similar to that observed with 0.5 mg/ml heparin and 200 ng/ml FGF10 (Fig. 2B). Decasaccharides with two sulfates per disaccharide unit (IdoA2S-GlcNS6OH, IdoA2OH-GlcNS6S, and IdoA2S-GlcNAc6S) all increased duct length, but IdoA2OH-GlcNS6S did not induce end bud expansion. This result is important, because it implies that specific sulfate patterns, and not just sulfate density, are important for end bud expansion. Interestingly, decasaccharides containing a 2-O-sulfate with any other sulfate group (IdoA2S-GlcNS6OH and IdoA2S-GlcNAc6S) grew more robustly than those with other decasaccharides and increased the number of buds, the width of the end buds, and the duct length (Fig. 4, A and B). Notably, epithelium treated with decasaccharides containing only 6-O-sulfate (IdoA2OH-GlcNAc6S) had longer ducts than the other decasaccharides with single sulfates/disaccharide unit and were a similar length to N- and 6-O-sulfated decasaccharide (IdoA2OH-GlcNS6S). Epithelium cultured with decasaccharides with only 2-O-sulfation caused a slight, but not significant, increase in duct length, and decasaccharides with only N-sulfation resembled those with no sulfation (Fig. 4, A and B). We hypothesized that the decasaccharides were increasing FGF10/FGFR2b signaling, so we measured expression of FGFR1b, FGFR2b, and Fgf1 (Fig. 4C), which we had previously shown were downstream of FGFR signaling (18Rebustini I.T. Patel V.N. Stewart J.S. Layvey A. Georges-Labouesse E. Miner J.H. Hoffman M.P. Dev. Biol. 2007; 308: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Gene expression was normalized to 29S and expressed as a -fold change in expression relative to the expression with IdoA2OH-GlcNAc6OH, a decasaccharide with no sulfates, which supports minimal growth and duct elongation (Fig. 4A). End bud expansion was associated with an ∼3-fold increase of FGFR1b expression, and the decasaccharides with 2 sulfates/unit (IdoA2S-GlcNS6OH and IdoA2S-GlcNAc6S) also increased Fgf1 ∼1.5-fold (Fig. 4C). Increased Fgf1 expression was similar to that previously reported, and anti-FGF1 antibodies have previously been shown to decrease FGF10-dependent morphogenesis (17Steinberg Z. Myers C. Heim V.M. Lathrop C.A. Rebustini I.T. Stewart J.S. Larsen M. Hoffman M.P. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). End bud expansion was also associated with decreased FGFR2b expression, suggesting an autocrine negative regulatory loop, similar to our previous findings (17Steinberg Z. Myers C. Heim V.M.

https://openalex.org/W1971773462,"When visual input is inconclusive, does previous experience aid the visual system in attaining an accurate perceptual interpretation? Prolonged viewing of a visually ambiguous stimulus causes perception to alternate between conflicting interpretations. When viewed intermittently, however, ambiguous stimuli tend to evoke the same percept on many consecutive presentations. This perceptual stabilization has been suggested to reflect persistence of the most recent percept throughout the blank that separates two presentations. Here we show that the memory trace that causes stabilization reflects not just the latest percept, but perception during a much longer period. That is, the choice between competing percepts at stimulus reappearance is determined by an elaborate history of prior perception. Specifically, we demonstrate a seconds-long influence of the latest percept, as well as a more persistent influence based on the relative proportion of dominance during a preceding period of at least one minute. In case short-term perceptual history and long-term perceptual history are opposed (because perception has recently switched after prolonged stabilization), the long-term influence recovers after the effect of the latest percept has worn off, indicating independence between time scales. We accommodate these results by adding two positive adaptation terms, one with a short time constant and one with a long time constant, to a standard model of perceptual switching."
https://openalex.org/W2095522096,"Background Conventional wisdom identifies biodiversity hotspots as priorities for conservation investment because they capture dense concentrations of species. However, density of species does not necessarily imply conservation ‘efficiency’. Here we explicitly consider conservation efficiency in terms of species protected per dollar invested. Methodology/Principal Findings We apply a dynamic return on investment approach to a global biome and compare it with three alternate priority setting approaches and a random allocation of funding. After twenty years of acquiring habitat, the return on investment approach protects between 32% and 69% more species compared to the other priority setting approaches. To correct for potential inefficiencies of protecting the same species multiple times we account for the complementarity of species, protecting up to three times more distinct vertebrate species than alternate approaches. Conclusions/Significance Incorporating costs in a return on investment framework expands priorities to include areas not traditionally highlighted as priorities based on conventional irreplaceability and vulnerability approaches."

Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria contain bacteriochlorophyll a, b, c, d, e, and g (2Chew A.G. Bryant D.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and oxygenic photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria, algae, and land plants produce chlorophyll a, b, c, d and 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll a 3According to the IUPAC nomenclature, chlorophyll a has a vinyl group at position 3 and an ethyl group at position 8 (see Fig. 1). Accordingly, what we call 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll a in this paper should be termed “8-deethyl-8-vinyl chlorophyll a.” However, most plant physiologists commonly call this compound “3,8-divinyl chlorophyll a” or simply “divinyl chlorophyll a.” We think this nomenclature is easier to understand. Therefore, we used the common nomenclature “3,8-divinyl chlorophyll a” instead of the IUPAC nomenclature in this paper. and b (Fig. 1) (3Tanaka R. Tanaka A. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 321-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 4Manning W.M. Strain H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1943; 151: 1-19Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Among them, the biosynthesis of chlorophyll a, b, c, d and all bacteriochlorophyll species requires the reduction of the 8-vinyl group (2Chew A.G. Bryant D.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). All of these chlorophyll molecules have a common backbone structure. Modification of the side chains on the common backbone structure gives rise to the diversity of chlorophylls (5Maresca J.A. Gomez Maqueo Chew A. Ponsati M.R. Frigaard N.U. Ormerod J.G. Bryant D.A. J.

A. 1998; 95: 12719-12723Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Among the variety of chlorophyll species, bacteriochlorophyll a and monovinyl chlorophyll a (Fig. 1) are most commonly used for the photochemistry in photosynthetic organisms. The exceptions to this are a group of marine cyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus species (7Chisholm S.W. Olson R.J. Zettler E.R. Goericke R. Waterbury J.B. Welschmeyer N.A. Nature. 1988; 334: 340-343Crossref Scopus (855) Google Scholar), and a cyanobacterial symbiont, Acaryochloris marina (8Tomo T. Okubo T. Akimoto S. Yokono M. Miyashita H. Tsuchiya T. Noguchi T. Mimuro M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7283-7288Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which use 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll a (Fig. 1) and chlorophyll d for their photochemistry, respectively. It is not clear why the majority of photosynthetic organisms prefer monovinyl chlorophylls instead of divinyl chlorophyll species. Akimoto et al. (9Akimoto S. Yokono M. Ohmae M. Yamazaki I. Nagata N. Tanaka R. Tanaka A. Mimuro M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2005; 409: 167-171Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) recently suggested that the replacement of monovinyl chlorophylls by 3,8-divinyl chlorophylls in the dvr mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana significantly changed the antenna system and thus affected energy and electron transfer. In addition, our group also observed that the dvr mutant is highly susceptible to strong illumination (10Nagata N. Tanaka R. Satoh S. Tanaka A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). There may be some (yet unknown) advantage for electron and/or energy transfer in the reduction of the 8-vinyl to an 8-ethyl group. For the synthesis of monovinyl chlorophyll, the reduction of the 8-vinyl group on the pyrrole ring B of 3,8-divinyl chlorophyllide (or possibly 3,8-divinyl protochlorophyllide) is a prerequisite. In our previous study (10Nagata N. Tanaka R. Satoh S. Tanaka A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we identified a gene encoding 8-vinyl reductase that is responsible for the synthesis of monovinyl chlorophyll from Arabidopsis, and we termed the gene DVR. Homologues of the DVR gene were found in the genomes of higher plants, green algae, and Prasinophytes. In addition, most but not all green sulfur bacteria and some purple bacteria have DVR homologues that were termed bciA (19Chew A.G. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2967-2975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there were no homologues identified in the genome of a red alga, Cyanidioschyzon merolae. Homologues were also found in five Synechococcus species but were not identified in any other cyanobacteria. Because C. merolae and the majority of cyanobacteria that lack DVR homologues synthesize monovinyl chlorophyll, it has been hypothesized that an unidentified 8-vinyl reductase is present in these organisms. To identify the second DVR gene, we first searched for genes exclusive to C. merolae and cyanobacteria that do not possess DVR homologues but synthesize monovinyl chlorophyll a. For this purpose, we developed a bioinformatics tool, correlation coefficient calculation tool (CCCT), 4The abbreviations used are: CCCTcorrelation coefficient calculation toolHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyFRHF420 reducing hydrogenaseORFopen reading frame. to select the candidates of the cyanobacterial genes encoding the hypothetical 8-vinyl reductase. We subsequently carried out a molecular genetic analysis and finally identified the gene in cyanobacteria that is involved in the 8-vinyl reductase activity. The function of the gene product and its evolutionary history are discussed. correlation coefficient calculation tool high performance liquid chromatography F420 reducing hydrogenase open reading frame. Materials and Growth Conditions—Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was grown at 30 °C in BG-11 medium (11Hihara Y. Sonoike K. Ikeuchi M. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in liquid and solid (0.5% agar) media under continuous illumination with normal light (50 μmol photons/m2s, white fluorescence lamp) or high light (1000 μmol photons/m2s). Pigment Analysis—Pigments were extracted with 80% acetone and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection (SPD-M20A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) on a reversed phase C18 column (150 × 6 mm, Shim-pack CLC-ODS, Shimadzu) using the solvent (methanol/ethyl acetate = 2:1 (v/v)) at the flow rate of 0.8 ml/min (12Giorgi L.B. Nixon P.J. Merry S.A. Joseph D.M. Durrant J.R. De Las Rivas J. Barber J. Porter G. Klug D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2093-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Spectrometric Measurements—Absorption spectra of cells were measured by using an opal diffuser at room temperatures with a Hitachi U-3310 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Electron Microscopy—Wild type and mutant Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 cells were grown under normal light conditions. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and embedded in 3% low melting agar. The agar-containing cells were initially fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Agar-embedded specimens were postfixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer and were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series. Dehydrated specimens were subsequently embedded in an Epon resin mixture (TAAB Epon 812, TAAB Laboratories Equipment Ltd., Berkshire, UK) (13Stanier G. Lester P. Alexander N.G. Lester P. Alexander N.G. Methods in Enzymology. 167. Academic Press, San Diego1988: 157-172Google Scholar). Ultra-thin sections were mounted on 200-mesh size grids. Specimens were stained for 20 min with 2% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate and briefly with a 0.2 g/liter solution of lead citrate. Specimens were viewed with a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV. Gene Cloning from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803—To inactivate the putative 8-vinyl reductase gene of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, the Slr1923 gene was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GCCCAGTGGACAGGCATTGT-3′ and 5′-ATGGGTAACGTTACCGCCTT-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega). The kanamycin resistance gene from Escherichia coli was inserted into the SmaI site that is present in the inserted DNA fragment. Transformation and Segregation Analysis of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803—Transformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was carried out according to the methods described previously (14Satoh S. Ikeuchi M. Mimuro M. Tanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4293-4297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Transformants were propagated on BG-11 agar plates containing 20 μg/ml kanamycin. For the promotion of segregation, transformants were incubated under dim light (1 μmol photons/m2s) with 5 mm glucose supplementation in agar medium. The segregation state of the transformants was analyzed by PCR. Sequence Retrieval and Blast Analysis—Sequences were obtained either from the GenBank™ data base or from Joint Genome Institute. The stand-alone BLAST program (version 2.2.10) (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60216) Google Scholar) was obtained from NCBI, and default parameters were used. Mathematica for Mac OS X, version 6.0.1 (Wolfram Research, Inc.) was used to control the BLAST program and to calculate the correlation coefficient as described under “Results.” We will freely distribute the program to calculate the correlation coefficient upon request. Phylogenetic Analysis—The deduced amino acid sequences of DVR and Slr1923 homologues were aligned using the ClustalW software (16Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55997) Google Scholar) with Gonnet residue weights. A neighbor joining tree (17Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) was constructed on the basis of the sequence alignment with the ClustalW software. Basic Characterization of 8-Vinyl Reductase in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803—Prior to the start of our bioinformatics approach to identify 8-vinyl reductase in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we examined whether this organism possesses specific activities for the reduction of the 8-vinyl group of the tetrapyrrole. Thylakoid membranes of wild type cells were purified and solubilized by Triton X-100. 3,8-Divinyl chlorophyllide a was incubated with the solubilized membranes, and the formation of monovinyl chlorophyllide a was monitored by HPLC after a 15-min incubation. When NADPH was added to the reaction mixture, the formation of monovinyl chlorophyllide a was observed. Without the addition of NADPH, only 3,8-divinyl chlorophyllide a was detected.5 This experiment provided evidence which confirmed that 8-vinyl reductase is present in this organism, and its activity is NADPH-dependent. Thus, we initiated the following bioinformatics approach to identify the gene encoding the second 8-vinyl reductase. Selection of Possible 8-Vinyl Reductase Genes from the Cyanobacterial Genome—For the following bioinformatics approach, a few assumptions were made. 1) All cyanobacteria producing monovinyl chlorophyll should have a specific enzyme(s) that reduces the 8-vinyl group of the tetrapyrrole. 2) Prochlorococcus species lack 8-vinyl reductase, because they do not produce monovinyl chlorophyll. 3) There are only two types of 8-vinyl reductase in cyanobacteria. The last assumption was made in order to make our bioinformatics approach possible. Without this assumption, the list of the candidate genes for those encoding 8-vinyl reductase would become too long for the subsequent reverse-genetics approach. We should note that 5 of 16 Synechococcus species whose genomes have been sequenced contain a DVR homologue. Therefore, it was not possible for us to accurately predict whether Synechococcus species have the second 8-vinyl reductase or not. Thus, we excluded those five species from the bioinformatics analysis. Taken together, if our assumption is correct, the second 8-vinyl reductase should exist in all cyanobacteria that produce monovinyl chlorophyll a except for the five Synechococcus species, and it should be absent from Prochlorococcus species. For the bioinformatics analysis, the cyanobacteria that were expected to have the second 8-vinyl reductase were placed into the “plus” group for bioinformatics analysis and the Prochlorococcus species were placed into the “minus” group. The second 8-vinyl reductase should be absent from this minus group. A red alga, C. merolae, was also included in the plus group, because its sequenced genome does not contain a DVR homologue. The addition of a eukaryotic organism to the analysis considerably increases the amount of information on the distribution of each gene. In general, attempts to identify orthologues by similarity searches using tools such as BLAST (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60216) Google Scholar) face a common problem in determining the threshold of similarity with which orthologues are selected. If only genes showing very high similarity to the query sequence are selected as orthologues, there is a high probability for true orthologues to go undetected within the search. On the contrary, if genes showing lower similarity to the query sequence are selected as orthologues, false genes might be identified as orthologues. To avoid this problem, CCCT ranked possible orthologues by calculating the correlation coefficient between the ability of monovinyl chlorophyll synthesis and the E value of each gene to the query sequence. Fig. 2 shows an example of CCCT analysis. If the query sequence shows high similarity (low E value) to one of the genes that is found only in the genomes of the plus group, CCCT gives higher values (correlation coefficient) closer to 1. In contrast, when another sequence shows high similarity to a gene found within the genomes of the minus group, the program generates a lower value that is closer to –1. With this strategy, both the pattern of gene distribution and the phenotype can be compared and scored. In this study, all ORFs from the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genome were used as a query sequence, and BLAST searches were performed against each genome from 32 organisms that were categorized either in the plus or minus group (see Fig. 2 for the list of organisms). For each genome, an ORF exhibiting the lowest E value to each query sequence was selected, and its value was used for the calculation of the correlation coefficient. Finally, all ORFs were ranked according to the order of higher correlation coefficient. Fig. 2, B–D, shows the E value profiles of the candidate proteins that were identified through our CCCT analysis. The highest correlation coefficient was found in Slr0335 (r = 0.998), which encodes a phycobilisome LCM core membrane linker polypeptide. The second and third highest were Slr1923 (hypothetical protein, r = 0.993) and Sll0757 (amidophosphoribosyl-transferase, r = 0.957), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, the distribution pattern of two genes, Slr1923 and Slr0335, matched our categorization pattern of the plus and minus groups. The distribution of the third gene, SLL0757, also matched our categorization pattern except for red algae “C. merolae” (Fig. 2D). Slr0335 was excluded from further analysis because the gene encodes a known component of phycobilisome. The Slr1923 gene has sequence similarity to the F420 reducing hydrogenase (FRH) β-subunit of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (18Alex L.A. Reeve J.N. Orme-Johnson W.H. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although the reaction catalyzed by FRH is not very similar to that presumed for the reaction by 8-vinyl reductase, we thought it was possible that Slr1923 was involved in the reduction of the 8-vinyl group, because an oxidoreductase family can potentially catalyze a wide range of reactions. Therefore, we decided to pursue this promising gene for further functional analysis. Disruption of the Slr1923 Gene—To examine whether the Slr1923 gene product participates in the reduction of the 8-vinyl group on pyrrole ring B, we disrupted the Slr1923 gene by homologous recombination in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (supplemental Fig. 1). Using an HPLC system incorporating a photo-diode array detector, we analyzed the pigment compositions of the slr1923 mutant and wild type cells (Fig. 3). In the mutant cells, a chromatographic peak corresponding to the monovinyl chlorophyll (8.56 min, peak 3-2) disappeared. Instead, another peak appeared at an earlier elution time (8.44 min, peak 3-1) in the mutant cells. The early peak in the mutant has the same retention time and absorption spectrum to those of 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll, which accumulate in the dvr mutant of A. thaliana (10Nagata N. Tanaka R. Satoh S. Tanaka A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this peak provided a [M + H]+ m/z value (870.5), which corresponds to the Mg2+-dechelated 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll a (3,8-divinyl pheophytin a). In contrast, the HPLC peak corresponding to monovinyl chlorophyll of wild type gave a [M + H]+ m/z value of 872.5, which represents Mg2+-dechelated monovinyl chlorophyll a (pheophytin a). It is important to note that the Mg2+ ion was removed from the chlorophyll molecules during the mass spectrometry analysis. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that Slr1923 encodes an essential component of 8-vinyl reductase, which is required for the monovinyl chlorophyll synthesis in this organism. The Slr1923 gene is located in a gene cluster consisting of Slr1923, Slr1924, and Slr1925 in this order. Slr1924 and Slr1925 encode carboxypeptidase and a protein involved in cobalamin biosynthesis, respectively. It was possible that disruption of Slr1923 affected the expression of Slr1924 and Slr1925. To examine whether possible disturbance in the expression of Slr1924 and Slr1925 had affected the synthesis of chlorophyll, we inserted the kanamycin resistance gene into Slr1924. We found that the Slr1924 disruptant did not show any observable phenotype, including accumulation of 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll (supplemental Fig. 2). These results indicate that the Slr1924 protein is not involved in the reduction of the 8-vinyl group. Furthermore, the same experiment indicates that Slr1925 is also not involved in this reaction. If the accumulation of 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll was caused by the interference of the expression of Slr1925 in the slr1923 mutant, then the disruption of the Slr1924 gene should have resulted in accumulation of 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll, but this was not the case (see supplemental Fig. 2). Collectively, we concluded that the accumulation of 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll in the slr1923 mutant was not the result of possible disturbance in Slr1924 and Slr1925 gene expression. Phenotype of the Slr1923 Knockout Mutant—Disruption of Slr1923 not only affected chlorophyll synthesis but also carotenoid synthesis. With respect to the wild type, the ratio of zeaxanthin to chlorophyll increased 2-fold; however, the β-carotene-to-chlorophyll ratio remained unchanged in the mutant cells. As mentioned under “Discussion,” it is possible that the increase in the zeaxanthin contents is induced by the light stresses. Electron microscopy showed that the average size of wild type cells was about 1.33 ± 0.04 μm (n = 4), whereas the slr1923 mutant cells was about 1.15 ± 0.07 μm(n = 4) (Fig. 4). With respect to wild type, the number of thylakoid membranes per cell was greatly reduced in the mutant cells, and they also exhibited a wider space between thylakoid membranes. These morphological changes in the mutant cells may also indicate that they are experiencing stressful conditions. Part of the stress could be that the 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll does not bind well to the proteins and is partly present in free form, which would be highly phototoxic. In our previous paper, we reported that the dvr mutant of A. thaliana, whose monovinyl chlorophyll was replaced by 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll, was completely bleached within a day under exposure to high light conditions (10Nagata N. Tanaka R. Satoh S. Tanaka A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, we intended to determine whether cyanobacteria containing 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll also exhibit a similar response to strong illumination. Wild type and mutant cells were initially cultured in liquid medium under normal light conditions (50 μmol photons/m2s) and were subsequently transferred to high light conditions (1000 μmol photons/m2s). Wild type cyanobacteria turned slightly yellow but were able to survive exposure to high light illumination (Fig. 5). In contrast, slr1923 mutant cells were completely bleached after 1 day of high light treatment (Fig. 5). These convincing results may indicate that the replacement of monovinyl chlorophyll with 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll induces a similar response through an analogous mechanism between higher plants and cyanobacteria. The growth rate of the slr1923 mutant was indistinguishable from that of the wild type cells under low light conditions (10 μmol photons/m2s), and it was slightly lower than the wild type cells under standard light conditions (40 μmol photons/m2s) (Fig. 6). Under high light conditions (150 μmol photons/m2s), the growth of slr1923 mutant was significantly retarded. These results also showed that the mutant accumulating 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll was sensitive to high light irradiation. Spectral Analysis of the Mutant—To further identify the effects of the accumulation of 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll, absorbance spectra of the mutant cells were measured (Fig. 7). The absorbance peak in the soret region was red-shifted by 6 nm in the mutant because of the accumulation of 3,8-divinyl chlorophyll. Absorption corresponding to chlorophyll (around 440 and 660 nm), carotenoids (around 490 nm), and phycobiliproteins (around 630 nm) was observed in both wild type and mutant cells. With respect to wild type, absorption corresponding to chlorophyll decreased in the mutant. However, absorption corresponding to phycobilisomes increased in the mutant. These data indicate that the ratio of phycobiliproteins to chlorophyll increased in the slr1923 mutant. Because a decrease in chlorophyll content was observed with in the dvr mutant of Arabidopsis (10Nagata N. Tanaka R. Satoh S. Tanaka A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), it is possible that the same phenomenon may have occurred in the slr1923 mutant. It should be noted that phycobilin synthesis was not inhibited in the slr1923 knock-out mutant as judged by its absorption spectrum (Fig. 5). Considering that phycobilins are synthesized by oxidative ring opening of heme, these data indicate that the common pathway of the heme and chlorophyll biosynthesis was not significantly affected in the mutant. Instead, it is likely that the chlorophyll branch of tetrapyrrole synthesis is predominantly inhibited compared with the heme branch. A possible explanation is that chlorophyll proteins are destabilized, causing the amount of free chlorophyll or chlorophyllide to rise, which in turn feed back to reduce the flux of intermediates through the pathway. Phylogenetic Analysis of 8-Vinyl Reductase—We analyzed the distribution of Slr1923 homologues in photosynthetic organisms (Fig. 8A). We could not find any Slr1923 homologues in the Synechococcus species, in which we found DVR homologues, and in Prochlorococcus species. Instead, we found Slr1923 homologues in other cyanobacteria that have been deposited in the GenBank™ data base. In addition, Slr1923 homologues were found in higher plants, green sulfur bacteria, green filamentous bacteria, and purple bacteria, and their predicted amino acid sequences are highly conserved (supplemental Fig. 3A for the alignment of the sequences). Despite this high conservation, there is no evidence showing that these Slr1923 homologues encode functional 8-vinyl reductase genes, with the exception for those belonging to the cyanobacterial clade. According to the public microarray data base in NASC, the Arabidopsis homologue of Slr1923 was predominantly expressed in the photosynthetic organs, and its expression was increased by the induction of leaf senescence in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, our phylogenetic analysis suggested that a red algal sequence belongs to the cyanobacterial clade. For comparison with the phylogenetic tree of Slr1923 homologues, we constructed a phylogenetic tree for DVR homologues. We found DVR homologues in higher plants, green algae, prasinophytes, diatoms, green sulfur bacteria, cyanobacteria (Synechococcus species), and purple bacteria (Fig. 8B). We expressed recombinant DVR proteins from Arabidopsis (10Nagata N. Tanaka R. Satoh S. Tanaka A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and Synechococcus WH81025 in E. coli and confirmed that these protein have 8-vinyl reductase activity for 3,8-divinyl chlorophyllide a. Thus, it would be reasonable to assume that all DVR homologues in the green lineage clade and the Synechococcus clade encode functional 8-vinyl reductase. In addition, Chew and Bryant (19Chew A.G. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2967-2975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) also detected the 8-vinyl reductase activity with a recombinant BciA protein from Chlorobium tepidum. Therefore, it is likely that all the proteins belonging to the green sulfur bacterial clade are genuine 8-vinyl reductase enzymes. To the best of our knowledge, there is no current evidence which shows that proteins belonging to other clades are also functional 8-vinyl reductase enzymes, even though their predicted amino acid sequences are well conserved (supplemental Fig. 3B for the alignment of the sequences). Bioinformatics Analysis—Three bioinformatics strategies may be potentially utilized to aid the identification of genes that are responsible for certain cellular functions. The first strategy is based upon a motif search. Proteins that participate in specific cellular processes often have distinctive motifs, such as the Rieske center binding motif. This strategy has been proven successful when searching within an organism containing only a limited number of proteins possessing"

Farnesylated proteins include Ras proteins, Rheb proteins, nuclear lamins, and Hdj2. Protein geranylgeranylation involves the addition of a longer isoprenoid, C20 geranylgeranyl group. Two different types of geranylgeranylation have been reported. Rho family proteins such as RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac as well as the γ-subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins are geranylgeranylated at a cysteine within the CAAL motif (similar to the CAAX motif, but the C-terminal amino acid is leucine or phenylalanine) at their C termini. Rab proteins involved in protein transport across the secretory and endocytosis pathways are also geranylgeranylated. These proteins usually end with CC (two cysteines) or CXC at the C termini, and both cysteines are geranylgeranylated. Recent studies highlight the physiological significance of protein geranylgeranylation.

Recent studies also showed that a number of geranylgeranylated proteins play important roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. In addition to RhoA and Cdc42 proteins, RalA protein was recently found to be activated downstream of Ras in most pancreatic cancer cells harboring oncogenic K-ras mutation (7Lim K.H. Baines A.T.

However, development of non-peptidomimetic inhibitors lagged behind. Recently, the first non-peptidomimetic compound, GGTI-DU40, was reported (25Peterson Y.K. Kelly P. Weinbaum C.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12445-12450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As for RabGGTase inhibitors, no effective inhibitors have been identified so far (26El Oualid F. Cohen L.H. van der Marel G.A. Overhand M. Curr. Med.

Thus, further development of compounds that inhibit GGTase-I or RabGGTase is of importance, as they provide novel reagents to deepen our understanding of protein geranylgeranylation. In this study, we first report the identification and characterization of novel inhibitors of GGTase-I that were identified from a chemical compound library that we constructed through diversity-oriented synthesis using allenoic acid-derived starting materials (28Castellano S. Fiji H.D. Kinderman S.S. Watanabe M. Leon P. Tamanoi F. Kwon O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5843-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A specific modification that improves their cellular activity has been identified. Second, we report the identification and characterization of novel compounds with preferential inhibition of RabGGTase. These compounds have a scaffold that is shared with GGTI but possess an extra structural feature. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT), 2% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin stock solutions (Invitrogen). K562 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. PANC-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. MCF-7 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. Materials—[3H]Farnesyl diphosphate (21.5 Ci/mmol) and [3H]geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) (23.0 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. BMS-225975 was kindly provided by Dr. Veeraswamy Manne (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.). GGTI-298 was purchased from Calbiochem. The prenyltransferases used are recombinant enzymes. GGTase-I, farnesyltransferase (FTase), RabGGTase, REP-1, and Rab7 were purchased from Jena Bioscience (Jena, Germany). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The allenoate-derived compound library, including P3-E5 and P5-H6, were synthesized as described (28Castellano S. Fiji H.D. Kinderman S.S. Watanabe M. Leon P. Tamanoi F. Kwon O. J. Am. Chem.

Detailed methods for the synthesis of P63-F10, P63-C7, P63-E11, P62-A5, P62-C11, P62-E4, and modified P5-H6 compounds (P61-A2, P61-A5, P61-A6, P61-A7 and P61-B4) will be described elsewhere. 3H. D. G. Fiji, M. Watanabe, L. Chan, F. Tamanoi, and O. Kwon, manuscript in preparation. In Vitro Enzyme Assays—GGTase-I and FTase activities were determined by following the incorporation of radiolabeled isoprenoid [3H]geranylgeranyl or [3H]farnesyl into substrate proteins. FTase or GGTase-I (50 nm) was used to initiate reactions containing 0.4 μm [3H]farnesyl diphosphate or 0.5 μm [3H]GGPP and 2 μm maltose-binding protein-tagged substrates (K-Ras4B for FTase and RhoA for GGTase-I) in 20 μlof buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 μm ZnCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Inhibitors were added at the indicated concentrations. The final Me2SO concentration was 2.5% for all samples. Reactions were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was spotted onto a filter paper and treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, followed by ethanol and acetone washing. The filter was counted using a scintillation counter. Kinetic assays in which the GGPP concentration was varied employed fixed concentrations of GGTase-I and RhoA, and reactions were carried out for 5 min. Similarly, fixed concentrations of GGTase-I and GGPP were used when the amount of RhoA was varied. For RabGGTase assays, the reaction contained the following components in 20 μl: 0.625 μlof[3H]GGPP (0.7 μm), 25 nm RabGGTase, 0.6 μm REP-1, 0.6 μm purified Rab7 or Ypt1 protein, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.3% CHAPS. Reactions were carried out for 20 min at 37 °C, and the products were analyzed as described above for the GGTase-I reaction. Graphing and Michaelis-Menten analysis were performed using Prism Version 5 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Inhibition of Geranylgeranylation in Cells—Inhibition of GGTase-I-catalyzed protein geranylgeranylation was assessed by examining the accumulation of unprenylated Rap1. To measure the level of unprenylated Rap1, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% (v/v) FBS overnight, and then Me2SO or appropriate inhibitors were added. Incubation was continued for 48 h. The cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Whole cell lysates of NIH3T3 cells were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with antibody against the unprenylated form of Rap1 (goat, catalog no. sc-1482, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), total Rap1 (catalog no. sc-65, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or actin (catalog no. A4700, Sigma). Actin was used as a loading control. Inhibition of Rab geranylgeranylation in cells (supplemental Fig. S2) was examined as described previously (29Sanford J.C. Foster L. Kapadia Z. Wessling-Resnick M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell lysates were subjected to 4 m urea and 15% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with antibody against Rab5b (catalog no. sc-598, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or actin. Subcellular fractionations (supplemental Fig. S3) were performed as described by Gomes et al. (30Gomes A.Q. Ali B.R. Ramalho J.S. Godfrey R.F. Barral D.C. Hume A.N. Seabra M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1882-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with P49-F6 for 48 h. After osmotic lysis, cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant from the ultracentrifugation was collected as a soluble fraction. The pellet was collected as a membrane fraction. These fractions were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by immunoblotting with antibody against Rab5b. RhoGDI (catalog no. sc-360, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and Na+/K+-ATPase (catalog no. A276, Sigma) were used as markers for soluble and membrane fractions, respectively. Cell Viability and Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell viability was determined using the CCK-8 cell counting kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Kumamoto, Japan) as described previously (31Lu J. Liong M. Zink J.I. Tamanoi F. Small. 2007; 3: 1341-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 103) were plated onto 96-well plates and treated with the appropriate inhibitor as indicated in the figure legends. Cell viability was calculated relative to the Me2SO control. The cell cycle profile was analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (32Kato-Stankiewicz J. Hakimi I. Zhi G. Zhang J. Serebriiskii I. Guo L. Edamatsu H. Koide H. Menon S. Eckl R. Sakamuri S. Lu Y. Chen Q.Z. Agarwal S. Baumbach W.R. Golemis E.A. Tamanoi F. Khazak V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14398-14403Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Transcriptional Reporter Assays—For the p21CIP1/WAF1 promoter-luciferase assay, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with p21CIP1/WAF1 promoter-luciferase or vector plasmids (both plasmids were provided by Dr. Genhong Cheng) (33Guo W. Baluda M.A. Park N.H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with GGTI compounds. A Promega luciferase assay kit was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of the difference was determined using Student's unpaired t test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Allenoic Acid-based Chemical Compound Library and Identification of GGTase-I Inhibitors—Previously, we reported the construction of a library of allenoate-derived compounds and the identification of novel GGTI compounds (28Castellano S. Fiji H.D. Kinderman S.S. Watanabe M. Leon P. Tamanoi F. Kwon O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5843-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The library construction involved the use of allenoates as multireactive core molecules. Using a second set of building blocks (imines, aldehydes, and maleimides) that react with allenoates under similar reaction conditions (phosphine catalysis), we produced diverse compounds, including dihydropyrroles (34Zhu X. Henry C.E. Kwon O. Tetrahedron. 2005; 61: 6276-6282Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar), tetrahydropyridines (35Zhu X. Lan J. Kwon O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 4716-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), bicyclic succinimides, 4S. Castellano, H. D. G. Fiji, and O. Kwon, unpublished data. dioxanylidenes (36Zhu X. Henry C.E. Wang J. Dudding T. Kwon O. Org. Lett. 2005; 7: 1387-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and α-pyrones (37Zhu X. Schaffner A. Li R.C. Kwon O. Org. Lett. 2005; 7: 2977-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The identification of GGTI compounds was carried out first by screening a 171-compound pilot library using an in vitro assay with RhoA protein as a substrate. Scaffolds that initially showed activity were optimized by solid-phase split-and-pool combinatorial synthesis. This enabled us to identify two types of novel compounds: one group containing a tetrahydropyridine ring as its core scaffold and the other group having a dihydropyrrole ring as its core scaffold. Fig. 1 shows the structures and potencies of four representative compounds from each group, together with a general structure of each group. Two compounds with the highest potency in each group, P3-E5 and P5-H6, were further characterized. As described, P3-E5 and P5-H6 inhibit GGTase-I with IC50 values of 313 and 466 nm, respectively (Fig. 1). The specificity of GGTase-I inhibition by P3-E5 and P5-H6 was examined by assaying their ability to inhibit two closely related enzymes, FTase and RabGGTase. No significant inhibition of FTase activity by these compounds was observed even when the concentration was increased to 50,000 nm (Fig. 2). Similarly, P3-E5 showed little inhibition of RabGGTase even at 50,000 nm. P5-H6 showed little inhibition of RabGGTase up to 10,000 nm. GGTIs Compete with the Substrate Protein—Michaelis-Menten analysis of the inhibition of GGTase-I is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3A shows the data derived from the results obtained using varying concentrations of GGPP, whereas Fig. 3B shows data derived from the results obtained using varying concentrations of the substrate protein RhoA. These results revealed that P3-E5 and P5-H6 are competitive inhibitors with respect to the substrate protein and uncompetitive inhibitors with respect to GGPP. P3-E5 and P5-H6 compete for binding of the protein substrate but not the isoprenoid substrate of GGTase-I. Ki values of 187 ± 13 and 408 ± 32 nm were calculated for P3-E5 and P5-H6, respectively. Improvement of the Cellular Activity of GGTI by Modification of P5-H6—We found that replacing a carboxyl group of the dihydropyrrole ring of P5-H6 significantly improved its cellular activity. This is shown in Fig. 4A; we synthesized a series of compounds with different moieties replacing the carboxyl group. The potency of these compounds to inhibit proliferation of K562 leukemic cells was examined, and their IC50 values are shown. The original P5-H6 compound containing a carboxylic acid moiety exhibited inhibition of proliferation of K562 cells with an IC50 value of 20 μm. Converting the free acid to an ethyl ester did not improve its cellular potency. However, amidation of this moiety led to improvement in its potency. Moreover, coupling of P5-H6 with an l-phenylalanine group resulted in significant improvement of cellular potency. Two compounds, P61-A6 and P61-B6, showed good potency with IC50 values of 2.2 and 5.0 μm in inhibiting proliferation of K562 cells, respectively. Comparison of the inhibitory activity of P5-H6 and P61-A6 in the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 and Jurkat cells is shown in Fig. 4B. The improved potency of these compounds to inhibit cell proliferation correlates with their increased ability to inhibit protein geranylgeranylation inside the cell. Results on this point using P5-H6 and P61-A6 are shown in Fig. 4C. In this experiment, inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation was evaluated using an antibody that specifically detects unprenylated Rap1. Treatment with P5-H6 or P61-A6 led to the appearance of the unprocessed Rap1 band in a dose-dependent manner. Note that the appearance of the Rap1 band was observed at 2.5 μm with P61-A6, whereas it was not seen with P5-H6, reflecting a significant improvement in the potency of P61-A6 to inhibit protein geranylgeranylation. In contrast to its effects on GGTase-I, P61-A6 did not inhibit protein farnesylation. This was examined using the farnesylated protein H-Ras. Although FTase inhibitor (BMS-225975) slowed the mobility of H-Ras protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, no such mobility shift was observed with P61-A6 or another GGTI compound, GGTI-298. Similarly, P61-A6 did not inhibit geranylgeranylation of Rab5b, as a slow migrating band representing that of unmodified Rab5b was detected only after treatment with RabGGTase inhibitors (P49-F6; see below) and not with P61-A6 (Fig. 4E). Although P61-A6 exhibited improved ability to inhibit geranylgeranylation in cells, its ability to inhibit the GGTase-I enzyme was less than that of P5-H6, as the IC50 value for enzyme inhibition was 1 μm. No significant inhibition of FTase or RabGGTase activity by the P61-A6 compound was observed even when the concentration was increased to 100,000 nm (data not shown). GGTI Compounds Inhibit Proliferation of Various Human Cancer Cell Lines and Cause G1 Cell Cycle Arrest—As shown in supplemental Table S1, significant inhibition of proliferation of a variety of human cancer cell lines was observed. Thus, these GGTI compounds inhibit a broad range of human cancer cell lines. The inhibition of proliferation by GGTI appears to be due to the inhibition of cell cycle progression. As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 with P61-A6 or P61-B6 caused dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation. This was associated with a significant dose-dependent enrichment of G1 phase cells, whereas the percentage of S phase cells decreased (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S1). Similar G1 enrichment was observed with a leukemic cell line, Jurkat; two pancreatic cancer cell lines, PANC-1 and MiaPaCa2; and another breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 (supplemental Table S2). One of the proposed mechanisms of GGTI effects on cell cycle progression is the inhibition of RhoA, which negatively regulates expression of the Cdk inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1. To investigate whether our GGTI compound induces p21CIP1/WAF1 expression, luciferase expression using the p21CIP1/WAF1 promoter (33Guo W. Baluda M.A. Park N.H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was measured. Transient expression systems with NIH3T3 cells were used to examine the ability of P61-A6 to induce p21CIP1/WAF1-luciferase expression. P61-A6 induced significant (4-fold) induction of luciferase activity versus Me2SO in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Identification of Dual Specificity Inhibitors of GGTase-I and RabGGTase—The characterization of our library of allenoate-derived compounds yielded novel compounds that have the ability to inhibit RabGGTase. The identification of these novel compounds was initially prompted by the observation that P5-H6 exhibited a slight inhibition of RabGGTase at concentrations >10,000 nm (Fig. 2B). This suggested to us that these GGTIs have the ability to act weakly on RabGGTase. If this were the case, we speculated that it might be possible to identify a subset of GGTI compounds that inhibit RabGGTase. With this reasoning, we examined our library of 3601 compounds related to P5-H6, listed all the compounds that exhibited GGTase-I inhibition, and screened them to see whether we could identify compounds that also inhibited RabGGTase. The assay was carried out using RabGGTase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Of 428 compounds that exhibited GGTase-I inhibition (>50% inhibition at 50 μm), we found that 60 compounds also exhibited the ability to inhibit RabGGTase (>50% inhibition at 25 μm). Fig. 6 shows the four most potent compounds (P8-G7, P8-H6, P8-H7, and P49-F5) that exhibited inhibition of both GGTase-I and RabGGTase in the 2–9 μm range. On the other hand, these compounds did not inhibit FTase even at >100 μm (Fig. 6, B and C). Examination of their structures led us to notice a feature that is common to these dual specificity compounds; they all have a characteristic sixatom aliphatic tail attached to the penta-substituted pyrrolidine core via thioether linkage (putative RabGGTase inhibitor (RabGGTI) feature). Identification of RabGGTIs—The finding of the putative RabGGTI feature is important, as this feature may be used to predict RabGGTI activity. We first examined our 3601-compound library and identified 524 compounds that have this feature. We then screened these compounds by carrying out RabGGTase assay. This resulted in the identification of 23 compounds that exhibited preferential inhibition of RabGGTase (<50% inhibition of GGTase-I at 50 μm and >50% inhibition of RabGGTase at 25 μm)."
https://openalex.org/W2050709903,"In response to viral infection, the expression of numerous host genes, including predominantly a number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, is usually up-regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels. It was noted that in cells infected with coronavirus, transcription and translation of some of these genes were differentially induced. Drastic induction of their expression at the transcriptional level was observed in cells infected with coronavirus. However, induction of the same genes at the translational level was usually found to be minimal to moderate. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using SARS-CoV proteins as baits, revealing that a subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), eIF3f, may interact with the N-terminal region of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. Meanwhile, parallel experiments confirmed that eIF3f could also interact with the S protein of another coronavirus, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). These interactions led to the inhibition of translation of a reporter gene in both in vitro expression system and intact cells. Interestingly, IBV-infected cells stably expressing a Flag-tagged eIF3f showed much higher translation of IL-6 and IL-8, suggesting that the interaction between coronavirus S protein and eIF3f plays a functional role in controlling the expression of host genes, especially genes that are induced during coronavirus infection cycles. This study reveals a novel mechanism exploited by coronavirus to regulate viral pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2074047315,"There is an increasing body of evidence which suggests that IL-4 plays a role in the pathogenesis of TB, but a general consensus on its role remains elusive. We have previously published data from a cohort of Ethiopian TB patients, their contacts, and community controls suggesting that enhanced IL-4 production is associated with infection with M. tuberculosis, rather than overt disease and that long-term protection in infected community controls is associated with co-production of the IL-4 antagonist IL-4d2, alongside elevated IL-4. Here, for the first time, we compare data on expression of IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-4delta2 over time in TB patients and their household contacts. During the follow-up period, the TB patients completed therapy and ceased to display TB-like symptoms. This correlated with a decrease in the relative amount of IL-4 expressed. Over the same period, the clinical status of some of their contacts also changed, with a number developing TB-like symptoms or clinically apparent TB. IL-4 expression was disproportionately increased in this group. The findings support the hypothesis that elevated IL-4 production is generally associated with infection, but that TB disease is associated with a relatively increased expression of IL-4 compared to IFN-gamma and IL-4delta2. However, the data also suggest that there are no clear-cut differences between groups: the immune response over time appears to include changes in the expression of IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-4delta2, and it is the relative, not absolute levels of cytokine expression that are characteristic of clinical status."
https://openalex.org/W1995119157,"HIV protease inhibitors (HIV-PIs) are key components of highly active antiretroviral therapy, but they have been associated with adverse side effects, including partial lipodystrophy and metabolic syndrome. We recently demonstrated that a commonly used HIV-PI, lopinavir, inhibits ZMPSTE24, thereby blocking lamin A biogenesis and leading to an accumulation of prelamin A. ZMPSTE24 deficiency in humans causes an accumulation of prelamin A and leads to lipodystrophy and other disease phenotypes. Thus, an accumulation of prelamin A in the setting of HIV-PIs represents a plausible mechanism for some drug side effects. Here we show, with metabolic labeling studies, that lopinavir leads to the accumulation of the <i>farnesylated</i> form of prelamin A. We also tested whether a new and chemically distinct HIV-PI, darunavir, inhibits ZMPSTE24. We found that darunavir does not inhibit the biochemical activity of ZMPSTE24, nor does it lead to an accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A in cells. This property of darunavir is potentially attractive. However, all HIV-PIs, including darunavir, are generally administered with ritonavir, an HIV-PI that is used to block the metabolism of other HIV-PIs. Ritonavir, like lopinavir, inhibits ZMPSTE24 and leads to an accumulation of prelamin A."
https://openalex.org/W2086953820,"Although murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with Bax or Bak deleted displayed no defect in apoptosis signaling, MEFs with Bax and Bak double knock-out (DKO) showed dramatic resistance to diverse apoptotic stimuli, suggesting that Bax and Bak are redundant but essential regulators for apoptosis signaling. Chelerythrine has recently been identified as a Bcl-xL inhibitor that is capable of triggering apoptosis via direct action on mitochondria. Here we report that in contrast to classic apoptotic stimuli, chelerythrine is fully competent in inducing apoptosis in the DKO MEFs. Wild-type and DKO MEFs are equally sensitive to chelerythrine-induced morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis phenotype. Interestingly, chelerythrine-mediated release of cytochrome c is rapid and precedes Bax translocation and integration. Although the BH3 peptide of Bim is totally inactive in releasing cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria of DKO MEFs, chelerythrine maintains its potency and efficacy in inducing direct release of cytochrome c from these mitochondria. Furthermore, chelerythrine-mediated mitochondrial swelling and loss in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) are inhibited by cyclosporine A, suggesting that mitochondrial permeability transition pore is involved in chelerythrine-induced apoptosis. Although certain apoptotic stimuli have been shown to elicit cytotoxic effect in the DKO MEFs through alternate death mechanisms, chelerythrine does not appear to engage necrotic or autophagic death mechanism to trigger cell death in the DKO MEFs. These results, thus, argue for the existence of an alternative Bax/Bak-independent apoptotic mechanism that involves cyclosporine A-sensitive mitochondrial membrane permeability.

Mitochondria are the major organelles involved in the signal transduction and biochemical execution of apoptosis (1Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Proteins of the Bcl-2 family are the central transducers of survival and apoptotic signals (2Chan S.L. Yu V.C. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2004; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). They act at mitochondria by regulating the permeability and integrity of the mitochondrial outer membranes, thereby controlling the release of apoptogenic factors. The Bcl-2 family consists of three major subfamilies of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic molecules. Members of the BH3-only subfamily (Bim, Bad, Bid, Bik, Noxa, Puma, and Hrk) serve as sentinels for the initiation of apoptosis by modulating the function of members of the other two multidomain pro-survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and A1/Bfl-1) or pro-apoptotic (Bax and Bak) subfamilies (3Strasser A.

A widely acknowledged paradigm of apoptotic signaling cascades suggests that apoptotic insults unleash one or more of the distinct BH3-only molecules and induce their translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane (2Chan S.L. Yu V.C. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2004; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Bouillet P. Strasser A. J.

In mitochondria these proteins are thought to bind preferentially to the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (8Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J.

The ratio between the levels of multidomain pro-and anti-apoptotic members may, thus, play an important role in setting the rheostat for death responses to apoptotic insults (4Danial N.N.

Some of the BH3-only molecules such as Bid and certain splicing isoforms of Bim are thought to have an additional role in promoting activation of the multidomain pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bax and Bak (10Letai A.

Despite the profound apoptotic defects, the ability of some bax and bak double-knock-out mice to survive into adulthood suggest the existence of other forms of cell death mechanism for directing proper development and maintaining tissue homeostasis by eliminating excess or damaged cells (14Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A. Ulrich E. Waymire K.G. Mahar P. Frauwirth K. Chen Y. Wei M. Eng V.M. Adelman D.M. Simon M.C. Ma A. Golden J.A. Evan G. Korsmeyer S.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several recent reports have shown that certain chemical apoptotic stimuli are capable of engaging in alternative forms of cell death in the absence of Bax and Bak. For example, DNA alkylating agents appeared to induce a mix of both apoptotic and necrotic cell death in MEFs, whereas they induced mainly necrotic death in MEFs lacking both Bax and Bak (15Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although etoposide and staurosporine predominantly induce apoptosis in MEFs, they activate a caspase-independent cell death mechanism largely dependent on autophagy in the DKO MEFs (16Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Therefore, the DKO MEFs could serve as a valuable tool in delineating multiple cell death mechanisms that can be engaged by cytotoxic agents which may otherwise escape detection in cells with intact apoptotic machinery. Chelerythrine, a benzophenanthridine alkaloid, is known to trigger apoptosis in a variety of tumor cells (17Malikova J. Zdarilova A. Hlobilkova A. Ulrichova J. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 2006; 22: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recently, chelerythrine was identified by us as an inhibitory molecule that can block the heterodimerization of the Bcl-xL and Bak BH3 peptide in a high-throughput screen of 107,423 extracts derived from natural products (18Chan S.L. Lee M.C. Tan K.O. Yang L.K. Lee A.S. Flotow H. Fu N.Y. Butler M.S. Soejarto D.D. Buss A.D. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20453-20456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although etoposide, staurosporine, and chelerythrine effectively triggered cytochrome c (cyt c) release from mitochondria in intact cells, only chelerythrine was able to induce cyt c release from isolated mitochondria (18Chan S.L. Lee M.C. Tan K.O. Yang L.K. Lee A.S. Flotow H. Fu N.Y. Butler M.S. Soejarto D.D. Buss A.D. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20453-20456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), suggesting that chelerythrine acts directly on mitochondria. In this study we compared the cytotoxic activity of chelerythrine in the wild-type (WT) and DKO MEFs in an attempt to further delineate the mechanism by which chelerythrine mediates its cytotoxic effect in mammalian cells. Interestingly, chelerythrine is cytotoxic to both cell types. Surprisingly, the morphological and biochemical features associated with chelerythrine-induced cytotoxicity in DKO MEFs are indistinguishable from those observed in the WT MEFs. These are consistent with apoptotic rather than the autophagic or necrotic phenotypes associated with certain classic cytotoxic stimuli in the DKO MEFs. Furthermore, although chelerythrine and the Bim BH3 peptide are effective in triggering cyt c release from mitochondria isolated from WT MEFs, only chelerythrine remains active in mediating this effect on mitochondria isolated from the DKO MEFs. Chelerythrine induces mitochondrial swelling and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and these effects are inhibited by cyclosporine A (CsA), suggesting the involvement of CsA-sensitive mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) components in both cell types. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that chelerythrine induces apoptosis in MEFs through a Bax- and Bak-independent mitochondrial mechanism that is distinct from the previously defined apoptosis gateway. Reagents and Cell Lines—SV40 T antigen-transformed WT and DKO MEFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 μg of streptomycin/ml and 100 IU of penicillin/ml, Invitrogen). Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was used for transfections according to the user's manual. The caspase inhibitors N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(O-Me) fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) and N-(2-quinolyl)valyl-aspartyl-(2,6-difluorophenoxy)-methyl Ketone (Q-VD-OPH) were from Calbiochem. Staurosporine, etoposide, chelerythrine, camptothecin, 3-methyladenine (3MA), and CsA were from Sigma. Anti-cyt c antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Anti-Myc antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody against high mobility group B1 protein (HMG-B1) was from Abcam. Antibodies against actin and HSP60 were from Sigma. Cyt c Release and Bax Translocation in Intact Cells—Cells were harvested and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To separate the cytosolic fraction from other cellular components, cells were lysed for 5 min on ice in a solution consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 200 μg/ml digitonin and protease inhibitors mixture as described (19Wilson-Annan J.

The supernatant (cytosol) was carefully removed, and the pellet containing the mitochondria was solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 10% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3)) containing the Complete protease inhibitors mixture. Protein content was determined by the Bradford reaction (Bio-Rad), and equivalent amount from each fraction were used for detection of cyt c release and Bax translocation using immunoblotting. Analysis of Isolated Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated from MEFs as previously described (20Tan K.O. Fu N.Y. Sukumaran S.K. Chan S.L. Kang J.H. Poon K.L. Chen B.S. Yu V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14623-14628Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For in vitro cyt c release assays, cells were suspended in isolation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)) and disrupted by 20 expulsions through a 27-gauge needle. Disrupted cells were spun at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and nucleus. The supernatants were centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min to pellet the heavy membrane fraction containing the mitochondria. The mitochondria-containing pellets were resuspended in assay buffer (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm sodium succinate, 25 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)) at 0.5 mg/ml. Equal amounts of mitochondria were treated with the indicated compounds for 15 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation (20Tan K.O. Fu N.Y. Sukumaran S.K. Chan S.L. Kang J.H. Poon K.L.

Cyt c released into the supernatant was subjected to fractionation on 13.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis. For light-scattering studies, mitochondrial isolated as described above were suspended in assay buffer (215 mm mannitol, 71 nm sucrose, 10 mm succinate, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) (21Galindo M.F.

Changes in absorbance at 540 nm (A540), indicating mitochondrial swelling as a consequence of mPTP opening, were measured after the addition of the indicated compounds using a microplate reader (Tecan). For dye retention assays, the mitochondrial suspension was incubated with 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′ tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1 100 ng/ml) for 10 min, then washed and resuspended in PBS; 5 min after the addition of indicated compounds, the level of JC-1 red fluorescence (FL2) retained by mitochondria was determined by flow cytometry (22Tzung S.P.

Assessment of Cell Viability, Cell Proliferation, and Caspase 3/7 Activity—Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates. After 48 h they were treated with the indicated concentrations of compounds. Cell death was assessed using WST assay according to the supplier's protocols (Roche Applied Science). For the cell proliferation assay, cells were seeded onto 6-well dishes. After 2 h they were treated with the indicated compounds in the presence and absence of 3MA (10 mm). The cells were then recovered and re-cultured in standard medium onto 96-well plates. Viable cell numbers were measured on the indicated days by WST assay. Caspase 3/7 activity was measured using a Caspase-Glo 3/7 kit from Promega. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Measurement—Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of compounds for 16 h. After such treatment, cells were washed in PBS and loaded with 1 μm 5-(and 6-)chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester dye (CM-H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C as described (23Kroll S.L. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C167-C174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CM-H2DCFDA buffer was then removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS before being analyzed by microplate reader (Tecan). Measurement was taken at an excitation wavelength of 500 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Emission from cells samples that were not loaded with CM-H2DCFDA was the same as for those with PBS. Fluorescence Microscope Analysis—Nuclear DNA fragmentation was assessed by nuclear morphology after Hoechst 33342 staining. Cells were stained with 1 μm Hoechst 33342 for 5 min at room temperature. In another set of experiment designed for detecting early phase of apoptosis, cells were stained with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide by following the manufacturer's instructions (ApoAlert™ Annexin V Apoptosis kit, Clontech). Apoptotic cells were photographed using Zeiss epifluorescence microscope with an attached Nikon Coolpix digital camera. Flow Cytometry—For the detection of sub-G1 DNA, cells were washed once, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, and fixed in a 50-fold excess of ice-cold 70% ethanol. Cells were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed, stained with 50 mg/ml of propidium iodide for 30 min at room temperature, and analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Mitochondrial membrane potential change (ΔΨm) as measured by JC-1 and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester staining was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). The exclusion assay for nonviable cells was performed by staining with 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD) followed by flow cytometry (BD Pharmingen). A minimum of 10,000 cells per sample were analyzed. The results presented are representative of at least three experiments. Chelerythrine Triggers Caspase-dependent Cytotoxicity in the Absence of Bax and Bak—In agreement with the published literature, DKO MEFs were found to be resistant to a variety of apoptotic stimuli including etoposide, staurosporine, camptothecin, cisplatin, methotrexate, and UV irradiation (Fig. 1, A, panel c and d, and B; data not shown). Surprisingly, in response to treatment with chelerythrine, both WT and DKO MEFs underwent similar morphological and biochemical changes that are hallmarks of apoptosis. The chelerythrine-treated MEFs displayed nuclear condensation (Fig. 1A, panels e and f) and the appearance of sub-G1 DNA (Fig. 1B). The appearance of sub-G1 DNA was seen in DKO MEFs treated with chelerythrine, but not etoposide, staurosporine, or camptothecin even though these compounds were fully effective in inducing sub-G1 DNA appearance in the WT MEFs (Fig. 1B; data not shown). Progressive stages of apoptosis could easily be detected in the chelerythrine-treated MEFs. At 5 μm, chelerythrine induced the appearance of annexin V-positive cells without an increase in propidium iodine staining at 16 h (Fig. 1C, panel b), indicative of early stage apoptosis. Cells exposed to 5 μm chelerythrine for prolonged period (Fig. 1C, panels g and h) or treated with higher concentrations of chelerythrine (Fig. 1C, panel c and d) became both annexin V- and propidium iodide-positive, presumably because of an increase in permeability of plasma membrane during the late stage of apoptosis. Moreover, chelerythrine was able to induce comparable caspase 3/7 activation in both WT and DKO MEFs (Fig. 1D). In contrast, etoposide, staurosporine, and UV irradiation were able to activate caspases 3/7 only in the WT MEFs (Fig. 1D). The appearance of sub-G1 DNA in DKO MEFs upon chelerythrine treatment was clearly caspase-dependent, as the effect was abolished by pretreatment with caspase inhibitor (zVAD-fmk) (Fig. 1E, upper panel) or overexpression of hXIAP (human X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) (Fig. 1E, lower panel), a protein that is known to sequester and inhibit activated caspases (24Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Chelerythrine failed to induce caspase-8 activation in both WT and DKO MEFs (data not shown), suggesting that the cytotoxic effect of chelerythrine in MEFs is not attributable to the extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway. Chelerythrine Remains Fully Active in Inducing Loss of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Cyt c Release in the Absence of Bax and Bak—Bax and Bak are thought to be the gateway to regulate the release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria. Because chelerythrine appears to induce apoptosis in cells that are deficient in these two proteins, we next evaluated mitochondrial apoptosis signaling in response to chelerythrine with the fluorescent dye JC-1 that allows the detection of loss of ΔΨm (mitochondrial depolarization). Treatment of WT and DKO MEFs with chelerythrine induced a substantial decrease in ΔΨm (Fig. 2A; supplemental Fig S1A, left panel). In contrast, etoposide (Fig. 2B; supplemental Fig S1A, right panel), staurosporine (Fig. 2C), camptothecin (Fig. 2D), and UV irradiation (data not shown) were ineffective in inducing loss of ΔΨm in the absence of Bax and Bak. The loss of ΔΨm induced by chelerythrine (Fig. 2E) but not by etoposide (supplemental Fig. S1B) in DKO MEFs was further confirmed using another fluorescent cationic dye, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester. Consistent with the notion that the efficacy of chelerythrine in engaging mitochondrial apoptosis signaling is not affected by the absence of Bax and Bak, the kinetics and efficacy of cyt c release from mitochondria to cytosol triggered by chelerythrine in both WT and DKO MEFs were similar (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, chelerythrine appeared to cause rapid release of cyt c (Fig. 3A, right panel). Because translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria and subsequent integration into outer mitochondrial membrane are thought to be the key signaling events preceding cyt c release upon apoptosis induction (20Tan K.O. Fu N.Y. Sukumaran S.K. Chan S.L. Kang J.H. Poon K.L. Chen B.S. Yu V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14623-14628Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we next compared the kinetics of these two events upon treatment with chelerythrine in WT and DKO MEFs. Surprisingly, chelerythrine-mediated Bax translocation and integration in the WT MEFs occurred at much slower kinetics than the cyt c release (Fig. 3B, left panel). In the DKO MEFs, despite the absence of Bax and Bak, the rapid kinetics of cyt c release was unaltered in response to chelerythrine (Fig. 3B, right panel). In contrast, staurosporine-induced Bax activation in WT MEFs coincided with cyt c release (supplemental Fig. S2A). DKO MEFs were significantly resistant to staurosporine-induced cyt c release (supplemental Fig. S2B), confirming the critical role of the Bax/Bak gateway in mediating staurosporine-induced apoptosis. BH3-only molecules are thought to integrate and relay apoptosis signals to mitochondria. Polypeptides consisting of amino acids representing the sequence of the BH3 domains are sufficient to trigger the direct release of cyt c from isolated mitochondria (10Letai A. Bassik M.C.

Certain chemical inhibitors of pro-survival members of Bcl-2 family including chelerythrine are thought to act as mimetic of the BH3-only molecules (18Chan S.L. Lee M.C. Tan K.O. Yang L.K. Lee A.S.

https://openalex.org/W2126979846,"Pitch patterns, such as melodies, consist of two levels of structure: a global level, comprising the pattern of ups and downs, or contour; and a local level, comprising the precise intervals that make up this contour. An influential neuropsychological model suggests that these two levels of processing are hierarchically linked, with processing of the global structure occurring within the right hemisphere in advance of local processing within the left. However, the predictions of this model and its anatomical basis have not been tested in neurologically normal individuals. The present study used fMRI and required participants to listen to consecutive pitch sequences while performing a same/different one-back task. Sequences, when different, either preserved (local) or violated (global) the contour of the sequence preceding them. When the activations for the local and global conditions were contrasted directly, additional activation was seen for local processing in right planum temporale and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). The presence of additional activation for local over global processing supports the hierarchical view that the global structure of a pitch sequence acts as a ""framework"" on which the local detail is subsequently hung. However, the lateralisation of activation seen in the present study, with global processing occurring in left pSTS and local processing occurring bilaterally, differed from that predicted by the neuroanatomical model. A re-examination of the individual lesion data on which the neuroanatomical model is based revealed that the lesion data equally well support the laterality scheme suggested by our data. While the present study supports the hierarchical view of local and global processing, there is an evident need for further research, both in patients and neurologically normal individuals, before an understanding of the functional lateralisation of local and global processing can be considered established."

Several regulatory mechanisms of TRPV1 function have been elucidated. Sensitization can arise from phosphorylation of TRPV1 at multiple sites via protein kinase C and protein kinase A downstream of activation of GTP-binding protein-coupling receptor by bradykinin, ATP, nerve growth factor, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and prostaglandins (10Caterina M.J. Julius D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Our recent report also showed that the metabotropic 5-HT receptor facilitates TRPV1 functions through protein kinase C/protein kinase A pathways (11Ohta T. Ikemi Y. Murakami M. Imagawa T. Otsuguro K. Ito S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 576: 809-822Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TRPV1 is subject to tonic inhibition by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (12Chuang H.H. Prescott E.D. Kong H. Shields S. Jordt S.E. Basbaum A.I. Chao M.V. Julius D. Nature. 2001; 411: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), providing an additional biochemical pathway through which the activity of the channel can be regulated after GTP-binding protein-coupling receptor activation. Recently, increases of cationic strength have been shown to contribute to inflammatory pain signaling through modulation of TRPV1 channels, since extracellular cations such as Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ gate and sensitize them (13Ahern G.P. Brooks I.M. Miyares R.L. Wang X.B. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5109-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Hyponatremia, a disease due to reduction of the plasma Na+ concentration, is one of the most common electrolyte disorders (14Offenstadt G. Das V. Minerva Anestesiol. 2006; 72: 353-356PubMed Google Scholar). It occurs via excess loss of plasma Na+ as a result of various causes such as chronic renal failure and congestive heart failure. When the serum Na+ level falls gradually over a period of several days or weeks, sodium levels as low as 110 meq/liter may be reached with minimal symptomatology. Its symptoms are often concomitant with pain (15Lukacz E.S. Nager C.W. Obstet. Gynecol. 2001; 98: 974-976PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular detector of pain perception in hyponatremia has not yet been identified. transient receptor potential V1 human TRPV1 porcine TRPV1 phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 15-hydroperoxyeicosa-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-tetraenoic acid human embryonic kidney dorsal root ganglion N-methyl-d-glucamine green fluorescent protein. We recently cloned a porcine orthologue of TRPV1 (pTRPV1) and analyzed its functional properties using a heterologous expression system (16Ohta T. Komatsu R. Imagawa T. Otsuguro K. Ito S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 71: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We showed that pTRPV1 was a nonselective cation channel sensitive to a number of vanilloid agonists, including capsaicin and endovanilloids, heat, and protons. In pharmacological characteristics of TRPV1, there are remarkable species differences; chicken TRPV1 is not sensitive to capsaicin (17Jordt S.E. Julius D.

Therefore, using a porcine orthologue may be more advantageous to predict physiological and pharmacological characteristics in human TRPV1. Here we demonstrate a quite unique property of porcine and human TRPV1; that is, the reduction of [Na+]o directly activates the TRPV1 channel and facilitates its activation induced by polymodal stimuli in a heterologous expression system and primary culture of sensory neurons. On the extracellular side of the TRPV1, several negatively charged amino acid residues (Glu-600, Glu-648, and Asp-646) have been identified to be critical for regulatory sites by positively charged molecules, such as protons, divalent and trivalent cations, and polyamines (13Ahern G.P. Brooks I.M. Miyares R.L. Wang X.B. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5109-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We hypothesize that [Na+]o has a novel regulatory role for the TRPV1 channel through its tonic inhibition under physiological conditions. We demonstrate that [Na+]o appears to act at the same sites as protons and that the specific glutamate residue Glu-600 is particularly important for activation of the TRPV1 channel by [Na+]o. If extracellular Na+ ionic homeostasis is disturbed by some metabolic causes like hyponatremia, TRPV1 may contribute to pain signaling in these patients. Cell Preparation, DNA Cloning, and Transfection—All protocols for experiments on animals were approved by the Committee on Animal Experimentation, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G (Meiji-Seika), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Banyu). The expression vectors pcDNA-pTRPV1-DEST53 for N-terminal GFP fusion protein, pcDNA-pTRPV1-DEST47 for C-terminal GFP fusion protein, and pGATE-pTRPV1 were constructed using Gateway Technology (Invitrogen) as described previously (16Ohta T. Komatsu R. Imagawa T. Otsuguro K. Ito S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 71: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the expression vector using a transfection reagent (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen) and used 24-48 h after transfection. Human TRPV1 (hTRPV1) was cloned from a human spinal cord cDNA library (Clontech) based on a published sequence (GenBank NM_080704). Complimentary DNA was subjected to PCR amplification with the use of high fidelity polymerase (KOD plus; Toyobo) using two sets of primers corresponding to the open reading frame of hTRPV1 (forward, 5′-CACCATGAAGAAATGGAGCAGCACAGACTTGGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCACTTCTCCCCGGAAGCGGCAGGACTCTTGAAGACC-3′). Single amino acid mutations of TRPV1 were made using the PrimeSTAR® mutagenesis basal kit (TaKaRa). All clones and mutations used were verified by sequencing using an automated sequencer (AB1 PRISM 3100, Applied Biosystems). Porcine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were obtained from male pigs (2-4 weeks after birth, 5-10 kg) as described previously (16Ohta T. Komatsu R. Imagawa T. Otsuguro K. Ito S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 71: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In brief, pigs were deeply anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) after tranquilization with ketamine (15 mg/kg, intramascular) and then killed by bloodletting from the cervical artery. To isolate murine DRG neurons adult mice (C57BL/6J and TRPV1-null (B6.129S4-Trpv1tm1Jul/J, Jackson Laboratories)) were euthanized with CO2 inhalation. Lumbar DRG were removed and enzymatically dissociated with collagenase (1 mg/ml, type II, Worthington) and DNase (1 mg/ml, Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, ganglia were further digested with trypsin (10 mg/ml, Sigma) and DNase (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Isolated cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) and cultured in M199 (Sigma) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%, Sigma), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were used within 1 day after preparation. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ and Na+ Concentrations—The intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in individual cells was measured with a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fura-2, by dual excitation using a fluorescent imaging system controlling illumination and acquisition (Aqua Cosmos, Hamamatsu Photonics) as described previously (16Ohta T. Komatsu R. Imagawa T. Otsuguro K. Ito S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 71: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To load fura-2, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester in normal external solution: 134 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). For Ca2+-free external solution, Ca2+ was omitted, and EGTA (0.5 mm) was added. For extracellular Na+ ([Na+]o)-free solution, Na+ was omitted and substituted for by equimolar NMDG+, various monovalent cations, or isotonic sucrose. For various [Na+]o-containing solutions (0-126 mm), Na+ was substituted for by equimolar NMDG+. The osmolarity of all external solutions used was 270-280 m Osm kg (Fiske ONE-TEN Osmometer, Fiske Associates). When [Ca2+]i and the intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) were simultaneously measured, cells were loaded with a fluorescent Na+ indicator, CoroNa Green-AM (26Meier S.D. Kovalchuk Y. Rose C.R. Neurosci. Methods. 2006; 155: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (10 μm, Molecular Probes) together with fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester. A coverslip with dye-loaded cells was placed in an experimental chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX71, Japan) equipped with an image acquisition and analysis system. To measure [Ca2+]i, cells were illuminated every 2.5 s with light at 340 and 380 nm, and the respective fluorescent signals of 500 nm were detected. For [Na+]i, cells were excited at 492 nm, and fluorescence above 515 nm was collected. The fluorescence emitted was projected to a CCD camera (ORCA-ER, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan), and the ratios of fluorescent signals (F340/F380) for [Ca2+]i and (F/Fo) for [Na+]i were stored on the hard disc of a PC (Pro-2500, EPSON). In some experiments the change in [Ca2+]i was measured using cameleon (27Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar), which is a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based Ca2+ sensor (supplemental Fig. 2A). HeLa cells were transfected with cameleon that was delivered by baculovirus-based transduction (Premo™ Cameleon, Molecular Probes) and porcine TRPV1 cDNA (pGATE-pTRPV1). For measurement of ratiometric fluorescence resonance energy transfer signals, cells were illuminated with light at 450 nm (F450), and yellow fluorescent protein emission (F480) and cyan fluorescent protein emission (F535) were detected. Cells were continuously superfused with the external solution at a flow rate of ∼1.5 ml/min through a Y-tube pipette placed close to the cells. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20-24 °C). Whole-cell Current Recording—Membrane currents were recorded using the conventional whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique with a patch clamp amplifier (Axo-patch 200B, Axon Instruments). The resistance of patch electrodes ranged from 3 to 4 megaohms. The currents were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz using an A/D converter (Digidata 1322A, Axon Instruments) in conjunction with a personal computer. During the experiments and analysis, pClamp 6 software (Axon Instruments) was used. The pipette solution contained 120 mm CsCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATPNa2, 0.2 mm GTPNa3, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm EGTA (pH 7.2 with CsOH). For simultaneous measurement of [Ca2+]i with the current responses, the pipette solution contained 120 mm CsCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1. mm 2 MgCl2, 2 mm ATPNa2, 0.2 mm GTPNa3, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1 mm fura-2 (pH 7.2 with CsOH). Immunocytochemistry—To identify whether neurons responding to [Na+]o removal express TRPV1 channels, primary cultured murine DRG cells were subjected to immunostaining with an anti-TRPV1 antibody. After [Ca2+]i responses were observed, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with a rabbit antiserum for TRPV1 (diluted 1:100, Santa Cruz). Subsequently, the antibody was visualized with Alexa® 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) for the detection of TRPV1. Preparations were examined with a confocal laser microscope (FV500, Olympus) using software (Fluoview, Olympus). Chemicals—Capsaicin from Sigma was dissolved in ethanol at a high concentration as a stock solution (1 mm). Capsazepine, iodoresiniferatoxin, and ruthenium red (from Sigma) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) to make a stock solution (0.1 m). 2-[2-[4-(4-Nitrobnezyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea mesylate (KB-R7943) was from Tocris. 15(S)-HPETE was from Biomol. The drugs were diluted to their final concentrations using the external solution. The final concentrations of ethanol and Me2SO were less than 0.001% (v/v) and 0.01% (v/v), respectively, which did not affect [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i. Data Analysis—The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. (n = number of observations). Comparisons were made by the paired Student's t test, and differences with a p value of less than 0.05 were considered significant. Pairwise associations were examined by Pearson's linear regression. Values of the 50% effective concentration (EC50) and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) were determined using Origin software (OriginLab). The present data were obtained from at least four different transfections or from three different animals per experiment. The Removal of External Na+ Increased [Ca2+]i in Porcine TRPV1-expressing HEK293 Cells—The effects of [Na+]o removal on [Ca2+]i in HEK293 cells expressing pTRPV1 were examined using fura-2-based [Ca2+]i imaging. The intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) was simultaneously monitored by loading CoroNa Green as a Na+ indicator. Representative time-lapse [Ca2+]i imaging clearly demonstrated that a [Ca2+]i increase was observed only in the cells responding to capsaicin when the cells were exposed to NMDG+-based [Na+]o-free solution (Fig. 1A). The application of [Na+]o-free solution elicited a rapid [Ca2+]i increase, which was sustained during the period of [Na+]o removal (Fig. 1B). In this period [Na+]i substantially decreased. Capsaicin (0.3 μm) produced a rapid [Ca2+]i rise concomitant with a sustained rise of [Na+]i. The time to peak of the [Ca2+]i increase induced by capsaicin (18.9 ± 1.2 s) was the same as that for the removal of [Na+]o (20.1 ± 1.3 s, n = 80). The increments of [Ca2+]i induced by the first application of [Na+]o-free solution and that induced by subsequently applied capsaicin were 258 ± 9.4 and 264.9 ± 9.1 nm (n = 80), respectively. No additive [Ca2+]i increase occurred with the simultaneous application of [Na+]o-free solution together with 0.3 μm capsaicin (data not shown). Under the present experimental conditions, no obvious tachyphylaxis occurred by repetitive application of capsaicin or [Na+]o-free solution (Fig. 1C). When [Na+]o was applied at different concentrations, low [Na+]o evoked a [Ca2+]i increase in pTRPV1-expressing HEK293 cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of 30.9 ± 2.0 mm (Fig. 1, D and E). The second application of [Na+]o-free solution, in which the [Na+]i level stayed high after capsaicin challenge, produced almost the same amplitude of [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 1B). The [Ca2+]i increase induced by the removal of [Na+]o was not affected by KB-R7943 (50 μm), a selective inhibitor of the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (28Schröder U.H. Breder J. Sabelhaus C.F. Reymann K.G. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These data indicated that the [Ca2+]i increase evoked by [Na+]o removal was unrelated to the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. In the present experiment we mainly analyzed the TRPV1 function using a recombinant channel protein with an N-terminal GFP fusion protein (GFP-pTRPV1). To avoid the possibility that low [Na+]o elicited the [Ca2+]i increase in heterologously pTRPV1-expressing cells due to some physiochemical interaction with GFP protein, three expression plasmids were constructed, and their [Ca2+]i responses to low [Na+]o were analyzed. The [Ca2+]i responses to [Na+]o removal were observed in cells that expressed pTRPV1 in the C terminus of the GFP fusion protein and even in cells lacking GFP (supplemental Fig. 1). Neither [Na+]o removal nor capsaicin produced a [Ca2+]i increase in non-transfected naive HEK293 cells, but ATP produced transient [Ca2+]i. Moreover, an increase of [Ca2+]i induced by [Na+]o removal could be detected in pTRPV1-transfected HeLa cells expressing a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based Ca2+ sensor, cameleon (supplemental Fig. 2). These results completely excluded the possibility that GFP fusion affected the nature of TRPV1, methods for [Ca2+]i measurement, or cellular dependence used for transfection in the [Ca2+]i increase evoked by [Na+]o removal. The effects of the replacement of [Na+]o by various monovalent cations or sucrose on [Ca2+]i were examined (Fig. 2). All monovalent cations and isotonic sucrose, used as a substitute for [Na+]o, caused a sustained increase of [Ca2+]i in cells responding to capsaicin. These [Ca2+]i responses were abolished by the removal of external Ca2+, indicative of Ca2+ influx from the extracellular milieu similar to capsaicin (29Ohta T. Imagawa T. Ito S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 73: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data suggest that no monovalent cations are able to replace the effect of Na+ on the TRPV1 channel and that [Na+]o removal itself activates the TRPV1 channel. Three TRPV1 antagonists, capsazepine, iodoresiniferatoxin, and ruthenium red, were tested for their ability to inhibit the [Na+]o removal-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Inhibitory effects of these antagonists were examined by the application of increasing their concentrations with [Na+]o-free solution. All antagonists caused concentration-dependent inhibition of the [Na+]o removal-induced [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 1F). The IC50 values were 6.0 ± 0.1 nm for iodoresiniferatoxin, 30.0 ± 0.2 nm for ruthenium red, and 287.2 ± 12.2 nm for capsazepine. This led to the hypothesis that the removal of [Na+]o relieved the tonic inhibitory action of [Na+]o on TRPV1 channels. Sensitization of TRPV1 Function by Low [Na+]o—We examined the effect of lowering [Na+]o on the capsaicin-induced [Ca2+]i increase. HEK293 cells expressing pTRPV1 were repetitively stimulated with a low concentration of capsaicin (0.03 μm) for 30 s at intervals of 5 min. For 112 mm [Na+]o-containing solution, [Na+]o was substituted by equimolar NMDG+; thus, osmotic pressure was unchanged. By lowering [Na+]o from 134 to 112 mm, the average [Ca2+]i response to capsaicin was increased (Fig. 3A). It returned to the original level when [Na+]o was increased to 134 mm. As shown in Figs. 1, D and E, and 3A, lowering [Na+]o to 112 mm did not produce any [Ca2+]i response but significantly potentiated the [Ca2+]i response evoked by capsaicin. The concentration dependence of capsaicin on the [Ca2+]i increase was shifted leftward by lowering [Na+]o from 134 to 112 mm, and the EC50 value of capsaicin was correspondingly significantly reduced from 76.3 ± 2.6 to 33.0 ± 1.8 nm. TRPV1 functions as a polymodal receptor that is activated not only by the vanilloid agonist capsaicin, but also by protons, noxious heat (2Tominaga M. Caterina M.J. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6155-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). We previously reported that these stimuli are effective for activating pTRPV1 (16Ohta T. Komatsu R. Imagawa T. Otsuguro K. Ito S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 71: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Next we examined whether low [Na+]o produced potentiation effects on proton-, heat-, or endovanilloid-induced responses. Brief application of protons (pH 6.5), heat (46 °C), and 15(S)-HPETE (1 μm) produces a transient [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 3C) under which these stimuli cause less than half-maximal responses (16Ohta T. Komatsu R. Imagawa T. Otsuguro K. Ito S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 71: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After the application of 112 mm [Na+]o, the [Ca2+]i response evoked by each stimulus was significantly enhanced (Fig. 3D), suggesting that lowering [Na+]o not only directly activated but also sensitized pTRPV1 channels. Membrane Current Responses to the Removal of [Na+]o—It is known that the capsaicin-evoked [Ca2+]i increase results from an influx of divalent cations directly through TRPV1 channels (1Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7144) Google Scholar). To examine whether low [Na+]o activates functional ion channels and promotes Ca2+ influx through TRPV1 channels, we simultaneously measured [Ca2+]i and current responses to the removal of [Na+]o under voltage clamp conditions in HEK293 cells expressing pTRPV1 (Fig. 4). At a holding potential of -60 mV, capsaicin (0.3 μm) and Cs+-based [Na+]o-free solution evoked an inward current concomitant with a rapid increase of [Ca2+]i. In the same cell NMDG+-based [Na+]o-free solution elicited only a small inward current, if any, together with a prominent [Ca2+]i increase. Presumably, in the former two conditions, a significant proportion of the inward current was"

However, the mechanisms by which they mediate their suppressive effects are not fully understood. Respiratory epithelial cells are a source of CX(3)CL1 (fractalkine), which mediates cell adhesion and acts as a chemoattractant for monocytes, T cells, and mast cells. We show, in lung A549 epithelial cells, that the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IFNgamma synergistically induced protein release and mRNA expression of CX(3)CL1 is inhibited by dexamethasone, without interfering with cytokine-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, and by an inhibitor of IkappaB kinase 2, AS602868. DNA binding assays confirmed the ability of NF-kappaB to bind to the proximal CX(3)CL1 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed a 5-fold increase in the recruitment of NF-kappaB to the CX(3)CL1 gene promoter in response to IFNgamma/TNF-alpha; this too was reversed by dexamethasone. In contrast, dexamethasone did not displace NF-kappaB from the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene promoter. We conclude that CX(3)CL1 expression is regulated through the NF-kappaB pathway and that dexamethasone inhibits CX(3)CL1 expression through a glucocorticoid receptor-dependent (RU486 sensitive) mechanism. This study also provides support for the action of glucocorticoids mediating their suppressive effects on expression by interfering with the binding of transcriptional activators at native gene promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2025726628,"The cellular chaperone protein Hsc70, along with components of the 26S proteasome and ubiquitin-conjugated proteins have been shown to be sequestered in discrete foci in the nuclei of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infected cells. We recently reported that cellular RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) undergoes proteasomal degradation during robust HSV-1 transcription, and that the immediate early protein ICP27 interacts with the C-terminal domain and is involved in the recruitment of RNAP II to viral transcription/replication compartments.Here we show that ICP27 also interacts with Hsc70, and is required for the formation of Hsc70 nuclear foci. During infection with ICP27 mutants that are unable to recruit RNAP II to viral replication sites, viral transcript levels were greatly reduced, viral replication compartments were poorly formed and Hsc70 focus formation was curtailed. Further, a dominant negative Hsc70 mutant that cannot hydrolyze ATP, interfered with RNAP II degradation during HSV-1 infection, and an increase in ubiquitinated forms of RNAP II was observed. There was also a decrease in virus yields, indicating that proteasomal degradation of stalled RNAP II complexes during robust HSV-1 transcription and replication benefits viral gene expression.We propose that one function of the Hsc70 nuclear foci may be to serve to facilitate the process of clearing stalled RNAP II complexes from viral genomes during times of highly active transcription."

Because KS spindle cells are thought to be of endothelial origin, and because mature endothelial cells do not sustain persistent KSHV-infection, our attention was focalized on circulating hematopoietic precursors able to differentiate into endothelial lineage.Late endothelial progenitor cells (late-EPCs) were cultured from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 16 patients with classic KS. The presence and load of KSHV genomes were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in DNA extracted from cells and supernatants of late-EPC cultures obtained from 7 patients. Endothelial colonies cultured from the peripheral blood of KS patients were found to satisfy all requisites to be defined late-EPCs: they appeared from the CD14-negative fraction of adherent cells after 11-26 days of culture, could be serially expanded in vitro, expressed high levels of endothelial antigens but lacked leukocyte markers. Late-EPC cultures were found to harbor KSHV-DNA at variable levels and to retain the virus after multiple passages in cells as well as in supernatants, suggesting that a quote of KSHV lytic infection may spontaneously occur. Lytic phase induction or hypoxia could amplify virus release in supernatants.Our results suggest that circulating endothelial progenitors from KS patients are KSHV-infected and support viral productive replication and may therefore represent potential virus reservoirs and putative precursors of KS spindle cells."

In this study, we analyzed gene expression in laboratory mice fed diets typical of humans and of chimpanzees. The effects of human diets were found to be significantly different from that of a chimpanzee diet in the mouse liver, but not in the brain. Importantly, 10% of the genes that differ in their expression between humans and chimpanzee livers differed also between the livers of mice fed the human and chimpanzee diets. Furthermore, both the promoter sequences and the amino acid sequences of these diet-related genes carry more differences between humans and chimpanzees than random genes. Our results suggest that the mouse can be used to study at least some aspects of human-specific traits."

The mechanisms of how new neurons are generated, how they integrate into circuits, and their role in coding remain mysteries. Here we report a technique that will greatly facilitate research into these questions. We found that electroporation can be used to robustly and selectively label progenitors in the Subventicular Zone. The approach was performed postnatally, without surgery, and with near 100% success rates. Labeling was found in all classes of interneurons in the olfactory bulb, persisted to adulthood and had no adverse effects. The broad utility of electroporation was demonstrated by encoding a calcium sensor and markers of intracellular organelles. The approach was found to be effective in wildtype and transgenic mice as well as rats. Given its versatility, robustness, and both time and cost effectiveness, this method offers a powerful new way to use genetic manipulation to understand adult neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2121286298,"Background The binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in the thymus determines fates of TCRαβ lymphocytes that subsequently home to secondary lymphoid tissue. TCR transgenic models have been used to study thymic selection and lineage commitment. Most TCR transgenic mice express the rearranged TCRαβ prematurely at the double negative stage and abnormal TCRαβ populations of T cells that are not easily detected in non-transgenic mice have been found in secondary lymphoid tissue of TCR transgenic mice. Methodology and Principal Findings To determine developmental pathways of TCR-transgenic thymocytes, we used Cre-LoxP-mediated fate mapping and show here that premature expression of a transgenic TCRαβ diverts some developing thymocytes to a developmental pathway which resembles that of gamma delta cells. We found that most peripheral T cells with the HY-TCR in male mice have bypassed the RORγt-positive CD4+8+ (double positive, DP) stage to accumulate either as CD4−8− (double negative, DN) or as CD8α+ T cells in lymph nodes or gut epithelium. Likewise, DN TCRαβ cells in lymphoid tissue of female mice were not derived from DP thymocytes. Conclusion The results further support the hypothesis that the premature expression of the TCRαβ can divert DN thymocytes into gamma delta lineage cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026872105,"Many hypotheses attempting to explain the speed and sensitivity with which a T-cell discriminates the antigens it encounters include a notion of relative spatial and temporal control of particular biochemical steps involved in the process. An essential step in T-cell receptor (TCR) mediated signalling is the activation of the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70. ZAP-70 is recruited to the TCR upon receptor engagement and, once activated, is responsible for the phosphorylation of the protein adaptor, Linker for Activation of T-cells, or LAT. LAT phosphorylation results in the recruitment of a signalosome including PLCgamma1, Grb2/SOS, GADS and SLP-76. In order to examine the real time spatial and temporal evolution of ZAP-70 activity following TCR engagement in the immune synapse, we have developed ROZA, a novel FRET-based biosensor whose function is dependent upon ZAP-70 activity. This new probe not only provides a measurement of the kinetics of ZAP-70 activity, but also reveals the subcellular localization of the activity as well. Unexpectedly, ZAP-70 dependent FRET was observed not only at the T-cell -APC interface, but also at the opposite pole of the cell or ""antisynapse""."
https://openalex.org/W2082159207,"Background The dissimilatory adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (APS) reductase (cofactors flavin adenine dinucleotide, FAD, and two [4Fe-4S] centers) catalyzes the transformation of APS to sulfite and AMP in sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP); in sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) it has been suggested to operate in the reverse direction. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus enzyme has been determined in different catalytically relevant states providing insights into its reaction cycle. Methodology/Principal Findings Full-length AprBA sequences from 20 phylogenetically distinct SRP and SOB species were used for homology modeling. In general, the average accuracy of the calculated models was sufficiently good to allow a structural and functional comparison between the beta- and alpha-subunit structures (78.8–99.3% and 89.5–96.8% of the AprB and AprA main chain atoms, respectively, had root mean square deviations below 1 Å with respect to the template structures). Besides their overall conformity, the SRP- and SOB-derived models revealed the existence of individual adaptations at the electron-transferring AprB protein surface presumably resulting from docking to different electron donor/acceptor proteins. These structural alterations correlated with the protein phylogeny (three major phylogenetic lineages: (1) SRP including LGT-affected Archaeoglobi and SOB of Apr lineage II, (2) crenarchaeal SRP Caldivirga and Pyrobaculum, and (3) SOB of the distinct Apr lineage I) and the presence of potential APS reductase-interacting redox complexes. The almost identical protein matrices surrounding both [4Fe-4S] clusters, the FAD cofactor, the active site channel and center within the AprB/A models of SRP and SOB point to a highly similar catalytic process of APS reduction/sulfite oxidation independent of the metabolism type the APS reductase is involved in and the species it has been originated from. Conclusions Based on the comparative models, there are no significant structural differences between dissimilatory APS reductases from SRP and SOB; this might be indicative for a similar catalytic process of APS reduction/sulfite oxidation."

It is useful to examine the circumstances under which other species will or will not barter to more fully understand the phenomenon. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are an interesting test case as they are an intelligent species, closely related to humans, and known to participate in reciprocal interactions and token economies with humans, yet they have not spontaneously developed costly barter.Although chimpanzees do engage in noncostly barter, in which otherwise value-less tokens are exchanged for food, this lack of risk is not typical of human barter. Thus, we systematically examined barter in chimpanzees to ascertain under what circumstances chimpanzees will engage in costly barter of commodities, that is, trading food items for other food items with a human experimenter. We found that chimpanzees do barter, relinquishing lower value items to obtain higher value items (and not the reverse). However, they do not trade in all beneficial situations, maintaining possession of less preferred items when the relative gains they stand to make are small.Two potential explanations for this puzzling behavior are that chimpanzees lack ownership norms, and thus have limited opportunity to benefit from the gains of trade, and that chimpanzees' risk of defection is sufficiently high that large gains must be imminent to justify the risk. Understanding the conditions that support barter in chimpanzees may increase understanding of situations in which humans, too, do not maximize their gains."

Using biochemistry, molecularbiology and electrophysiology methods we demonstrate a protein-protein interaction between HCN2 and the K(+) channel regulator protein 1, named KCR1. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments we show that KCR1 and HCN2 proteins are able to associate. Heterologously expressed HCN2 whole-cell current density was significantly decreased by KCR1. KCR1 profoundly suppressed I(HCN2) single-channel activity, indicating a functional interaction between KCR1 and the HCN2 channel subunit. Endogenous KCR1 expression could be detected in adult and neonatal rat ventriculocytes. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of KCR1 in rat cardiomyocytes (i) reduced I(f) whole-cell currents, (ii) suppressed most single-channel gating parameters, (iii) altered the activation kinetics, (iv) suppressed spontaneous action potential activity, and (v) the beating rate. More importantly, siRNA-based knock-down of endogenous KCR1 increased the native I(f) current size and single-channel activity and accelerated spontaneous beating rate, supporting an inhibitory action of endogenous KCR1 on native I(f). Our observations demonstrate for the first time that KCR1 modulates I(HCN2)/I(f) channel gating and indicate that KCR1 serves as a regulator of cardiac automaticity."

The exact mechanisms orchestrating filament assembly are not fully understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we examine mechanisms controlling filament assembly of non-muscle myosin IIB heavy chain (MHC-IIB). We show that in vitro the entire C-terminus region of net positive charge, found in myosin II rods, is important for self-assembly of MHC-IIB fragments. In contrast, no particular sequences in the rod region with net negative charge were identified as important for self-assembly, yet a minimal area from this region is necessary. Proper paracrystal formation by MHC-IIB fragments requires the 196aa charge periodicity along the entire coiled-coil region. In vivo, in contrast to self-assembly in vitro, negatively-charged regions of the coiled-coil were found to play an important role by controlling the intracellular localization of native MHC-IIB. The entire positively-charged region is also important for intracellular localization of native MHC-IIB.

Its activity is subject to a tight regulation involving a multitude of post-translational modifications. The plethora of functional protein interactions of p53 at present precludes a clear understanding of regulatory principles in the p53 signaling network. To circumvent this complexity, we studied here the minimal requirements for functionally relevant p53 post-translational modifications by expressing human p53 together with its best characterized modifier Mdm2 in budding yeast. We find that expression of the human p53-Mdm2 module in yeast is sufficient to faithfully recapitulate key aspects of p53 regulation in higher eukaryotes, such as Mdm2-dependent targeting of p53 for degradation, sumoylation at lysine 386 and further regulation of this process by p14(ARF). Interestingly, sumoylation is necessary for the recruitment of p53-Mdm2 complexes to yeast nuclear bodies morphologically akin to human PML bodies. These results suggest a novel role for Mdm2 as well as for p53 sumoylation in the recruitment of p53 to nuclear bodies. The reductionist yeast model that was established and validated in this study will now allow to incrementally study simplified parts of the intricate p53 network, thus helping elucidate the core mechanisms of p53 regulation as well as test novel strategies to counteract p53 malfunctions."

Although three EP3 variants, alpha, beta, and gamma, have been described in mice, their functional significance in regulating tumorigenesis is unknown. In this study we provide evidence that expressing murine EP3 alpha, beta, and gamma receptor variants in tumor cells reduces to the same degree their tumorigenic potential in vivo. In addition, activation of each of the three mEP3 variants induces enhanced cell-cell contact and reduces cell proliferation in vitro in a Rho-dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrate that EP3-mediated RhoA activation requires the engagement of the heterotrimeric G protein G(12). Thus, our study provides strong evidence that selective activation of each of the three variants of the EP3 receptor suppresses tumor cell function by activating a G(12)-RhoA pathway."

In the present study, we developed a novel alternative method to test the role of a humanized anti-tissue factor mAb in acute lung injury with transgenic mice.Human tissue factor knock-in (hTF-KI) transgenic mice and a novel humanized anti-human tissue factor mAb (anti-hTF mAb, CNTO859) were developed. The hTF-KI mice showed a normal and functional expression of hTF. The anti-hTF mAb specifically blocked the pro-coagulation activity of brain extracts from the hTF-KI mice and human, but not from wild type mice. An extrapulmonary ARDS model was used by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion. Significant lung tissue damage in hTF-KI mice was observed after 2 h reperfusion. Administration of CNTO859 (5 mg/kg, i.v.) attenuated the severity of lung tissue injury, decreased the total cell counts and protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and reduced Evans blue leakage. In addition, the treatment significantly reduced alveolar fibrin deposition, and decreased tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity in the serum. This treatment also down-regulated cytokine expression and reduced cell death in the lung.This novel anti-hTF antibody showed beneficial effects on intestinal ischemia-reperfusion induced acute lung injury, which merits further investigation for clinical usage.

This is true despite the electrophysiological basis of the latter recordings, which are typically extracellular recordings of action potentials from a restricted sample of cells.Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging in human subjects, we found a widely distributed cortical response in both primary somatosensory and motor cortex upon pneumatic stimulation of the hairless surface of the thumb, index and ring fingers. Though not organized in a discrete somatotopic fashion, the population activity in response to thumb and index finger stimulation indicated a disproportionate response to fingertip stimulation, and one that was modulated by stimulation direction. Furthermore, the activation was structured with a line of symmetry through the central sulcus reflecting inputs both to primary somatosensory cortex and, precentrally, to primary motor cortex.In considering functional activation that is not somatotopically or anatomically restricted as in monkey electrophysiology studies, our methodology reveals finger-related activation that is not organized in a simple somatotopic manner but is nevertheless as structured as it is widespread. Our findings suggest a striking functional mirroring in cortical areas conventionally ascribed either an input or an output somatotopic function."
https://openalex.org/W1991421174,"We report the production and availability of over 7000 fully sequence verified plasmid ORF clones representing over 3400 unique human genes. These ORF clones were derived using the human MGC collection as template and were produced in two formats: with and without stop codons. Thus, this collection supports the production of either native protein or proteins with fusion tags added to either or both ends. The template clones used to generate this collection were enriched in three ways. First, gene redundancy was removed. Second, clones were selected to represent the best available GenBank reference sequence. Finally, a literature-based software tool was used to evaluate the list of target genes to ensure that it broadly reflected biomedical research interests. The target gene list was compared with 4000 human diseases and over 8500 biological and chemical MeSH classes in approximately 15 Million publications recorded in PubMed at the time of analysis. The outcome of this analysis revealed that relative to the genome and the MGC collection, this collection is enriched for the presence of genes with published associations with a wide range of diseases and biomedical terms without displaying a particular bias towards any single disease or concept. Thus, this collection is likely to be a powerful resource for researchers who wish to study protein function in a set of genes with documented biomedical significance."
https://openalex.org/W2094680147,"Background Polyglutamine expansion disorders are caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the disease related protein, leading to severe neurodegeneration. All polyQ disorders are hallmarked by the presence of intracellular aggregates containing the expanded protein in affected neurons. The polyQ disorder SpinoCerebellar Ataxia 1 (SCA1) is caused by a polyQ-expansion in the ataxin-1 protein, which is thought to lead to nuclear aggregates. Methodology/Principal Findings Using advanced live cell fluorescence microscopy and a filter retardation assay we show that nuclear accumulations formed by polyQ-expanded ataxin-1 do not resemble aggregates of other polyQ-expanded proteins. Instead of being static, insoluble aggregates, nuclear accumulations formed by the polyQ-expanded ataxin-1 showed enhanced intracellular kinetics as compared to wild-type ataxin-1. During mitosis, ataxin-1 accumulations redistributed equally among daughter cells, in contrast to polyQ aggregates. Interestingly, polyQ expansion did not affect the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of ataxin-1 as proposed before. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that polyQ expansion does not necessarily lead to aggregate formation, and that the enhanced kinetics may affect the nuclear function of ataxin-1. The unexpected findings for a polyQ-expanded protein and their consequences for ongoing SCA1 research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1975065818,"Background Effective therapy for HIV-infected individuals remains an unmet medical need. Promising clinical trials with dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy consisting of autologous DC loaded with autologous virus have been reported, however, these approaches depend on large numbers of HIV virions to generate sufficient doses for even limited treatment regimens. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study describes a novel approach for RT-PCR amplification of HIV antigens. Previously, RT-PCR amplification of autologous viral sequences has been confounded by the high mutation rate of the virus which results in unreliable primer-template binding. To resolve this problem we developed a multiplex RT-PCR strategy that allows reliable strain-independent amplification of highly polymorphic target antigens from any patient and requires neither viral sequence data nor custom-designed PCR primers for each individual. We demonstrate the application of our RT-PCR process to amplify translationally-competent RNA encoding regions of Gag, Vpr, Rev and Nef. The products amplified using this method represent a complex mixture of autologous antigens encoded by viral quasispecies. We further demonstrate that DCs electroporated with in vitro-transcribed HIV RNAs are capable of stimulating poly-antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in vitro. Conclusion/Significance This study describes a strategy to overcome patient to patient viral diversity enabling strain-independent RT-PCR amplification of RNAs encoding sequence divergent quasispecies of Gag, Vpr, Rev and Nef from small volumes of infectious plasma. The approach allows creation of a completely autologous therapy that does not require advance knowledge of the HIV genomic sequences, does not have yield limitations and has no intact virus in the final product. The simultaneous use of autologous viral antigens and DCs may provoke broad patient-specific immune responses that could potentially induce effective control of viral loads in the absence of conventional antiretroviral drug therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2014546734,"Background Gene families typically evolve by gene duplication followed by the adoption of new or altered gene functions. A different way to evolve new but related functions is alternative splicing of existing exons of a complex gene. The chemosensory gene families of animals are characterised by numerous loci of related function. Alternative splicing has only rarely been reported in chemosensory loci, for example in 5 out of around 120 loci in Drosophila melanogaster. The gustatory receptor gene Gr39a has four large exons that are alternatively spliced with three small conserved exons. Recently the genome sequences of eleven additional species of Drosophila have become available allowing us to examine variation in the structure of the Gr39a locus across a wide phylogenetic range of fly species. Methodology/Principal Findings We describe a fifth exon and show that the locus has a complex evolutionary history with several duplications, pseudogenisations and losses of exons. PAML analyses suggested that the whole gene has a history of purifying selection, although this was less strong in exons which underwent duplication. Conclusions/Significance Estimates of functional divergence between exons were similar in magnitude to functional divergence between duplicated genes, suggesting that exon divergence is broadly equivalent to gene duplication."
https://openalex.org/W1977586504,"Background Despite extensive large scale analyses of expression and protein-protein interactions (PPI) in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, over a thousand yeast genes remain uncharacterized. We have developed a novel strategy in yeast that directly combines genetics with proteomics in the same screen to assign function to proteins based on the observation of genetic perturbations of sentinel protein interactions (GePPI). As proof of principle of the GePPI screen, we applied it to identify proteins involved in the regulation of an important yeast cell cycle transcription factor, SBF that activates gene expression during G1 and S phase. Methodology/Principle Findings The principle of GePPI is that if a protein is involved in a pathway of interest, deletion of the corresponding gene will result in perturbation of sentinel PPIs that report on the activity of the pathway. We created a fluorescent protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA) to detect the interaction between Cdc28 and Swi4, which leads to the inactivation of SBF. The PCA signal was quantified by microscopy and image analysis in deletion strains corresponding to 25 candidate genes that are periodically expressed during the cell cycle and are substrates of Cdc28. We showed that the serine-threonine kinase Elm1 plays a role in the inactivation of SBF and that phosphorylation of Elm1 by Cdc28 may be a mechanism to inactivate Elm1 upon completion of mitosis. Conclusions/Significance Our findings demonstrate that GePPI is an effective strategy to directly link proteins of known or unknown function to a specific biological pathway of interest. The ease in generating PCA assays for any protein interaction and the availability of the yeast deletion strain collection allows GePPI to be applied to any cellular network. In addition, the high degree of conservation between yeast and mammalian proteins and pathways suggest GePPI could be used to generate insight into human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2054837902,"The International Shark Attack File mentions only four unprovoked shark attacks on the coast of West Africa during the period 1828-2004, an area where high concentrations of sharks and 17 species potentially dangerous to man have been observed. To investigate if the frequency of shark attacks could be really low and not just under-reported and whether there are potentially sharks that might attack in the area, a study was carried out in Dakar and the Cap Vert peninsula, Senegal.Personnel of health facilities, administrative services, traditional authorities and groups of fishermen from the region of Dakar were interviewed about the occurrence of shark attacks, and visual censuses were conducted along the coastline to investigate shark communities associated with the coasts of Dakar and the Cap Vert peninsula. Six attacks were documented for the period 1947-2005, including two fatal ones attributed to the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvieri. All attacks concerned fishermen and only one occurred after 1970. Sharks were observed year round along the coastline in waters 3-15 m depth. Two species potentially dangerous for man, the nurse shark Ginglymostoma cirratum and the blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus, represented together 94% of 1,071 sharks enumerated during 1,459 hours of observations. Threatening behaviour from sharks was noted in 12 encounters (1.1%), including 8 encounters with C. limbatus, one with Galeocerdo cuvieri and 3 with unidentified sharks.These findings suggest that the frequency of shark attacks on the coast of West Africa is underestimated. However, they also indicate that the risk is very low despite the abundance of sharks. In Dakar area, most encounters along the coastline with potentially dangerous species do not result in an attack. Compared to other causes of water related deaths, the incidence of shark attack appears negligible, at least one thousand fold lower."
https://openalex.org/W2063802706,"Background At present, it is difficult to visualize the internalization of surface receptors induced by ubiquitination that is taken place at the plasma membrane in mammals. This problem makes it difficult to reveal molecular basis for ubiquitination-mediated internalization in mammals. Methodology/Principle Findings In order to overcome it, we have generated T-REx-c-MIR, a novel mammalian Tet-on B cell line using a constitutively active E3 ubiquitin ligase, c-MIR, and its artificial target molecule. By applying the surface biotinylation method to T-REx-c-MIR, we succeeded to monitor the fate of surface target molecules after initiation of ubiquitination process by doxycycline (Dox)-induced c-MIR expression. Target molecules that pre-existed at the plasma membrane before induction of c-MIR expression were oligo-ubiquitinated and degraded by Dox-induced c-MIR expression. Dox-induced c-MIR expression initiated rapid internalization of surface target molecules, and blockage of the internalization induced the accumulation of the surface target molecules that were newly ubiquitinated by c-MIR. Inhibition of the surface ubiquitination by down-regulating ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 impaired the internalization of target molecules. Finally, a complex of c-MIR and target molecule was detected at the plasma membrane. Conclusions/Significances These results demonstrate that in T-REx-c-MIR, surface target molecule is ubiquitinated at the plasma membrane and followed by being internalized from the plasma membrane. Thus, T-REx-c-MIR is a useful experimental tool to analyze how surface ubiquitination regulates internalization in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1990457238,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) perform essential roles in cell division and gene expression in all eukaryotes. The requirement for an upstream CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is also universally conserved, but the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe appears to be unique in having two CAKs with both overlapping and specialized functions that can be dissected genetically. The Mcs6 complex--orthologous to metazoan Cdk7/cyclin H/Mat1--activates the cell-cycle CDK, Cdk1, but its non-redundant essential function appears to be in regulation of gene expression, as part of transcription factor TFIIH. The other CAK is Csk1, an ortholog of budding yeast Cak1, which activates all three essential CDKs in S. pombe--Cdk1, Mcs6 and Cdk9, the catalytic subunit of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb)--but is not itself essential.Cells lacking csk1(+) are viable but hypersensitive to agents that damage DNA or block replication. Csk1 is required for normal levels of homologous recombination (HR), and interacts genetically with components of the HR pathway. Tests of damage sensitivity in csk1, mcs6 and cdk9 mutants indicate that Csk1 acts pleiotropically, through Cdk9 and at least one other target (but not through Mcs6) to preserve genomic integrity.The two CAKs in fission yeast, which differ with respect to their substrate range and preferences for monomeric CDKs versus CDK/cyclin complexes as substrates, also support different functions of the CDK network in vivo. Csk1 plays a non-redundant role in safeguarding genomic integrity. We propose that specialized activation pathways dependent on different CAKs might insulate CDK functions important in DNA damage responses from those capable of triggering mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2034088444,"A novel and efficient tagArray technology was developed that allows rapid identification of antibodies which bind to receptors with a specific expression profile, in the absence of biological information. This method is based on the cloning of a specific, short nucleotide sequence (tag) in the phagemid coding for each phage-displayed antibody fragment (phage-Ab) present in a library. In order to set up and validate the method we identified about 10,000 different phage-Abs binding to receptors expressed in their native form on the cell surface (10 k Membranome collection) and tagged each individual phage-Ab. The frequency of each phage-Ab in a given population can at this point be inferred by measuring the frequency of its associated tag sequence through standard DNA hybridization methods. Using tiny amounts of biological samples we identified phage-Abs binding to receptors preferentially expressed on primary tumor cells rather than on cells obtained from matched normal tissues. These antibodies inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and tumor development in vivo, thus representing therapeutic lead candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2080848476,"The C-terminal domain (CTD) of bacteriophage Mu immunity repressor (Rep) regulates DNA binding by the N-terminal domain and degradation by ClpXP protease. Five residues at the Rep C terminus (CTD5) can serve as a ClpX recognition motif, but it is dormant unless activated, a state that can be induced by the presence of dominant-negative mutant repressors (Vir). Conversion of Rep to ClpXP-sensitive form was associated with not only increased exposure of CTD5 to solvent but also increased CTD motion or flexibility as measured by fluorescence anisotropy. CTD mutations (V183S, K193S, and V196S) promoting ClpXP resistance without destroying the recognition motif prevented increased CTD motion induced by Vir. Suppression of ClpXP protease resistance conferred by the V196S mutation also correlated with restoration of CTD motion. The temperature-sensitive R47Q mutation present in cis within the DNA-binding domain restored ClpXP protease sensitivity to the V196S mutant, and anisotropy analysis indicated that R47Q allows the V196S CTD to gain increased flexibility when Vir was present. The results indicate that the CTD functions to turn the recognition motif on and off, most likely by modulating flexibility of the domain that harbors the ClpX recognition motif, suggesting a general mechanism by which proteins can regulate their own degradation."
