https://openalex.org/W2484877107,"Inflammatory M1 spectrum macrophages protect from infection but can cause inflammatory disease and tissue damage, whereas alternatively activated/M2 spectrum macrophages reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair. Modulation of macrophage phenotype may be therapeutically beneficial and requires further understanding of the molecular programs that control macrophage differentiation. A potential mechanism by which macrophages differentiate may be through microRNA (miRNA), which bind to messenger RNA and post-transcriptionally modify gene expression, cell phenotype and function. We hypothesized that the inflammation-associated miRNA, miR-155, would be required for typical development of macrophage inflammatory state. miR-155 was rapidly up-regulated over 100-fold in inflammatory M1(LPS + IFN-γ), but not M2(IL-4), macrophages. Inflammatory genes Inos, Il1b and Tnfa and their corresponding protein or enzymatic products were reduced up to 72% in miR-155 knockout mouse M1(LPS + IFN-γ) macrophages, but miR-155 deficiency did not affect expression of the M2-associated gene Arg1 in M2(IL-4) macrophages. Additionally, a miR-155 oligonucleotide inhibitor efficiently suppressed Inos and Tnfa gene expression in wild-type M1(LPS + IFN-γ) macrophages. Comparative transcriptional profiling of unstimulated and M1(LPS + IFN-γ) macrophages derived from wild-type (WT) and miR-155 knockout (KO) mice revealed that half (approximately 650 genes) of the signature we previously identified in WT M1(LPS + IFN-γ) macrophages was dependent on miR-155. Real-Time PCR of independent datasets confirmed that miR-155 contributed to suppression of its validated mRNA targets Inpp5d, Tspan14, Ptprj and Mafb and induction of Inos, Il1b, Tnfa, Il6 and Il12. Overall, these data indicate that miR-155 plays an essential role in driving the inflammatory phenotype of M1(LPS+ IFN-γ) macrophages."

However, spirituality/religion can be problematic to some patients and cause caregiving difficulties. The objective of this paper was to examine the role of spirituality/religion as a source of strength, resilience and wellbeing among sub-Saharan African (SSA) migrant women with HIV/AIDS. A qualitative study of SSA migrant women was conducted between April 2013 and December 2014. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling and snowball techniques from AIDS Reference Centres and AIDS workshops in Belgium, if they were 18 years and older, French or English speaking, and diagnosed HIV positive more than 3 months beforehand. We conducted semi-structured interviews with patients and did observations during consultations and support groups attendances. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. 44 women were interviewed, of whom 42 were Christians and 2 Muslims. None reported religious/spiritual alienation, though at some point in time many had felt the need to question their relationship with God by asking ""why me?"" A majority reported being more spiritual/religious since being diagnosed HIV positive. Participants believed that prayer, meditation, regular church services and religious activities were the main spiritual/religious resources for achieving connectedness with God. They strongly believed in the power of God in their HIV/AIDS treatment and wellbeing. Spiritual/religious resources including prayer, meditation, church services, religious activities and believing in the power of God helped them cope with HIV/AIDS. These findings highlight the importance of spirituality in physical and mental health and wellbeing among SSA women with HIV/AIDS that should be taken into consideration in providing a caring and healthy environment."

While miR-9 has been characterized as dysregulated either as an oncomiR or tumour suppressor in a variety of other cancers including breast, ovarian, and nasopharyngeal carcinomas, it has not been previously evaluated and proven as an oncomiR in prostate cancer. miR-9 was confirmed an oncomiR when found to be overexpressed in tumour tissue as compared to adjacent benign glandular epithelium through laser-capture microdissection of radical prostatectomy biopsies. Inhibition of miR-9 resulted in reduced migratory and invasive potential of the M12 cell line, and reduced tumour growth and metastases in male athymic nude mice. Analysis showed that miR-9 targets e-cadherin and suppressor of cytokine signalling 5 (SOCS5), but not NF-ĸB mRNA. Expression of these proteins was shown to be affected by modulation in expression of miR-9."

Although there was no clear directional response to climate warming across the entire study area, there was significant region- to region- variation in responses (i.e. from as many as 73% to as few as 32% of species shifting upward). To understand the factors that might be controlling region-specific distributional shifts of plant species, we explored the relationship between the direction of change in distribution limits and the nature of recent climate change. We found that the direction that distribution limits shifted was explained by an interaction between the rate of change in local summer temperatures and seasonal precipitation. Specifically, species were more likely to shift upward at their upper elevational limit when minimum temperatures increased and snowfall was unchanging or declined at slower rates (<0.5 mm/year). This suggests that both low temperature and water availability limit upward shifts at upper elevation limits. By contrast, species were more likely to shift upwards at their lower elevation limit when maximum temperatures increased, but also shifted upwards under conditions of cooling temperatures when precipitation decreased. This suggests increased water stress may drive upward shifts at lower elevation limits. Our results suggest that species’ elevational distribution shifts are not predictable by climate warming alone but depend on the interaction between seasonal temperature and precipitation change."
https://openalex.org/W2482938988,"Urban waste impacts human and environmental health, and waste management has become one of the major challenges of humanity. Concurrently with new directives due to manage this human by-product, illegal dumping has become one of the most lucrative activities of organized crime. Beyond economic fraud, illegal waste disposal strongly enhances uncontrolled dissemination of human pathogens, pollutants and invasive species. Here, we demonstrate the potential of novel real-time GPS tracking of scavenging species to detect environmental crime. Specifically, we were able to detect illegal activities at an officially closed dump, which was visited recurrently by 5 of 19 GPS-tracked yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis). In comparison with conventional land-based surveys, GPS tracking allows a much wider and cost-efficient spatiotemporal coverage, even of the most hazardous sites, while GPS data accessibility through the internet enables rapid intervention. Our results suggest that multi-species guilds of feathered detectives equipped with GPS and cameras could help fight illegal dumping at continental scales. We encourage further experimental studies, to infer waste detection thresholds in gulls and other scavenging species exploiting human waste dumps."
https://openalex.org/W2483895441,"Extreme winter losses of honey bee colonies are a major threat to beekeeping but the combinations of factors underlying colony loss remain debatable. We monitored colonies in two environments (colonies wintered indoors or outdoors) and characterized the effects of two parasitic mites, seven viruses, and Nosema on honey bee colony mortality and population loss over winter. Samples were collected from two locations within hives in fall, mid-winter and spring of 2009/2010. Although fall parasite and pathogen loads were similar in outdoor and indoor-wintered colonies, the outdoor-wintered colonies had greater relative reductions in bee population score over winter. Seasonal patterns in deformed wing virus (DWV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), and Nosema level also differed with the wintering environment. DWV and Nosema levels decreased over winter for indoor-wintered colonies but BQCV did not. Both BQCV and Nosema concentration increased over winter in outdoor-wintered colonies. The mean abundance of Varroa decreased and concentration of Sacbrood virus (SBV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) increased over winter but seasonal patterns were not affected by wintering method. For most viruses, either entrance or brood area samples were reasonable predictors of colony virus load but there were significant season*sample location interactions for Nosema and BQCV, indicating that care must be taken when selecting samples from a single location. For Nosema spp., the fall entrance samples were better predictors of future infestation levels than were fall brood area samples. For indoor-wintered colonies, Israeli acute paralysis virus IAPV concentration was negatively correlated with spring population size. For outdoor-wintered hives, spring Varroa abundance and DWV concentration were positively correlated with bee loss and negatively correlated with spring population size. Multivariate analyses for fall collected samples indicated higher DWV was associated with colony death as did high SBV for spring-collected samples."
https://openalex.org/W2503141557,"Osteoclast differentiation is dependent on the activities of receptor activator NF-kB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Given that RANKL plays a critical role in osteoclast formation and bone resorption, any new compounds found to alter its activity would be predicted to have therapeutic potential for disorders associated with bone loss. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a naturally occurring sulfur compound with well-documented anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; currently its effects on osteoclast differentiation are unknown. We sought to investigate whether MSM could regulate osteoclastogenesis, and if so, its mechanism of action. In this study, we investigated the effects of MSM on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, together with STAT3's involvement in the expression of osteoclastic gene markers. These experiments were conducted using bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) and cell line material, together with analyses that interrogated both protein and mRNA levels, as well as signaling pathway activity. Although MSM was not toxic to osteoclast precursors, MSM markedly inhibited RANKL-induced TRAP activity, multinucleated osteoclast formation, and bone resorptive activity. Additionally, the expression of several osteoclastogenesis-related marker genes, including TRAF6, c-Fos, NFATc1, cathepsin K, and OSCAR were suppressed by MSM. MSM mediated suppression of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis involved inhibition of ITAM signaling effectors such as PLCγ and Syk, with a blockade of NF-kB rather than MAPK activity. Furthermore, MSM inhibited RANKL-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 Ser727. Knockdown of STAT3 using shRNAs resulted in reduced RANKL-mediated phosphorylation of Ser727 STAT3, and TRAF6 in cells for which depletion of STAT3 was confirmed. Additionally, the expression of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenic marker genes were significantly decreased by MSM and STAT3 knockdown. Taken together, these results indicate that STAT3 plays a pivotal role in RANKL-induced osteoclast formation, and that MSM can attenuate RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by blocking both NF-kB and STAT3 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2505731850,"Introduction Cognitive impairment in the euthymic phase is a well-established finding in bipolar disorder. However, its brain structural and/or functional correlates are uncertain. Methods Thirty-three euthymic bipolar patients with preserved memory and executive function and 28 euthymic bipolar patients with significant memory and/or executive impairment, as defined using two test batteries, the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) and the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS), plus 28 healthy controls underwent structural MRI using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Twenty-seven of the cognitively preserved patients, 23 of the cognitively impaired patients and 28 controls also underwent fMRI during performance of the n-back working memory task. Results No clusters of grey or white matter volume difference were found between the two patient groups. During n-back performance, the cognitively impaired patients showed hypoactivation compared to the cognitively preserved patients in a circumscribed region in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Both patient groups showed failure of de-activation in the medial frontal cortex compared to the healthy controls. Conclusions Cognitive impairment in euthymic bipolar patients appears from this study to be unrelated to structural brain abnormality, but there was some evidence for an association with altered prefrontal function."

However, the significance and the factors that sequester heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery are not fully known. Here, we report that an inner nuclear membrane protein complex Lem2-Nur1 is essential for heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing. We found that Lem2 is physically associated with another inner nuclear membrane protein, Nur1, and deletion of either lem2 or nur1 causes silencing defect at centromeres, telomeres, and rDNA loci. We analyzed the genome-wide association of Lem2 using ChIP sequencing and we found that it binds to the central core region of centromeres, in striking contrast to Chp1, a component of pericentromeric heterochromatin, which binds H3K9me-rich chromatin in neighboring sequences. The recruitment of Lem2 and Nur1 to silent regions of the genome is dependent on H3K9 methyltransferase, Clr4. Finally, we show that the Lem2-Nur1 complex regulates the local balance between the underln]Snf2/HDAC-containing repressor complex (SHREC) histone deacetylase complex and the anti-silencing protein Epe1.

Regulation of eukaryotic genome function involves the differential organization of chromatin into euchromatic and heterochromatic domains distinguished on the basis of their appearance, structure, localization and function (1Altaf M.

Cell Biol. 2013; 25: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Heterochromatin is a silent chromatin structure that represses gene expression and recombination to maintain genome integrity. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, heterochromatic loci are restricted to the pericentromeric DNA regions, mating type loci and telomeres. The centromeres are surrounded by DNA repeats that compose an outer repeat (otr) region (containing dg and dh repeats) and innermost repeat (imr) region, which flank the central core (cnt) domain. These repeats are thought to be transposon remnants and are required for centromere assembly and proper chromosome segregation (6Allshire R.C. Ekwall K.

Assembly of heterochromatin in fission yeast requires methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) by the conserved Clr4 methyltransferase. H3K9 methylation requires components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery. RNA transcripts act as a scaffold for the assembly of RNAi and chromatin modifying factors that initiate the formation of heterochromatin. Methylation of H3K9 recruits chromodomain containing HP1 proteins, Swi6 and Chp2, which are critical for heterochromatic gene silencing (9Martienssen R. Moazed D.

Cytological studies have shown that heterochromatin has a tendency to associate within the nuclear periphery, raising the possibility that proximity to the nuclear envelope facilitates heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing (3Mekhail K. Moazed D. The nuclear envelope in genome organization, expression and stability.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 5: 317-328Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Taddei A. Gasser S.M. Structure and function in the budding yeast nucleus.Genetics. 2012; 192: 107-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, for example, telomeres form clusters at the nuclear periphery. Localization of transcriptionally silent domains toward the nuclear periphery has also been observed in budding yeast flies and plants (17Towbin B.D. Meister P. Gasser S.M. The nuclear envelope–a scaffold for silencing?.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2009; 19: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Observations in higher eukaryotes also suggest a role for nuclear periphery in gene silencing. In human cells, gene-poor chromosomes as well as the inactive X chromosome or Barr body tend to localize at the nuclear periphery. In metazoans, lamina-associated domains (lamina-associated domains), which lies beneath the inner nuclear membrane, are enriched for repressed chromatin state (18Amendola M. van Steensel B. Mechanisms and dynamics of nuclear lamina-genome interactions.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 28: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This peripheral association of these domains is linked to repressive H3K9 methylation, a hallmark of repressive chromatin. In humans, lamina-associated domains constitute around 40% of mammalian genome (19Guelen L. Pagie L. Brasset E. Meuleman W. Faza M.B. Talhout W. Eussen B.H. de Klein A.

Similarly, in Caenorhabditis elegans, lamina-associated domains constitute repeat-rich regions, and knockdown of lamina-associated proteins EMR-1 and LEM-2 leads to derepression of perinuclear heterochromatin (21Ikegami K. Egelhofer T.A. Strome S. Lieb J.D.

These studies suggest that attachment of chromosome domains to the nuclear periphery can affect its expression. In support of this, artificial tethering of transcriptionally active loci in yeast and mammals become repressed when tethered to the nuclear periphery (2Towbin B.D. Gonzalez-Sandoval A. Gasser S.M.

Lamins have been shown to interact with several inner nuclear membrane proteins (INM). 2The abbreviations used are: INM, inner nuclear membrane; SHREC, Snf2/HDAC-containing repressor complex; Chip-seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing; 5-FOA, 5-fluoro-orotic acid; TBZ, thiabendazole; qRT, quantitative RT; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TAP, tandem affinity purification. 2The abbreviations used are: INM, inner nuclear membrane; SHREC, Snf2/HDAC-containing repressor complex; Chip-seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing; 5-FOA, 5-fluoro-orotic acid; TBZ, thiabendazole; qRT, quantitative RT; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TAP, tandem affinity purification. Several lamin-associated proteins contain a LEM domain (LAP2-Emerin-MAN1), a 40-amino acid helix-extension-helix motif that is conserved from yeast to humans (23Barton L.J. Soshnev A.A. Geyer P.K. Networking in the nucleus: a spotlight on LEM-domain proteins.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2015; 34: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 24Brachner A. Foisner R. Evolvement of LEM proteins as chromatin tethers at the nuclear periphery.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2011; 39: 1735-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). S. pombe contain three INM (Lem2, Man1, and Ima1) proteins that show homology with lamin-associated proteins (25Mans B. Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Comparative genomics, evolution and origins of the nuclear envelope and nuclear pore complex.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1625-1650Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Lem2 and Man1 contain a helix-extension-helix motif homologous to metazoan LEM domain. Recently, Lem2 and Man1 have been shown to be important for nuclear structure integrity and telomere anchoring with nuclear membrane in fission yeast (26Gonzalez Y. Saito A. Sazer S. Fission yeast Lem2 and Man1 perform fundamental functions of the animal cell nuclear lamina.Nucleus. 2012; 3: 60-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Lem2-Nur1 homologue, Heh1-Nur1 forms a CLIP complex (chromosome linkage INM proteins) that physically links rDNA repeats to nuclear periphery. CLIP is required for the maintenance of rDNA repeat stability and not for their silencing. Deletion of either heh1 or nur1 causes release of rDNA repeats from the nuclear periphery and leads to chromosome instability by promoting aberrant recombination events in the rDNA repeats. In addition, artificial tethering of rDNA repeats to nuclear periphery partially suppresses repeat instability in heh1 or nur1 mutant cells (27Mekhail K. Seebacher J. Gygi S.P. Moazed D. Role for perinuclear chromosome tethering in maintenance of genome stability.Nature. 2008; 456: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although the localization of fission yeast heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery is thought to be important for gene regulation, the functional significance and the factors that sequester heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery are not fully known. Here, we show that inner nuclear membrane protein Lem2 and its interacting partner Nur1 are required for heterochromatin silencing in S. pombe. We found that deletion of lem2 or nur1 causes silencing defects at centromeres, telomeres and at rDNA loci. We further determined the genome-wide localization of Lem2 and demonstrated that it associates specifically with silent regions of the genome in a heterochromatin-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that the Lem2-Nur1 complex regulates the balance between chromatin binding of the histone deacetylase complex Snf2/HDAC-containing repressor complex (SHREC) and anti-silencing protein Epe1. Overall, our results uncover a novel role for the Lem2-Nur1 complex in heterochromatin gene silencing in S. pombe. These findings add a new perspective to the evolutionarily conserved LEM domain proteins and suggest that the mammalian homologues might also play crucial roles in heterochromatin gene silencing. To identify novel factors required for heterochromatin gene silencing and its localization toward the nuclear periphery, we identified two inner nuclear membrane proteins in fission yeast, Lem2, a conserved LEM domain protein, and Nur1, a nuclear rim protein. Homologs of Lem2 and Nur1 in S. cerevisiae have been shown to be required for peripheral localization of heterochromatin but not for silencing (27Mekhail K. Seebacher J. Gygi S.P. Moazed D. Role for perinuclear chromosome tethering in maintenance of genome stability.Nature. 2008; 456: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We used co-immunoprecipitation assays to demonstrate that in fission yeast Lem2 and Nur1 were physically associated. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments from cells that expressed functional C-terminally TAP-tagged Lem2 and C-terminally Myc-tagged Nur1 expressed under the control of their endogenous promoters. As shown in Fig. 1A, Nur1-Myc co-immunoprecipitated with Lem2-TAP. To gain insight about the role of the Lem2-Nur1 complex in heterochromatin gene silencing, we deleted either lem2 or nur1 or both in a strain that has ura4+ reporter inserted at the centromere (Fig. 1B). Deletion of either lem2 or nur1 leads to a loss of gene silencing that is observed with an imr1R::ura4+ reporter gene and a loss of growth on 5-FOA medium (Fig. 1C, 5-FOA is toxic to cells that express ura4+). The silencing phenotypes were verified by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to examine the levels of inserted ura4+ reporter gene (imr1::ura4+) or endogenous heterochromatic transcripts originating from the dg elements of centromeres. clr4Δ, in which heterochromatin is completely disrupted, was used as a positive control. We found that inserted ura4+ and centromeric dg transcripts were derepressed in lem2Δ and nur1Δ cells, although to a lesser extent than in clr4Δ cells (Fig. 1, D and E). Consistent with the silencing and qRT-PCR results, occupancy of polymerase II at the centromeric dg region increased in lem2 and nur1 mutant cells (Fig. 1F). Centromeric heterochromatin is important for chromosome segregation, and any perturbation of centromeric heterochromatin causes defects in chromosome segregation (31Allshire R.C. Nimmo E.R. Ekwall K. Javerzat J.P. Cranston G. Mutations derepressing silent centromeric domains in fission yeast disrupt chromosome segregation.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 218-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 32Volpe T. Schramke V.

RNA interference is required for normal centromere function in fission yeast.Chromosome Res. 2003; 11: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We observed that like clr4Δ cells, lem2Δ and nur1Δ cells showed hypersensitivity to the microtubule-destabilizing drug thiabendazole (TBZ) (Fig. 1G). These results indicate that the Lem2-Nur1 complex is required for heterochromatic gene silencing at pericentromeric heterochromatin. To gain further insight into the role of Lem2-Nur1 in heterochromatin organization, we constructed strains expressing Lem2 or Nur1 with a C-terminal TAP tag. We performed ChIP-seq analysis of Lem2 and Chp1. Interestingly, Lem2 was strictly confined to the central core cnt1 domain and was excluded from the pericentromeric regions, whereas Chp1 was enriched at the outer repeats (Fig. 2, B and C). The ChIP-seq data were further validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-qPCR) experiments at dg and central core regions (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, ChIP analysis of Nur1 showed a similar binding pattern as that of lem2 (Fig. 2, F and G). In addition to centromeres, genome-wide distribution of Lem2 showed that it also associates with other silent regions of the genome-like telomeres and rDNA repeats (Fig. 3, A–D). Similar to pericentromeric heterochromatin, deletion of either Lem2 or Nur1 leads to derepression of telomeres (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, we did not see any enrichment of Lem2 or Nur1 to euchromatin regions of the genome. These findings indicate that regulation of heterochromatin gene silencing by Lem2 and Nur1 is through direct association with centromeric as well as with other silent regions of the genome.FIGURE 3.Lem2 and Nur1 binding to other silent regions of the genome.

Control of heterochromatin localization and silencing by the nuclear membrane protein Lem2.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because Lem2-Nur1 complex specifically localizes to heterochromatic loci, we explored whether Lem2-Nur1 recruitment to heterochromatic loci is dependent on heterochromatin. We constructed strains expressing Lem2 or Nur1 with a C-terminal TAP tag in clr4 deletion background. ChIP-seq analysis revealed deletion of H3K9-specific methyltransferase, Clr4 abolished lem2 localization at centromeres (Fig. 4, A and B), telomeres, and the DNA repeats (data not shown). The ChIP-seq experiments were further verified by ChIP experiments, which showed complete loss of Lem2-Nur1 binding in clr4-deleted cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, effects of mutations in heterochromatin assembly factor Clr4 impairs Lem2-Nur1 recruitment. These observations suggest that heterochromatin serves as a platform for binding of the Lem2 and Nur1 complex, which tethers heterochromatin towards the nuclear periphery that ensures proper silencing. In S. pombe H3K9 methylation is a key event in the formation of heterochromatin. This mark serves as a binding site for Swi6, which plays a critical role in maintaining chromatin structure and ensuring faithful chromosome segregation during cell division (15Verdel A. Jia S.

To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of the Lem2-Nur1 complex in heterochromatin gene silencing, we looked at the effect of deleting lem2 on H3K9me2 and Swi6 enrichment at centromeric heterochromatin. Cells lacking Lem2 displayed a drop in levels of H3K9me2 and Swi6 (Fig. 5, A and B). A similar effect was seen on levels of H3K9me2 and Swi6 in nur1-deleted cells. Because deletion of lem2 and nur1 did not greatly affect H3K9me and Swi6 levels, we speculated whether deletion of lem2 or nur1 impairs the recruitment of other factors that are important for silencing. To test this, we took a candidate-based approach and determined the recruitment of RNAi-linked Snf2-HDAC repressor complex (SHREC) and anti-silencing protein Epe1 in lem2 deletion cells, because these factors have previously been shown to work antagonistically in regulation of heterochromatin gene silencing downstream of H3K9me (35Sugiyama T.

SHREC belongs to Snf2/HDAC repressor complex family and contains the class II HDAC Clr3 that targets lysine 14 of histone H3. Epe1 is a conserved Jumonji C domain nuclear protein that antagonizes heterochromatization. Inactivation of Epe1 enhances reporter gene silencing and promotes heterochromatin spreading across boundary elements, while its overexpression abrogates heterochromatin structure and impairs centromere functions (36Ayoub N. Noma K. Isaac S. Kahan T. Grewal S.I. Cohen A. A novel jmjC domain protein modulates heterochromatization in fission yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4356-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We constructed strains expressing either FLAG-tagged Clr1, a component of SHREC, or FLAG-tagged Epe1 in lem2 deletion cells and looked at binding of SHREC or Epe1 in lem2-deleted cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, we found increased association of Epe1 and decreased SHREC/Clr1 binding in lem2-deleted cells (Fig. 5, C and D). Consistent with the ChIP data, the acetylation levels were greatly increased in cells lacking either lem2 or nur1 (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that Lem2-Nur1 promotes SHREC binding while preventing Epe1 localization at centromeres. The eukaryotic genome within the nucleus is spatially segregated into euchromatin and heterochromatin, with heterochromatin often associated with the nuclear envelope (2Towbin B.D.

This localization is thought to present a sub-compartment enriched for factors required for heterochromatin silencing and with properties distinct from the nuclear interior (12Zhang K. Mosch K.

However, the significance of this peripheral localization in terms of heterochromatin stability and the proteins responsible for this perinuclear sequestration are not fully understood. This study identified and characterized a novel inner nuclear membrane protein complex, Lem2-Nur1, as being essential for heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing in fission yeast. Deletion of either lem2 or nur1 causes silencing defects both at centromeres and at telomeres. Compared with clr4 deletion, where heterochromatin is completely disrupted, lem2- and nur1-deleted cells show significant derepression of transcription within centromeric and telomeric heterochromatin (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 3.). Interestingly, ChIP and ChIP-seq data showed that Lem2 and Nur1 strictly bind to the central core cnt1 domain of centromeres, which is involved in kinetochore assembly and deletion of lem2 and nur1 causes segregation defects possibly through defects in kinetochore assembly (Fig. 1). Interestingly, unlike lem2 and nur1, which are important for tethering and silencing of all the heterochromatin domains in S. pombe, the budding yeast homologs Heh1 and Nur1, which forms the CLIP complex are implicated in tethering and stability of rDNA repeats and not in silencing. It would be interesting to investigate whether the Lem2-Nur2 complex in S. pombe does play a role in stability of rDNA repeats. Even though tethering and silencing have been mechanistically separated from each other, both processes reinforce each other (16Taddei A. Gasser S.M. Structure and function in the budding yeast nucleus.Genetics. 2012; 192: 107-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 45Gonzalez-Sandoval A. Towbin B.D. Kalck V. Cabianca D.S. Gaidatzis D.

Perinuclear anchoring of H3K9-methylated chromatin stabilizes induced cell fate in C. elegans embryos.Cell. 2015; 163: 1333-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Indeed, the mechanisms used for the recruitment are often epigenetic marks established during heterochromatin formation. In case of budding yeast, deacetylation of histone H4 is necessary for SIR protein recruitment. Similarly, in C. elegans, methylation of H3K9 is required for SET-25 localization with peripheral heterochromatin (2Towbin B.D. Gonzalez-Sandoval A. Gasser S.M. Mechanisms of heterochromatin subnuclear localization.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 356-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 46Towbin B.D. González-Aguilera C.

Step-wise methylation of histone H3K9 positions heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery.Cell. 2012; 150: 934-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In tune with the above findings, Lem2-Nur1 recruitment to repressive chromatin depends on heterochromatin (Fig. 4). On the mechanistic level, the function of Lem2-Nur1 involves the recruitment of the repressor complex SHREC to heterochromatin, which contributes to repression. SHREC is the Snf2-HDAC-containing repressor complex, which deacetylates histone H3 and H4 and remodels chromatin structure at heterochromatic regions, resulting in transcriptional gene silencing and heterochromatin spreading (Fig. 6) (35Sugiyama T. Cam H.P. Sugiyama R. Noma K. Zofall M. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. SHREC, an effector complex for heterochromatic transcriptional silencing.Cell. 2007; 128: 491-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Deletion of lem2 or nur1 causes an increase in binding of Epe1, a Jumonji C domain protein that blocks spreading of H3K9me at heterochromatic barriers (36Ayoub N. Noma K. Isaac S. Kahan T. Grewal S.I. Cohen A. A novel jmjC domain protein modulates heterochromatization in fission yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4356-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Epe1 counteracts SHREC and targeting of Epe1 causes an increase in transcription at heterochromatin and a defect in heterochromatin spreading. Furthermore, loss of lem2 or nur1 increases the acetylation levels at the silent regions (Fig. 5C). An independent study also found Lem2 being essential for silencing and heterochromatin localization to nuclear periphery. It demonstrated that silencing by Lem2 is epistatic with SHREC and opposes the function of anti-silencing protein Epe1. Furthermore, it elegantly shows that Lem2 collaborates with multiple factors like Csi1 to ensure proper heterochromatin silencing and its localization at the nuclear periphery (34Barrales R.R. Forn M. Georgescu P.R. Sarkadi Z. Braun S. Control of heterochromatin localization and silencing by the nuclear membrane protein Lem2.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Regulation of SHREC and Epe1 binding by Lem2-Nur1 adds an unexpected functional layer in the regulation of heterochromatin silencing. We speculate that Clr4 mediated methylation of H3K9 and subsequent binding of Swi6 to methylated histones localizes heterochromatin to the nuclear periphery. Localization to the nuclear periphery depends on interaction with the inner nuclear membrane protein complex Lem2-Nur1, which then regulates binding of SHREC (Fig. 6). Given the evolutionary conservation of Lem2-Nur1, the mechanism described here may represent a widespread strategy for fine-tuning transcriptional gene silencing by localization of heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery. In summary, we uncovered a multistep mechanism of heterochromatin gene silencing mediated by Clr4-dependent chromatin binding of Lem2-Nur1. Lem2-Nur1 regulates silencing by ensuring appropriate balance between binding of repressing SHREC and activating Epe1 factors. These factors modulate the levels of repressive and activating histone post-translational modifications which in turn affect gene silencing.

Cells were cross-linked with 10 mm dimethyl adipimidate and subsequently with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and quenched with 125 mm glycine for 5 min. Cross-linked chromatin was sonicated to yield DNA fragments of an average size of 200–500 bp. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with anti-TAP (Applied Biosystems), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), and diMeH3K9 antibody (Abcam). Primers used in the PCRs were analyzed for linearity range and efficiency with a LightCycler (Applied Biosystems) to accurately evaluate occupancy (% of immunoprecipitation/input). The results shown with standard errors are based on three independent experiments. For ChIP-seq experiments, libraries for Illumina sequencing were constructed following the manufacturer's protocols, starting with ∼5 ng of immunoprecipitated DNA fragments. Each library was generated with custom-made adaptors carrying unique barcode sequences at the ligating end (30Wong K.H. Struhl K.

Bar-coded libraries were mixed and sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2000. Raw reads were separated according to their barcodes and mapped to the S. pombe genome using Bowtie. Mapped reads were normalized to reads per million and visualized in IGV. Silencing assays were performed from overnight cultures grown in 5 ml of YEA (yeast extract supplemented with adenine). 10-Fold serial dilutions were made so that the highest density spot contained 1.2 × 105 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2480182681,"This study investigated whether treatment naïve adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; n = 33; 19 female) differed from healthy controls (n = 31; 17 female) in behavioral performance, event-related potential (ERP) indices of preparatory attention (CueP3 and late CNV), and reactive response control (Go P3, NoGo N2, and NoGo P3) derived from a visual cued Go/NoGo task. On several critical measures, Cue P3, late CNV, and NoGo N2, there were no significant differences between the groups. This indicated normal preparatory processes and conflict monitoring in ADHD patients. However, the patients had attenuated Go P3 and NoGoP3 amplitudes relative to controls, suggesting reduced allocation of attentional resources to processes involved in response control. The patients also had a higher rate of Go signal omission errors, but no other performance decrements compared with controls. Reduced Go P3 and NoGo P3 amplitudes were associated with poorer task performance, particularly in the ADHD group. Notably, the ERPs were not associated with self-reported mood or anxiety. The results provide electrophysiological evidence for reduced effortful engagement of attentional resources to both Go and NoGo signals when reactive response control is needed. The absence of group differences in ERP components indexing proactive control points to impairments in specific aspects of cognitive processes in an untreated adult ADHD cohort. The associations between ERPs and task performance provided additional support for the altered electrophysiological responses."

We developed two primary a priori hypotheses to examine relationships between three categories of wading bird prey biomass and covariates hypothesized to affect the concentration of aquatic fauna, a pulsed resource for breeding wading bird populations during the dry season. The fish concentration hypothesis proposed that local-scale processes concentrate wet-season fish biomass into patches in the dry season, whereas the fish production hypothesis states that the amount of dry-season fish biomass reflects fish biomass production during the preceding wet season. We sampled prey in drying pools at 405 sites throughout the Florida Everglades between December and May from 2006–2010 to test these hypotheses. The models that explained variation in dry-season fish biomass included water-level recession rate, wet-season biomass, microtopography, submerged vegetation, and the interaction between wet-season biomass and recession rate. Crayfish (Procambarus spp.) biomass was positively associated with wet-season crayfish biomass, moderate water depth, dense submerged aquatic vegetation, thin flocculent layer and a short interval of time since the last dry-down. Grass shrimp (Palaemonetes paludosus) biomass increased with increasing rates of water level recession, supporting our impression that shrimp, like fish, form seasonal concentrations. Strong support for wet-season fish and crayfish biomass in the top models confirmed the importance of wet-season standing stock to concentrations of fish and crayfish the following dry season. Additionally, the importance of recession rate and microtopography showed that local scale abiotic factors transformed fish production into the high quality foraging patches on which apex predators depended."
https://openalex.org/W2494301194,"Quantifying and predicting the antigenic characteristics of a virus is something of a holy grail for infectious disease research because of its central importance to the emergence of new strains, the severity of outbreaks, and vaccine selection. However, these characteristics are defined by a complex interplay of viral and host factors so that phylogenetic measures of viral similarity are often poorly correlated to antigenic relationships. Here, we generate antigenic phylogenies that track the phenotypic evolution of two serotypes of foot-and-mouth disease virus by combining host serology and viral sequence data to identify sites that are critical to their antigenic evolution. For serotype SAT1, we validate our antigenic phylogeny against monoclonal antibody escape mutants, which match all of the predicted antigenic sites. For serotype O, we validate it against known sites where available, and otherwise directly evaluate the impact on antigenic phenotype of substitutions in predicted sites using reverse genetics and serology. We also highlight a critical and poorly understood problem for vaccine selection by revealing qualitative differences between assays that are often used interchangeably to determine antigenic match between field viruses and vaccine strains. Our approach provides a tool to identify naturally occurring antigenic substitutions, allowing us to track the genetic diversification and associated antigenic evolution of the virus. Despite the hugely important role vaccines have played in enhancing human and animal health, vaccinology remains a conspicuously empirical science. This study advances the field by providing guidance for tuning vaccine strains via site-directed mutagenesis through this high-resolution tracking of antigenic evolution of the virus between rare major shifts in phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2503941830,"Serine carboxypeptidase (SCP) is one of the largest groups of enzymes catalyzing proteolysis for functional protein maturation. To date, little is known about the function of SCPs in rice. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the gene structure and expression profile of 59 rice SCPs. SCP46 is dominantly expressed in developing seeds, particularly in embryo, endosperm and aleurone layers, and could be induced by ABA. Functional characterization revealed that knock-down of SCP46 resulted in smaller grain size and enhanced seed germination. Furthermore, scp46 seed germination became less sensitive to the ABA inhibition than the Wild-type did; suggesting SCP46 is involved in ABA signaling. As indicated by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis, numerous grain filling and seed dormancy related genes, such as SP, VP1 and AGPs were down-regulated in scp46. Yeast-two-hybrid assay also showed that SCP46 interacts with another ABA-inducible protein DI19-1. Taken together, we suggested that SCP46 is a master regulator of grain filling and seed germination, possibly via participating in the ABA signaling. The results of this study shed novel light into the roles of SCPs in rice."

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a major mediator of the stress response in the brain-gut axis, but it is not clear how CRH agonists change human brain responses to interoceptive stimuli. We tested the hypothesis that brain activation in response to colorectal distention is enhanced after CRH injection in IBS patients compared to healthy controls. Brain H215O- positron emission tomography (PET) was performed in 16 male IBS patients and 16 age-matched male controls during baseline, no distention, mild and intense distention of the colorectum using barostat bag inflation. Either CRH (2 μg/kg) or saline (1:1) was then injected intravenously and the same distention protocol was repeated. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), serum cortisol and plasma noradrenaline levels were measured at each stimulation. At baseline, CRH without colorectal distention induced more activation in the right amygdala in IBS patients than in controls. During intense distention after CRH injection, controls showed significantly greater activation than IBS patients in the right amygdala. Plasma ACTH and serum cortisol secretion showed a significant interaction between drug (CRH, saline) and distention. Plasma noradrenaline at baseline significantly increased after CRH injection compared to before injection in IBS. Further, plasma noradrenaline showed a significant group (IBS, controls) by drug by distention interaction. Exogenous CRH differentially sensitizes brain regions of the emotional-arousal circuitry within the visceral pain matrix to colorectal distention and synergetic activation of noradrenergic function in IBS patients and healthy individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2496342985,"Subtilisin-like serine proteases (SBTs) are extracellular proteases that depend on their propeptides for zymogen maturation and activation. The function of propeptides in plant SBTs is poorly understood and was analyzed here for the propeptide of tomato subtilase 3 (SBT3PP). SBT3PP was found to be required as an intramolecular chaperone for zymogen maturation and secretion of SBT3 in vivo Secretion was impaired in a propeptide-deletion mutant but could be restored by co-expression of the propeptide in trans SBT3 was inhibited by SBT3PP with a Kd of 74 nm for the enzyme-inhibitor complex. With a melting point of 87 °C, thermal stability of the complex was substantially increased as compared with the free protease suggesting that propeptide binding stabilizes the structure of SBT3. Even closely related propeptides from other plant SBTs could not substitute for SBT3PP as a folding assistant or autoinhibitor, revealing high specificity for the SBT3-SBT3PP interaction. Separation of the chaperone and inhibitor functions of SBT3PP in a domain-swap experiment indicated that they are mediated by different regions of the propeptide and, hence, different modes of interaction with SBT3. Release of active SBT3 from the autoinhibited complex relied on a pH-dependent cleavage of the propeptide at Asn-38 and Asp-54. The remarkable stability of the autoinhibited complex and pH dependence of the secondary cleavage provide means for stringent control of SBT3 activity, to ensure that the active enzyme is not released before it reaches the acidic environment of the trans-Golgi network or its final destination in the cell wall."

In this study, we investigated the potential role of KLF13 as a downstream effector of GR action utilizing both in vivo and in vitro approaches. Our data show that KLF13 mRNA and protein levels are significantly diminished in the hearts of mice lacking GR in cardiomyocytes. Glucocorticoid administration up-regulated Klf13 mRNA in the mouse heart, in isolated primary cardiomyocytes, and in immortal cardiomyocyte cell lines. Glucocorticoid Klf13 gene expression was abolished by treatment with a GR antagonist (RU486) or by knockdown of GR in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, glucocorticoid induction of Klf13 mRNA was resistant to de novo protein synthesis inhibition, demonstrating that Klf13 is a direct glucocorticoid receptor gene target. A glucocorticoid responsive element (GRE) was identified in the Klf13 gene and its function was verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation in HL-1 cells and mouse hearts. Functional studies showed that GR regulation of Klf13 is critical to protect cardiomyocytes from DNA damage and cell death induced by cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O) and the antineoplastic drug doxorubicin. These results established a novel role for GR and KLF13 signaling in adult cardiomyocytes with potential clinical implications for the prevention of cardiotoxicity induced heart failure.

https://openalex.org/W2482322884,"Objective This study investigated the associations between physical activity and the prevalence of obesity determined by waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and body mass index (BMI). Methods This is the first study to our knowledge on physical activity and obesity using a nationally representative sample of South Korean population from The Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We categorized individuals into either non-obese or obese defined by WHtR and BMI. Levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were classified as ‘Inactive’, ‘Active’, and ‘Very active’ groups based on the World Health Organization physical activity guidelines. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the associations between physical activity and the prevalence of obesity. Results Physical activity was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of obesity using both WHtR and BMI. Compared to inactive men, odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for obesity by WHtR ≥0.50 were 0.69 (0.53–0.89) in active men and 0.76 (0.63–0.91) in very active men (p for trend = 0.007). The ORs (95% CIs) for obesity by BMI ≥25 kg/m2 were 0.78 (0.59–1.03) in active men and 0.82 (0.67–0.99) in very active men (p for trend = 0.060). The ORs (95% CIs) for obesity by BMI ≥30 kg/m2 were 0.40 (0.15–0.98) in active men and 0.90 (0.52–1.56) in very active men (p for trend = 0.978). Compared to inactive women, the ORs (95% CIs) for obesity by WHtR ≥0.50 were 0.94 (0.75–1.18) in active women and 0.84 (0.71–0.998) in very active women (p for trend = 0.046). However, no significant associations were found between physical activity and obesity by BMI in women. Conclusions We found more significant associations between physical activity and obesity defined by WHtR than BMI. However, intervention studies are warranted to investigate and compare causal associations between physical activity and different obesity measures in various populations."
https://openalex.org/W2479621399,"Substituting sugar-free for sugar-sweetened beverages reduces weight gain. This effect may be more pronounced in children with a high body mass index (BMI) because their sensing of kilocalories might be compromised. We investigated the impact of sugar-free versus sugary drinks separately in children with a higher and a lower initial BMI z score, and predicted caloric intakes and degree of compensation in the two groups.This is a secondary, explorative analysis of our double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) which showed that replacement of one 250-mL sugary drink per day by a sugar-free drink for 18 months significantly reduced weight gain. In the 477 children who completed the trial, mean initial weights were close to the Dutch average. Only 16% were overweight and 3% obese. Weight changes were expressed as BMI z-score, i.e. as standard deviations of the BMI distribution per age and sex group. We designated the 239 children with an initial BMI z-score below the median as 'lower BMI' and the 238 children above the median as 'higher BMI'. The difference in caloric intake from experimental beverages between treatments was 86 kcal/day both in the lower and in the higher BMI group. We used a multiple linear regression and the coefficient of the interaction term (initial BMI group times treatment), indicated whether children with a lower BMI responded differently from children with a higher BMI. Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05. Relative to the sugar sweetened beverage, consumption of the sugar-free beverage for 18 months reduced the BMI z-score by 0.05 SD units within the lower BMI group and by 0.21 SD within the higher BMI group. Body weight gain was reduced by 0.62 kg in the lower BMI group and by 1.53 kg in the higher BMI group. Thus the treatment reduced the BMI z-score by 0.16 SD units more in the higher BMI group than in the lower BMI group (p = 0.04; 95% CI -0.31 to -0.01). The impact of the intervention on body weight gain differed by 0.90 kg between BMI groups (p = 0.09; 95% CI -1.95 to 0.14). In addition, we used a physiologically-based model of growth and energy balance to estimate the degree to which children had compensated for the covertly removed sugar kilocalories by increasing their intake of other foods. The model predicts that children with a lower BMI had compensated 65% (95% CI 28 to 102) of the covertly removed sugar kilocalories, whereas children with a higher BMI compensated only 13% (95% CI -37 to 63).The children with a BMI above the median might have a reduced tendency to compensate for changes in caloric intake. Differences in these subconscious compensatory mechanisms may be an important cause of differences in the tendency to gain weight. If further research bears this out, cutting down on the intake of sugar-sweetened drinks may benefit a large proportion of children, especially those who show a tendency to become overweight.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00893529."
https://openalex.org/W2499736488,"After traumatic spinal cord injury, an acute phase triggered by trauma is followed by a subacute phase involving inflammatory processes. We previously demonstrated that peripheral serum cytokine expression changes depend on neurological outcome after spinal cord injury. In a subsequent intermediate phase, repair and remodeling takes place under the mediation of growth factors such as Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 is a promising growth factor which is thought to act as a neuroprotective agent. Since previous findings were taken from animal studies, our aim was to investigate this hypothesis in humans based on peripheral blood serum. Forty-five patients after traumatic spinal cord injury were investigated over a period of three months after trauma. Blood samples were taken according to a fixed schema and IGF-1 levels were determined. Clinical data including AIS scores at admission to the hospital and at discharge were collected and compared with IGF-1 levels. In our study, we could observe distinct patterns in the expression of IGF-1 in peripheral blood serum after traumatic spinal cord injury regardless of the degree of plegia. All patients showed a marked increase of levels seven days after injury. IGF-1 serum levels were significantly different from initial measurements at four and nine hours and seven and 14 days after injury, as well as one, two and three months after injury. We did not detect a significant correlation between fracture and the IGF-1 serum level nor between the quantity of operations performed after trauma and the IGF-1 serum level. Patients with clinically documented neurological remission showed consistently higher IGF-1 levels than patients without neurological remission. This data could be the base for the establishment of animal models for further and much needed research in the field of spinal cord injury."

How these interactions facilitate these dynamic processes is still being actively investigated.

Cell migration is an essential physiological function that is tightly regulated in numerous biological processes, including development, tissue remodeling, wound healing, and tumor metastasis (1Chen J.

These processes require coordination of dynamic reorganization between the actin filaments and microtubules. Cortactin (CTN) 6The abbreviations used are: CTN, cortactin; SH3, Src homology 3; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; +TIP, plus end tracking protein; EB, end-binding; PACF, photoactivatable complementary fluorescent; N-WASP, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. is a multidomain-containing scaffold protein that consists of an N-terminal acidic domain, six and a half tandem repeats, an α helix, a proline-rich region, and an Src Homology (SH3) domain at its C terminus (3Cosen-Binker L.I. Kapus A. Cortactin: the gray eminence of the cytoskeleton.Physiology. 2006; 21: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). CTN is an important scaffold for promoting the polymerization and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (4Murphy D.A. Courtneidge S.A. The “ins” and “outs” of podosomes and invadopodia: characteristics, formation and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Functionally, CTN, distributed at protrusions and the leading edges, is necessary for cell migration by regulating intercellular adhesion and cell spreading (5MacGrath S.M. Koleske A.J. Cortactin in cell migration and cancer at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 1621-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Importantly, CTN is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues in response to growth factor receptors, which regulates cell migration (6Lua B.L. Low B.C. Cortactin phosphorylation as a switch for actin cytoskeletal network and cell dynamics control.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Microtubules, one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton, are required for maintaining the physical and plastic properties of migrating cells (7Watanabe T. Noritake J. Kaibuchi K. Regulation of microtubules in cell migration.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 76-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The plus ends of microtubules extend into the cell peripheral regions, dynamically switching between growing and shortening phases (8Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Dynamic instability of microtubule growth.Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar). The cytoskeletal interactions controlling cell migration are mediated by mechanisms that promote dynamic regulation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (9Kaverina I. Straube A. Regulation of cell migration by dynamic microtubules.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 22: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that MAP-dependent regulatory pathways control cell migration by stimulating actin polymerization at the leading edge of migrating cells and, through the modulation of dynamic cell adhesion properties, regulate both the stabilization and disassembly of focal adhesion complexes (10Stehbens S. Wittmann T. Targeting and transport: how microtubules control focal adhesion dynamics.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 198: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Focal adhesion complexes are initiated outside of the cell by binding to the extracellular matrix, where they mechanically connect the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton and provide the anchor points required for cell migration (1Chen J.

Migrating cells organize a dynamic extracellular matrix, activate proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src based on extracellular matrix stiffness, and synergize various organelle dynamics (12Calvo F.

Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). One group of MAPs regulates microtubule dynamics and interactions within cells via their localization at the plus ends of microtubules, which are called microtubule plus end tracking proteins (+TIPs) (13Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Tracking the ends: a dynamic protein network controls the fate of microtubule tips.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). +TIPs have been identified based on their actual localization at the growing ends of microtubules and their regulation by virtual interactions with the end-binding (EB) family of +TIP proteins. Our early studies revealed that TIP150 is an EB1-based microtubule plus end tracking protein necessary for accurate microtubule-kinetochore attachment during cell division (14Jiang K. Wang J. Liu J.

Our recent work showed that TIP150 is required for dynamic microtubule-plasma membrane interaction during entosis (16Xia P. Zhou J. Song X. Wu B. Liu X. Li D. Zhang S. Wang Z. Yu H. Ward T. Zhang J.

Linkage of microtubule plus ends with the cell cortex is required for directional cell migration. However, the functionality and mechanistic role of TIP150 in cell migration remain unclear. In this study, we identify that TIP150 directly associates with the actin-binding protein, CTN, via its C-terminal proline-rich region (CT150). Interestingly, the CT150 associates with the SH3 domain of CTN, and the interaction is negatively regulated by EGF-elicited tyrosine phosphorylation of CTN. Moreover, suppression of either TIP150 or CTN inhibited directional cell migration. Perturbation of the TIP150-CTN interaction using a membrane-permeable peptide, CT150, inhibited cell migration. Thus, our study suggested that the TIP150-CTN interaction orchestrates directional cell migration via linking dynamic microtubule plus ends to the cortical cytoskeleton. Our previous studies have revealed the functional importance of TIP150 in kinetochore and microtubule plus end dynamics during mitosis and entosis (14Jiang K. Wang J. Liu J. Ward T. Wordeman L.

Cell Biol. 2014; 6: 240-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because TIP150 protein levels remain unchanged during the cell cycle, we sought to examine the role of TIP150 in interphase cells. To study the molecular association of TIP150 with other microtubule end-binding proteins, we carried out an affinity isolation of a TIP150-containing protein complex followed by mass spectrometric identification of tryptic peptides derived from the individually sliced bands as described previously (17Fang Z. Miao Y. Ding X. Deng H. Liu S. Wang F. Zhou R. Watson C. Fu C. Hu Q. Lillard Jr., J.W. Powell M. Chen Y. Forte J.G. Yao X.

As shown in Fig. 1A, anti-TIP150 affinity beads covalently coupled to an anti-TIP150 antibody isolated a major polypeptide of 150 kDa in addition to three visible bands of polypeptides with approximate masses of 73, 55, and 25 kDa (lane 2). The 150-kDa polypeptide was absent from control IgG affinity matrix isolation (Fig. 1A, lane 1) and was confirmed as 150 kDa based on mass spectrometry and Western blotting analyses. Our mass spectrometric analyses identified the 73-kDa polypeptide as CTN, a characterized cortical actin-binding protein interacting with Grb2 in cell migration and cellular polarity establishment (19Crostella L. Lidder S. Williams R. Skouteris G.G.

Cell. 2003; 14: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Western blotting analyses validated that the microtubule plus end protein EB1 also existed in the immunoprecipitates of TIP150, whereas the actin-binding protein ezrin was absent (Fig. 1B). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation using an anti-CTN antibody confirmed that TIP150 forms a cognate complex with CTN (Fig. 1C, lane 3, second panel). Ezrin was absent in the CTN immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C, lane 3, third panel), suggesting that the CTN-TIP150 interaction is selective. As a positive control, Grb2 was retained by CTN immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1C, lane 3, fourth panel). Consistently, the TIP150-CTN interaction also occurs in MCF7 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1, D and E). Thus, we conclude that TIP150 forms a cognate complex with CTN in interphase cells. The cortical cytoskeleton constitutes an important subcellular structure that determines cell shape and orchestrates cellular dynamics. CTN is an actin-binding protein located at the cortical cytoskeleton for integration of diverse signaling pathways. The identification of CTN in the TIP150 protein complex prompted us to examine the distribution profiles of TIP150 and CTN in interphase cells. To validate the hypothesis, we carried out immunofluorescence microscopic analyses of MDA-MB-231 cells triple-stained for CTN (red), TIP150 (green), and microtubules (blue). As shown in Fig. 1F, b‘, green, TIP150 distributes in the cytoplasm of interphase MDA-MB-231 cells and appears as comet-like structures, reminiscent of microtubule plus ends. Careful examination revealed a brief localization of TIP150 around plasma membrane regions reminiscent of membrane ruffle structures (Fig. 1F, b‘, arrowheads). Surprisingly, this membrane ruffle-like localization of TIP150 is partially superimposed onto that of CTN signal (Fig. 1F, red), as shown in the magnified montage of triple color merged images (Fig. 1F, d”, arrowheads). Thus, we conclude that TIP150 interacts and co-distributes with CTN near the plasma membrane in interphase cells. CTN is a signaling scaffold molecule containing several structural modules that facilitate the orchestration of protein-protein interactions underlying the signaling cascade during cell polarity establishment and cell migration. On the other hand, TIP150 also contains structural determinants essential for interacting with EB1 (14Jiang K. Wang J. Liu J. Ward T. Wordeman L. Davidson A. Wang F. Yao X. TIP150 interacts with and targets MCAK at the microtubule plus ends.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that TIP150 physically interacts with CTN and that the binding interface and perhaps structural determinants could be uncovered by biochemical characterization. To test this hypothesis, we designed a series of deletion mutants of TIP150 and CTN according to their structural features (Fig. 2, A and Fig. B) and expressed those proteins tagged with GFP in HEK293T cells. To first determine the specificity of TIP150-CTN interaction, aliquots of HEK293T cells were transiently transfected to express FLAG-TIP150 with GFP-tagged IQGAP1 (GFP-IQ1), N-WASP (GFP-WASP), CTN (GFP-CTN), and GFP alone. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation using M2 affinity matrix followed by anti-GFP blotting analyses confirmed that FLAG-TIP150 forms a cognate complex with GFP-CTN (Fig. 2C, lane 7, top panel). Neither IQGAP1 nor N-WASP was present in the FLAG-TIP150 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6, top panel), confirming that the CTN-TIP150 interaction is selective. To further evaluate the physical interaction and pinpoint the regions of TIP150 involved in the interaction, we carried out a pulldown assay using GST-CTN as an affinity matrix to absorb the GFP-TIP150 and its deletion mutants from HEK293T cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 2D, right panel, lanes 15–18, Western blotting analyses with a monoclonal antibody of GFP demonstrated that the GFP fusion proteins containing the C-terminal TIP150, in addition to full-length GFP-TIP150, were readily retained on GST-CTN matrix. The N-terminal domain also exhibited weak binding activity toward CTN (Fig. 2D, right panel, lane 12). To pinpoint the precise region of CTN involved in TIP150 binding, we expressed recombinant GST-CTN and its deletion mutants in bacteria. Purified GST-CTN proteins (full-length, N terminus, and C terminus) were used as affinity matrices to absorb the GFP-TIP150 from HEK293T cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 2E, top panel, lanes 6–7, Western blotting analysis with an anti-GFP antibody indicated that the TIP150 binds to the C-terminal domain of CTN. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel showed the quality of purified GST-CTN proteins (Fig. 2E, bottom panel). To define the exact domain(s) essential for their physical interaction, we carried out an additional GST pulldown assay using fine deletion mutants of CTN as affinity matrices to absorb GFP-TIP150 from HEK293T cell lysates. Immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody confirmed that GFP-TIP150 was retained on GST-CTN, indicating a direct interaction between the CTN SH3 domain and the TIP150 C-terminal (amino acids 898–1110) in vitro (Fig. 3B, lane 5, and D, lane 21). The EB1-binding domain alone exhibited no detectable binding activity toward CTN protein (Fig. 3D, lane 17). Thus, we conclude that TIP150 directly interacts with the CTN SH3 domain through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Phosphorylation of CTN regulates its activity, including its ability to promote actin polymerization and cell migration (21Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. The role of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in the locomotion of endothelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In particular, CTN is phosphorylated on tyrosines 421, 466, and 482 in response to EGF stimulation (22Head J.A. Jiang D. Li M. Zorn L.J. Schaefer E.M. Parsons J.T. Weed S.A. Cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation requires Rac1 activity and association with the cortical actin cytoskeleton.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3216-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cell motility could be inhibited by truncating the N-terminal F-actin binding domains of CTN or by blocking tyrosine phosphorylation mutation sites (Y421F/Y466F/Y482F, non-phosphorylatable) (23Wang W. Liu Y. Liao K. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by the FAK-Src complex at focal adhesions regulates cell motility.BMC Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Next we tested whether EGF stimulation modulates TIP150-CTN interaction in cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min after serum starvation of 8 h. The cell lysates were then incubated with TIP150 affinity matrix beads. The results showed that the TIP150-CTN association in MDA-MB-231 cells was reduced by EGF stimulation (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, mutation of CTN phosphorylation sites (Y421E/Y466E/Y482E, phosphomimetic mutants) have been shown to reduce the ability to interact with focal adhesion kinase and promote cell migration (23Wang W. Liu Y. Liao K. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by the FAK-Src complex at focal adhesions regulates cell motility.BMC Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We sought to investigate whether mutations at these phosphorylation sites had any effect on TIP150 interaction. To determine whether the phospho-mimicking mutants modulate the TIP150 interaction with CTN, we used anti-GFP antibody to probe GFP-TIP150 bound to the affinity beads preloaded with GST-CTN and a triple site mutation: GST-CTNY421F/Y466F/Y482F (Fig. 3F, 3Y/F) and GST-CTNY421D/Y466D/Y482D (Fig. 3F, 3Y/D). Quantitatively, the relative binding efficiency of TIP150 was significantly less, p < 0.001, when tyrosine was changed to aspartic acid, mimicking the phosphorylated form of CTN (Fig. 3G), suggesting that reversible phosphorylation may regulate the dynamic interaction between TIP150 and CTN. The C-terminal region of CTN contains a series of tyrosine residues: 421, 466, 482, 497, 499, and 541, which are conserved between mouse and human (24Wang W. Chen L. Ding Y. Jin J. Liao K. Centrosome separation driven by actin-microfilaments during mitosis is mediated by centrosome-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1334-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of CTN on the TIP150-CTN interaction, we carried out another pulldown assay using GST-CTN phosphorylation mutants as affinity matrices. As shown in Fig. 3H, FLAG-TIP150 from HEK293T cell extracts directly bound to GST-CTNY497F, GST-CTNY499F, and GST-CTNY541F but not to GST-CTNY497D, GST-CTNY499D, or GST-CTNY541D (lanes 3–5 and lanes 6–8, respectively). We compared the relative binding efficiency of TIP150 to wild-type CTN and its phosphorylation-mimicking forms and found that TIP150 exhibited no apparent difference in binding to wild-type CTN and non-phosphorylatable mutants. However, the binding of TIP150 to phospho-mimicking CTN was impaired (Fig. 3H, lanes 6–8). Quantitative analyses showed that GST-CTNY497D binding of TIP150 was reduced by half. GST-CTNY499D and GST-CTNY541D virtually lost their binding to TIP150 (Fig. 3I), suggesting that these sites are major residues essential for TIP150-CTN interactions. Several microtubule plus end tracking proteins have been reported to modulate cell migration by different mechanisms (7Watanabe T. Noritake J. Kaibuchi K. Regulation of microtubules in cell migration.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 76-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 13Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Tracking the ends: a dynamic protein network controls the fate of microtubule tips.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Our immunofluorescence microscopic analyses show that TIP150 co-distributes with CTN near the plasma membrane in interphase cells (Fig. 1F). To examine the possible function of endogenous TIP150 and TIP150-CTN interactions in cell migration, we sought to suppress TIP150 and CTN in MDA-MB-231 cells using the indicated shRNAs. Because EB1 is involved in cell migration (25Wen Y. Eng C.H. Schmoranzer J. Cabrera-Poch N. Morris E.J. Chen M. Wallar B.J. Alberts A.S. Gundersen G.G. EB1 and APC bind to mDia to stabilize microtubules downstream of Rho and promote cell migration.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), we included EB1 as a positive control. Western blotting analysis revealed that TIP150 was efficiently depleted by specific shRNAs but not by scrambled sequences, whereas the protein levels of tubulin and EB1 were unaffected (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Our quantitative analyses showed knockdown efficiencies of 86% and 91% for TIP150 and EB1, respectively (Fig. 4B). To probe whether TIP150 is involved in cell migration, we used wound healing assays to judge whether suppression of TIP150 alters the cell dynamics. Specifically, aliquots of MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with TIP150 shRNAs, followed by starvation and a linear scratch generated by a sterile pipette tip as described previously (26Zhang L. Shao H. Zhu T. Xia P. Wang Z. Liu L. Yan M. Hill D.L. Fang G. Chen Z. Wang D. Yao X. DDA3 associates with microtubule plus ends and orchestrates microtubule dynamics and directional cell migration.Sci. Rep. 2013; 3: 1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, suppression of TIP150 protein inhibited cell migration, as determined by the wound healing assay. Our quantitative analyses showed that suppression of TIP150 alone, EB1 alone, or combined suppression of EB1 and TIP150 proteins reduced the relative migration rate to 46.2%, 47.9%, and 39.4%, respectively, compared with that of the scrambled shRNA (Fig. 4D). These results demonstrate that TIP150 functions in cell migration. After demonstrating the involvement of TIP150 in cell migration, we next examined whether CTN is involved in cell migration. As shown in Fig. 4, E and F, Western blotting analyses revealed that CTN was efficiently depleted by specific shRNAs but not by the scramble sequences, whereas the protein levels of tubulin were unaffected (Fig. 4E, lanes 3 and 4). As shown in Fig. 4G, suppression of CTN protein inhibited cell migration, as determined by the wound healing assay. Our quantitative analyses show that suppression of CTN alone, TIP150 alone, or combined suppression of CTN and TIP150 reduced the relative migration rate to 41.3%, 49.2%, and 34.1%, respectively, compared with that of the scrambled shRNA (Fig. 4H). These results suggest that endogenous CTN and TIP150 are regulators responsible for the EGF-stimulated cell migration. To further validate our results at the single-cell level, MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with mCherry-tagged control shRNA or TIP150 shRNA were starved and then stimulated by serum to migrate. Suppression of TIP150 induced a measurable defect in cell migration (Fig. 5A, bottom panels). To quantify these results, the migration speeds of cells transfected with control shRNA or TIP150 shRNA were calculated. The quantitative analysis showed that TIP150 knockdown reduced the velocity of MDA-MB-231 cells by roughly 55% of that observed in control cells (Fig. 5B). We next examined the migration distance in the absence of TIP150. As shown in Fig. 5C, the total distance of travel from initial to final point upon stimulation with EGF was statistically different, whereas shRNA-TIP150-transfected cells migrated a shorter distance compared with the non-transfected group. Quantitative analyses showed that the distance of cell migration in the TIP150-depleted cells was half of that in control cells (Fig. 5C, p < 0.001). Our quantitative analyses also show that shRNA-TIP150 significantly reduced the directional velocity of cell migration (Fig. 5, D–F). Thus, we conclude that TIP150 is required for directionally persistent cell migration in MDA-MB-231 cells. As microtubule plus end dynamics in the cell cortex region are involved in cell morphogenesis, polarity, and migration, we focused on the role of TIP150 on microtubule plus end dynamics in this region. As shown Fig. 5F, TIP150 knockdown increased the unstable microtubule ends in the cell cortex region. In TIP150-depleted cells, the microtubule plus end growth rate and shrinking rate increased by 42.6% and 67.6%, respectively, relative to that in control cells (Fig. 5, H and I). At the cortex of TIP150 knockdown cells, microtubule plus ends displayed a shorter time in pausing but a longer time in growing and shortening (Fig. 5J). The data suggest that TIP150 is likely responsible for microtubule stabilization in the cortex region. The biochemical characterization of the TIP150-CTN physical interaction prompted us to investigate whether TIP150 cooperates with CTN in linking microtubule plus ends to the plasma membrane cortex. To this end, we first examined whether CTN alters TIP150-dependent microtubule plus end tracking in vitro using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM)-based assay reported previo"
https://openalex.org/W2485990757,"Borneol is a compound widely used in ophthalmic preparations in China. Little is known about its exact role in treating eye diseases. Here we report that transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channel is a pharmacological target of borneol and mediates its therapeutic effect in the eyes. Ca2+ measurement and electrophysiological recordings revealed that borneol activated TRPM8 channel in a temperature- and dose-dependent manner, which was similar to but less effective than the action of menthol, an established TRPM8 agonist. Borneol significantly increased tear production in guinea pigs without evoking nociceptive responses at 25°C, but failed to induce tear secretion at 35°C. In contrast, menthol evoked tearing response at both 25 and 35°C. TRPM8 channel blockers N-(3-Aminopropyl)-2-[(3-methylphenyl)methoxy]-N-(2-thienylmethyl)benzamide hydrochloride (AMTB) and N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4-(3-chloropyridin-2-yl)piperazine-1-carboxamide (BCTC) abolished borneol- and menthol-induced tear secretion. Borneol at micromolar concentrations did not affect the viability of human corneal epithelial cells. We conclude that borneol can activate the cold-sensing TRPM8 channel and modestly increase ocular surface wetness, which suggests it is an active compound in ophthalmic preparations and particularly useful in treating dry eye syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2492895835,"The 2015 NICE guidelines for suspected cancer recommend that English General Practitioners have direct access to diagnostic tests to investigate symptoms of cancer that do not meet the criteria for urgent referral. We aimed to identify the proportion of GPs in England with direct access to these tests.We recruited 533 English GPs through a national clinical research network to complete an online survey about direct access to laboratory, radiology, and endoscopy tests in the three months leading up to the release of the 2015 NICE guidance. If they had direct access to a diagnostic test, GPs were asked about the time necessary to arrange a test and receive a report. Results are reported by NHS sub-region and, adjusting for sampling, for England as a whole.Almost all GPs reported direct access to x-ray and laboratory investigations except faecal occult blood testing (54%, 95% CI 49-59%) and urine protein electrophoresis (89%, 95% CI 84-92%). Fewer GPs had direct access to CT scans (54%, 95% CI 49-59%) or endoscopy (colonoscopy 32%, 95% CI 28-37%; gastroscopy 72%, 95% CI 67-77%). There was significant variation in direct access between NHS regions for the majority of imaging tests-for example, from 20 to 85% to MRI. Apart from x-ray, very few GPs (1-22%) could access radiology and endoscopy within the timescales recommended by NICE. The modal request to test time was 2-4 weeks for routine radiology and 4-6 weeks for routine endoscopy with results taking another 1-2 weeks.At the time that the 2015 NICE guideline was released, local investment was required to not only provide direct access but also reduce the interval between request and test and speed up reporting. Further research using our data as a benchmark is now required to identify whether local improvements in direct access have been achieved in response to the NICE targets. If alternative approaches to test access are to be proposed they must be piloted comprehensively and underpinned by robust effectiveness data."
https://openalex.org/W2475436493,"Traffic state estimation from the floating car system is a challenging problem. The low penetration rate and random distribution make available floating car samples usually cover part space and time points of the road networks. To obtain a wide range of traffic state from the floating car system, many methods have been proposed to estimate the traffic state for the uncovered links. However, these methods cannot provide traffic state of the entire road networks. In this paper, the traffic state estimation is transformed to solve a missing data imputation problem, and the tensor completion framework is proposed to estimate missing traffic state. A tensor is constructed to model traffic state in which observed entries are directly derived from floating car system and unobserved traffic states are modeled as missing entries of constructed tensor. The constructed traffic state tensor can represent spatial and temporal correlations of traffic data and encode the multi-way properties of traffic state. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it can fully mine and utilize the multi-dimensional inherent correlations of traffic state. We tested the proposed approach on a well calibrated simulation network. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach yield reliable traffic state estimation from very sparse floating car data, particularly when dealing with the floating car penetration rate is below 1%."
https://openalex.org/W2498282609,"Background The 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) was introduced in Cambodia in January 2015. There are limited data concerning the common serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Knowledge of the circulating pneumococcal serotypes is important to monitor epidemiological changes before and after vaccine implementation. Methods All episodes of IPD defined by the isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from blood, cerebrospinal fluid or other sterile site in Cambodian children admitted to the Angkor Hospital for Children in Siem Reap, Northwestern Cambodia, between 1st January 2007 and 1st July 2012 were retrospectively studied. Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates that could be retrieved underwent phenotypic typing and whole genome sequencing. Results There were 90 Cambodian children hospitalized with IPD with a median (IQR) age of 2.3 years (0.9–6.2). The case fatality was 15.6% (95% CI 8–23). Of 50 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates available for further testing, 46% were penicillin non-susceptible and 8% were ceftriaxone non-susceptible, 78% were cotrimoxazole resistant, 30% were erythromycin resistant and 30% chloramphenicol resistant. There were no significant changes in resistance levels over the five-year period. The most common serotypes were 1 (11/50; 22%), 23F (8/50; 16%), 14 (6/50; 12%), 5 (5/50; 10%) and 19A (3/50; 6%). Coverage by PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13 was 44%, 76% and 92% respectively. We identified novel multilocus sequence types and resistotypes using whole genome sequencing. Conclusions This study suggests IPD is an important disease in Cambodian children and can have a significant mortality. PCV13 coverage of the serotypes determined in studied strains was high and consistent with another recent study. The phenotypic resistance patterns observed were similar to other regional studies. The use of whole genome sequencing in the present study provides additional typing and resistance information together with the description of novel sequence types and resistotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2476236054,"Avian influenza viruses sporadically cross the species barrier to mammals, including humans, in which they may cause epidemic disease. Recently such an epidemic occurred due to the emergence of avian influenza virus of the subtype H10N7 (Seal/H10N7) in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). This epidemic caused high mortality in seals along the north-west coast of Europe and represented a potential risk for human health. To characterize the spectrum of lesions and to identify the target cells and viral distribution, findings in 16 harbor seals spontaneously infected with Seal/H10N7 are described. The seals had respiratory tract inflammation extending from the nasal cavity to bronchi associated with intralesional virus antigen in respiratory epithelial cells. Virus infection was restricted to the respiratory tract. The fatal outcome of the viral infection in seals was most likely caused by secondary bacterial infections. To investigate the pathogenic potential of H10N7 infection for humans, we inoculated the seal virus intratracheally into six ferrets and performed pathological and virological analyses at 3 and 7 days post inoculation. These experimentally inoculated ferrets displayed mild clinical signs, virus excretion from the pharynx and respiratory tract inflammation extending from bronchi to alveoli that was associated with virus antigen expression exclusively in the respiratory epithelium. Virus was isolated only from the respiratory tract. In conclusion, Seal/H10N7 infection in naturally infected harbor seals and experimentally infected ferrets shows that respiratory epithelial cells are the permissive cells for viral replication. Fatal outcome in seals was caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia similar to that in fatal human cases during influenza pandemics. Productive infection of ferrets indicates that seal/H10N7 may possess a zoonotic potential. This outbreak of LPAI from wild birds to seals demonstrates the risk of such occasions for mammals and thus humans."
https://openalex.org/W2497815182,"Gastropod mollusks have been proposed as alternative models for male reproductive toxicity testing, due to similarities in their reproductive anatomy compared to mammals, together with evidence that endocrine disrupting chemicals can cause effects in some mollusks analogous to those seen in mammals. To test this hypothesis, we used the freshwater pulmonate snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, for which various genetic tools and a draft genome have recently become available, to investigate the effects of two steroid androgens on the development of mollusk secondary sexual organs. Here we present the results of exposures to two potent androgens, the vertebrate steroid; 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the pharmaceutical anabolic steroid; 17α-methyltestosterone (MT), under continuous flow-through conditions throughout embryonic development and up to sexual maturity. Secondary sexual gland morphology, histopathology and differential gene expression analysis were used to determine whether steroid androgens stimulated or inhibited organ development. No significant differences between tissues from control and exposed snails were identified, suggesting that these androgens elicited no biologically detectable response normally associated with exposure to androgens in vertebrate model systems. Identifying no effect of androgens in this mollusk is significant, not only in the context of the suitability of mollusks as alternative model organisms for testing vertebrate androgen receptor agonists but also, if applicable to other similar mollusks, in terms of the likely impacts of androgens and anti-androgenic pollutants present in the aquatic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2519301732,"B cell activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF), also known as B lymphocyte stimulator, is a ligand required for the generation and maintenance of B lymphocytes. In this study, the ability of different monoclonal antibodies to recognize, inhibit, or activate mouse BAFF was investigated. One of them, a mouse IgG1 named Sandy-2, prevented the binding of BAFF to all of its receptors, BAFF receptor, transmembrane activator and calcium modulating ligand interactor, and B cell maturation antigen, at a stoichiometric ratio; blocked the activity of mouse BAFF on a variety of cell-based reporter assays; and antagonized the prosurvival action of BAFF on primary mouse B cells in vitro. A single administration of Sandy-2 in mice induced B cell depletion within 2 weeks, down to levels close to those observed in BAFF-deficient mice. This depletion could then be maintained with a chronic treatment. Sandy-2 and a previously described rat IgG1 antibody, 5A8, also formed a pair suitable for the sensitive detection of endogenous circulating BAFF by ELISA or using a homogenous assay. Interestingly, 5A8 and Sandy-5 displayed activities opposite to that of Sandy-2 by stimulating recombinant BAFF in vitro and endogenous BAFF in vivo. These tools will prove useful for the detection and functional manipulation of endogenous mouse BAFF and provide an alternative to the widely used BAFF receptor-Fc decoy receptor for the specific depletion of BAFF in mice."

To understand the molecular mechanisms associated with salt stress and identify genes of potential importance in cultivated chrysanthemum, we carried out transcriptome sequencing of chrysanthemum. Two cDNA libraries were generated from the control and salt-treated samples (Sample_0510_control and Sample_0510_treat) of leaves. By using the Illumina Solexa RNA sequencing technology, 94 million high quality sequencing reads and 161,522 unigenes were generated and then we annotated unigenes through comparing these sequences to diverse protein databases. A total of 126,646 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) were identified in leaf. Plant hormones, amino acid metabolism, photosynthesis and secondary metabolism were all changed under salt stress after the complete list of GO term and KEGG enrichment analysis. The hormone biosynthesis changing and oxidative hurt decreasing appeared to be significantly related to salt tolerance of chrysanthemum. Important protein kinases and major transcription factor families involved in abiotic stress were differentially expressed, such as MAPKs, CDPKs, MYB, WRKY, AP2 and HD-zip. In general, these results can help us to confirm the molecular regulation mechanism and also provide us a comprehensive resource of chrysanthemum under salt stress."
https://openalex.org/W2499675376,"Bordetella holmesii causes both invasive and respiratory diseases in humans. Although the number of cases of pertussis-like respiratory illnesses due to B. holmesii infection has increased in the last decade worldwide, little is known about the virulence factors of the organism. Here, we analyzed a B. holmesii isolate that forms large aggregates and precipitates in suspension, and subsequently demonstrated that the autoagglutinating isolate is deficient in Bordetella intermediate protein A (BipA) and that this deletion is caused by a frame-shift mutation in the bipA gene. A BipA-deficient mutant generated by homologous recombination also exhibited the autoagglutination phenotype. Moreover, the BipA mutant adhered poorly to an abiotic surface and failed to form biofilms, as did two other B. holmesii autoagglutinating strains, ATCC 51541 and ATCC 700053, which exhibit transcriptional down-regulation of bipA gene expression, indicating that autoagglutination indirectly inhibits biofilm formation. In a mouse intranasal infection model, the BipA mutant showed significantly lower levels of initial lung colonization than did the parental strain (P < 0.01), suggesting that BipA might be a critical virulence factor in B. holmesii respiratory infection. Together, our findings suggest that BipA production plays an essential role in preventing autoagglutination and indirectly promoting biofilm formation by B. holmesii."
https://openalex.org/W2482097572,"Purpose To assess the neuroprotective effects of flibanserin (formerly BIMT-17), a dual 5-HT1A agonist and 5-HT2A antagonist, in a light-induced retinopathy model. Methods Albino BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with either vehicle or increasing doses of flibanserin ranging from 0.75 to 15 mg/kg flibanserin. To assess 5-HT1A-mediated effects, BALB/c mice were injected with 10 mg/kg WAY 100635, a 5-HT1A antagonist, prior to 6 mg/kg flibanserin and 5-HT1A knockout mice were injected with 6 mg/kg flibanserin. Injections were administered once immediately prior to light exposure or over the course of five days. Light exposure lasted for one hour at an intensity of 10,000 lux. Retinal structure was assessed using spectral domain optical coherence tomography and retinal function was assessed using electroretinography. To investigate the mechanisms of flibanserin-mediated neuroprotection, gene expression, measured by RT-qPCR, was assessed following five days of daily 15 mg/kg flibanserin injections. Results A five-day treatment regimen of 3 to 15 mg/kg of flibanserin significantly preserved outer retinal structure and function in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, a single-day treatment regimen of 6 to 15 mg/kg of flibanserin still provided significant protection. The action of flibanserin was hindered by the 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY 100635, and was not effective in 5-HT1A knockout mice. Creb, c-Jun, c-Fos, Bcl-2, Cast1, Nqo1, Sod1, and Cat were significantly increased in flibanserin-injected mice versus vehicle-injected mice. Conclusions Intraperitoneal delivery of flibanserin in a light-induced retinopathy mouse model provides retinal neuroprotection. Mechanistic data suggests that this effect is mediated through 5-HT1A receptors and that flibanserin augments the expression of genes capable of reducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Since flibanserin is already FDA-approved for other indications, the potential to repurpose this drug for treating retinal degenerations merits further investigation."

The non-ACOS cohort involved patients with confirmed absence of ACOS. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for TB in the ACOS and non-ACOS cohorts by using poisson regression analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine the adjusted HR (aHR) for TB in the ACOS cohort compared with the non-ACOS cohort.The aHR for TB was 2.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.19-2.66) in the ACOS cohort. The TB risk was significantly higher in the ACOS cohort than in the non-ACOS cohort when stratified by age, sex, comorbidities, and atopy. Within the ACOS cohort, the aHR was higher among patients receiving SABAs+SAMAs, LABAs+LAMAs, and ICSs (aHR [95% CI]: 3.06 [2.75-3.41], 3.68 [2.93-4.61], and 2.79 [1.25-6.22], respectively; all P < .05). Furthermore, patients with more than 15 outpatient visits and hospitalizations per year demonstrated the highest aHR (8.09; 95% CI, 6.85-9.56).ACOS cohort potentially develop incident TB, regardless of the age,sex, comorbidities and atopy; even without receiving the inhalers.This risk is higher, especially in the ACOS cohort have a high frequency of medical services or receiving the inhalers such as SABAs+SAMAs, LABAs+LAMAs and ICSs."

Here we have assessed the effect of genetic ablation of PrPC in transgenic mice expressing human wild type amyloid precursor protein (line I5). Deletion of PrPC had no effect on the α- and β-secretase proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) nor on the amount of Aβ38, Aβ40 or Aβ42 in the brains of the mice. In addition, ablation of PrPC did not alter Aβ deposition or histopathology phenotype in this transgenic model. Thus using this transgenic model we could not provide evidence to support the hypothesis that PrPC regulates Aβ production."
https://openalex.org/W2480011615,"We investigated the effects of low-dose multi detector computed tomography (MDCT) in combination with statistical iterative reconstruction algorithms on trabecular bone microstructure parameters. Twelve donated vertebrae were scanned with the routine radiation exposure used in our department (standard-dose) and a low-dose protocol. Reconstructions were performed with filtered backprojection (FBP) and maximum-likelihood based statistical iterative reconstruction (SIR). Trabecular bone microstructure parameters were assessed and statistically compared for each reconstruction. Moreover, fracture loads of the vertebrae were biomechanically determined and correlated to the assessed microstructure parameters. Trabecular bone microstructure parameters based on low-dose MDCT and SIR significantly correlated with vertebral bone strength. There was no significant difference between microstructure parameters calculated on low-dose SIR and standard-dose FBP images. However, the results revealed a strong dependency on the regularization strength applied during SIR. It was observed that stronger regularization might corrupt the microstructure analysis, because the trabecular structure is a very small detail that might get lost during the regularization process. As a consequence, the introduction of SIR for trabecular bone microstructure analysis requires a specific optimization of the regularization parameters. Moreover, in comparison to other approaches, superior noise-resolution trade-offs can be found with the proposed methods."
https://openalex.org/W2490179709,"The bacterial RecA protein plays a role in the complex system of DNA damage repair. Here, we report the functional and structural characterization of the Herbaspirillum seropedicae RecA protein (HsRecA). HsRecA protein is more efficient at displacing SSB protein from ssDNA than Escherichia coli RecA protein. HsRecA also promotes DNA strand exchange more efficiently. The three dimensional structure of HsRecA-ADP/ATP complex has been solved to 1.7 Å resolution. HsRecA protein contains a small N-terminal domain, a central core ATPase domain and a large C-terminal domain, that are similar to homologous bacterial RecA proteins. Comparative structural analysis showed that the N-terminal polymerization motif of archaeal and eukaryotic RecA family proteins are also present in bacterial RecAs. Reconstruction of electrostatic potential from the hexameric structure of HsRecA-ADP/ATP revealed a high positive charge along the inner side, where ssDNA is bound inside the filament. The properties of this surface may explain the greater capacity of HsRecA protein to bind ssDNA, forming a contiguous nucleoprotein filament, displace SSB and promote DNA exchange relative to EcRecA.

By using the portable POCKIT™ device with the novel primer set iiFoc-1/iiFoc-2, the Foc race 4 iiPCR assay (including DNA amplification and signal monitoring) could be completed within one hour. The developed Foc race 4 iiPCR assay is thus a user-friendly and efficient platform designed specifically for the detection of Foc race 4. The detection limit of this optimized Foc iiPCR system was estimated to be 1 copy of the target standard DNA as well as 1 fg of the Foc genomic DNA. This approach can serve as a rapid detection method for in planta detection of Foc race 4 in field-infected banana. It was concluded that this molecular detection procedure based on iiPCR has good potential for use as an efficient detection method."
https://openalex.org/W2484475598,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the result of metabolic defects in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, yet most T2D loci identified to date influence insulin secretion. We hypothesized that T2D loci, particularly those affecting insulin sensitivity, can be identified through interaction with insulin secretion loci. To test this hypothesis, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg), a dynamic measure of first-phase insulin secretion, were identified in African Americans from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Family Study (IRASFS; n = 492 subjects). These SNPs were tested for interaction, individually and jointly as a genetic risk score (GRS), using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from five cohorts (ARIC, CARDIA, JHS, MESA, WFSM; n = 2,725 cases, 4,167 controls) with T2D as the outcome. In single variant analyses, suggestively significant (Pinteraction<5×10−6) interactions were observed at several loci including LYPLAL1 (rs10746381), CHN2 (rs7796525), and EXOC1 (rs4289500). Notable AIRg GRS interactions were observed with SAMD4A (rs11627203) and UTRN (rs17074194). These data support the hypothesis that additional genetic factors contributing to T2D risk can be identified by interactions with insulin secretion loci."
https://openalex.org/W2502105793,"Wireless sensor networks consist of resource limited devices. Most crucial of these resources is battery life, as in most applications like battle field or volcanic area monitoring, it is often impossible to replace or recharge the power source. This article presents an energy efficient collaborative communication system based on spread spectrum to achieve energy efficiency as well as immunity against jamming, natural interference, noise suppression and universal frequency reuse. Performance of the proposed system is evaluated using the received signal power, bit error rate (BER) and energy consumption. The results show a direct proportionality between the power gain and the number of collaborative nodes as well as BER and signal-to-noise ratio (Eb/N0). The analytical and simulation results of the proposed system are compared with SISO system. The comparison reveals that SISO perform better than collaborative communication in case of small distances whereas collaborative communication performs better than SISO in case of long distances. On the basis of these results it is safe to conclude that collaborative communication in wireless sensor networks using wideband systems improves the life time of nodes in the networks thereby prolonging the network's life time."
https://openalex.org/W2492126787,"The success of prevention programs demonstrated the importance of raising awareness about haemoglobinopathies since the lack of knowledge and awareness about the disorders may serve as barriers to prevention, disclosure of disease status as well as to testing for haemoglobinopathies. The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of middle and high school students towards haemoglobinopathies in Hatay, where the disorders are prevalent. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 8th and 9th grade students across Hatay including all sub provinces. From May 2012 to December 2012, a total of 1925 students filled the questionnaires which query the knowledge level and attitudes of students by face to face method. Among questions regarding students’ knowledge about haemoglobinopathies, the lowest correct response rate was observed in “How do these diseases transmit?” with 31.8%, meaning most of the students did not know that the diseases are transmitted by heredity. Significant differences were observed between the correct answer rates of the students and their status of being previously informed. Students who had a diseased person around were having a 2.597-fold (95%CI = 1.886–3.575); students possessing at least one parent at secondary education level or above were having a 1.954-fold higher probability of being previously informed (95%CI = 1.564–2.443). Due to the lack of knowledge about haemoglobinopathies in middle and high school students, we suggest health education programs including informative lectures particularly about the genetic basis of the disorders especially in the regions where the disorders are prevalent."
https://openalex.org/W2500557011,"Preconditioning (PC) procedures (ischemic or pharmacological) are powerful procedures used for attaining protection against prolonged ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, in a variety of organs, including the heart. The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the protection by PC are however, complex and only partially understood. Recently, an 'iron-based mechanism' (IBM), that includes de novo ferritin synthesis and accumulation, was proposed to explain the specific steps in cardioprotection generated by IPC. The current study investigated whether nitric oxide (NO), generated by exogenous NO-donors, could play a role in the observed IBM of cardioprotection by IPC. Therefore, three distinct NO-donors were investigated at different concentrations (1-10 μM): sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). Isolated rat hearts were retrogradely perfused using the Langendorff configuration and subjected to prolonged ischemia and reperfusion with or without pretreatment by NO-donors. Hemodynamic parameters, infarct sizes and proteins of the methionine-centered redox cycle (MCRC) were analyzed, as well as cytosolic aconitase (CA) activity and ferritin protein levels. All NO-donors had significant effects on proteins involved in the MCRC system. Nonetheless, pretreatment with 10 μM SNAP was found to evoke the strongest effects on Msr activity, thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase protein levels. These effects were accompanied with a significant reduction in infarct size, increased CA activity, and ferritin accumulation. Conversely, pretreatment with 2 μM SIN-1 increased infarct size and was associated with slightly lower ferritin protein levels. In conclusion, the abovementioned findings indicate that NO, depending on its bio-active redox form, can regulate iron metabolism and plays a role in the IBM of cardioprotection against reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W2475513503,"Background When urine output increases, voided volume at each voiding also increases in normal subjects. This is generally understood as a vesical adaptation response to diuresis (VARD). Because lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are supposed to be improved by the change in bladder function after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP), the aim of the present study was to investigate whether VARD is involved in the improvement of LUTS after RARP. Methods 100 consecutive patients who underwent RARP and had the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL) index, a frequency-volume chart (FVC), uroflowmetry, and post-voided residual urine (PVR) available were evaluated before and after RARP. This cohort was divided into patients with and without preoperative LUTS according to the preoperative IPSS total score. VARD was defined as the presence of a significant correlation between the urine output rate and voided volume at each voiding (R2>0.2). Results In patients with preoperative LUTS, the IPSS total, storage, and voiding symptom scores were significantly improved after RARP (all P<0.001). The QOL index was also significantly improved after RARP (P<0.05). Although VARD was not seen before RARP (R2 = 0.05), it was seen after RARP (3 months R2 = 0.22, 12 months R2 = 0.23). PVR was significantly reduced after RARP (P = 0.004). Conclusions Improvement of LUTS was seen with acquisition of VARD after RARP. As a result, urinary QOL was also improved in patients with preoperative LUTS. RARP might be an effective procedure for amelioration of LUTS by the acquisition of VARD."
https://openalex.org/W2495302621,"Vertebrate semicircular canals (SCC) first appeared in the vertebrates (i.e. ancestral fish) over 600 million years ago. In SCC the principal mechanoreceptors are hair cells, which as compared to cochlear hair cells are distinctly longer (70 vs. 7 μm), 10 times more compliant to bending (44 vs. 500 nN/m), and have a 100-fold higher tip displacement threshold (< 10 μm vs. <400 nm). We have developed biomechanical models of vertebrate hair cells where the bundle is approximated as a stiff, cylindrical elastic rod subject to friction and thermal agitation. Our models suggest that the above differences aid SCC hair cells in circumventing the masking effects of Brownian motion noise of about 70 nm, and thereby permit transduction of very low frequency (<10 Hz) signals. We observe that very low frequency mechanoreception requires increased stimulus amplitude, and argue that this is adaptive to circumvent Brownian motion overload at the hair bundles. We suggest that the selective advantage of detecting such low frequency stimuli may have favoured the evolution of large guiding structures such as semicircular canals and otoliths to overcome Brownian Motion noise at the level of the mechanoreceptors of the SCC."
https://openalex.org/W2476084932,"Pullulanase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of polysaccharides, has been identified in a broad range of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, and animals. The pullulanase (pulB; FTT_0412c) of F. tularensis subspecies tularensis Schu S4 is considered to be a homologue of the type I pullulanase (pulA) of the other Francisella subspecies. The significance of Francisella pullulanase has been obscure until now. In the present study, we characterized a recombinant PulB of F. tularensis SCHU P9, which was expressed as a his-tagged protein in Escherichia coli. The recombinant PulB was confirmed to be a type I pullulanase by its enzymatic activity in vitro. A pulB gene knockout mutant of F. tularensis SCHU P9 (ΔpulB) was constructed using the TargeTron Knockout system and plasmid pKEK1140 to clarify the function of PulB during the growth of F. tularensis in macrophages. The intracellular growth of the ΔpulB mutant in murine macrophage J774.1 cells was significantly reduced compared with that of the parental strain SCHU P9. Expression of PulB in ΔpulB, using an expression plasmid, resulted in the complementation of the reduced growth in macrophages, suggesting that PulB is necessary for the efficient growth of F. tularensis in macrophages. To assess the role of PulB in virulence, the knockout and parent bacterial strains were used to infect C57BL/6J mice. Histopathological analyses showed that tissues from ΔpulB-infected mice showed milder lesions compared to those from SCHU P9-infected mice. However, all mice infected with SCHU P9 and ΔpulB showed the similar levels of bacterial loads in their tissues. The results suggest that PulB plays a significant role in bacterial growth within murine macrophage but does not contribute to bacterial virulence in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2503224212,"To evaluate the association between post-inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), pneumonia and lung cancer in patients with asthma.The study samples were collected from the National Health Insurance Database. Asthmatic patients who were first-time users of ICS between 2003 and 2005 were identified as cases. For each case, 4 control individuals were randomly matched for sex, age and date of ICS use. Cases and matched controls were followed up until the end of 2010. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to determine the hazard ratio for pulmonary infections and lung cancer risk in the ICS users and non-users.A total of 10,904 first-time users of ICS were matched with 43,616 controls. The hazard ratios for lung cancer were: 2.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-5.22; p = 0.012) for individuals with post-ICS TB, 1.28 (95%CI, 0.73-2.26; p = 0.389) for post-ICS pneumonia, 2.31(95%CI, 0.84-6.38; p = 0.105) for post-ICS pneumonia+TB, 1.08 (95%CI, 0.57-2.03; p = 0.815) for TB, 0.99 (95%CI, 0.63-1.55; p = 0.970) for pneumonia, and 0.32 (95%CI, 0.05-2.32; p = 0.261) for pneumonia+ TB, respectively.Post-ICS TB increased lung cancer risk in patients with asthma. Because of the high mortality associated with lung cancer, screening tests are recommended for patients with post-ICS TB."
https://openalex.org/W2506398592,"In the last few decades, awareness of environmental issues has increased significantly. Little has changed, however, in human activities contributing to environmental damage. Why is it so difficult for us to change our behavior in a domain that is clearly so important to the future of humanity? Here we propose and test the possibility that self-signaling, the way we view ourselves based on our past behaviors, is one of the factors contributing to the difficulty of taking environmental action. In three experiments, we show that previous self-interested thoughts or behaviors serve as important signals that hinder the likelihood of acting in line with an individual’s reported concern for the environment. This study not only helps explain the gap between environmental awareness and action, but also suggests alternative strategies for policymakers and environmental agencies to promote proenvironmental behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2484052254,"We fabricated droplet-based microfluidic platform for copolymerizable microspheres with acrydite modified DNA probe. The copolymerizable 3-D polyacrylamide microspheres were successfully produced from microcontinuous-flow synthesis with on-channel solidification. DNA copolymerization activity, surface presentation and thermostability were assessed by using fluorescent labeled complementary probe. The binding performance was only visible on the surface area of oligo-microspheres. We show that the resulting oligo-microspheres can be directly integrated into a streamlined microsphere-PCR protocol for amplifying ssDNA. Our microspheres could be utilized as a potential material for ssDNA analysis such as DNA microarray and automatic DNA SELEX process."
https://openalex.org/W2499025749,"Screening endoscopies in individuals 40 years or older in regions where gastric cancer is prevalent increase the diagnosis of gastric cancer at an early stage. However, the benefits of screening endoscopies in a young population (<40 years) have not been evaluated.We reviewed data from patients less than 40 years old who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection or surgery for initial-onset gastric cancer. We also administered a questionnaire to gather information concerning periodic endoscopic inspections and the period from the penultimate endoscopy to diagnosis.Of the 564 patients in this study, 101 (17.9%) patients underwent screening endoscopy within 24 months of their gastric cancer diagnosis. Lesion size was significantly smaller in the ≤24 months group than in the >24 month group (23.8 mm [standard deviation, 22.2 mm] vs. 30.5 mm [standard deviation, 23.1 mm], P = 0.008). However, the proportion of patients with early gastric cancer did not differ between the two groups (≤24 months vs. >24 months group; 67.6% vs. 65.7%, P = 0.712). On multivariable analysis, periodic endoscopies did not influence the early diagnosis of gastric cancer (with >24 months as the reference group: ≤24 months, odds ratio = 0.939, 95% confidence interval = 0.583-1.513).Although periodic endoscopies aided in the detection of gastric cancer when lesions were smaller in size, they seemed not to increase the proportion of patients with early gastric cancer in young patients diagnosed with resectable gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2489337678,"Cell walls are essential components of plant cells which perform a variety of important functions for the different cell types, tissues and organs of a plant. Besides mechanical function providing cell shape, cell walls participate in intercellular communication, defense during plant-microbe interactions, and plant growth. The plant cell wall consists predominantly of polysaccharides with the addition of structural glycoproteins, phenolic esters, minerals, lignin, and associated enzymes. Alterations in the cell wall composition created through either changes in biosynthesis of specific constituents or their post-synthetic modifications in the apoplast compromise cell wall integrity and frequently induce plant compensatory responses as a result of these alterations. Here we report that post-synthetic removal of fucose residues specifically from arabinogalactan proteins in the Arabidopsis plant cell wall induces differential expression of fucosyltransferases and leads to the root and hypocotyl elongation changes. These results demonstrate that the post-synthetic modification of cell wall components presents a valuable approach to investigate the potential signaling pathways induced during plant responses to such modifications that usually occur during plant development and stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W2481038496,"In our continuing structure-activity relationship study of a new class of erythromycin A (EM-A) derivatives with antiproliferative activity, a new series of de(N-methyl) EM-A dimers jointed by a four-atom linker, -CH2CH = CHCH2-, were prepared and their antiproliferative activity against three human tumor cell lines was evaluated by MTT assay. The most active EM-A dimer, compound 1b, that carrying C6 methoxyl groups was further investigated and showed potent antiproliferative activity in six other human tumor cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis of 1b treated HeLa and MCF-7 cells indicated that the four-atom EM-A dimers induced the SubG1 phase cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis, in time- and dose-dependent manners. Further experiments including morphologic observation, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, mitochondrial potential alternation and western blot analysis revealed that the antiproliferative mechanism may involve the induction of apoptosis in activating the mitochondrial pathway, and regulation of apoptotic proteins."
