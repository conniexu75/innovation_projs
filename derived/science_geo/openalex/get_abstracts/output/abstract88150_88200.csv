https://openalex.org/W2018205338,"We report the isolation of a cluster of four alpha-like globin genes from a bacteriophage lambda library of human DNA (Lawn et al., 1978). Analysis of the cloned DNA confirms the linkage arrangement of the two adult alpha-globin genes (alpha 1 and alpha 2) previously derived from genomic blotting experiments (Orkin, 1978) and identifies two additional closely linked alpha-like genes. The nucleotide sequence of a portion of each of these alpha-like genes was determined. One of these sequences is tentatively identified as an embryonic zeta-globin gene (zeta 1) by comparison with structural data derived from purified zeta-globin protein (J. Clegg, personal communication), while the other sequence cannot be matched with any known alpha-like polypeptide sequence (we designate this sequence phi alpha 1). Localization of the four alpha-like sequences on a restriction map of the gene cluster indicates that the genes have the same transcriptional orientation and are arranged in the order 5'-zeta 1-phi alpha 1-alpha 2-alpha 1-3'. Genomic blotting experiments identified a second, nonallelic zeta-like globin gene (phi 2) located 10-12 kb 5' to the cloned zeta-globin gene. Comparison of the locations of restriction sites within alpha 1 and alpha 2 and heteroduplex studies reveal extensive sequence homology within and flanking the two genes. The homologous sequences, which are interrupted by two blocks of nonhomology, span a region of approximately 4 kb. This extensive sequence homology between two genes which are thought to be the products of an ancient duplication event suggests the existence of a mechanism for sequence matching during evolution. One consequence of this arrangement of homologous sequences is the occurrence of two types of deletions in recombinant phage DNA during propagation in E. coli. The locations and sizes of the two types of deletions are indistinguishable from those of the two types of deletions associated with alpha-thalassemia 2 (Embury et al., 1979; Orkin et al., 1979; S. Embury et al., manuscript submitted). This information strongly suggests that the genetic disease is a consequence of unequal crossing over between homologous sequences within and/or surrounding the two adult alpha-globin genes."

https://openalex.org/W2076571885,"The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) segments of several ρ− mutants carrying the oli-2, oli-4 and pho-1 loci have been sequenced. The segments contain a common structural gene sequence that has been identified to include all three genetic markers. The gene codes for a protein with a molecular weight of 28,257. This new gene is located between 61.5 and 62.6 units on the wild-type map of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is transcribed from the same DNA strand as most other yeast mitochondrial genes sequenced to date. The amino acid composition and sequence deduced from the DNA sequence indicate that the protein is very hydrophobic, with three long domains (>30 residues) consisting of nonpolar amino acids. Based on its molecular weight, the gene product is tentatively proposed to be either subunit 3 or 6 of the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W66338719,"Reaction of the purified Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum at 0 degrees C at low [gamma-32P]ATP (0.1 to 0.67 microM) and enzyme (0.025 to 0.24 microM) concentration in the presence of 0.11 to 30 mM Ca2+ without added Mg2+ has resulted in the formation of phosphorylated intermediate (EP:maximal level of EP = 0.45 mol/mol of enzyme) at a very slow rate. Under these conditions, the reaction steps in which EP decomposition takes place are completely prevented. This has permitted us to study the EP formation reaction and its reversal specifically, with a considerably improved time resolution. An apparent rate constant of EP formation (Vf) increases in parallel with the concentration of Ca . ATP, but not with those of Mg . ATP, or of protonated or fully ionized free ATP. This suggests that Ca . ATP is the substrate under these conditions. If Co2+ or Mn2+ are in excess over the other ions during the reaction, Vf varies in parallel with [Co . ATP] or [Mn . ATP]. Thus, it appears that either Ca2+, Co2+, or Mn2+ can be complexed with ATP to form the effective substrate. An apparent rate constant of the back reaction of EP initiated by addition of ADP to EP (Vr) increases in proportion to [ADP] or [H . ADP], but is inhibited by increasing concentrations of the ADP complex with Ca2+ or Mg2+, indicating that free ADP or protonated ADP, or both, are actual substrates for the back reaction of EP. These results suggest a new type of site to which the metal moiety of metal . ATP complex remains bound after the release of ADP from the enzyme. An acid-stable phosphorylated intermediate (EP) produced in the presence of high Ca2+ concentrations (e.g. 0.11 mM) without added Mg2+ does not decompose spontaneously, and the major portion (approximately 90%) of this EP (EPD+) reacts with ADP to form ATP (ADP-sensitive). Upon chelating Ca2+ with ethylene glycol bis(beta-amino-ethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), EPD+ is converted to another form of EP (EPD-), which is unreactive with ADP (or ADP-insensitive). Addition of Mg2+, after initiation of the reaction leading to EPD- by EGTA, results in rapid production of Pi from a portion of EPD- with KMg approximately equal to 3.3 x 10(3) M-1. The fraction of EPD- that is Mg2+-sensitive (EPD-,M+) increases with reaction time at a much slower rate than the Mg2+-insensitive portion of EPD- (EPD-,M-). These results suggest that the enzyme reaction involves the sequential formation of at least three forms of acid-stable EP, viz. in the order of formation, EPD+, EPD-,M-, and EPD-,M+. The equilibrium between EPD+ and EPD-,M- is shifted by higher [K+] and [Ca2+] towards EPD+."
https://openalex.org/W1568920857,"Preferential labeling of COOH-terminal sequences in newly synthesized fibronectin was achieved by short term incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids in the presence of pactamycin, an inhibitor of polypeptide chain initiation. The labeled fibronectin was then cleaved with cathepsin D under conditions that yield a large (137,000-dalton) fragment that lacks collagen-binding properties, and a smaller (72,000-dalton) fragment that retains the ability of fibronectin to bind to collagen. Determination of the relative specific radioactivities of the two fragments leads us to conclude that the collagen-binding domain in fibronectin is located in the NH2-terminal third of the polypeptide chain and not in a COOH-terminal region as previously indicated by other structural studies."

https://openalex.org/W1672700608,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) from bovine brain has been reported to be a family of three polypeptide fragments derived by limited proteolysis from myelin basic protein (MBP) (Westall, F. C., Lennon, V. A., and Gosopodarowicz, D. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 4675-4678). However, fragments of sequence similar to the proposed active ones, generated from bovine MBP by acid proteases, are inactive in stimulating [3H]thymidine incorporation in BALB/c 3T3 cells. Further, the principal active component of the brain FGF preparation (Gospodarowicz, D., Bialecki, H., and Greenburg, G. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 3736-3743) which can be recovered in high yield from isoelectric focusing in sucrose has a pI between 4.8 and 5.8 in contradistinction to the MBP fragments (pI approximately 10) and is not retained on a column of chicken anti-bovine MBP-Sepharose. Therefore, although the reported preparation of brain FGF gives an increase in activity units/mg of protein of about 1000-fold over the crude brain extract, the main protein components, the MBP fragments, do not possess the mitogenic activity. Additional purification of as much as 50- to 100-fold may be required to obtain a homogeneous preparation of the real brain FGF."
https://openalex.org/W1556485756,"Evidence is presented that the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-glycogenolytic complex isolated from fast twitch skeletal muscle is a highly specific, functionally defined compartment for phosphorylase regulation. The addition of ATP alone results in prompt phosphorylase activation which demonstrates calcium dependence similar to the calcium-magnesium ATPase that catalyzes SR calcium transport suggesting that these two calcium-requiring -ystems might interact within the complex. Lowering extravesicular calcium concentration by transport of calcium into the SR lumen resulted in inactivation of phosphorylase a. This effect could be prevented by the addition of the calcium ionophore X537A which inhibits SR calcium sequestration or a calcium EGTA buffer which maintains free calcium. It was mimicked by EGTA addition. Since exogenous phosphorylase b and phosphorylase a were not activated or inactivated, respectively, by the endogenous activating enzymes or phosphatase in the SR-glycogenolytic complex, these regulatory enzymes may be compartmented. In addition, endogenous phosphorylase could be uncoupled from its activating enzymes by amylase treatment. These results suggest that the SR-glycogenolytic complex in fast twitch skeletal muscle is a compartmented system for phosphorylase activation controlled by SR calcium flux, a feature in contrast to the cardiac complex (Entman, M.L., Kaniike, K., Goldstein, M.A., Nelson, T.E., Bornet, E.P., Futch, T.W., and Schwartz, A. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 3140-3146). We suggest that the complex is the in vitro counterpart of the well documented rapid burst of glycogenolysis which ensures with the onset of contraction."
https://openalex.org/W95432657,"Immunoprecipitation of uniformly labeled yeast submitochondrial preparations using a subunit-specific or a holoenzyme antiserum has been employed to determine the subunit stoichiometry of the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase complex. The Triton-solubilized enzyme consists of 10 types of subunits. The number of copies of each subunit, in order of decreasing molecular weight, is 3:3:1:2:1:2:2:1:2:3. on the basis of the stoichiometry data, the ATPase complex has a molecular weight of 5.8 x 10(5) and contains a minimum of 20 polypeptide chains. Analysis of water-soluble ATPase (F1-ATPase) indicates that the stoichiometry of the three largest subunits of the enzyme is preserved in the absence of the other subunits. The molecular weights of both forms of the ATPase, derived from stoichiometry data, agree well with measurements obtained from gel filtration and sedimentation studies. The implications of these data for the structure, function, and assembly of the complex are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1549879214,"A modified protocol for isolation of transverse tubules incorporated an extra stage of purification. The existence of an ATP-energized Ca2+ pump in transverse tubules isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle has been demonstrated. Isolated transverse tubules had a Ca-ATPase activity of 0.78 mu mol/min . mg; this was 300% in excess of that activity attributable to sarcoplasmic reticulum contamination. The distribution of part of the CaATPase activity and ATP-energized Ca2+ uptake coincided with the distribution of transverse tubules in isopycnic sucrose gradients loaded with mechanically disrupted triad junctions. Transverse tubules accumulated over 70 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein; this uptake was abolished by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Neither digitoxin nor monensin inhibited Ca2+ uptake, indicating that Ca2+ accumulation did not occur through a sodium/calcium exchange. Conditions for half-maximal Ca2+ uptake were 5 micro M free Ca2+ and 10 micro M ATP. The Ca2+ pump of isolated transverse tubules was distinguished from the Ca2+ pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum and sarcolemma in that the transverse tubule Ca2+ pump: 1) was not enhanced by oxalate; 2) was not energized by acetyl phosphate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, or 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate; and 3) did not hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl phosphate or 3-O-methyl-fluorescein phosphate. Using Ca2+-dependent 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphatase as a marker for sarcoplasmic reticulum, the contamination of the transverse tubule preparation was calculated to be 6%. This agreed with a contamination level of 5% estimated by freeze-fracture electron microscopy."

https://openalex.org/W1582568326,"The intrinsic membrane sector (Fo) of the H+-ATPase complex of Escherichia coli has been purified, incorporated into liposomes, and its proton-translocating activity reconstituted. The Fo sector was prepared by treating a purified, particulate, F1FO-ATPase preparation with EDTA to solubilize the F1-ATPase. The resulting particulate Fo fraction was incorporated into liposomes of E. coli phospholipids by sonication. Proton efflux from these liposomes was measured with a pH electrode after imposition of a membrane potential. The kinetics of proton efflux fits that predicted by the Goldman-flux equation. The rate of proton efflux was increased maximally more than 100-fold on incorporation of the Fo sector into the liposomes. The rate of H+ efflux varied directly with the amount of Fo material added during reconstitution. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide blocked Fo-mediated H+ efflux. Inhibition was shown to be due to reaction of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide with a specific proteolipid subunit of Fo. The preparation of Fo used in these studies contained the three proteins that had previously been identified as likely subunits of Fo (Foster, D. L., and Fillingame, R. H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 8230-8236). It remains to be determined whether all three components are required for reconstitution of proton translocation activity."
https://openalex.org/W2072159133,A striking inverse correlation was found in umbilical cord plasma between the concentrations of dehydroisoandrosterone sulfate and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol but not high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Dehydroisoandrosterone sulfate is a major secretory product of the human fetal adrenal and the principal precursor of placental estrogen production. The data suggest that the concentrations for LDL-cholesterol in fetal plasma are influenced by the rate of utilization of LDL-cholesterol by the fetal adrenal for steroidogenesis and are not necessarily related to a genetic predisposition for hypercholesterolemia or other lipoprotein disorders.
https://openalex.org/W1568462251,"A previously undescribed gamma chain variant of human fibrinogen has been identified by application of a sensitive sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoretic technique to separate the polypeptide chains. This variant, called gamma B, clots and cross-links as well as the major species (gamma A), is similarly degraded by plasmin, and has a molecular weight of 53,100 as compared to 50,100 for gamma A. Cross-linked dimers of Mr = 100,100 and 108,500 are identified after action of thrombin and Factor XIIIa, suggesting the formation of gamma A-gamma A and gamma B-gamma B dimers rather than gamma A-gamma B hybrid species. The gamma B chain dimers represent 16% of the total cross-linked gamma chain forms. Two early plasmic derivatives of gamma A and gamma B chains have been demonstrated to have lost fragments of Mr = approximately 4,000 and 5,000 without loss of 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl cadaverine fluorescence. Since the difference in molecular weight of gamma A and gamma B chains is maintained during plasmic degradation of both monomer and dimeric fluorescent forms, this suggests that the additional sequence of amino acids in gamma B is located at or near the COOH-terminal end of this polypeptide chain."

https://openalex.org/W46183566,"The effect of K+ on phosphorylation of the Ca2+-dependent ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum by either Pi or ATP was studied using a millisecond mixing and quenching device. Equilibrium levels of phosphoenzyme formed by Pi were progressively decreased in the presence of increasing K+ concentrations. This effect was more pronounced in empty vesicles than in vesicles previously loaded with calcium. Potassium did not modify the initial rate of enzyme phosphorylation by Pi but increased the rate of phosphoenzyme hydrolysis 4- to 6-fold. Using low ATP concentration (50 micro M), the steady state level of phosphoenzyme was decreased by the addition of K+. This effect disappeared when the ATP concentration was raised to 1 mM."

https://openalex.org/W1485457797,"Late in the life cycle of the single-stranded DNA phage phi X, the synthesis of positive strand DNA is coupled to the maturation of progeny virions. DNA synthesis and packaging take place in a replication-assembly complex, which we have purified to homogeneity and characterized. The following conclusions can be drawn: 1. The DNA component of the replication-assembly complex is a rolling circle with a single-stranded DNA tail which is less than or equal to genome length. 2. The major protein component of the replication-assembly complex is an intact viral capsid, as shown by gel analysis of 35S-labeled complexes. As replication proceeds at the DNA growing point, the positive strand tail of the rolling circle is displaced directly into the capsid. In addition to the capsid, the complex contains at least 1 molecule of the phi X gene A nicking protein, which appears to be covalently linked to the DNA. 3. The rolling circle . capsid complex can be purified to homogeneity by taking advantage of its uniform sedimentation velocity (35 S) and its uniform density upon equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl (1.50 g/cc). 4. The replication-assembly complex can be visualized in the electron microscope. An electron-dense particle, which has the dimensions of a viral capsid, is observed attached to a rolling circle at the DNA growing point. 5. Hybridization of specific phi X restriction fragments to the deproteinized, single-stranded tails of intact rolling circles has allowed the use of these replicating intermediates to determine both the origin/terminus and the direction of phi X positive strand DNA synthesis. The ends of the rolling circle tails map in the Hae III restriction Fragment Z6b, at the position on the phi X genome at which the gene A endonuclease is known to cut. This result indicates that this endonuclease participates in the termination of each round of synthesis by cutting off unit-length viral genomes. 6. Rolling circle . capsid complexes were also isolated from two other icosahedral, single-stranded DNA phages: G4 and St-1. The rolling circle . capsid complex seen in the case of the single-stranded DNA phages represents the first example of a structure in which DNA synthesis and viral assembly occur in a coupled manner. This tight coordination explains why double-stranded DNA circles are the net product of synthesis early in the viral life cycle while only single-stranded DNA circles are produced later. The single-stranded tails of the rolling circle intermediates are available for conversion to the duplex state at early times, whereas the concentration of preformed capsids later is high enough to bind to all of the replicating molecules and package the emerging positive strand DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1594707751,"The presence of diethyl ether enhances the rates of both Ca2+ uptake and ATPase activity in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (SR) isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. Stopped-flow measurements of Ca2+ transport in SR show that, in the absence of oxalate and other calcium-complexing anions, the initial velocity of the ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake increases from 60 to 107 nmol of Ca2+/s/mg of protein when 5% (v/v) diethyl ether is present. Similar concentrations of diethyl ether increase steady state levels of Ca2+ accumulation by over 80%. Parallel to the enhancement of the rate of Ca2+ transport, diethyl ether induces an increased rate of Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. Among four other ether compounds tested, three enhanced the rate of Ca2+ uptake, but none as effectively as diethyl ether, and a fourth reduced the rate of Ca2+ transport by the SR. These results contrast with previous observations concerning the effect of diethyl ether on ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport by SR and are now consistent with a direct pharmacological action of ether as a muscle relaxant at the level of SR Ca2+ transport."
https://openalex.org/W2121899785,"Urinary acidification in the turtle urinary bladder is due to a reversible proton-translocating ATPase. To estimate the H+/ATP stoichiometry of this pump, we measured the delta G'ATP in the epithelial cells and the maximum e.m.f. generated by the pump. The latter is the maximal transepithelial electrochemical gradient for protons placed across the epithelium that is needed to nullify the rate of transport and averaged 179 +/- 7 mV. The delta G'ATP averaged 50.1 kJ/mol. The H+/ATP stoichiometry of these bladders was 2.92 +/- 0.1. In other experiments, the bladders were poisoned by iodoacetate and cyanide and a variable transepithelial electrochemical gradient for protons was placed across them. It was noted that ATP synthesis occurred at a transepithelial electrochemical gradient for protons greater than 120 mV. The delta G'ATP in other bladders treated identically averaged 40.0 kJ/mol, giving a H+/ATP stoichiometry of 3.4 +/- 0.1. We conclude that the H+/ATP stoichiometry of the proton pump of turtle urinary bladder is approximately 3."

Incubation of F1 with monodentate Cr(III)ADP and 32Pi followed by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 resulted in 32Pi counts in the F1 protein peak. The appearance of radioactivity from inorganic phosphate in the protein peak was dependent upon the presence of monodentate Cr(III)ADP and F1, and was inhibited by MgADP. Removal of the enzyme from the reaction mixture containing Cr(III)ADP and 32Pi by acid precipitation followed by chromatography on Sephadex G-10 indicated the net formation and slow release of a radioactive product. High voltage electrophoresis showed that this product was 32Pi . Cr(III)ADP. Incubation of F1 with bidentate Cr(III)ATP also resulted in formation of this product. These results indicated that non-membrane-bound F1 was capable of net synthesis of what may be an ATP synthesis and hydrolysis transition state analog. The F1-dependent formation of the complex was taken as evidence that the soluble ATPase can function in ATP synthesis as well as ATP hydrolysis."

The resulting proteoliposomes were fused with erythrocytes in presence of La3+, Ca2+, or Mg2+. Subsequently, 45Ca uptake into the cells could be demonstrated. It was dependent on externally added ATP, inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and enhanced by inactivation of the endogenous Ca2+-ATPase which catalyzes Ca2+ extrusion from the cells. The insertion of the protein did not induce cell lysis, but the cells did become more fragile.

The arginine-modified protein lost its native structure and was biologically inactive in the inhibition of growth of HeLa cells, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and in vitro DNA strand scissions. Trypsin hydrolysis of 1,2-cyclohexanedione-modified neocarzinostatin resulted in selective cleavage of the Lys-Val (positions 20 and 21) bond of the primary structure yielding NH2-terminal 1-20 and the COOH-terminal 21-109 residue fragments. The latter contained modified arginine residues. Both peptide fragments were biologically inactive. Treatment of the arginine-modified neocarzinostatin and the arginine-protected 89-residue fragment with 0.25 M Tris-acetate buffer, pH 9.0, for 15 h resulted in the release of 1,2-cyclohexanedione, regenerating all three arginine residues. The regenerated protein and the 89-residue fragment were fully active biologically. Further, the regenerated 89-residue fragment possessed 70% of the reactivity of neocarzinostatin with antibody raised against the native protein. The conformation of the 89-residue fragment was almost identical with that of the native protein in CD spectral properties."

In circular dimers the crossover points are distributed uniformly along the chromosome, even in the presence of the RecB-dependent Chi recombinational hotspots.
