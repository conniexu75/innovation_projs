https://openalex.org/W1991415686,"Background & Objective Managing data from large-scale projects (such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)) for further analysis is an important and time consuming step for research projects. Several efforts, such as the Firehose project, make TCGA pre-processed data publicly available via web services and data portals, but this information must be managed, downloaded and prepared for subsequent steps. We have developed an open source and extensible R based data client for pre-processed data from the Firehouse, and demonstrate its use with sample case studies. Results show that our RTCGAToolbox can facilitate data management for researchers interested in working with TCGA data. The RTCGAToolbox can also be integrated with other analysis pipelines for further data processing.

Hyaluronan (HA) accumulation into artery walls supports vessel thickening and is involved in many cardiocirculatory diseases. Excessive cytosolic glucose can enter the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, increase UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) availability, and lead to modification of cytosolic proteins via O-linked attachment of the monosaccharide β-N-GlcNAc (O-GlcNAcylation) from UDP-GlcNAc by the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase. As many cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins can be glycosylated by O-GlcNAc, we studied whether the expression of the HA synthases that synthesize HA could be controlled by O-GlcNAcylation in human aortic smooth muscle cells. Among the three HAS isoenzymes, only HAS2 mRNA increased after O-GlcNAcylation induced by glucosamine treatments or by inhibiting O-GlcNAc transferase with PUGNAC (O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate). We found that the natural antisense transcript of HAS2 (HAS2-AS1) was absolutely necessary to induce the transcription of the HAS2 gene. Moreover, we found that O-GlcNAcylation modulated HAS2-AS1 promoter activation by recruiting the NF-κB subunit p65, but not the HAS2 promoter, whereas HAS2-AS1 natural antisense transcript, working in cis, regulated HAS2 transcription by altering the chromatin structure around the HAS2 proximal promoter via O-GlcNAcylation and acetylation. These results indicate that HAS2 transcription can be finely regulated not only by recruiting transcription factors to the promoter as previously described but also by modulating chromatin accessibility by epigenetic modifications."

The response to nitrogen starvation and high light leads to the accumulation of carbohydrates and fatty acids as well as increased activity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Although the behavior of individual pathways has been well investigated, little is known about the systemic effects of the stress response mechanism. Here we present time-resolved metabolite, enzyme activity, and physiological data that capture the metabolic response of H. pluvialis under nitrogen starvation and high light. The data were integrated into a putative genome-scale model of the green alga to in silico test hypotheses of underlying carbon partitioning. The model-based hypothesis testing reinforces the involvement of starch degradation to support fatty acid synthesis in the later stages of the stress response. In addition, our findings support a possible mechanism for the involvement of the increased activity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in carbon repartitioning. Finally, the in vitro experiments and the in silico modeling presented here emphasize the predictive power of large scale integrative approaches to pinpoint metabolic adjustment to changing environments.

Photosynthetic algae use light energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) to generate and store chemical energy. Under imbalanced growth conditions, the carbon fixed by algae can be directed toward compounds serving as storage reserves (e.g. starch and lipids), which can be readily used to provide energy and a carbon skeleton when needed (1Amin S.

The freshwater green microalga Hematococcus pluvialis has been extensively studied due to its ability to accumulate the valuable secondary metabolite astaxanthin (6Boussiba S. Vonshak A. Astaxanthin accumulation in the green alga Haematococcus pluvialis.Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 1077-1082Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This ketocarotenoid is a powerful antioxidant used as a food additive for humans and as a colorant in aquaculture (7Spolaore P. Joannis-Cassan C. Duran E. Isambert A. Commercial applications of microalgae.J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2006; 101: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2958) Google Scholar). Different stress conditions, including high salinity, high irradiance, and nutrient deprivation, induce the accumulation of astaxanthin to up to 4% of the cell's dry biomass (8Boussiba S.

However, the highest rate of accumulation was observed under the combined stress of nitrogen starvation and high light (HL) 3The abbreviations used are: HLhigh lightCHcarbohydrateFAfatty acidTAGtriacylglycerolInDisMinimizerintegrated discrepancy minimizerµEmicroeinsteinsDWdry weightChlchlorophyllTCHtotal carbohydrateFVAflux variability analysisTcartotal carotenoid. exposure (10Aflalo C.

Lett. 1999; 21: 601-604Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar), (e.g. the alga encysts and produces high amounts of carbohydrates (CHs) and fatty acids (FAs), which can reach up to 65 and 35% of the cell's dry biomass, respectively (6Boussiba S.

This behavior is unique in that most studied microalgae accumulate either FAs or CHs, but not both, when exposed to stress. high light carbohydrate fatty acid triacylglycerol integrated discrepancy minimizer microeinsteins dry weight chlorophyll total carbohydrate flux variability analysis total carotenoid. The temporal patterns of change in the cell's components upon nitrogen starvation and HL indicate that CH accumulation is an immediate response to the stress application, followed by FA accumulation (12Recht L. Zarka A. Boussiba S. Patterns of carbohydrate and fatty acid changes under nitrogen starvation in the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis and Nannochloropsis sp.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2012; 94: 1495-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), probably at the expense of the CHs. This observation suggests that the FAs are in part built from starch degradation derivatives. Similar results have been obtained in studies of species of the family Chlorellaceae; for instance, under sulfur deficiency, lipid accumulation begins with a reduction in stored starch (13Mizuno Y. Sato A. Watanabe K. Hirata A. Takeshita T. Ota S. Sato N. Zachleder V. Tsuzuki M. Kawano S. Sequential accumulation of starch and lipid induced by sulfur deficiency in Chlorella and Parachlorella species.Bioresour. Technol. 2013; 129: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and in Chlorella UTEX29, the number of lipid bodies increased while starch granules decreased after 24 h of nitrogen deprivation (14Goncalves E.C. Johnson J.V. Rathinasabapathi B.

Several studies have investigated the interplay of FA and CH biosynthesis and its regulation in microalgae, often with the aim of enhancing oil accumulation in the cell (15Sirevåg R. Levine R.P.

Posewitz M.C. Engineering algae for biohydrogen and biofuel production.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2009; 20: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). For example, it was shown that inactivation of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in a Chlamydomonas starchless mutant can lead to a 10-fold increase in triacylglycerol (TAG) (21Li Y. Han D. Hu G. Dauvillee D. Sommerfeld M. Ball S. Hu Q. Chlamydomonas starchless mutant defective in ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase hyper-accumulates triacylglycerol.Metab. Eng. 2010; 12: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); however, these findings are still being debated (3Siaut M. Cuiné S. Cagnon C. Fessler B. Nguyen M. Carrier P. Beyly A. Beisson F. Triantaphylidès C. Li-Beisson Y. Oil accumulation in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: characterization, variability between common laboratory strains and relationship with starch reserves.BMC Biotechnol. 2011; 11: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Recently, increasing attention has been given to carbon partitioning under different stress conditions (12Recht L. Zarka A. Boussiba S. Patterns of carbohydrate and fatty acid changes under nitrogen starvation in the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis and Nannochloropsis sp.Appl. Microbiol.

Eng. 2010; 12: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the interplay between carbon pools in microalgae is not entirely resolved. Furthermore, during the stress response H. pluvialis exhibits an increased activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. For the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as well as plants, it has been proposed that FA biosynthesis can be promoted by the enhanced activity of the TCA cycle (22Sweetlove L.J. Beard K.F.

The response of diatom central carbon metabolism to nitrogen starvation is different from that of green algae and higher plants.Plant Physiol. 2012; 158: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Moreover, in Hematococcus lacustris, transcriptome analysis of the response to high irradiance and nutrient starvation revealed a general increase in respiration transcripts (i.e. glycolysis, TCA cycle, electron transport, phosphorylation) during astaxanthin accumulation (25Kim D. Hong S. Bae J. Yim N. Jin E. Lee C. Transcriptomic analysis of Haematococcus lacustris during astaxanthin accumulation under high irradiance and nutrient starvation.Biotechnol. Bioprocess Eng. 2011; 16: 698-705Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the TCA cycle is known to function as an essential component of the respiratory metabolism contributing to the generation of energy in the cell (26Araújo W.L. Nunes-Nesi A. Nikoloski Z. Sweetlove L.J. Fernie A.R. Metabolic control and regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in photosynthetic and heterotrophic plant tissues.Plant Cell Environ. 2012; 35: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), its exact involvement in the stress response remains elusive. The temporal changes in the cell's major components and activity patterns suggest concerted repartitioning of the carbon pools and activation of the TCA cycle in response to environmental cues. This observation of a system-wide response reinforces the need to provide a system-based understanding of the metabolic regulation and constraints involved in the response of H. pluvialis to stress. One promising approach to tackling this task is metabolic profiling, which provides a snapshot of the metabolic status of a cell. As endogenous (e.g. developmental cues) and exogenous (e.g. environmental cues) factors induce perturbations at the levels of gene expression, post-transcriptional/post-translational regulation, and enzyme activity, these processes lead to a concerted shift in the metabolic status of the cell. When integrated with enzyme data, metabolite profiling can reveal the activity in parts of the metabolic network (27Gibon Y. Blaesing O.E. Hannemann J. Carillo P. Höhne M. Hendriks J.H. Palacios N. Cross J. Selbig J. Stitt M. A robot-based platform to measure multiple enzyme activities in Arabidopsis using a set of cycling assays: comparison of changes of enzyme activities and transcript levels during diurnal cycles and in prolonged darkness.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3304-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, only a few investigations on metabolomic and enzymatic data integration have been conducted in microalgae (23Lee do Y. Park J.J. Barupal D.K. Fiehn O. System response of metabolic networks in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to total available ammonium.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11: 973-988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Xiong W. Liu L. Wu C. Yang C.

Weiss J. May P. Kempa S. Irgang S. Recuenco-Munoz L. Pietzke M. Schwemmer T. Rupprecht J. Egelhofer V. Targeted proteomics for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii combined with rapid subcellular protein fractionation, metabolomics and metabolic flux analyses.Mol. Biosyst. 2010; 6: 1018-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and a systems-based study of the carbon-nitrogen metabolism in response to nitrogen starvation under HL in H. pluvialis is still lacking. In the present study, we explored the metabolic regulation and constraints of carbon partitioning under nitrogen starvation and HL in H. pluvialis. We integrated metabolite and enzyme activity data from H. pluvialis with the aim of generating a systems description of the microalga's metabolism. In addition, recent methodological developments have highlighted the possibility of predicting flux distributions and other molecular phenotypes by integrating experimental data with large scale metabolic models (30Lewis N.E. Nagarajan H. Palsson B.O. Constraining the metabolic genotype-phenotype relationship using a phylogeny of in silico methods.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). We therefore developed a putative genome-scale model for H. pluvialis by extending the existing model of Chlamydomonas to allow the integration of data about the cell's physiology (e.g. FA, astaxanthin, and starch) and enzyme activities. The resulting genome-scale network reconstruction (31Orth J.D. Thiele I. Palsson B.Ø. What is flux balance analysis?.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar) was employed in combination with a novel constraint-based modeling approach termed integrated discrepancy minimizer (InDisMinimizer) to investigate the following two questions. (i) Is starch degraded to supply carbon skeletons as precursors for the nitrogen starvation-induced FA synthesis? (ii) Does increased activity of the TCA cycle support FA biosynthesis? The results are discussed in the framework of the current knowledge on algal metabolism and its regulation under stress. H. pluvialis Flotow 1844em.Wille K-0084 was obtained from the Scandinavian Culture Center for Algae and Protozoa at the University of Copenhagen. The culture medium was BG-11 (32Stanier R.Y. Kunisawa R. Mandel M. Cohen-Bazire G. Purification and properties of unicellular blue-green algae (order Chroococcales).Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 171-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), modified according to Boussiba and Vonshak (6Boussiba S. Vonshak A. Astaxanthin accumulation in the green alga Haematococcus pluvialis.Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 1077-1082Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar). H. pluvialis was cultured as described previously (33Zhekisheva M. Zarka A. Khozin-Goldberg I. Cohen Z. Boussiba S. Inhibition of astaxanthin synthesis under high irradiance does not abolish triacylglycerol accumulation in the green alga Haematococcus pluvialis (Chlorophyceae).J. Phycol. 2005; 41: 819-826Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cultures of green (non-flagellated) cells were first cultivated for 5 days in mBG-11 medium at an irradiance of 75 µE m−2 s−1. Exponentially growing cells were washed in double-distilled water and then resuspended in nitrogen-free mBG-11 medium at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells ml−1. To induce a rapid stress response to nitrogen depletion, cultures were exposed to a HL intensity of 350 µE m−2 s−1 (10Aflalo C. Meshulam Y. Zarka A. Boussiba S. On the relative efficiency of two-vs. one-stage production of astaxanthin by the green alga: Haematococcus pluvialis.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2007; 98: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The culture was held under these stress conditions for either 48 or 96 h, as specified below. Samples were taken at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after the stress application for the 48-h exposure and at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h for the 96-h exposure to the stress conditions. The growth parameters: dry weight (DW), cell count, chlorophyll (Chl), and total carotenoid contents, were measured as described previously (6Boussiba S. Vonshak A. Astaxanthin accumulation in the green alga Haematococcus pluvialis.Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 1077-1082Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, DW determination was slightly modified, and the filters were dried in a microwave oven (Lenco model LMW-1826) at power level 3 for 8 min. Cell size was determined microscopically (Axioskop 1 (Zeiss) connected to an Olympus DP70 digital camera). Protein content was determined by the BCA method according to Smith et al. (34Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Measurement of protein using bicinchoninic acid.Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18590) Google Scholar). Total carbohydrate (TCH) content was determined by the anthrone method (35Roe J.H. The determination of sugar in blood and spinal fluid with anthrone reagent.J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 212: 335-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hewitt B.R. Spectrophotometric determination of total carbohydrate.Nature. 1958; 182: 246-247Google Scholar) with specific modifications for H. pluvialis (12Recht L. Zarka A. Boussiba S.

Residues were then hydrolyzed in boiling H2SO4 for 10 min. Once cooled to room temperature, 1 ml of anthrone reagent (35Roe J.H.

Spectrophotometric determination of total carbohydrate.Nature. 1958; 182: 246-247Google Scholar) was added to all samples and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and absorbance was read in a spectrophotometer at 625 nm. Samples were then quantified by comparison with a calibration curve made from glucose under the same conditions. Transmethylation of biomass, and quantification and qualification of FAs were determined as described by Zhekisheva et al. (33Zhekisheva M. Zarka A. Khozin-Goldberg I. Cohen Z. Boussiba S. Inhibition of astaxanthin synthesis under high irradiance does not abolish triacylglycerol accumulation in the green alga Haematococcus pluvialis (Chlorophyceae).J. Phycol. 2005; 41: 819-826Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transmethylation of FAs was performed by incubating freeze-dried biomass in dry methanol containing 2% (v/v) H2SO4 at 80 °C for 1.5 h under argon atmosphere and continuous stirring. Heptadecanoic acid (C17:0; Sigma-Aldrich) was added as an internal standard. FA methyl esters were quantified and qualified on a Trace GC Ultra (Thermo, Italy) equipped with flame ionization detector and programmed temperature vaporizing injector. The detector temperature was fixed at 280 °C, and helium was used as the carrier gas. The programmed temperature vaporizing injector was programmed to increase the temperature from 40 °C at time of injection to 300 °C at time of sample transfer. Separation was achieved on a fused silica capillary column (ZB-WAX+, Phenomenex, 30 m × 0.32 mm). FA methyl esters were identified by co-chromatography with authentic standards (Sigma-Aldrich). For routine measurements, samples (∼50 mg DW) were collected and centrifuged (4000 × g, for 5 min), supernatants were removed, and pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Prior to extraction, samples were resuspended in extraction buffer (27Gibon Y. Blaesing O.E. Hannemann J. Carillo P. Höhne M. Hendriks J.H. Palacios N. Cross J. Selbig J. Stitt M.

After centrifugation (4000 × g, for 5 min), the supernatant was removed, and samples were ground and stored at −80 °C. Extraction was then performed as described by Gibon et al. (37Gibon Y. Pyl E.T.

Measurements were performed for two different setups. In setup 1 (48 h), 10 enzymes were measured in two independent experiments (A and B) with four biological replicates each, and in setup 2 (96 h), 21 enzymes were measured in four independent experiments (C–F) with four biological replicates. A detailed list of the enzymes measured under each setup can be found in supplemental Information Sheet 1. Samples (∼15 mg DW) were collected and centrifuged (4000 × g, for 5 min), and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until extraction. Metabolite extraction followed an established protocol (41Lisec J. Schauer N. Kopka J. Willmitzer L.

https://openalex.org/W1988703754,"Most asexual species of fungi have either lost sexuality recently, or they experience recombination by cryptic sexual reproduction. Verticillium dahliae is a plant-pathogenic, ascomycete fungus with no known sexual stage, even though related genera have well-described sexual reproduction. V. dahliae reproduces mitotically and its population structure is highly clonal. However, previously described discrepancies in phylogenetic relationships among clonal lineages may be explained more parsimoniously by recombination than mutation; therefore, we looked for evidence of recombination within and between clonal lineages. Genotyping by sequencing was performed on 141 V. dahliae isolates from diverse geographic and host origins, resulting in 26,748 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We found a strongly clonal population structure with the same lineages as described previously by vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) and molecular markers. We detected 443 recombination events, evenly distributed throughout the genome. Most recombination events detected were between clonal lineages, with relatively few recombinant haplotypes detected within lineages. The only three isolates with mating type MAT1-1 had recombinant SNP haplotypes; all other isolates had mating type MAT1-2. We found homologs of eight meiosis-specific genes in the V. dahliae genome, all with conserved or partially conserved protein domains. The extent of recombination and molecular signs of sex in (mating-type and meiosis-specific genes) suggest that V. dahliae clonal lineages arose by recombination, even though the current population structure is markedly clonal. Moreover, the detection of new lineages may be evidence that sexual reproduction has occurred recently and may potentially occur under some circumstances. We speculate that the current clonal population structure, despite the sexual origin of lineages, has arisen, in part, as a consequence of agriculture and selection for adaptation to agricultural cropping systems."
https://openalex.org/W2108920219,"Moraxella catarrhalis is a significant cause of otitis media and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Here, we characterize a phase-variable DNA methyltransferase (ModM), which contains 5′-CAAC-3′ repeats in its open reading frame that mediate high-frequency mutation resulting in reversible on/off switching of ModM expression. Three modM alleles have been identified (modM1–3), with modM2 being the most commonly found allele. Using single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) genome sequencing and methylome analysis, we have determined that the ModM2 methylation target is 5′-GARm6AC-3′, and 100% of these sites are methylated in the genome of the M. catarrhalis 25239 ModM2 on strain. Proteomic analysis of ModM2 on and off variants revealed that ModM2 regulates expression of multiple genes that have potential roles in colonization, infection, and protection against host defenses. Investigation of the distribution of modM alleles in a panel of M. catarrhalis strains, isolated from the nasopharynx of healthy children or middle ear effusions from patients with otitis media, revealed a statistically significant association of modM3 with otitis media isolates. The modulation of gene expression via the ModM phase-variable regulon (phasevarion), and the significant association of the modM3 allele with otitis media, suggests a key role for ModM phasevarions in the pathogenesis of this organism.—Blakeway, L.

https://openalex.org/W1964033716,"Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been proven effective in promoting fracture healing but the underlying mechanisms are not fully depicted. We examined the effect of LIPUS on the recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the pivotal role of stromal cell-derived factor-1/C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (SDF-1/CXCR4) pathway in response to LIPUS stimulation, which are essential factors in bone fracture healing. For in vitro study, isolated rat MSCs were divided into control or LIPUS group. LIPUS treatment was given 20 minutes/day at 37°C for 3 days. Control group received sham LIPUS treatment. After treatment, intracellular CXCR4 mRNA, SDF-1 mRNA and secreted SDF-1 protein levels were quantified, and MSCs migration was evaluated with or without blocking SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway by AMD3100. For in vivo study, fractured 8-week-old young rats received intracardiac administration of MSCs were assigned to LIPUS treatment, LIPUS+AMD3100 treatment or vehicle control group. The migration of transplanted MSC to the fracture site was investigated by ex vivo fluorescent imaging. SDF-1 protein levels at fracture site and in serum were examined. Fracture healing parameters, including callus morphology, micro-architecture of the callus and biomechanical properties of the healing bone were investigated. The in vitro results showed that LIPUS upregulated SDF-1 and CXCR4 expressions in MSCs, and elevated SDF-1 protein level in the conditioned medium. MSCs migration was promoted by LIPUS and partially inhibited by AMD3100. In vivo study demonstrated that LIPUS promoted MSCs migration to the fracture site, which was associated with an increase of local and serum SDF-1 level, the changes in callus formation, and the improvement of callus microarchitecture and mechanical properties; whereas the blockade of SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling attenuated the LIPUS effects on the fractured bones. These results suggested SDF-1 mediated MSCs migration might be one of the crucial mechanisms through which LIPUS exerted influence on fracture healing."

Although several microRNAs (miRNAs) with aberrant expression have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of MS and EAE, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of abnormal miRNA expression in astrocytes upon IL-17 stimulation remain unclear. In the present study, we detected the changes of miRNA expression profiles both in the brain tissue of EAE mice and in cultured mouse primary astrocytes stimulated with IL-17 and identified miR-873 as one of the co-up-regulated miRNAs in vivo and in vitro. The overexpression of miR-873, demonstrated by targeting A20 (TNFα-induced protein 3, TNFAIP3), remarkably reduced the A20 level and promoted NF-κB activation in vivo and in vitro as well as increasing the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (i.e. IL-6, TNF-α, MIP-2, and MCP-1/5). More importantly, silencing the endogenous miR-873 or A20 gene with lentiviral vector of miR-873 sponge (LV-miR-873 sponge) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) of A20 (LV-A20 shRNA) in vivo significantly lessened or aggravated inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) of EAE mice, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2048452923,"This study aimed to investigate whether interindividual differences in autonomic inhibitory control predict safety learning and fear extinction in an interoceptive fear conditioning paradigm. Data from a previously reported study (N = 40) were extended (N = 17) and re-analyzed to test whether healthy participants' resting heart rate variability (HRV) - a proxy of cardiac vagal tone - predicts learning performance. The conditioned stimulus (CS) was a slight sensation of breathlessness induced by a flow resistor, the unconditioned stimulus (US) was an aversive short-lasting suffocation experience induced by a complete occlusion of the breathing circuitry. During acquisition, the paired group received 6 paired CS-US presentations; the control group received 6 explicitly unpaired CS-US presentations. In the extinction phase, both groups were exposed to 6 CS-only presentations. Measures included startle blink EMG, skin conductance responses (SCR) and US-expectancy ratings. Resting HRV significantly predicted the startle blink EMG learning curves both during acquisition and extinction. In the unpaired group, higher levels of HRV at rest predicted safety learning to the CS during acquisition. In the paired group, higher levels of HRV were associated with better extinction. Our findings suggest that the strength or integrity of prefrontal inhibitory mechanisms involved in safety- and extinction learning can be indexed by HRV at rest."

Manipulation of miR-539 may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of heart failure and other metabolic diseases. Heart failure is a multifactorial process and, despite some advances, few effective treatments have emerged in the last two decades. During heart failure, the myocardium undergoes profound alterations in gene expression and metabolic substrate utilization, which are associated with both pro- and maladaptive changes in mechanics and energetics (1.Mudd J.O. Kass D.A. Tackling heart failure in the twenty-first century.Nature. 2008; 451: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Likewise, nutrient and stress sensing mechanisms are also implicated, although debate still rages regarding what, exactly, such changes mean to the pathology or recovery of the failing heart. At the cellular level, an ever-growing list of post-translational modifications affects organ function. Of these numerous post-translational modifications, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) 2The abbreviations used are: O-GlcNAcO-linked N-acetylglucosamineOGTO-GlcNAc transferaseOGAO-GlcNAcaseMImyocardial infarctionmiRNAmicroRNANRCMsneonatal rat cardiomyocytesqRTquantitative RTBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolmmumus musculus. modification of proteins represents an emerging target in various pathologies (2.Ngoh G.A.

The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway forms UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which serves as the sugar donor for the O-GlcNAc modification. Two antagonistic enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA; human gene: MGEA5), directly regulate O-GlcNAcylation of proteins inasmuch as OGT catalyzes the addition of GlcNAc to some serine and/or threonine residues in proteins, whereas OGA removes it. Altered levels of O-GlcNAcylation occur in many pathological conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, neurodegeneration, and cancer (4.Jones S.P. Zachara N.E. Ngoh G.A.

Although there are plausible metabolic explanations that may partially explain increased O-GlcNAc levels in failing hearts, other possibilities exist. Although many regard flux of substrate through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway as the only (or at least primary) mechanism regulating O-GlcNAcylation, other regulatory mechanisms remain unexplored. Thus, understanding the mechanisms regulating expression of OGT and OGA persist as important limitations in the field. One potential area of molecular regulation may involve microRNAs (miRNAs), which are endogenous small RNAs (∼22 nucleotides) that play key regulatory roles in fine-tuning gene expression by ultimately inhibiting translation of their target mRNAs and such post-transcriptional regulation has been associated with various cardiovascular diseases (12.Small E.M.

Several diseases, at least experimentally, are improved by oligonucleotide-based technologies, making them attractive therapeutic candidates.

Body temperature was maintained at 36.5–37.5 °C using a rectal thermometer interfaced with a servo-controlled heat lamp throughout the procedure. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane then maintained under anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane and examined. Using the Vevo rail system, the mouse was placed chest up on an examination board interfaced with the Vevo 770. Next, depilatory cream was applied to the chest of the mouse and wiped clean to remove all hair in the area of interest. The 707-B (30 MHz) scan head was used to obtain two-dimensional images (100 frames/s) of the parasternal long axis. M-modes images were also acquired. The probe was then rotated to acquire a short axis view of the heart. Beginning at the level of the papillary muscles and moving apically, serial two-dimensional images were taken every millimeter. All measurements were taken using the rail system Vevo 770 to maintain probe placement and allow for minute adjustments of position. Left ventricular inner diameters during diastole and systole were determined from M-modes along with heart rate. Diastolic and systolic volumes were acquired by applying Simpson's rule of discs to the serially acquired short axis images. Stroke volume was calculated as: diastolic volume − systolic volume. Ejection fraction was calculated as: (stroke volume/diastolic volume) × 100%. Cardiac output was determined by: stroke volume × heart rate. After 5 and 28 days (to assess early and late stage heart failure), the infarcted and sham-operated mice were euthanized, and the hearts were rapidly excised and fixed for immunohistochemical analysis or immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. In brief, after excision, sham and infarcted mouse hearts (5 and 28 days) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C, then kept in PBS with 30% sucrose overnight at 4 °C, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), sectioned (10 µm) with cryostat (Leica, Germany), and placed on superfrost slides. The degree of myocardial infarction (MI) was evaluated using Masson's trichrome staining kit according to manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). Total RNA from the 5- and 28-day sham and infarcted mouse hearts (n = 4) was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Rodent miRNA microarray kit (Applied Biosystems) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 1 µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Megaplex RT primers (Megaplex RT Rodent Pool A), followed by a real-time PCR with TaqMan Rodent MicroRNA Array performed on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT System. SDS software version 2.3 and DataAssist version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems) were used to obtain the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) value. U6 small nuclear RNA included in the TaqMan Rodent MicroRNA Array was used as an endogenous control. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses were carried out using TaqMan miRNA assays (Applied Biosystems) according to the manual. Relative expression of miR-539 was calculated using the ΔΔCT method normalized to the expression of U6 small nuclear RNA (Applied Biosystems). Relative levels of OGA and OGT mRNA were examined with specific primers (OGA: forward, 5′-TGGAAGACCTTGGGTTATGG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGCTCAGCTTCTTCCACTGA-3′; OGT, forward, 5′-CCTGGGTCGCTTGGAAGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGGTTGCGTCTCAATTGCTTT-3′) using Fast SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) and normalized to levels of 18 S mRNA. All qRT-PCRs were performed in duplicate. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) were isolated from 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats according to the protocol described elsewhere (23.Jones S.P. Teshima Y. Akao M. Marbán E. Simvastatin attenuates oxidant-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac myocytes.Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 697-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The isolated cardiomyocytes were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and vitamin B12 in the presence of anti-mitotic BrdU (0.1 mm) for 4 days to inhibit fibroblast growth and subsequently grown in the absence of BrdU. HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. 293FT cells cultured in DMEM Glutamax (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and Geneticin (Invitrogen) were used for the lentivirus preparation. For luciferase assay, we transiently co-transfected (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen) pLenti6/V5-miR-539 or pLenti6/V5-scrambled (250 ng) overexpressing constructs with luciferase reporter plasmid containing wild type OGA-3′UTR (Genecopoeia, Inc.) or miR-539 binding seed mutant OGA-3′UTR (250 ng) in 60–70% confluent HEK293 cells grown in a 12-well plate. Renilla reporter plasmid (10 ng) was used as transfection control. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). The precursor miRNA-539 was amplified from mouse genomic DNA using forward (5′-CACGTGTGAGGAGTGGTGAT-3′) and reverse (5′-CCTTGTGCCCAGGTAAGG-3′) primers containing EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. Scrambled sequence amplified from pEZX-MR04 (GeneCopoeia, Inc.) using forward (5′-ACACCCTGTTTATTGATGCTGA-3′) and reverse (5′-CCTGTTATTCTCTGCTAACGCC-3′) primers was used as a control. The amplified precursor miRNA-539 and scrambled control were cloned into pLenti6/V5 plasmid and verified by sequencing. The integrity of miRNA-539 and scrambled control stem loop structure was analyzed using mfold version 2.3. 3 µg of pLenti6/V5-miR-539 was mixed with 9 µg of ViraPower Packaging Mix (Invitrogen) and transfected in 293FT cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. The pseudolentiviral particles released in the medium were concentered using Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) and titrated in NRCMs by qPCR using SV40 forward, 5′-GCTCCCCAGCAGGCAGAAGTATG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGGGGAGCCTGGGGACTTTCCAC-3′ primers. pLenti6/V5-mCherry was used as a transduction control. We examined the effect of miR-539 on OGA and OGT by transducing NRCMs and HEK293 cells with miR-539 lentivirus or scrambled or mCherry control lentiviruses. The cells were maintained in their regular growth medium for 2 days and selected with blasticidine for 5 days. Alternatively, cells were transfected with mirVanaTM miR-539 inhibitor or an negative control Oligonucleotides (10 nmol/liter) using LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) after 5 days of lentivirus treatment. Overexpression of miR-539 expression was verified by qRT-PCR using miRNA assay as described above and the loss or gain of OGA expression followed by miR-539 mimic/inhibitor was analyzed by Western blotting. The proteins from the hearts and whole cell lysate were separated in 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gel by electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed for OGA (1:1000; sc-135093, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), OGT (1:2000; O6264, Sigma), O-GlcNAc (1:1000; CTD 110.6, Covance; or RL2, Affinity Bioreagents), α-tubulin, or β-actin (1:2000, Sigma) followed by secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) using a standard protocol as described earlier (24.Facundo H.T. Brainard R.E. Watson L.J. Ngoh G.A. Hamid T. Prabhu S.D. Jones S.P. O-GlcNAc signaling is essential for NFAT-mediated transcriptional reprogramming during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2012; 302: H2122-H2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Densitometry analysis was performed using non-saturated chemiluminescent membranes exposed and quantified using Fuji LAS-3000 bio-imaging analyzer. MicroRNA-539 in situ hybridization was performed using the protocol described by Obernosterer et al. (25.Obernosterer G. Martinez J. Alenius M. Locked nucleic acid-based in situ detection of microRNAs in mouse tissue sections.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1508-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In brief, frozen sections of sham and infarcted mouse hearts (5 and 28 days) were prepared as mentioned earlier, washed in PBS for 10 min, placed in acetylation solution (98% diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, 1.3% triethanolamine, 0.175% HCl, 12% acetic anhydride) for 20 min and digested by Proteinase K (25 µg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature, washed in PBS for 5 min, and prehybridized (50% formamide, 25% 20× SSC, 10% 50× Denhardt's, 1.25% 20 mg/ml of yeast tRNA, 5% 10 mg/ml of salmon sperm DNA, 0.4 g of blocking reagents in 20 ml of solution and 8.75% diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water) at 50 °C for 4 h. The digoxigenin-labeled mmu-miR-539 LNA probe (Exiqon, Woburn, MA). Probes (1 nm) were denatured with denaturing hybridization solution (50% formamide, 25% 20× saline-sodium citrate (SSC), 10% 50× Denhardt's, 1.25% 20 mg/ml of yeast tRNA, 5% 10 mg/ml of salmon sperm DNA, 0.4 g of blocking reagents in 20 ml of solution, 2.5% of 10% CHAPS, 0.5 of 20% Tween, and 5.75% diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water) at 95 °C for 5 min, then added to the slides and hybridized at 50 °C for overnight. The slides were washed in 5× SSC for 5 min followed by 0.2× SSC for 60 min at 60 °C. After blocking for 1 h (2% fetal bovine serum), the sections were incubated with anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Applied Science; 1:2000) overnight at 4 °C. The bound antibody was detected by AP substrate, nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, toluidine salt for color development for 24–48 h at room temperature in the dark, and imaged using a NS-F12 camera mounted on a Nikon Eclipse Ni microscope. To determine whether additional insults, such as hypoxia-reoxygenation alter miR-539 levels, NRCMs were subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation as described (9.Zafir A. Readnower R. Long B.W. McCracken J. Aird A. Alvarez A. Cummins T.D. Li Q. Hill B.G. Bhatnagar A. Prabhu S.D. Bolli R. Jones S.P. Protein O-GlcNAcylation is a novel cytoprotective signal in cardiac stem cells.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 765-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were subjected to 3 h hypoxia in Esumi lethal ischemia medium for glucose and nutrient deprivation (containing 117 mmol/liter of NaCl, 12 mmol/liter of KCl, 0.9 mmol/liter of CaCl2, 0.49 mmol/liter of MgCl2, 4 mmol/liter of HEPES, 20 mmol/liter of sodium lactate, and 5.6 mmol/liter of l-glucose; pH 6.2) in a sealed humidified hypoxic chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Inc.) flushed with 5% CO2 and 95% N2, and maintained at 37 °C. After 3 h, the cells were switched to Esumi control medium (containing 137 mmol/liter of NaCl, 3.8 mmol/liter of KCl, 0.9 mmol/liter of CaCl2, 0.49 mmol/liter of MgCl2, 4 mmol/liter of HEPES, and 5.6 mmol/liter of d-glucose, pH 7.4) and allowed to reoxygenate for 3, 6, and 12 h in the modular incubator. Cells grown in the Esumi control medium for the same durations were used as normoxic controls. The expression of miR-539 and OGA protein level was analyzed as described above. Unpaired Student's t test was used for the comparison between two groups. Analysis of variance was performed when comparisons were made among three or more groups along with Scheffe's post hoc analysis. p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Masson's trichrome staining showed distinct blue collagen fibers and red myocytes in the sham and infarcted mouse hearts (Fig. 1, A–D). At 5 days the infarcted heart showed significantly decreased wall thickness with increased collagen deposition, which was greater at 28 days compared with the sham heart (Fig. 1, B and D). Echocardiography was performed at 5 and 28 days post-MI to demonstrate the severity of cardiac dysfunction. At 5 days after MI, hearts exhibited significant dilation (Fig. 1, E–H) and severely depressed cardiac function, as evidenced by significantly decreased stroke volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output (Fig. 1, I–L) when compared with sham-operated mice. Indeed, this defect persisted; echocardiography confirmed dysfunction 28 days after MI (Fig. 1, E–L). Global miRNA profiling analysis revealed that several miRNAs are differentially expressed (<0.7- or >2-fold) in 5- and 28-day failing hearts compared with sham heart (Table 1). To identify the miRNAs that target HBP, we performed target prediction analysis (TargetScan and MiRanda algorithms) and found a predicted miR-539 binding site in OGA-3′UTR (26.Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets.Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9835) Google Scholar). The miR-539 binding sites in the OGA-3′UTR are conserved among mouse, rat, and human (Fig. 2A). We performed qRT-PCR to confirm the miRNA microarray data. Specifically, miRNA-539 was up-regulated ∼5- and ∼3-fold (p < 0.05) in 5 and 28 days, respectively, in the infarcted heart compared with sham heart (Fig. 2B). Further in situ hybridization analysis with the miR-539 LNA probe revealed increased expression of miR-539 in the remote zone (non-infarcted) of the failing heart compared with the sham heart (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, a strong signal of miR-539 was observed in 5-day compared with 28-day failing heart and the sham hearts showed weak signals at both 5 and 28 days. Histomorphological observation also showed the perinuclear localization of miR-539 in the cardiomyocytes. Collectively these data demonstrate that miR-539 was significantly up-regulated in the failing heart by 5 days and through at least 28 days.TABLE 1miRNA expression in the failing heartMicroRNAHF vs. sham (mean ± S.D.)5 days28 daysmmu-let-7g0.54 ± 0.040.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-126–5p0.73 ± 0.050.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-1275.89 ± 0.353.87 ± 0.01mmu-miR-128a0.86 ± 0.150.69 ± 0.01mmu-miR-133a0.58 ± 0.140.48 ± 0.03mmu-miR-133b0.52 ± 0.060.49 ± 0.01mmu-miR-135a0.49 ± 0.040.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-135b0.40 ± 0.090.24 ± 0.01mmu-miR-139–5p0.52 ± 0.040.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-1401.77 ± 0.141.95 ± 0.01mmu-miR-142–3p4.23 ± 1.183.24 ± 0.59mmu-miR-142–5p3.80 ± 0.253.23 ± 0.01mmu-miR-1430.64 ± 0.050.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-1450.65 ± 0.040.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-148b0.70 ± 0.130.69 ± 0.02mmu-miR-1500.64 ± 0.040.49 ± 0.02mmu-miR-15b2.36 ± 0.151.94 ± 0.01mmu-miR-181a1.15 ± 0.110.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-1844.88 ± 2.554.59 ± 0.96mmu-miR-1870.77 ± 0.130.48 ± 0.02mmu-miR-18a4.24 ± 1.112.76 ± 0.02mmu-miR-1940.61 ± 0.150.48 ± 0.58mmu-miR-199a-3p5.23 ± 0.303.92 ± 0.01mmu-miR-200b0.20 ± 0.150.94 ± 0.03mmu-miR-2030.56 ± 0.060.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-2040.57 ± 0.140.49 ± 0.01mmu-miR-2080.88 ± 0.390.68 ± 0.01mmu-miR-214.59 ± 0.393.95 ± 0.01mmu-miR-2144.22 ± 1.362.75 ± 0.58mmu-miR-2150.66 ± 0.040.48 ± 0.02mmu-miR-2233.17 ± 0.861.93 ± 0.02mmu-miR-2242.40 ± 0.151.93 ± 0.01mmu-miR-26a0.61 ± 0.050.48 ± 0.04mmu-miR-296–5p5.46 ± 0.823.92 ± 0.03mmu-miR-29b1.07 ± 0.140.70 ± 0.58mmu-miR-30a0.61 ± 0.040.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-30b0.56 ± 0.040.49 ± 0.02mmu-miR-30c0.52 ± 0.110.34 ± 0.58mmu-miR-30e0.64 ± 0.120.34 ± 0.01mmu-miR-313.19 ± 0.161.93 ± 0.01mmu-miR-3280.62 ± 0.050.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-335–3p2.30 ± 0.181.93 ± 0.01mmu-miR-337–3p4.31 ± 0.323.86 ± 0.01mmu-miR-337–5p5.40 ± 0.793.89 ± 0.01mmu-miR-342–3p1.21 ± 1.380.96 ± 0.01mmu-miR-345–5p0.62 ± 0.120.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-34a0.66 ± 0.050.48 ± 0.02mmu-miR-34b-3p1.68 ± 0.161.94 ± 0.01mmu-miR-3512.91 ± 0.171.94 ± 0.03mmu-miR-3610.88 ± 0.050.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-362–3p2.49 ± 0.671.36 ± 0.58mmu-miR-376a13.82 ± 1.956.51 ± 0.02mmu-miR-376b3.45 ± 1.563.86 ± 0.03mmu-miR-376c4.34 ± 0.283.89 ± 0.01mmu-miR-3824.47 ± 0.487.96 ± 0.01mmu-miR-384–5p0.60 ± 0.170.34 ± 0.02mmu-miR-409–3p7.78 ± 3.227.71 ± 0.58mmu-miR-4106.91 ± 0.363.92 ± 0.01mmu-miR-4114.62 ± 1.303.88 ± 0.01mmu-miR-434–3p4.00 ± 1.122.70 ± 0.58mmu-miR-434–5p3.35 ± 0.992.73 ± 0.01mmu-miR-4860.46 ± 0.040.49 ± 0.01mmu-miR-487b4.05 ± 1.042.73 ± 0.58mmu-miR-4953.96 ± 0.233.93 ± 0.01mmu-miR-4990.55 ± 0.040.48 ± 0.01mmu-miR-5002.82 ± 0.732.77 ± 0.01mmu-miR-5033.54 ± 0.333.85 ± 0.01mmu-miR-5396.98 ± 2.825.59 ± 0.01mmu-miR-542–5p0.66 ± 0.040.48 ± 0.03mmu-miR-5431.79 ± 0.161.94 ± 0.01mmu-miR-6521.71 ± 0.141.95 ± 0.01mmu-miR-6674.73 ± 0.273.82 ± 0.01mmu-miR-6742.18 ± 0.601.93 ± 0.58mmu-miR-6851.52 ± 0.421.93 ± 0.02mmu-miR-7a2.64 ± 0.811.94 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab Use of qRT-PCR analysis showed significant down-regulation of OGA mRNA and protein levels in both 5- and 28-day infarcted hearts compared with sham hearts (Fig. 3, A an"
https://openalex.org/W1983206838,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that have a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and their misregulation is common in different types of cancer. Although it has been shown that miR-7 plays an oncogenic role in different cellular contexts, the molecular mechanisms by which miR-7 promotes cell transformation are not well understood. Here we show that the transcription factor KLF4 is a direct target of miR-7 and present experimental evidence indicating that the regulation of KLF4 by miR-7 has functional implications in epithelial cell transformation. Stable overexpression of miR-7 into lung and skin epithelial cells enhanced cell proliferation, cell migration and tumor formation. Alteration of these cellular functions by miR-7 resulted from misregulation of KLF4 target genes involved in cell cycle control. miR-7-induced tumors showed decreased p21 and increased Cyclin D levels. Taken together, these findings indicate that miR-7 acts as an oncomiR in epithelial cells in part by directly regulating KLF4 expression. Thus, we conclude that miR-7 acts as an oncomiR in the epithelial cellular context, where through the negative regulation of KLF4-dependent signaling pathways, miR-7 promotes cellular transformation and tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2070866550,"Background Tuberculosis is endemic in Cape Town, South Africa where a majority of the population become tuberculosis infected before adulthood. While social contact patterns impacting tuberculosis and other respiratory disease spread have been studied, the environmental determinants driving airborne transmission have not been quantified. Methods Indoor carbon dioxide levels above outdoor levels reflect the balance of exhaled breath by room occupants and ventilation. We developed a portable monitor to continuously sample carbon dioxide levels, which were combined with social contact diary records to estimate daily rebreathed litres. A pilot study established the practicality of monitor use up to 48-hours. We then estimated the daily volumes of air rebreathed by adolescents living in a crowded township. Results One hundred eight daily records were obtained from 63 adolescents aged between 12- and 20-years. Forty-five lived in wooden shacks and 18 in brick-built homes with a median household of 4 members (range 2–9). Mean daily volume of rebreathed air was 120.6 (standard error: 8.0) litres/day, with location contributions from household (48%), school (44%), visited households (4%), transport (0.5%) and other locations (3.4%). Independent predictors of daily rebreathed volumes included household type (p = 0.002), number of household occupants (p = 0.021), number of sleeping space occupants (p = 0.022) and winter season (p<0.001). Conclusions We demonstrated the practical measurement of carbon dioxide levels to which individuals are exposed in a sequence of non-steady state indoor environments. A novel metric of rebreathed air volume reflects social and environmental factors associated with airborne infection and can identify locations with high transmission potential."
https://openalex.org/W2113634951,"Exposure to nanoparticles (NPs) may cause vascular effects including endothelial dysfunction and foam cell formation, with oxidative stress and inflammation as supposed central mechanisms. We investigated oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and lipid accumulation caused by nano-sized carbon black (CB) exposure in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), THP-1 (monocytes) and THP-1 derived macrophages (THP-1a). The proliferation of HUVECs or co-cultures of HUVECs and THP-1 cells were unaffected by CB exposure, whereas there was increased cytotoxicity, assessed by the LDH and WST-1 assays, especially in THP-1 and THP-1a cells. The CB exposure decreased the glutathione (GSH) content in THP-1 and THP-1a cells, whereas GSH was increased in HUVECs. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was increased in all cell types after CB exposure. A reduction of the intracellular GSH concentration by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) pre-treatment further increased the CB-induced ROS production in THP-1 cells and HUVECs. The expression of adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, but not adhesion of THP-1 to HUVECs or culture dishes, was elevated by CB exposure, whereas these effects were unaffected by BSO pre-treatment. qRT-PCR showed increased VCAM1 expression, but no change in GCLM and HMOX1 expression in CB-exposed HUVECs. Pre-exposure to CB induced lipid accumulation in THP-1a cells, which was not affected by the presence of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. In addition, the concentrations of CB to induce lipid accumulation were lower than the concentrations to promote intracellular ROS production in THP-1a cells. In conclusion, exposure to nano-sized CB induced endothelial dysfunction and foam cell formation, which was not dependent on intracellular ROS production."
https://openalex.org/W2056979920,"Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1) is a component of the molecular machinery required for the biogenesis of specialized organelles and lysosomal targeting of cargoes via the endosomal to lysosomal trafficking pathway. BLOS1, one subunit of BLOC-1, is implicated in lysosomal trafficking of membrane proteins. We found that the degradation and trafficking of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were delayed in BLOS1 knockdown cells, which were rescued through BLOS1 overexpression. A key feature to the delayed EGFR degradation is the accumulation of endolysosomes in BLOS1 knockdown cells or BLOS1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts. BLOS1 interacted with SNX2 (a retromer subunit) and TSG101 (an endosomal sorting complex required for transport subunit-I) to mediate EGFR lysosomal trafficking. These results suggest that coordination of the endolysosomal trafficking proteins is important for proper targeting of EGFR to lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2101718405,"Biased agonism by G-protein-coupled receptor ligands has opened up strategies for targeted physiological or therapeutic actions. We hypothesized that urotensin II (UII)-derived peptides displayed unexpected physiological effects because of such biased signaling on the UII human urotensin (hUT) receptor. We determined the coupling to G proteins and β-arrestins of the UII-activated hUT receptor expressed in HEK293 using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) biosensors, as well as the production of IP1-3 and cAMP using homogenous time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (HTRF)-based assays. The activated receptor coupled to Gi1, GoA, Gq, and G13, excluding Gs, and recruited β-arrestins 1 and 2. Integration of these pathways led to a 2-phase kinetic phosphorylation of ERK1/2 kinases. The tested peptides induced three different profiles: UII, urotensin-related peptide (URP), and UII4-11 displayed the full profile; [Orn(8)]UII and [Orn(5)]URP activated G proteins, although with pEC50s 5-10× higher, and did not or barely recruited β-arrestin; urantide also failed to recruit β-arrestin but displayed a reversed rank order for Gi and Gq vs. Go pEC50s (-8.79±0.20, -8.43±0.21, and -7.86±0.36, respectively, for urantide, -7.87±0.10, -7.23±0.27, and -8.55±0.19, respectively, for [Orn(5)]URP) and was a partial agonist of all G-protein pathways. Interestingly, the peptides differently modulated cell survival but similarly induced cell migration and adhesion. Thus, we demonstrate biased signaling between β-arrestin and G proteins, and between G-protein subtypes, which dictates the receptor's cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W1968249262,"The importance of H2S as a physiological signaling molecule continues to develop, and ion channels are emerging as a major family of target proteins through which H2S exerts many actions. The purpose of the present study was to investigate its effects on T-type Ca(2+) channels. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrate that the H2S donor, NaHS (10 μM-1 mM) selectively inhibits Cav3.2 T-type channels heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, whereas Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channels were unaffected. The sensitivity of Cav3.2 channels to H2S required the presence of the redox-sensitive extracellular residue H191, which is also required for tonic binding of Zn(2+) to this channel. Chelation of Zn(2+) with N,N,N',N'-tetra-2-picolylethylenediamine prevented channel inhibition by H2S and also reversed H2S inhibition when applied after H2S exposure, suggesting that H2S may act via increasing the affinity of the channel for extracellular Zn(2+) binding. Inhibition of native T-type channels in 3 cell lines correlated with expression of Cav3.2 and not Cav3.1 channels. Notably, H2S also inhibited native T-type (primarily Cav3.2) channels in sensory dorsal root ganglion neurons. Our data demonstrate a novel target for H2S regulation, the T-type Ca(2+) channel Cav3.2, and suggest that such modulation cannot account for the pronociceptive effects of this gasotransmitter."
https://openalex.org/W2007092312,"Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the final and only committed acylation step in the synthesis of triacylglycerols. In this study, three novel AhDGATs genes were identified and isolated from peanut. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that the AhDGAT1-2 transcript was more abundant in roots, seeds, and cotyledons, whereas the transcript abundances of AhDGAT1-1 and AhDGAT3-3 were higher in flowers than in the other tissues examined. During seed development, transcript levels of AhDGAT1-1 remained relatively low during the initial developmental stage but increased gradually during later stages, peaking at 50 days after pegging (DAP). Levels of AhDGAT1-2 transcripts were higher at 10 and 60 DAPs and much lower during other stages, whereas AhDGAT3-3 showed higher expression levels at 20 and 50 DAPs. In addition, AhDGAT transcripts were differentially expressed following exposure to abiotic stresses or abscisic acid. The activity of the three AhDGAT genes was confirmed by heterologous expression in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae TAG-deficient quadruple mutant.

https://openalex.org/W2050660609,"Background Osteopathy is an increasingly popular health care modality to address pain and function in the musculoskeletal system, organs and the head region, as well as functional somatic syndromes. Although osteopathy is recommended principally in guidelines for management of back pain, osteopaths' scope of practice is wide, albeit poorly defined. In order to understand better the practice of osteopathy, this study aimed to investigate the most common reasons for osteopathic consultations in clinical settings in Quebec. Methods A prospective survey of members of the Registre des ostéopathes du Québec was conducted to examine demographics in osteopathic practices, as well as patients' primary reasons for consultations over a two-week period. The questionnaire was devised following a literature review and refined and verified with two stages of expert input. Results 277 osteopaths (60.1% response rate) responded to the survey notice. 14,002 patients' primary reasons for consultations were reported in completed questionnaires and returned by practicing osteopaths. Musculoskeletal pain located in the spine, thorax, pelvis and limbs was the most common reason for consultations (61.9%), with females consulting most commonly for cervical pain and males for lumbar pain. Perinatal and paediatric (11.8%), head (9.1%), visceral (5.0%) and general concerns (4.8%) were the other most common reasons for consultations. Preventive care represented the remaining 0.3%. Interpretation The nature of primary reasons for osteopathic consultations, coupled with documented satisfaction of patients with this approach, suggest a future for multidisciplinary collaborative health care including osteopathy. Results of this survey may contribute to informing physicians and others pending regulation of Quebec osteopaths, and also provide direction for future clinical research and guidelines development."
https://openalex.org/W2117905193,"Filarial parasites modulate effective immune response of their host by releasing a variety of immunomodulatory molecules, which help in the long persistence of the parasite within the host. The present study was aimed to characterize an immunomodulatory protein of Brugia malayi and its interaction with the host immune component at the structural and functional level. Our findings showed that Brugia malayi Calreticulin (BmCRT) is responsible for the prevention of classical complement pathway activation via its interaction with the first component C1q of the human host. This was confirmed by inhibition of C1q dependent lysis of immunoglobulin-sensitized Red Blood Cells (S-RBCs). This is possibly the first report which predicts CRT-C1q interaction on the structural content of proteins to explain how BmCRT inhibits this pathway. The molecular docking of BmCRT-C1q complex indicated that C1qB chain (IgG/M and CRP binding sites on C1q) played a major role in the interaction with conserved and non-conserved regions of N and P domain of BmCRT. Out of 37 amino acids of BmCRT involved in the interaction, nine amino acids (Pro(126), Glu(132), His(147), Arg(151), His(153), Met(154), Lys(156), Ala(196) and Lys(212)) are absent in human CRT. Both ELISA and in silico analysis showed the significant role of Ca(+2) in BmCRT-HuC1q complex formation and deactivation of C1r2-C1s2. Molecular dynamics studies of BmCRT-HuC1q complex showed a deviation from ∼ 0.4 nm to ∼ 1.0 nm. CD analyses indicated that BmCRT is composed of 49.6% α helix, 9.6% β sheet and 43.6% random coil. These findings provided valuable information on the architecture and chemistry of BmCRT-C1q interaction and supported the hypothesis that BmCRT binds with huC1q at their targets (IgG/M, CRP) binding sites. This interaction enables the parasite to interfere with the initial stage of host complement activation, which might be helpful in parasites establishment. These results might be utilized for help in blocking the C1q/CRT interaction and preventing parasite infection."
https://openalex.org/W2052007131,"Aphid populations show periodic fluctuations and many causes are attributed to their dynamic. We investigated the regulation by temperature of the aphid populations composed of Metopolophium dirhodum, Sitobion avenae, and Rhopalosiphum padi on winter wheat using a 24 years long time series data. We computed the sum of daily temperatures above 5°C, the threshold temperature for aphid development, and the sum of daily temperatures within the [0(threshold for wheat development),5] °C interval. Applying Generalised Additive Model framework we tested influences of temperature history expressed via degree days before the start of the aphid immigration on the length of their occurrence. We aimed to estimate the magnitude and direction of this influence, and how far to the past before the start of the aphid season the temperature effect goes and then identify processes responsible for the effect. We fitted four models that differed in the way of correcting for abundance in the previous year and in specification of temperature effects. Abundance in the previous year did not affect the length of period of aphid population growth on wheat. The temperature effect on the period length increased up to 123 days before the start of the current season, i.e. when wheat completed vernalization. Increased sum of daily temperatures above 5°C and the sum of daily temperatures within the [0,5] °C interval both shortened the length of period of aphid population growth. Stronger effect of the latter suggests that wheat can escape from aphid attacks if during winter temperatures range from 0 to 5°C. The temperature influence was not homogeneous in time. The strongest effect of past temperature was about 50 to 80 and 90 to 110 days before the beginning of the current aphid season indicating important role of termination of aphid egg dormancy and egg hatching."
https://openalex.org/W2065989165,"Electrical stimulation (ES) has been proven to be an effective means of enhancing the speed and accuracy of nerve regeneration. However, these results were recorded when the procedure was performed almost immediately after nerve injury. In clinical settings, most patients cannot be treated immediately. Some patients with serious trauma or contaminated wounds need to wait for nerve repair surgery. Delays in nerve repair have been shown to be associated with poorer results than immediate surgery. It is not clear whether electrical stimulation still has any effect on nerve regeneration after enough time has elapsed.A delayed nerve repair model in which the rats received delayed nerve repair after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months was designed. At each point in time, the nerve stumps of half the rats were bridged with an absorbable conduit and the rats were given 1 h of weak electrical stimulation. The other half was not treated. In order to analyze the morphological and molecular differences among these groups, 6 ES rats and 6 sham ES rats per point in time were killed 5 days after surgery. The other rats in each group were allowed to recover for 6 weeks before the final functional test and tissue observation.The amounts of myelinated fibers in the distal nerve stumps decreased as the delay in repair increased for both ES rats and sham ES rats. In the 1-day-delay and 1-week-delay groups, there were more fibers in ES rats than in sham ES rats. And the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) results were better for ES rats in these two groups. In order to analyze the mechanisms underlying these differences, Masson staining was performed on the distal nerves and quantitative PCR on the spinal cords. Results showed that, after delays in repair of 1 month and 2 months, there was more collagen tissue hyperplasia in the distal nerve in all rats. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and trkB expression levels in the spinal cords of ES rats were higher than in sham ES rats. However, these differences decreased as the delay in repair increased.Electrical stimulation does not continue to promote nerve regeneration after long delays in nerve repair. The effective interval for nerve regeneration after delayed repair was found to be less than 1 month. The mechanism seemed to be related to the expression of nerve growth factors and regeneration environment in the distal nerves."
https://openalex.org/W2049772404,"Off the Ningaloo coast of North West Western Australia, Spangled Emperor Lethrinus nebulosus are among the most highly targeted recreational fish species. The Ningaloo Reef Marine Park comprises an area of 4,566 km2 of which 34% is protected from fishing by 18 no-take sanctuary zones ranging in size from 0.08-44.8 km2. To better understand Spangled Emperor movements and the adequacy of sanctuary zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park for this species, 84 Spangled Emperor of a broad spectrum of maturity and sex were tagged using internal acoustic tags in a range of lagoon and reef slope habitats both inside and adjacent to the Mangrove Bay Sanctuary zone. Kernel Utilisation Distribution (KUD) was calculated for 39 resident individuals that were detected for more than 30 days. There was no relationship with fish size and movement or site fidelity. Average home range (95% KUD) for residents was 8.5±0.5 km2 compared to average sanctuary zone size of 30 km2. Calculated home range was stable over time resulting in resident animals tagged inside the sanctuary zone spending ∼80% of time within the sanctuary boundaries. The number of fish remaining within the array of receivers declined steadily over time and after one year more than 60% of tagged fish had moved outside the sanctuary zone and also beyond the 28 km2 array of receivers. Long term monitoring identified the importance of shifting home range and was essential for understanding overall residency within protected areas and also for identifying spawning related movements. This study indicates that despite exhibiting stable and small home ranges over periods of one to two years, more than half the population of spangled emperor move at scales greater than average sanctuary size within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park."
https://openalex.org/W2059672041,"Epac, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the low molecular weight G protein Rap, is an effector of cAMP signaling and has been implicated to have roles in numerous diseases, including diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and cancer. We used a computational molecular modeling approach to predict potential binding sites for allosteric modulators of Epac and to identify molecules that might bind to these regions. This approach revealed that the conserved hinge region of the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of Epac1 is a potentially druggable region of the protein. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assay (CAMYEL, cAMP sensor using YFP-Epac-Rluc), we assessed the predicted compounds for their ability to bind Epac and modulate its activity. We identified a thiobarbituric acid derivative, 5376753, that allosterically inhibits Epac activity and used Swiss 3T3 and HEK293 cells to test the ability of this compound to modulate the activity of Epac and PKA, as determined by Rap1 activity and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation, respectively. Compound 5376753 selectively inhibited Epac in biochemical and cell migration studies. These results document the utility of a computational approach to identify a domain for allosteric regulation of Epac and a novel compound that prevents the activation of Epac1 by cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2115509961,"Intracellular proteolytic pathways have been validated as rational targets in multiple myeloma with the approval of two proteasome inhibitors in this disease, and with the finding that immunomodulatory agents work through an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing Cereblon. Another E3 ligase that could be a rational target is the murine double minute (MDM) 2 protein, which plays a role in p53 turnover. A novel inhibitor of this complex, MI-63, was found to induce apoptosis in p53 wild-type myeloma models in association with activation of a p53-mediated cell death program. MI-63 overcame adhesion-mediated drug resistance, showed anti-tumor activity in vivo, enhanced the activity of bortezomib and lenalidomide, and also overcame lenalidomide resistance. In mutant p53 models, inhibition of MDM2 with MI-63 also activated apoptosis, albeit at higher concentrations, and this was associated with activation of autophagy. When MI-63 was combined with the BH3 mimetic ABT-737, enhanced activity was seen in both wild-type and mutant p53 models. Finally, this regimen showed efficacy against primary plasma cells from patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory myeloma. These findings support the translation of novel MDM2 inhibitors both alone, and in combination with other novel agents, to the clinic for patients with multiple myeloma."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role SUA levels may play in the prevalence, severity, and prognosis of CAD in premenopausal women.This cross-sectional retrospective study included 607 premenopausal women who had undergone coronary angiography. The CAD diagnosis was based upon stenosis affecting ≥ 50% of the luminal diameter. Association of the SUA levels with CAD prevalence, severity, and clinical outcomes were assessed by statistical analysis.In total, 369 (60.8%) of the patients were diagnosed with CAD. The CAD patients had significantly higher SUA levels than those without CAD (5.3 ± 1.9 vs. 4.8 ± 1.7 mg/dL, P = 0.001). The SUA levels were found to be significantly associated with CAD prevalence (P = 0.013). Patients with higher levels of SUA also showed increased rates of multivessel disease and composite end-points, such as major adverse cardiac events. Furthermore, multivariate analysis identified abnormally high levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia) as an independent risk factor for CAD (OR 1.51 (1.11-2.53), P<0.05).The SUA levels are significantly associated with the prevalence of CAD. The SUA levels may be a predictor for incidence of major cardiovascular events in premenopausal women."
https://openalex.org/W2008291698,"The tripartite interactions in a pathosystem involving wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), the Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), and the BYDV vector aphid Sitobion avenae were studied under field conditions to determine the impact of these interactions on aphid populations, virus pathology and grain yield. Wheat varietal resistance to BYDV and aphids varied among the three wheat varieties studied over two consecutive years. The results demonstrated that (1) aphid peak number (APN) in the aphid + BYDV (viruliferous aphid) treatment was greater and occurred earlier than that in the non-viruliferous aphid treatment. The APN and the area under the curve of population dynamics (AUC) on a S. avenae-resistant variety 98-10-30 was significantly lower than on two aphid-susceptible varieties Tam200(13)G and Xiaoyan6. (2) The production of alatae (PA) was greater on the variety 98-10-30 than on the other varieties, and PA was greater in the aphid + BYDV treatment on 98-10-30 than in the non-viruliferous aphid treatment, but this trend was reversed on Tam200(13)G and Xiaoyan6. (3) The BYDV disease incidence (DIC) on the variety 98-10-30 was greater than that on the other two varieties in 2012, and the disease index (DID) on Tam200(13)G was lower than on the other varieties in the aphid + BYDV and BYDV treatments in 2012, but not in 2011 when aphid vector numbers were generally lower. (4) Yield loss in the aphid + BYDV treatment tended to be greater than that in the aphid or BYDV alone treatments across varieties and years. We suggested that aphid population development and BYDV transmission tend to promote each other under field conditions. The aphids + BYDV treatment caused greater yield reductions than non-viruliferous aphids or virus treatment. Wheat varietal resistance in 98-10-30 affects the aphid dispersal, virus transmission and wheat yield loss though inhibits aphid populations from increasing."

Faithful chromosome segregation during cell division is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material. Centromeric chromatin specifies the site of assembly of the kinetochore, a massive, evolutionarily conserved protein complex that attaches chromosomes to microtubules for segregation. In contrast to the complex regional centromeres found in higher eukaryotic organisms, budding yeast has a simple point centromere (1.Furuyama S. Biggins S.

A centromeric histone H3 variant, collectively known as CenH3 and in budding yeast as Cse4, replaces histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes. Exclusive incorporation of CenH3 (or Cse4 in budding yeast) at the centromere is the foundation for proper kinetochore assembly, microtubule attachment, and chromosome segregation. Therefore, regulating Cse4 levels and deposition is a critical process. An increased dosage of Cse4 leads to mislocalization, kinetochore defects, and chromosome loss in budding yeast (4.Collins K.A.

Our results suggest that phosphorylation of Psh1 by CK2 promotes its E3 activity toward Cse4. Although deletion of CKA2 stabilized Cse4 more than deletion of PSH1, ectopic incorporation of Cse4 occurred at a lower level, suggesting that Psh1-Cse4 association itself prevents Cse4 misincorporation.

The lysate was sonicated using a Biorupter for 20 min (30 s on/off) at medium intensity. Protein concentration was determined, and samples were normalized before proceeding with the ChIP. 20% of total chromatin extract was used for IP using 2 µl of anti-Cse4 antibody and incubated at 4 °C overnight. 25 µl of Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen, 100-04D) prewashed in FA-Lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) were added and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were washed at room temperature with the following sequence of buffers; FA-Lysis buffer, FA-Lysis buffer with 1 m NaCl, FA-Lysis buffer with 500 mm NaCl, TEL buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% sodium deoxycholate), and twice with 1× Tris-EDTA. Chromatin fragments were eluted twice using 200 µl of Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 250 mm NaCl, and 1× Tris-EDTA) at 65 °C with agitation. Two elutions were combined, treated with Proteinase K for 1 h at 55 °C, and incubated overnight at 65 °C. DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated using 100% ethanol. 2% of the total chromatin extract was processed for the input sample. Cse4 ChIPs were performed in triplicate with two no-antibody controls for each strain. Quantitative PCR was performed in triplicate for each sample using a Quanta Biosciences Perfecta SYBR Green FastMix. The method for FLAG-His6-Psh1 expression and purification has been published (11.Hewawasam G. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Venkatesh S. Martin-Brown S. Florens L. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L. Psh1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the centromeric histone variant Cse4.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 444-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recombinant CK2 was purchased from New England Biolabs (catalog number P6010L). How Psh1 E3 ligase activity is controlled is unknown, but we suspected that PTMs played a role. To investigate whether PTMs could regulate Psh1 activity, we affinity-purified Psh1-TAP and analyzed samples using mass spectrometry (MS) for PTMs. We were able to identify multiple phosphorylation sites in Psh1 (Fig. 1A). The Psh1-TAP purification is enriched mainly for the soluble pool of Psh1. To specifically examine centromere-associated Psh1, we purified kinetochore proteins using Dsn1-FLAG, a subunit of the kinetochore MIND complex (18.Akiyoshi B. Sarangapani K.K. Powers A.F. Nelson C.R. Reichow S.L. Arellano-Santoyo H. Gonen T. Ranish J.A. Asbury C.L. Biggins S. Tension directly stabilizes reconstituted kinetochore-microtubule attachments.Nature. 2010; 468: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and analyzed PTMs of the Psh1 in these samples by MS. We identified the same phosphorylation sites in centromere-associated Psh1 as found in Psh1-TAP samples as well as two additional sites (Fig. 1A). Major phosphorylation sites with >20% of modified/total spectra are indicated in Fig. 1B relative to the major protein domains in Psh1. To further confirm the phosphorylation of Psh1, we used an epitope-tagged Psh1-HA strain (Fig. 1C). Psh1-HA was immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts, and eluates were subjected to shrimp alkaline phosphatase treatment to remove phosphate groups from phosphorylated proteins. Samples were analyzed by Phos-tag-SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. On a Phos-tag gel, phosphorylated proteins migrate more slowly compared with lesser or non-phosphorylated counterparts. We detected a faster migrating Psh1-HA band in the shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated sample compared with the untreated sample, further confirming in vivo phosphorylation of Psh1. CK2 is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase in eukaryotic organisms. This versatile kinase controls many important cellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, translation, metabolism, and cell cycle progression. Hundreds of CK2 substrates have been identified so far (19.Meggio F. Pinna L.A. One-thousand-and-one substrates of protein kinase CK2?.FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). CK2 is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits. In budding yeast, the catalytic subunits are Cka1 and Cka2, and the regulatory subunits are Ckb1 and Ckb2. Most of the Psh1 phosphorylation sites identified by MS are predicted to be CK2 sites by NetPhosK, a program for prediction of potential kinases. These potential CK2 sites are depicted in black bars in Fig. 1A. In addition, all four subunits of CK2 co-purified with Psh1-TAP (Fig. 1D), further suggesting CK2 as a potential kinase for Psh1. To determine whether CK2 is a kinase for Psh1, we performed a kinase assay in vitro utilizing recombinant Psh1, CK2, and radiolabeled ATP (Fig. 1E). The autoradiograph clearly shows phosphorylated Psh1 in the presence of both CK2 and ATP, suggesting that Psh1 is a substrate for CK2. Recombinant Psh1 used in this assay was purified using a baculovirus expression system in insect cells. The lower intensity phosphorylated Psh1 band observed with the control sample without CK2 (Fig. 1E, lane 4) is possibly due to some kinase activity that co-purified with Psh1. To identify which subunit of CK2 is responsible for phosphorylating Psh1, we deleted each catalytic subunit (cka1Δ or cka2Δ) in the strain expressing Psh1-HA. Single deletions were made because double deletion of the two catalytic subunits is reported to be lethal (20.Glover 3rd, C.V. On the physiological role of casein kinase II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 95-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cell lysates of the mutants were compared with WT using Phos-tag-SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1F). Psh1-HA in the cka1Δ strain migrated similarly to WT, whereas in the cka2Δ strain it showed a faster migrating, lesser or non-phosphorylated band, suggesting that Cka2 is primarily responsible for Psh1 phosphorylation. To identify the subunits of CK2 that are physically interacting with Psh1, epitope-tagged strains with Psh1-HA/Ckb1-FLAG and Psh1-HA/Ckb2-FLAG were used to perform co-IP and Western blotting (Fig. 1G). We were able to detect both Ckb1 and Ckb2 interacting with Psh1. However, the interaction between Psh1 and Ckb1 was much stronger. These data demonstrate that CK2 is a kinase for Psh1 with catalysis and interaction primarily mediated by Cka2 and Ckb1, respectively. Psh1 contains a RING domain, a type of zinc finger that can bind two zinc cations, and a zinc finger domain (Fig. 1B). The RING domain is essential for the Psh1-Cse4 interaction, and a mutation in the RING domain stabilizes Cse4 (11.Hewawasam G. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Venkatesh S. Martin-Brown S. Florens L. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L. Psh1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the centromeric histone variant Cse4.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 444-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We tested the RING and zinc finger mutants for interaction with Ckb1 of CK2 and Ubc3/Cdc34, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme for Psh1 (see comment in Hewawasam et al. (11.Hewawasam G. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Venkatesh S. Martin-Brown S. Florens L. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L. Psh1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the centromeric histone variant Cse4.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 444-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar)). Co-IP showed that the Ckb1-Psh1 interaction required the RING finger domain of Psh1 (Fig. 1H). The RING domain appears to be required for Psh1 to interact with both Cse4 and Ckb1. However, neither the RING nor zinc finger domain was required for the Psh1-Ubc3 interaction (data not shown). This suggests that the interaction between Psh1 and Ubc3 is facilitated by an unidentified region of Psh1. PSH1 is not an essential gene, and a simple deletion of PSH1 does not cause a defect in a minichromosome loss assay (11.Hewawasam G. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Venkatesh S. Martin-Brown S. Florens L. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L. Psh1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the centromeric histone variant Cse4.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 444-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Deletion of PSH1 resulted in slow growth when Cse4 was overexpressed from the GAL promoter on a 2-µm plasmid. Cse4 overexpression in a psh1Δ strain alters kinetochore function as revealed by a delay in destruction of anaphase inhibitor Pds1 (12.Ranjitkar P. Press M.O. Yi X. Baker R. MacCoss M.J. Biggins S. An E3 ubiquitin ligase prevents ectopic localization of the centromeric histone H3 variant via the centromere targeting domain.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 455-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). If CK2 is important for Psh1-mediated Cse4 regulation, then overexpression of Cse4 in a CK2 mutant might be expected to show a growth phenotype similar to PSH1 deletion, and Cse4 protein levels should be subsequently stabilized. To test this, we overexpressed Cse4 in catalytic subunit deletion mutants cka1Δ and cka2Δ (Fig. 2A). We observed slow growth with cka2Δ but not with cka1Δ (Fig. 2A, compare cka1Δ+CSE4 and cka2Δ+CSE4 with psh1Δ+CSE4), consistent with our observation that Cka2 was primarily responsible for phosphorylation of Psh1. Cse4 overexpression in the double mutant psh1Δcka2Δ showed a growth phenotype similar to that of either single mutant, suggesting the Psh1 and Cka2 function in the same pathway to control Cse4 levels. We then examined the Cse4 protein levels in these strains using a protein stability assay (Fig. 2B). After Gal induction of Cse4 overexpression, cycloheximide (CHX) was added to inhibit protein translation, and the level of Cse4 in cell lysates was determined at different time points using Western blotting with anti-Cse4 antibody. We observed highly stabilized Cse4 levels in a cka2Δ mutant compared with a WT strain, and the half-life of Cse4 (Cse4 t½) was about 3 times longer in a cka2Δ strain (Fig. 2B, left panel). Cse4 was more stabilized by cka2Δ than psh1Δ. We next measured the stability of endogenous levels of Cse4-Myc (Fig. 2C). Cse4-Myc was also stabilized in a cka2Δ strain compared with a WT strain. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Psh1 by CK2 may promote its E3 activity for Cse4. Because the two stability assays in Fig. 2B were performed separately, the difference in Cse4 stability in WT strain between the left and right panels could be due to fluctuations in the experimental conditions. However, the two stability assays with Cse4 overexpression resulted in an average Cse4 t½ of 12 min for WT strain, which is comparable with a Cse4 t½ of WT strain (12.7 min) with endogenous Cse4 levels in Fig. 2C. Conversely, in cka2Δ strain, Cse4 t½ was elevated with Cse4 overexpression (Fig. 2, compare B, left panel, with C; 29.0 versus 18.2 min, respectively). Assuming that the experimental conditions are comparable in Fig. 2, B, left panel, and C, a high level of soluble Cse4 and inefficient Cse4 degradation in the absence of Cka2 may elevate Cse4 t½ in the cka2Δ strain with Cse4 overexpression. We next examined ubiquitylated forms of Cse4 in WT and cka2Δ strains with both endogenous Cse4 and overexpression (Fig. 3). Cells expressing Cse4-Myc at endogenous levels were grown to midlog phase and treated with MG132 for 2 h to inhibit proteasome function. Pdr5, a plasma membrane transporter, is deleted from these strains to improve MG132 uptake. The efficiency of proteasome inhibition was confirmed by high accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins in MG132-treated cells compared with DMSO control samples (Fig. 3A, left panel, anti-ubiquitin Western blot). Anti-Myc Western blotting showed similar Cse4-Myc levels in the lysates (Fig. 3A, left panel). Polyubiquitylated proteins were pulled down from MG132-treated samples using polyubiquitin affinity resin, and eluates were probed with anti-ubiquitin and anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 3A, right panel). Pulldown samples probed with anti-ubiquitin showed that the efficiency of enrichment of polyubiquitylated proteins was nearly the same. A psh1Δ strain was included as a control. We did not observe an obvious difference in polyubiquitylated Cse4-Myc (Ubn-Cse4-Myc) levels among WT, cka2Δ, and psh1Δ strains when Cse4-Myc was expressed at an endogenous level. The Cse4 stability assay in Fig. 2B suggests that a reduction in the Ubn-Cse4 levels between WT and cka2Δ might be more obvious if Cse4 was overexpressed. Therefore, we examined Ubn-Cse4 levels in the strains in Fig. 2B (Fig. 3B). After Gal induction of Cse4, cells were treated with MG132. The method described in Liu et al. (21.Liu C. Apodaca J. Davis L.E. Rao H. Proteasome inhibition in wild-type yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.BioTechniques. 2007; 42 (162): 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was used to inhibit proteasome function using MG132. The efficiency of proteasome inhibition was confirmed by high accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins in MG132-treated cells compared with DMSO control samples (Fig. 3B, left panel, anti-ubiquitin Western blot). Anti-Cse4 Western blotting showed similar Cse4 levels in the lysates (Fig. 3B, left panel). Polyubiquitylated proteins were pulled down as explained before, and samples were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B, right panel). The efficiency of enrichment of polyubiquitylated proteins in MG132-treated samples was very similar, and the signal was reduced in DMSO control samples. Ubn-Cse4 was detected only in MG132-treated samples, confirming that these bands are polyubiquitylated Cse4 normally targeted for proteasomal degradation. Under our experimental conditions, we could not observe an obvious difference in Ubn-Cse4 levels between WT and psh1Δ strains, suggesting that differences in ubiquitylation may be more difficult to detect than differences in protein stability. As expected, however, we detected a dramatic reduction in Ubn-Cse4 levels in a cka2Δ strain compared with WT. These results further suggest that CK2 promotes ubiquitylation and degradation of Cse4. Cse4 is only partially stabilized in a psh1Δ strain, indicating the presence of additional factors controlling Cse4 levels in vivo (11.Hewawasam G. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Venkatesh S. Martin-Brown S. Florens L. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L. Psh1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the centromeric histone variant Cse4.Mol.

Interestingly, Cse4 was more stabilized by cka2Δ than psh1Δ (Fig. 2B), suggesting that CK2 may control factors in addition to Psh1. Ubc3/Cdc34, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme for Psh1, is regulated by CK2 phosphorylation (15.Block K. Boyer T.G. Yew P.R.

The CK2 phosphorylation of catalytic domain of Cdc34 modulates its activity at the G1 to S transition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1391-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). CK2 phosphorylation within the N-terminal catalytic domain of Ubc3 up-regulates its ubiquitin charging activity (16.Coccetti P. Tripodi F. Tedeschi G. Nonnis S. Marin O. Fantinato S. Cirulli C.

Therefore, in a cka2Δ mutant, ubiquitin charging of Ubc3 might be inefficient, causing extra stabilization of Cse4 levels. Recently, Fpr3 has been reported as another regulator of Cse4 stability (22.Ohkuni K. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K.

https://openalex.org/W2101153749,"This study assessed the effects of Coprinus comatus cap (CCC) on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and the effects of CCC on the development of diet-induced obesity in rats. Here, we showed that the CCC has an inhibitory effect on the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, resulting in a significant decrease in lipid accumulation through the downregulation of several adipocyte specific-transcription factors, including CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β, C/EBPδ, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). Moreover, treatment with CCC during adipocyte differentiation induced a significant down-regulation of PPARγ and adipogenic target genes, including adipocyte protein 2, lipoprotein lipase, and adiponectin. Interestingly, the CCC treatment of the 3T3-L1 adipocytes suppressed the insulin-stimulated Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation, and these effects were stronger in the presence of an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation, LY294002, suggesting that CCC inhibited adipocyte differentiation through the down-regulation of Akt signaling. In the animal study, CCC administration significantly reduced the body weight and adipose tissue weight of rats fed a high fat diet (HFD) and attenuated lipid accumulation in the adipose tissues of the HFD-induced obese rats. The size of the adipocyte in the epididymal fat of the CCC fed rats was significantly smaller than in the HFD rats. CCC treatment significantly reduced the total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the serum of HFD rats. These results strongly indicated that the CCC-mediated decrease in body weight was due to a reduction in adipose tissue mass. The expression level of PPARγ and phospho-Akt was significantly lower in the CCC-treated HFD rats than that in the HFD obesity rats. These results suggested that CCC inhibited adipocyte differentiation by the down-regulation of major transcription factor involved in the adipogenesis pathway including PPARγ through the regulation of the Akt pathway in 3T3-L1 cells and HFD adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1983660269,"The classical antivenom therapy has appreciably reduced snakebite mortality rate and thus is the only savior drug available. Unfortunately, it considerably fails to shield the viper bite complications like hemorrhage, local tissue degradation and necrosis responsible for severe morbidity. Moreover, the therapy is also tagged with limitations including anaphylaxis, serum sickness and poor availability. Over the last decade, snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs) are reported to be the primary component responsible for hemorrhage and tissue degradation at bitten site. Thus, antivenom inability to offset viper venom-induced local toxicity has been a basis for an insistent search for SVMP inhibitors. Here we report the inhibitory effect of compound 5d, an apigenin based molecule against SVMPs both in silico and in vivo. Several apigenin analogues are synthesized using multicomponent Ugi reactions. Among them, compound 5d effectively abrogated Echis carinatus (EC) venom-induced local hemorrhage, tissue necrosis and myotoxicity in a dose dependant fashion. The histopathological study further conferred effective inhibition of basement membrane degradation, and accumulation of inflammatory leucocytes at the site of EC venom inoculation. The compound also protected EC venom-induced fibrin and fibrinogen degradation. The molecular docking of compound 5d and bothropasin demonstrated the direct interaction of hydroxyl group of compound with Glu146 present in hydrophobic pocket of active site and does not chelate Zn2+. Hence, it is concluded that compound 5d could be a potent agent in viper bite management."

Certain genetic mutations affecting the proteins in the phototransduction cascade cause blinding disorders in humans.

These changes were not observed in the cGMP-gated channel knock-out rods, an equivalent light condition that mimics light-stimulated channel closure. Thus transducin signaling, but not channel closure, triggers rapid cell death in light damage caused by constitutive phototransduction. Additionally, we show that in the albino light damage model cell death was not associated with increase in global protein ubiquitination or unfolded protein response induction.

Retinal light toxicity.Eye. 2011; 25: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and different experimental paradigms of light damage have been used to investigate the mechanism of photoreceptor cell apoptosis. The use of rhodopsin knock-out and RPE65-deficient mice clearly showed the requirement of rhodopsin and a functioning visual cycle in light damage (7.Grimm C. Wenzel A. Hafezi F. Yu S. Redmond T.M.

Downstream of rhodopsin, two distinct pathways are known (8.Hao W. Wenzel A. Obin M.S. Chen C.K. Brill E. Krasnoperova N.V. Eversole-Cire P. Kleyner Y. Taylor A. Simon M.I. Grimm C. Remé C.E. Lem J. Evidence for two apoptotic pathways in light-induced retinal degeneration.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The first involves bright light activating a large amount of rhodopsin, R*. Early changes in this pathway include a large increase in intracellular Ca2+ within the rod photoreceptors (9.Donovan M. Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. Light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis in vivo requires neuronal nitric-oxide synthase and guanylate cyclase activity and is caspase-3-independent.J. Biol.

Gene expression in the mouse retina: the effect of damaging light.Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 252-260PubMed Google Scholar). Cell death in this pathway is independent of the visual G-protein transducin but is prevented in the c-Fos-deficient mice (11.Hafezi F. Steinbach J.P. Marti A. Munz K. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. Aguzzi A.

The second pathway involves constitutive G-protein signaling. In retinal rods, photolyzed rhodopsin activates several transducin molecules which in turn activate the effector enzyme PDE6. PDE6 hydrolyzes cGMP, leading to closure of the cGMP-gated (CNG) channel. Photolyzed rhodopsin is deactivated by rhodopsin kinase (GRK1)-mediated phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues at the carboxyl terminus of rhodopsin (12.Wilden U. Kühn H. Light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin: number of phosphorylation sites.Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) followed by arrestin (ARR1) binding (13.Wilden U.

How constitutive G-protein signaling leads to photoreceptor cell death is not well understood but is an important question to address inasmuch as defects in ARR1 and GRK1 genes occur in the human population (19.Fuchs S. Nakazawa M. Maw M. Tamai M. Oguchi Y. Gal A. A homozygous 1-base pair deletion in the arrestin gene is a frequent cause of Oguchi disease in Japanese.Nat.

Defects in the rhodopsin kinase gene in the Oguchi form of stationary night blindness.Nat.

Fain G. Support for the equivalent light hypothesis for RP.Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1254-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Light damage to photoreceptors in the albino BALB/c mice is caused by pathologically high levels of light-activated rhodopsin, R*, produced even under relatively low ambient illumination. Two factors contribute to generate high levels of R* in BALB/c mice: first, the lack of pigment in the iris that normally restricts the amount of light reaching the neural retina; and second, a robust RPE65 enzyme that rapidly regenerates the visual pigment rhodopsin (22.Wenzel A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P. Hafezi F. Grimm C. The Rpe65 Leu450Met variation increases retinal resistance against light-induced degeneration by slowing rhodopsin regeneration.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the pigmented iris of C57/B6 and ARR1−/− mice (which are in C57/B6 background) reduces the amount of light reaching the retina by 2 orders of magnitude relative to that of albino mice (23.Rapp L.M. Williams T.P. The role of ocular pigmentation in protecting against retinal light damage.Vision Res. 1980; 20: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Further, the Met-450 variant of RPE65 expressed in C57/B6 mice is less active and slows the kinetics of rhodopsin regeneration by 4-fold when compared with the Leu-450 variant expressed by BALB/c mice (22.Wenzel A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P. Hafezi F. Grimm C. The Rpe65 Leu450Met variation increases retinal resistance against light-induced degeneration by slowing rhodopsin regeneration.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the difference in the levels of R* generated by the same light exposure to BALB/c and C57 mice can be ≥400-fold, making the albino BALB/c mice an ideal light damage model to isolate the toxic effect of excessive R*, which generates reactive oxygen species and cause oxidative stress (2.Athanasiou D. Aguilà M. Bevilacqua D. Novoselov S.S. Parfitt D.A. Cheetham M.E.

Williams D.R. The susceptibility of the retina to photochemical damage from visible light.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2012; 31: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In wild type mice, rhodopsin catalytic lifetime has been estimated to be as short as 40 ms (25.Burns M.E. Pugh Jr., E.N. Lessons from photoreceptors: turning off G-protein signaling in living cells.Physiology. 2010; 25: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, in the ARR1−/− rods, the light response is abnormally prolonged. Rhodopsin phosphorylation proceeds normally in the ARR1−/− rods and decreases the catalytic activity of rhodopsin by ∼70%; full recovery follows the time course of meta II decay, which on average is ∼42 s in mouse rods (14.Xu J. Dodd R.L. Makino C.L. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Prolonged photoresponses in transgenic mouse rods lacking arrestin.Nature. 1997; 389: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Assuming in wild type rods that rhodopsin phosphorylation occurs halfway through its catalytic lifetime and the rate of transducin activation is 1,300 Gt*/s (26.Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Maximal rate and nucleotide dependence of rhodopsin-catalyzed transducin activation: initial rate analysis based on a double displacement mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10000-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the number of transducin activated is estimated to be 34 ([1,300 Gt*/s × 0.02 s] + [1.300 Gt*/s × 0.02 s × 0.3] = 34 Gt*). In contrast, the long R* lifetime in the ARR1−/− would activate 16,400 Gt (1,300 Gt*/s × 42 s × 0.3), which is ∼480-fold more than wild type. Although high levels of R* generated in the albino mouse model will also activate Gt*, the amount is expected to be lower than ARR1−/− [34Gt*/s × 100 (for pupil dilation) = 3,400 Gt*/s]. Thus ARR1−/− mice is an ideal model system to isolate the deleterious effect of prolonged transducin activation. In the present study, we compared the initial molecular events following light exposure in the albino BALB/c and the pigmented ARR1−/− mice using an experimental paradigm that produced a similar degree of photoreceptor cell death in both models. We showed that prolonged G-protein signaling caused by the lack of ARR1 led to a rapid induction of the PERK arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) 2The abbreviations used are: UPRunfolded protein responseONLouter nuclear layerGCguanylyl cyclaseUPSubiquitin-proteasome systemRPEretinal pigmented epitheliumERendoplasmic reticulumANOVAanalysis of varianceCNGcyclic nucleotide-gated. followed by a coordinated increase in global protein ubiquitination and degradation of PDE6 and guanylyl cyclase activating protein 2 (GCAP2). These changes were prevented when G-protein signaling was abolished in the GNAT1−/− background. Transducin activation leads to closure of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels. However, light damage did not occur in the CNG channel knock-out rods, suggesting that G-protein signaling, but not channel closure, initiates the cell death pathway. In the albino light damage model, light-exposed BALB/c retinas showed equivalent degradation of phototransduction proteins without an increase in protein ubiquitination or induction of ER stress.

All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with regulations established by the National Institutes of Health. The animal protocol was approved by the University of Southern California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The ARR1−/−, GRK1−/−, GNAT1−/−, and Cngb1−/− transgenic mice were derived from 129sv ES cells and successive bred with C57/B6 mice for more than five generations. C57/B6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories. ARR1−/−, GRK1−/−, and BALB/c mice were born and reared in darkness to avoid light-dependent retinal degeneration. C57Bl/6 mice were reared in 12-h light/dark cycles and moved to darkness 1 week before the light exposure. Experiments were performed on 4-week-old mice. The mice were exposed to diffuse cool white fluorescent light at luminescence level of 5000 lux without pupil dilation and then euthanized at the following time points: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, or 36 h after light onset. For some experiments, the mice were exposed to light for 12 h followed by 36 h in darkness. After mice were euthanized, the superior pole of their cornea was marked by cauterization before enucleation. The cornea and lens were removed, and the remaining eye cup was embedded into epoxy resin. The epon-embedded eyes were sectioned along vertical meridian into 1-µm sections and stained with Richardson stain, and morphometric measurements of outer nuclear layer thickness were performed as described previously (27.Concepcion F. Mendez A. Chen J. The carboxyl-terminal domain is essential for rhodopsin transport in rod photoreceptors.Vision Res. 2002; 42: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope using a 63× objective. Eye cups were prepared as described above and placed in 4% formaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for 1 h and rinsed four times for 15 min each time in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. The eye cups were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight and then embedded in O.C.TTM (Tissue-Tech®) and sectioned at 10-µm thickness in a cryostat (CM 3050 S; Leica Microsystems). The sections were treated for 2 min room temperature with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, 2% goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) and heated to 65 °C for 10 s followed by five rinses with PBS. Blocking buffer was applied for 1 h and then replaced with rabbit polyclonal antibody against GCAP2 (28.Mendez A. Burns M.E. Sokal I. Dizhoor A.M. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Role of guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs) in setting the flash sensitivity of rod photoreceptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9948-9953Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) or GCAP1 (made in our laboratory, both diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer) or a mouse monoclonal antibody against rhodopsin (1D4, gift from R. Molday). The sections were rinsed and incubated with a fluorescein- or Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories). The images were obtained using a LSM 5 confocal microscope (Zeiss Microscopy). The retina was dissected and homogenized in 150 µl of buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid) containing 0.1 mm PMSF, complete mini protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Sciences), and 50 µm NaF. DNase I (30 units; Roche Applied Sciences) was then added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The total protein amount of each sample was determined by the BCATM protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). An equal amount of retinal homogenate from each sample was electrophoresed on 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (WhatmanTM; GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and incubated overnight with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-PDE polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Cytosignal, PAB-06800), rabbit anti-ROS-GC1 polyclonal antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz, sc50512), mouse anti-Gtα antibody (1:5000, EMD4Biosciences, 371740), rabbit polyclonal anti-GCAP1 and GCAP2 antibodies (1:2000 and 1:1000, respectively, generated in our laboratory), mouse anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Sigma, U0508), mouse anti-GRP78/Bip monoclonal antibody (1:1000, BD Biosciences, 610978), rabbit anti-phospho-eIF2α (Ser-51) polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, 9721), rabbit anti-ATF3 antibody (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, HPA001562), rabbit anti-CREB-2 (ATF4) antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz, sc200), rabbit anti-ATF6α antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz, sc22799), rabbit anti-IRE1α antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, 3294), and mouse anti-actin antibody (1:5000, Millipore, MAB1501). For detection of phototransduction proteins (PDE, GC1, Gtα, GCAP1, and GCAP2), as well as ubiquitin and actin, membranes were then incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (1:10,000, LI-COR Biosciences, P/N926-31081) at room temperature for 1 h and detected by Odyssey infrared imaging system. Densitometric scanning of each band was followed by quantitative analysis using ImageJ. GRP78, p-eIF2α, ATF3, ATF4, ATF6α, and IRE1α signals were detected using Amersham Biosciences ECL Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The films were scanned, and the intensity of the bands was quantified using Photoshop. The proteasome-associated proteins were isolated by a proteasome isolation kit (Calbiochem, 539176) following the manufacturer's protocol and detected by the Western blot analysis as described above. Quantitation of Western data were obtained using at least three independent sets of experiments obtained from independent mice (n ≥ 3). Individual retinas from dark-adapted or light-exposed mice were isolated under infrared light and lysed in 200 µl of ice-cold buffer (PBS, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1%Triton X-100) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C on a nutator. Insoluble material was recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min and dissolved in 100 µl of SDS loading buffer at room temperature for 10 min and briefly homogenized to disperse the pellet. Equal fractions of the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. ARR1−/−, BALB/c, and C57 mice were exposed to 5,000-lux white fluorescent light without pupil dilation for the indicated times (Fig. 1). In ARR1−/− retina, morphology was largely intact at 12 h except for a few pycnotic nuclei (Fig. 1A, arrows, top row). At 36 h, the nuclei appeared misaligned, and the outer segment structure was disrupted. When the mice exposed to 12 h of constant light were allowed to recover in darkness for 36 h, retinal structure recovered, but the thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) was reduced by ∼20% because of cell death. Light exposure also led to substantial disruption of albino BALB/c retinas and a reduction of ONL thickness (Fig. 1A, middle row). Quantification of ONL thickness across the entire span of the retina is shown in Fig. 1B. The ONL thickness was not statistically different between BALB/c and ARR1−/− retinas except for the 12-h light + 36-h dark time point where the ARR1−/− retinas were slightly thinner. As a first step toward characterizing the initial molecular events downstream of rhodopsin activation, Western blots were performed to compare the levels of phototransduction proteins in the ARR1−/− and BALB/c retinas. In the control C57/B6 samples, light exposure had little effect on the level of guanylyl cyclase 1 (GC), rod PDE6 catalytic αβ subunits (PDEαβ), guanylate cyclase activating protein 1 (GCAP1), or rod transducin (GNAT1). However, the level of GCAP2 was significantly reduced after 12 and 36 h of light exposure (p < 0.03 and p < 0.003, respectively, by two-tailed Student's t test). The GCAPs are Ca2+-binding proteins that inhibit GC activity in the Ca2+-bound state and activate GC in the Ca2+-free state (28.Mendez A. Burns M.E. Sokal I. Dizhoor A.M. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Role of guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs) in setting the flash sensitivity of rod photoreceptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The CNG channels are gated open by high [cGMP] in the dark-adapted state. Ca2+ enters the outer segment through these open channels and is extruded by Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchanger 1 (NCKX1) (30.Schnetkamp P.P. Sodium-calcium exchange in the outer segments of bovine rod photoreceptors.J. Physiol. 1986; 373: 25-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Closure of CNG channels following light exposure causes a drop in intracellular [Ca2+], which leads to GC stimulation by GCAPs to synthesize cGMP. Ca2+-free GCAP2 appears to be structurally unstable in vitro (31.Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. Three-dimensional structure of guanylyl cyclase activating protein-2, a calcium-sensitive modulator of photoreceptor guanylyl cyclases.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and perhaps unstable in vivo as well (Fig. 2A; see also below). However, the selective degradation of GCAP2 alone had no apparent effect on retinal morphology in the control C57/B6 retina (Fig. 1). This decrease in GCAP2 was also observed in the ARR1−/− retina after 12 h of light exposure, together with PDE6αβ (Fig. 2B, p < 0.002 and p < 0.003, respectively). No significant changes were observed for GC1, GCAP1, or GNAT1. In the BALB/c retina, the levels of the majority of the proteins assayed were lowered after 12 h of light exposure (Fig. 2C, p < 0.05 for all protein assayed except for GC, which did not reach statistical significance). At the 36-h time points all of the phototransduction protein levels were further reduced in both ARR1−/− and BALB/c retinas, a result consistent with the ongoing cell death occurring at the later time points (Fig. 1). PDE activation by Gtα-GTP also sets in motion GTP hydrolysis by the GTPase-activating protein complex consisting of PDEγ, Gβ5L, and RGS9 (for regulator of G-protein signaling). These interactions are increased as a consequence of constitutive transducin activation by photolyzed rhodopsin. We compared the levels of GTPase-activating proteins between the dark basal level and after 12 h of light exposure to see whether increased interaction of these proteins may have caused their destabilization (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the level of PDEγ was reduced by more than 70% in the light-exposed ARR1−/− retinas, but not Gβ5L or RGS9. In the BALB/c retina, all of the proteins in the GTPase-activating protein complex were decreased (Fig. 2D). Thus a specific down-regulation of all three subunits of PDE6 occurred in the light-exposed ARR1−/− retinas. We next investigated whether the rapid protein degradation is through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Phototransduction proteins are highly abundant proteins expressed by the rod cells. Notably, overload or impairment of the UPS has been implicated in many types of retinal degenerations (32.Lin J.H. Walter P. Yen T.S. Endoplasmic reticulum stress in disease pathogenesis.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2008; 3: 399-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 33.Shinde V.M. Sizova O.S. Lin J.H. LaVail M.M. Gorbatyuk M.S.

Caspase-7 ablation modulates UPR, reprograms TRAF2-JNK apoptosis and protects T17M rhodopsin mice from severe retinal degeneration.Cell Death Dis. 2013; 4: e528Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To see whether this is the case, the global ubiquitinated proteins and proteasome-associated proteins were examined by Western blots (Fig. 2E, upper and lower panel, respectively). A 2-fold increase in ubiquitinated proteins was observed in the ARR1−/− retina after 12 h of light exposure. These levels decreased at 36 h despite ongoing degeneration (Fig. 2E, quantification of ubiquitin levels is shown on the bar graph to the right). Thus excessive transducin signaling in the ARR1−/− retina caused many proteins other than GCAP2 and PDE6 to be marked for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This was not observed in the BALB/c samples at any time points. A proteasome pulldown was carried out and probed with antibodies against the phototransduction proteins (Fig. 2E, lower panel). Of the list of proteins shown in Fig. 2 (A–C), only PDE6 and GCAP2 were associated with the proteasome at the 12-h time point (Fig. 2E, lower panel). These results suggest a specific degradation of PDE6 and GCAP2 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. For the BALB/c retinas, only a weak signal was observed for GCAP2 (Fig. 2E), but not other proteins. Taken together, the large-scale degradation of the abundant phototransduction proteins PDE6 and GCAP2 in addition to other ubiquitinated proteins may have overloaded the UPS. This pathway was not utilized in the BALB/c retina, although global protein degradation did occur following light exposure. Structurally unstable proteins tend to form aggregates in the cell. This possibility was investigated using immunofluorescence microscopy on retinal sections prepared from C57/B6, ARR1−/−, and BALB/c mice to visualize GCAP2 localization (Fig. 3A). GCAP2 immunoreactivity appeared evenly distributed throughout all compartments of the photoreceptor cell layer in the dark-adapted retina from all three lines of mice. In the C57/B6 retina, this pattern was unchanged after 3 h of light exposure. However, after 48 h of light exposure, puncta can be seen to be concentrated at the level of the connecting cilia (arrow, cc). In the ARR1−/− retina, the puncta are visible by 3 h, and their density in the outer segment increased after 12 h of light exposure. The BALB/c retina also displayed GCAP2-positive puncta after light exposure. In both ARR1−/− and BALB/c retinas, the appearance of puncta is correlated with a loss of signal in the ONL (Fig. 3"
https://openalex.org/W2162638827,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder caused by the absence of dystrophin in both skeletal and cardiac muscles. This leads to severe muscle degeneration, and dilated cardiomyopathy that produces patient death, which in most cases occurs before the end of the second decade. Several lines of evidence have shown that modulators of nitric oxide (NO) pathway can improve skeletal muscle and cardiac function in the mdx mouse, a mouse model for DMD. Whole body periodic acceleration (pGz) is produced by applying sinusoidal motion to supine humans and in standing conscious rodents in a headward-footward direction using a motion platform. It adds small pulses as a function of movement frequency to the circulation thereby increasing pulsatile shear stress to the vascular endothelium, which in turn increases production of NO. In this study, we examined the potential therapeutic properties of pGz for the treatment of skeletal muscle pathology observed in the mdx mouse. We found that pGz (480 cpm, 8 days, 1 hr per day) decreased intracellular Ca(2+) and Na(+) overload, diminished serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) and reduced intracellular accumulation of Evans Blue. Furthermore, pGz increased muscle force generation and expression of both utrophin and the carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of nNOS (CAPON). Likewise, pGz (120 cpm, 12 h) applied in vitro to skeletal muscle myotubes reduced Ca(2+) and Na(+) overload, diminished abnormal sarcolemmal Ca(2+) entry and increased phosphorylation of endothelial NOS. Overall, this study provides new insights into the potential therapeutic efficacy of pGz as a non-invasive and non-pharmacological approach for the treatment of DMD patients through activation of the NO pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1985085986,"Improved drought tolerance is always a highly desired trait for agricultural plants. Significantly increased drought tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0) has been achieved in our work through the suppression of ESKMO1 (ESK1) gene expression with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and overexpression of CBF genes with constitutive gene expression. ESK1 has been identified as a gene linked to normal development of the plant vascular system, which is assumed directly related to plant drought response. By using siRNA that specifically targets ESK1, the gene expression has been reduced and drought tolerance of the plant has been enhanced dramatically in the work. However, the plant response to external abscisic acid application has not been changed. ICE1, CBF1, and CBF3 are genes involved in a well-characterized plant stress response pathway, overexpression of them in the plant has demonstrated capable to increase drought tolerance. By overexpression of these genes combining together with suppression of ESK1 gene, the significant increase of plant drought tolerance has been achieved in comparison to single gene manipulation, although the effect is not in an additive way. Accompanying the increase of drought tolerance via suppression of ESK1 gene expression, the negative effect has been observed in seeds yield of transgenic plants in normal watering conditions comparing with wide type plant."
https://openalex.org/W1991992760,"Sitobion avenae (F.) can survive on various plants in the Poaceae, which may select for highly plastic genotypes. But phenotypic plasticity was often thought to be non-genetic, and of little evolutionary significance historically, and many problems related to adaptive plasticity, its genetic basis and natural selection for plasticity have not been well documented. To address these questions, clones of S. avenae were collected from three plants, and their phenotypic plasticity under alternative environments was evaluated. Our results demonstrated that nearly all tested life-history traits showed significant plastic changes for certain S. avenae clones with the total developmental time of nymphs and fecundity tending to have relatively higher plasticity for most clones. Overall, the level of plasticity for S. avenae clones’ life-history traits was unexpectedly low. The factor ‘clone’ alone explained 27.7–62.3% of the total variance for trait plasticities. The heritability of plasticity was shown to be significant in nearly all the cases. Many significant genetic correlations were found between trait plasticities with a majority of them being positive. Therefore, it is evident that life-history trait plasticity involved was genetically based. There was a high degree of variation in selection coefficients for life-history trait plasticity of different S. avenae clones. Phenotypic plasticity for barley clones, but not for oat or wheat clones, was frequently found to be under significant selection. The directional selection of alternative environments appeared to act to decrease the plasticity of S. avenae clones in most cases. G-matrix comparisons showed significant differences between S. avenae clones, as well as quite a few negative covariances (i.e., trade-offs) between trait plasticities. Genetic basis and evolutionary significance of life-history trait plasticity were discussed."

Materials and Methods Bladders from 3 week old Wistar rats were studied. End-point PCR on total mRNA was used to assess the expression of Ano1. Immunofluorescent labelling of whole mount bladder tissue imaged with confocal microscope allowed localization of Ano1 and vimentin immunopositive cells. The effects of CaCC blockers: niflumic acid (NFA) (3,10,30 µM) and 5-Nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) (10, 30 µM) on spontaneous phasic contractile activity of intact (with mucosa) and denuded (without mucosa) detrusor strips were measured under isometric tension in organ baths (n = 141, N = 60). Results Ano1 expression was found at mRNA level in mucosa and detrusor layers. Confocal microscopy revealed presence of Ano1 immunopositive cells in mucosa and in detrusor layers; a subpopulation of vimentin positive cells expressed Ano1. Both chloride channel blockers reduced the amplitude and frequency of phasic contractions in denuded and intact strips. Conclusions Ano1 is expressed in rat urinary bladder and is present in cells sharing markers with interstitial cells. CaCC blockers reduced phasic activity of the bladder tissue. Ano1 is expressed in the bladder and plays a role in its spontaneous phasic contractile activity."

The data show that the dynamics and signaling of the MOP receptor in SH-SY5Y cells are modified by the activation of α2-adrenergic and NPFF2 receptors, but not by the activation of receptors not described to interact with the opioid receptor. By combining, for the first time, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching at variable radius experiments with bimolecular fluorescence complementation, we show that the MOP/NPFF2 heterodimer adopts a specific diffusion behavior that corresponds to a mix of the dynamic properties of both MOP and NPFF2 receptors. Altogether, the data suggest that heterologous regulation is accompanied by a specific organization of receptors in the membrane."

Despite profound knowledge about the pre-test probability of bacteraemia, blood culture analysis often results in low rates of pathogen detection and therefore increasing diagnostic costs. To improve the cost-effectiveness of blood culture sampling, we computed a risk prediction model based on highly standardizable variables, with the ultimate goal to identify via an automated decision support tool patients with very low risk for bacteraemia. Methods In this retrospective hospital-wide cohort study evaluating 15,985 patients with suspected bacteraemia, 51 variables were assessed for their diagnostic potency. A derivation cohort (n = 14.699) was used for feature and model selection as well as for cut-off specification. Models were established using the A2DE classifier, a supervised Bayesian classifier. Two internally validated models were further evaluated by a validation cohort (n = 1,286). Results The proportion of neutrophile leukocytes in differential blood count was the best individual variable to predict bacteraemia (ROC-AUC: 0.694). Applying the A2DE classifier, two models, model 1 (20 variables) and model 2 (10 variables) were established with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.767 and 0.759, respectively. In the validation cohort, ROC-AUCs of 0.800 and 0.786 were achieved. Using predefined cut-off points, 16% and 12% of patients were allocated to the low risk group with a negative predictive value of more than 98.8%. Conclusion Applying the proposed models, more than ten percent of patients with suspected blood stream infection were identified having minimal risk for bacteraemia. Based on these data the application of this model as an automated decision support tool for physicians is conceivable leading to a potential increase in the cost-effectiveness of blood culture sampling. External prospective validation of the model's generalizability is needed for further appreciation of the usefulness of this tool."
https://openalex.org/W2040127144,"Plant species show different responses to the elevated temperatures that are resulting from global climate change, depending on their ecological and physiological characteristics. The highly invasive shrub Lantana camara occurs between the latitudes of 35 °N and 35 °S. According to current and future climate scenarios predicted by the CLIMEX model, climatically suitable areas for L. camara are projected to contract globally, despite expansions in some areas. The objective of this study was to test those predictions, using a pot experiment in which branch cuttings were grown at three different temperatures (22 °C, 26 °C and 30 °C). We hypothesized that warming would facilitate the invasiveness of L. camara. In response to rising temperatures, the total biomass of L. camara did increase. Plants allocated more biomass to stems and enlarged their leaves more at 26 °C and 30 °C, which promoted light capture and assimilation. They did not appear to be stressed by higher temperatures, in fact photosynthesis and assimilation were enhanced. Using lettuce (Lactuca sativa) as a receptor plant in a bioassay experiment, we also tested the phytotoxicity of L. camara leachate at different temperatures. All aqueous extracts from fresh leaves significantly inhibited the germination and seedling growth of lettuce, and the allelopathic effects became stronger with increasing temperature. Our results provide key evidence that elevated temperature led to significant increases in growth along with physiological and allelopathic effects, which together indicate that global warming facilitates the invasion of L. camara."
https://openalex.org/W2090916464,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly today. One of the earliest reported signs of Alzheimer's disease is olfactory dysfunction, which may manifest in a variety of ways. The present study sought to address this issue by investigating odor coding in the anterior piriform cortex, the primary cortical region involved in higher order olfactory function, and how it relates to performance on olfactory behavioral tasks. An olfactory habituation task was performed on cohorts of transgenic and age-matched wild-type mice at 3, 6 and 12 months of age. These animals were then anesthetized and acute, single-unit electrophysiology was performed in the anterior piriform cortex. In addition, in a separate group of animals, a longitudinal odor discrimination task was conducted from 3–12 months of age. Results showed that while odor habituation was impaired at all ages, Tg2576 performed comparably to age-matched wild-type mice on the olfactory discrimination task. The behavioral data mirrored intact anterior piriform cortex single-unit odor responses and receptive fields in Tg2576, which were comparable to wild-type at all age groups. The present results suggest that odor processing in the olfactory cortex and basic odor discrimination is especially robust in the face of amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP) over-expression and advancing amyloid β (Aβ) pathology. Odor identification deficits known to emerge early in Alzheimer's disease progression, therefore, may reflect impairments in linking the odor percept to associated labels in cortical regions upstream of the primary olfactory pathway, rather than in the basic odor processing itself."
https://openalex.org/W2088775936,"Maternal inflammation during pregnancy is associated with the later development of cognitive and behavioral impairment in the offspring, reminiscent of the traits of schizophrenia or autism spectrum disorders. Hippocampal long-term potentiation and long-term depression of glutamatergic synapses are respectively involved in memory formation and consolidation. In male rats, maternal inflammation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to a premature loss of long-term depression, occurring between 12 and 25 postnatal days instead of after the first postnatal month, and aberrant occurrence of long-term potentiation. We hypothesized this would be related to GABAergic system impairment. Sprague Dawley rats received either LPS or isotonic saline ip on gestational day 19. Male offspring's hippocampus was studied between 12 and 25 postnatal days. Morphological and functional analyses demonstrated that prenatal LPS triggered a deficit of hippocampal GABAergic interneurons, associated with presynaptic GABAergic transmission deficiency in male offspring. Increasing ambient GABA by impairing GABA reuptake with tiagabine did not interact with the low frequency-induced long-term depression in control animals but fully prevented its impairment in male offspring of LPS-challenged dams. Tiagabine furthermore prevented the aberrant occurrence of paired-pulse triggered long-term potentiation in these rats. Deficiency in GABA seems to be central to the dysregulation of synaptic plasticity observed in juvenile in utero LPS-challenged rats. Modulating GABAergic tone may be a possible therapeutic strategy at this developmental stage."

We demonstrate the genetic encoding of a set of alkene lysines using the orthogonal PylRS/PylTCUA pair in Escherichia coli. The installed double bond functionality was then applied in a photoinitiated thiol-ene reaction of the protein with a fluorescent thiol-bearing probe, as well as a cysteine residue of a second protein, showing the applicability of this approach in the formation of heterogeneous non-linear fused proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2037895194,"Stimulation of type I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1/5) in several neuronal types induces slow excitatory responses through activation of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels. GABAergic cerebellar molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) modulate firing patterns of Purkinje cells (PCs), which play a key role in cerebellar information processing. MLIs express mGluR1, and activation of mGluR1 induces an inward current, but its precise intracellular signaling pathways are unknown. We found that mGluR1 activation facilitated spontaneous firing of mouse cerebellar MLIs through an inward current mediated by TRPC1 channels. This mGluR1-mediated inward current depends on both G protein-dependent and -independent pathways. The nonselective protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and AG490 as well as the selective extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibitors PD98059 and SL327 suppressed the mGluR1-mediated current responses. Following G protein blockade, the residual mGluR1-mediated inward current was significantly reduced by the selective Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2. In contrast to cerebellar PCs, GABAB receptor activation in MLIs did not alter the mGluR1-mediated inward current, suggesting that there is no cross-talk between mGluR1 and GABAB receptors in MLIs. Thus, activation of mGluR1 facilitates firing of MLIs through the TRPC1-mediated inward current, which depends on not only G protein-dependent but also Src-ERK1/2-dependent signaling pathways, and consequently depresses the excitability of cerebellar PCs."
https://openalex.org/W2040923823,"Chelated lanthanides such as europium (Eu) have uniquely long fluorescence emission half-lives permitting their use in time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) assays. In Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) a donor fluorophore transfers its emission energy to an acceptor fluorophore if in sufficiently close proximity. The use of time-resolved (TR) FRET minimizes the autofluorescence of molecules present in biological samples. In this report, we describe a homogenous immunoassay prototype utilizing TR-FRET for detection of antibodies in solution. The assay is based on labeled protein L, a bacterial protein that binds to immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain, and labeled antigen, which upon association with the same Ig molecule produce a TR-FRET active complex. We show that the approach is functional and can be utilized for both mono- and polyvalent antigens. We also compare the assay performance to that of another homogenous TR-FRET immunoassay reported earlier. This novel assay may have wide utility in infectious disease point-of-care diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W1994605817,"The transient receptor potential ion channel TRPA1 confers the ability to detect tissue damaging chemicals to sensory neurons and as a result mediates chemical nociception in vivo. Mouse TRPA1 is activated by electrophilic compounds such as mustard-oil and several physical stimuli such as cold temperature. Due to its sensory function inhibition of TRPA1 activity might provide an effective treatment against chronic and inflammatory pain. Therefore, TRPA1 has become a target for the development of analgesic drugs. 6-Methyl-5-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1H-indazole (Compound 31) has been identified by a chemical screen and lead optimization as an inhibitor of chemical activation of TRPA1. However, the structures or domains of TRPA1 that mediate the inhibitory effect of Compound 31 are unknown. Here, we screened 12,000 random mutant clones of mouse TRPA1 for their sensitivity to mustard-oil and the ability of Compound 31 to inhibit chemical activation by mustard-oil. In addition, we separately screened this mutant library while stimulating it with cold temperatures. We found that the single-point mutation I624N in the N-terminus of TRPA1 specifically affects the sensitivity to mustard-oil, but not to cold temperatures. This is evidence that sensitivity of TRPA1 to chemicals and cold temperatures is conveyed by separable mechanisms. We also identified five mutations located within the pore domain that cause loss of inhibition by Compound 31. This result demonstrates that the pore-domain is a regulator of chemical activation and suggests that Compound 31 might be acting directly on the pore-domain."
https://openalex.org/W2071355682,"Iron was previously shown to induce rapid nuclear translocation of a Myb3 transcription factor in the protozoan parasite, Trichomonas vaginalis. In the present study, iron was found to induce a transient increase in cellular cAMP, followed by the nuclear influx of Myb3, whereas the latter was also induced by 8-bromo-cyclic AMP. Iron-inducible cAMP production and nuclear influx of Myb3 were inhibited by suramin and SQ22536, respective inhibitors of the Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins and adenylyl cyclases. In contrast, the nuclear influx of Myb3 induced by iron or 8-bromo-cAMP was delayed or inhibited, respectively, by H89, the inhibitor of protein kinase A. Using liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry, Thr(156) and Lys(143) in Myb3 were found to be phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, respectively. These modifications were induced by iron and inhibited by H89, as shown by immunoprecipitation-coupled Western blotting. Iron-inducible ubiquitination and nuclear influx were aborted in T156A and K143R, but T156D was constitutively ubiquitinated and persistently localized to the nucleus. Myb3 was phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of a T. vaginalis protein kinase A, TvPKAc. A transient interaction between TvPKAc and Myb3 and the phosphorylation of both proteins were induced in the parasite shortly after iron or 8-bromo-cAMP treatment. Together, these observations suggest that iron may induce production of cAMP and activation of TvPKAc, which then induces the phosphorylation of Myb3 and subsequent ubiquitination for accelerated nuclear influx. It is conceivable that iron probably exerts a much broader impact on the physiology of the parasite than previously thought to encounter environmental changes."
https://openalex.org/W2134930016,"The physiological condition of juvenile birds can be influenced by multiple ecological stressors, and few studies have concurrently considered the effects of environmental contaminants in combination with ecological attributes that can influence foraging conditions and prey availability. Using three temporally distinct indices of physiological condition, we compared the physiological response of nestling great egrets (Ardea alba) and white ibises (Eudocimus albus) to changing prey availability, hydrology (water depth, recession rate), and mercury exposure in the Florida Everglades. We found that the physiological response of chicks varied between species and among environmental variables. Chick body condition (short-term index) and fecal corticosterone levels (medium-term) were influenced by wetland water depth, prey availability, region, and age, but not by mercury contamination. However, mercury exposure did influence heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in egret chicks, indicating a longer-term physiological response to contamination. Our results indicate that the physiological condition of egret and ibis chicks were influenced by several environmental stressors, and the time frame of the effect may depend on the specialized foraging behavior of the adults provisioning the chicks."
https://openalex.org/W2082198467,"Paracoccidioidomycosis is the most important systemic mycosis in Latin America. The main entrance of the fungus is the airway. It primarily occurs in the lung, but in its disseminated form may affect any organ. The liver is one of the organs afflicted by this disease and its homeostasis may be impaired. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the evolution of paracoccidioidomycosis in the liver of Swiss mice and correlate morphological factors with the expression of gp43 and with physicochemical analysis via FT-Raman of the infected organ. According to colony forming unit (CFU) and granuloma counting, the first and second weeks were the periods when infection was most severe. Tissue response was characterized by the development of organized granulomas and widespread infection, with yeasts located within the macrophages and isolated hepatocytes. The gp43 molecule was distributed throughout the hepatic parenchyma, and immunostaining was constant in all observed periods. The main physicochemical changes of the infected liver were observed in the spectral ranges between 1700–1530 cm−1 and 1370 – 1290 cm−1, a peak shifting center attributed to phenylalanine and area variation of -CH2 and -CH3 compounds associated to collagen, respectively. Over time, there was a direct proportional relationship between the number of CFUs, the number of granulomas and the physicochemical changes in the liver of mice infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The expression of gp43 was similar in all observed periods."
https://openalex.org/W2014609957,"Mitochondrial sequence data is often used to reconstruct the demographic history of Pleistocene populations in an effort to understand how species have responded to past climate change events. However, departures from neutral equilibrium conditions can confound evolutionary inference in species with structured populations or those that have experienced periods of population expansion or decline. Selection can affect patterns of mitochondrial DNA variation and variable mutation rates among mitochondrial genes can compromise inferences drawn from single markers. We investigated the contribution of these factors to patterns of mitochondrial variation and estimates of time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for two clades in a co-operatively breeding avian species, the white-browed babbler Pomatostomus superciliosus. Both the protein-coding ND3 gene and hypervariable domain I control region sequences showed departures from neutral expectations within the superciliosus clade, and a two-fold difference in TMRCA estimates. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of departure from a strict clock model of molecular evolution in domain I, leading to an over-estimation of TMRCA for the superciliosus clade at this marker. Our results suggest mitochondrial studies that attempt to reconstruct Pleistocene demographic histories should rigorously evaluate data for departures from neutral equilibrium expectations, including variation in evolutionary rates across multiple markers. Failure to do so can lead to serious errors in the estimation of evolutionary parameters and subsequent demographic inferences concerning the role of climate as a driver of evolutionary change. These effects may be especially pronounced in species with complex social structures occupying heterogeneous environments. We propose that environmentally driven differences in social structure may explain observed differences in evolutionary rate of domain I sequences, resulting from longer than expected retention times for matriarchal lineages in the superciliosus clade."
https://openalex.org/W1976560951,"Because structural remodeling of several proteins, including ion channels, may underlie the abnormal action potentials of Purkinje cells (PCs) that survive in the 48 hr infarcted zone of the canine heart (IZPCs), we sought to determine the subcellular structure and function of the KV1.5 (KCNA5) protein in single IZPCs. Clustering of the Kv1.5 subunit in axons is regulated by a synapse-associated protein, SAP97, and is linked to an actin-binding protein, cortactin, and an intercellular adhesion molecule, N-cadherin. To understand the functional remodeling of the Kv1.5 channel and its regulation in IZPCs, Kv1.5 currents in PCs were measured as the currents blocked by 10 µM RSD1379 using patch-clamp techniques. Immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging were used for both single and aggregated IZPCs vs normal PCs (NZPCs) to determine the relationship of Kv1.5 with SAP-97, cortactin and N-cadherin. In IZPCs, both the sarcolemma (SL) and intercalated disk (ID) Kv1.5 protein are abundant, and the amount of cytosolic Kv1.5 protein is greatly increased. SAP-97 is also increased at IDs and has notable cytosolic localization suggesting that SAP-97 may regulate the functional expression and stabilization of Kv1.5 channels in IZPCs. Cortactin, which is located with N-cadherin at IDs in NZPCs, remains at IDs but begins to dissociate from N-cadherin, often forming ring structures and colocalizing with Kv1.5 within IZPCs. At the same time, cortactin/Kv1.5 colocalization is increased at the ID, suggesting an ongoing active process of membrane trafficking of the channel protein. Finally, the Kv1.5 current, measured as the RSD1379-sensitive current, at +40 mV did not differ between NZPCs (0.81±0.24 pA/pF, n = 14) and IZPCs (0.83±0.21 pA/pF, n = 13, NS). In conclusion, the subcellular structural remodeling of Kv1.5, SAP97 and cortactin maintained and normalized the function of the Kv1.5 channel in Purkinje cells that survived myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W1979804202,"The process of leukocyte recruitment to the airways in real time has not been extensively studied, yet airway inflammation persists as a major contributor to lung pathology. We showed previously in vivo, that neutrophils are recruited acutely to the large airways after periods of airway distension imposed by the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Given extensive literature implicating products of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in lung injury after ventilatory over-distension, we questioned whether similar mechanisms exist in airway post-capillary venules. Yet, endothelial nitric oxide has been shown to be largely anti-inflammatory in other systemic venules. Using intravital microscopy to visualize post-capillary tracheal venules in anesthetized, ventilated mice, the number of adherent leukocytes was significantly decreased in eNOS-/- mice under baseline conditions (2±1 cell/60 min observation) vs wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice (7±2 cells). After exposure to PEEP (8 cmH2O for 1 min; 5 times), adherent cells increased significantly (29±5 cells) in WT mice while eNOS-/- mice demonstrated a significantly decreased number of adherent cells (11±4 cells) after PEEP. A similar response was seen when thrombin was used as the pro-inflammatory stimulus. In addition, mouse tracheal venular endothelial cells studied in vitro after exposure to cyclic stretch (18% elongation) or thrombin both demonstrated increased p-selectin expression that was significantly attenuated by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA) and excess BH4. In vivo treatment with the ROS inhibitor NACA or co-factor BH4 abolished completely the PEEP-induced leukocyte adherence. These results suggest that pro-inflammatory stimuli cause leukocyte recruitment to tracheal endothelium in part due to eNOS uncoupling."
