https://openalex.org/W2750540167,"X-linked diseases typically exhibit more severe phenotypes in males than females. In contrast, protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) mutations cause epilepsy in heterozygous females but spare hemizygous males. The cellular mechanism responsible for this unique pattern of X-linked inheritance is unknown. We show that PCDH19 contributes to adhesion specificity in a combinatorial manner such that mosaic expression of Pcdh19 in heterozygous female mice leads to striking sorting between cells expressing wild-type (WT) PCDH19 and null PCDH19 in the developing cortex, correlating with altered network activity. Complete deletion of PCDH19 in heterozygous mice abolishes abnormal cell sorting and restores normal network activity. Furthermore, we identify variable cortical malformations in PCDH19 epilepsy patients. Our results highlight the role of PCDH19 in determining cell adhesion affinities during cortical development and the way segregation of WT and null PCDH19 cells is associated with the unique X-linked inheritance of PCDH19 epilepsy."

Using a combination of topic mapping, author and journal co-citation analyses, and overlay visualization of new and hot topics in the field, this article makes important contribution to the entrepreneurship research by identifying 46 topics in the 24-year history of entrepreneurship research and demonstrates how they appear, disappear, reappear and stabilize over time. It also identifies five topics that are persistent across the 24-year study period--institutions and institutional entrepreneurship, innovation and technology management, policy and development, entrepreneurial process and opportunity, and new ventures--which I labeled as The Pentagon of Entrepreneurship. Overall, the analyses revealed patterns of convergence and divergence and the diversity of topics, specialization, and interdisciplinary engagement in entrepreneurship research, thus offering the latest insights on the state of the art of the field."
https://openalex.org/W2782101141,"Summary Simple decisions arise from the evaluation of sensory evidence. But decisions are determined by more than just evidence. Individuals establish internal decision criteria that influence how they respond. Where or how decision criteria are established in the brain remains poorly understood. Here, we show that neuronal activity in the superior colliculus (SC) predicts changes in decision criteria. Using a novel Yes-No task that isolates changes in decision criterion from changes in decision sensitivity, and computing neuronal measures of sensitivity and criterion, we find that SC neuronal activity correlates with the decision criterion regardless of the location of the choice report. We also show that electrical manipulation of activity within the SC produces changes in decisions consistent with changes in decision criteria and are largely independent of the choice report location. Our correlational and causal results together provide strong evidence that SC activity signals the position of a decision criterion. Video Abstract"

The age-dependent increase of nlp-29 expression is regulated by the epidermal tir-1/SARM–pmk-1/p38 MAPK innate immunity pathway. We further identify an orphan G protein-coupled receptor NPR-12 (neuropeptide receptor 12) acting in neurons as a receptor for NLP-29 and demonstrate that the autophagic machinery is involved cell autonomously downstream of NPR-12 to transduce degeneration signals.

Neurons have reciprocal regulatory interactions with surrounding cells. The innate immune system, as well as many molecules with immune functions, plays important roles in the nervous system (Boulanger, 2009Boulanger L.M.

Barres B.A. Stevens B. The complement system: an unexpected role in synaptic pruning during development and disease.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 369-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that the dramatic increase of C1q, the pattern recognition molecule of the classical complement cascade that functions in the innate immune system to remove pathogens upon infections, triggers the functional aging of the brain (Sekar et al., 2016Sekar A. Bialas A.R. de Rivera H. Davis A. Hammond T.R. Kamitaki N. Tooley K. Presumey J. Baum M.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 13460-13474Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Whereas the reason for the increased expression of such immune molecules in the aging brain is still unknown, studies have implicated that sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with infections by pathogenic microbes, such as fungi, herpes simplex virus, and pneumonia-causing Chlamydophila pneumonia (Hill et al., 2014Hill J.M. Clement C. Pogue A.I. Bhattacharjee S. Zhao Y. Lukiw W.J. Pathogenic microbes, the microbiome, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).Front. Aging Neurosci. 2014; 6: 127Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether infections cause the degeneration of neurons and whether any immune molecules that can be induced by infections contribute to aging-associated neurodegeneration. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are host-defense peptides and play important roles in fighting microbe pathogens after infections (Zhang and Gallo, 2016Zhang L.J. Gallo R.L. Antimicrobial peptides.Curr. Biol. 2016; 26: R14-R19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence shows that some AMPs are highly expressed in mouse microglia (Hickman et al., 2013Hickman S.E. Kingery N.D. Ohsumi T.K. Borowsky M.L. Wang L.C. Means T.K. El Khoury J. The microglial sensome revealed by direct RNA sequencing.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1896-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) as well as in the astrocytes of AD patients’ brains (Williams et al., 2013Williams W.M. Torres S. Siedlak S.L.

Neuroinflammation. 2013; 10: 127Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) despite the absence of infection, suggesting that AMPs may have non-antimicrobial functions in the nervous system. Dendrite and axon degeneration occur in both normal aging and aging-related neurodegenerative diseases and are considered major causes of neuronal dysfunction (Adalbert and Coleman, 2013Adalbert R.

Studies have revealed factors involved in the regulation of axon degeneration (Wang et al., 2012Wang J.T. Medress Z.A. Barres B.A. Axon degeneration: molecular mechanisms of a self-destruction pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), whereas the mechanisms underlying dendrite degeneration remain largely unknown. Here, using C. elegans PVD neurons as a model, we show that aging-associated expression of NLP-29 (neuropeptide-like protein 29), an epidermally expressed AMP (Couillault et al., 2004Couillault C. Pujol N. Reboul J. Sabatier L. Guichou J.F. Kohara Y. Ewbank J.J.

Distinct innate immune responses to infection and wounding in the C. elegans epidermis.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), causes dendrite degeneration. We further identify a conserved orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) NPR-12 (neuropeptide receptor 12) as the receptor in neurons for NLP-29 and show that NPR-12 signaling induces autophagy to mediate aging-associated dendrite degeneration. Moreover, we find that fungal infections can induce dendrite degeneration through the same mechanism as in aging. Finally, we present evidence to show that NLP-29/AMP can cause dendrite degeneration in NPR-12-expressing rat cortical neurons through the autophagic machinery as well, suggesting that the findings we report here are likely to be evolutionarily conserved. Therefore, our study uncovers an unexpected novel function of NLP-29/AMP and its neuronal receptor in regulating dendrite degeneration and provides a new mechanism for dendrite degeneration in physiological and pathological conditions. To investigate aging-associated neurodegeneration in vivo, we used C. elegans PVD neurons as a model. Each of the two PVD neurons, PVDL and PVDR, has extensive, highly branched, and well-organized dendritic arbors, with one ventrally oriented axon (Figure 1A; Smith et al., 2010Smith C.J. Watson J.D. Spencer W.C. O’Brien T. Cha B. Albeg A. Treinin M. Miller 3rd, D.M. Time-lapse imaging and cell-specific expression profiling reveal dynamic branching and molecular determinants of a multi-dendritic nociceptor in C. elegans.Dev. Biol. 2010; 345: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). First, we characterized the PVD degeneration pattern during aging by observing the changes of dendrite morphology in control animals (wdIs51(F49H12.4::GFP)) from day 1 to day 9 of adulthood consecutively, with day 1 defined as 24 hr after the final larval stage (L4). Progressive dendrite morphological changes were observed in these animals over the course of aging (Figure 1A). Specifically, the PVD dendrites developed bead- or bubble-like structures along dendrites and were enriched in autophagosomes (Figure 1B), which is similar to what was observed in mammalian neurons of neurodegenerative disease models (Menzies et al., 2015Menzies F.M. Fleming A. Rubinsztein D.C. Compromised autophagy and neurodegenerative diseases.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 16: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Cytoskeleton disorganization, such as microtubule instability, has been well documented in neurodegeneration (Wang and Mandelkow, 2016Wang Y. Mandelkow E. Tau in physiology and pathology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 5-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We next examined the distribution of polymerized microtubules in PVD dendrites using EMTB::GFP (Richardson et al., 2014Richardson C.E. Spilker K.A. Cueva J.G. Perrino J. Goodman M.B. Shen K. PTRN-1, a microtubule minus end-binding CAMSAP homolog, promotes microtubule function in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons.eLife. 2014; 3: e01498Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and observed fragmented and discontinued microtubule filaments in aged, but not young, animals (Figure S1D). Interestingly, most of these fragmented EMTB::GFP signals appeared to be enriched in the aging-associated bead-/bubble-like structures (Figure S1D). Whereas PVD dendrites underwent progressive morphological changes over the course of aging, PVD axons and cell bodies did not display significant bead- or bubble-like structures within the same time frame (Figures S1A and S1B). The distributions of axonal autophagosomes and microtubules were also similar in young and aged animals (Figures S1C and S1D). For quantification of age-dependent PVD dendritic morphological change, an animal was considered as having such change if a total of ten or more bead- or bubble-like structures were observed in more than five PVD functional units (dendritic menorahs; Oren-Suissa et al., 2010Oren-Suissa M. Hall D.H. Treinin M. Shemer G. Podbilewicz B. The fusogen EFF-1 controls sculpting of mechanosensory dendrites.Science. 2010; 328: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The number of control animals with dendritic morphological changes significantly increased with age: 30% of them started to show bead- or bubble-like structures on day 5 of adulthood, 50% on day 6, and almost 100% on day 7 (Figure 1C), whereas the onset of dendritic morphological changes in these animals preceded animal death by several days (Figure 1C). In addition, there was an age-dependent progressive increase in the severity of dendritic morphological changes, quantified as the number of bead- or bubble-like structures in each control animal (Figure 1D). Next, we tested whether the morphological changes of PVD dendrites were accompanied by any alteration in PVD function. PVD neurons are responsible for the response to harsh touch applied to the mid-part of the body, where the animal subsequently initiates forward or backward movements (Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2010Chatzigeorgiou M.

The mec-3 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans requires its own product for maintained expression and is expressed in three neuronal cell types.Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Activating the touch receptor neurons, including ALM, AVM, PLM, and PVM, by gentle touch can also generate similar behavioral responses (Way and Chalfie, 1989Way J.C. Chalfie M. The mec-3 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans requires its own product for maintained expression and is expressed in three neuronal cell types.Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To exclude the possible effects of the touch receptor neurons in our behavioral tests, we assessed PVD function in a mec-4 mutant background, which lacks functioning touch receptor neurons but has normally functioning PVD neurons (Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991Driscoll M. Chalfie M.

Shen K. The transmembrane LRR protein DMA-1 promotes dendrite branching and growth in C. elegans.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 15: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We used mec-3 mutants, which have dysfunctions in both PVD and touch receptor neurons, as a positive control for the “no harsh touch response” (Way and Chalfie, 1989Way J.C. Chalfie M. The mec-3 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans requires its own product for maintained expression and is expressed in three neuronal cell types.Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations, approximately 60% of mec-3 mutants did not respond to harsh touch (Liu and Shen, 2011Liu O.W. Shen K. The transmembrane LRR protein DMA-1 promotes dendrite branching and growth in C. elegans.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 15: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a fraction that was consistent over days 1–10 (Figure 1E). On the other hand, mec-4 animals, considered to have wild-type responses to harsh touch, showed an age-dependent increase in the “non-response rate” (Figure 1E), which mirrored the observed PVD morphological changes (bead- or bubble-like structures). Neurodegeneration is defined as a progressive loss of neurons or their processes (axons and dendrites) with a corresponding progressive impairment in neuronal function (Jack et al., 2013Jack Jr., C.R. Knopman D.S. Jagust W.J. Petersen R.C. Weiner M.W. Aisen P.S. Shaw L.M. Vemuri P. Wiste H.J.

Although we did not observe a loss of PVD dendritic menorahs in the time frame we examined (Figure S1E), the bead- or bubble-like structures along PVD dendrites, which were enriched with autophagosomes and fragmented microtubules, demonstrated the features of neurodegeneration. Similar beading or blebbing of neurites has been used as a marker of neurodegeneration in both invertebrate and vertebrate models (Kuchibhotla et al., 2008Kuchibhotla K.V. Goldman S.T. Lattarulo C.R.

Genetic analysis of age-dependent defects of the Caenorhabditis elegans touch receptor neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 9274-9279Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, PVD neurons underwent an aging-associated functional decline that coincided temporally with the morphological changes of their dendrites (Figure 1E). Based on this evidence, we conclude that PVD neurons display aging-associated dendrite degeneration at both morphological and functional levels. We thus characterized PVD dendrite degeneration by bead- or bubble-like structures formed along the dendrites (see more details in the STAR Methods section). Given that PVD axons and cell bodies did not show noticeable morphological and structural changes within the same time period (Figures S1A–S1D), the dendrite degeneration we observed was likely to represent the early stage of PVD neurodegeneration. To further demonstrate that the PVD dendrite degeneration we describe here is associated with aging, we tested whether changing animal lifespan could alter this phenotype. Loss-of-function (lf) in daf-2, the insulin/insulin growth factor (IGF) receptor, can greatly extend the lifespan of C. elegans (Apfeld and Kenyon, 1998Apfeld J. Kenyon C. Cell nonautonomy of C. elegans daf-2 function in the regulation of diapause and life span.Cell. 1998; 95: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Consistent with the essential role of daf-2 in aging, we found that a daf-2(lf) mutation significantly delayed the onset of aging-associated PVD dendrite degeneration (Figure S1F). daf-2 appeared to regulate aging-associated degeneration in a non-cell-autonomous manner (Figure S1F), similar to its non-cell-autonomous functions in regulating lifespan (Apfeld and Kenyon, 1998Apfeld J. Kenyon C. Cell nonautonomy of C. elegans daf-2 function in the regulation of diapause and life span.Cell. 1998; 95: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These data further support that the PVD dendrite degeneration phenotype is aging associated. Through a genetic screen, we found that an lf mutation (tm1931) in nlp-29 significantly delayed the onset of aging-associated PVD dendrite degeneration at both morphological and functional levels (Figures 2A–2D and S1B), whereas nlp-29(tm1931) animals had a comparable lifespan to that of control animals (Figure S2A). To further confirm our observation, we generated a second lf allele, nlp-29(yad90), in which the coding region of nlp-29 was deleted (Figure S3A). nlp-29(yad90) delayed aging-associated PVD dendrite degeneration to the same degree as observed in nlp-29(tm1931) (Figure 2B). Expression of NLP-29::GFP under its own promoter with its own 3′ UTR fully rescued nlp-29(tm1931) phenotypes (Figure 2E). nlp-29 is mainly expressed in the epidermis and functions as an AMP to combat infection via the skin (Couillault et al., 2004Couillault C. Pujol N. Reboul J. Sabatier L. Guichou J.F. Kohara Y. Ewbank J.J. TLR-independent control of innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans by the TIR domain adaptor protein TIR-1, an ortholog of human SARM.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We found that RNAi knockdown of nlp-29 in the epidermis was sufficient to delay aging-associated PVD dendrite degeneration as in nlp-29(lf) mutants, whereas PVD-specific knockdown of nlp-29 did not cause any obvious delay of dendrite degeneration (Figure S3C). Consistent with these results, expression of nlp-29 using an adult epidermis-specific promoter (Pcol-19) was able to rescue nlp-29(tm1931) phenotypes (Figure 2E). With these observations, we conclude that epidermally expressed nlp-29 plays a key role in regulating aging-associated PVD dendrite degeneration. To further confirm the essential role of NLP-29 in PVD dendrite degeneration, we microinjected synthetic NLP-29 peptide into control animals at day 1 at 10 μM and 100 μM (Figure 3A). As a control peptide, we used a highly similar AMP NLP-31 at 100 μM (Figure S3B). At 24 hr post-injection (day 2), approximately 45% of animals injected with 10 μM NLP-29 and 60% injected with 100 μM NLP-29 displayed PVD dendrite degeneration, whereas only ∼25% injected with vehicle (DMSO) or NLP-31 showed dendrite degeneration (Figure 3A). Similar to what was observed during aging-associated degeneration, we found that autophagosomes were also enriched in degenerating PVD dendrites of NLP-29-injected animals (Figure S3F), whereas similar injections did not cause any obvious changes in PVD axons (Figures S3E and S3F). In addition, we observed that epidermis-specific overexpression of nlp-29 induced an early onset of aging-associated PVD dendrite degeneration (Figure 3B). These data show that overproduction of NLP-29 is sufficient to induce PVD dendrite degeneration. Our results led us to hypothesize that aging-associated PVD dendrite degeneration is triggered by age-dependent changes in nlp-29 expression level. Indeed, both nlp-29 mRNA and protein levels increased with age in control animals (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3D), and the significant increase of nlp-29 expression on day 5 coincided temporally with the dramatic increase in the number of animals with PVD dendrite degeneration over the course of aging. The age-dependent change in epidermal nlp-29 expression was also confirmed by an increase in the number of control animals (nlp-29 transcriptional reporter: frIs7(Pnlp-29::GFP; Pcol-12::dsRed); Pujol et al., 2008aPujol N. Cypowyj S. Ziegler K. Millet A. Astrain A. Goncharov A. Jin Y. Chisholm A.D. Ewbank J.J. Distinct innate immune responses to infection and wounding in the C. elegans epidermis.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) with Pnlp-29::GFP induction during aging (Figure 3E). As C. elegans age, the skin displays structural changes, such as thickened cuticles and thinner epidermis (Herndon et al., 2002Herndon L.A. Schmeissner P.J. Dudaronek J.M. Brown P.A. Listner K.M. Sakano Y. Paupard M.C. Hall D.H. Driscoll M. Stochastic and genetic factors influence tissue-specific decline in ageing C. elegans.Nature. 2002; 419: 808-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), which could potentially lead to a loss of epidermal integrity and subject aged animals to a higher susceptibility to microbial infections. Under lab culture conditions, C. elegans uses E. coli OP50 as a food source. As OP50 can be pathogenic to older C. elegans (Garigan et al., 2002Garigan D. Hsu A.L. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Kenyon C. Genetic analysis of tissue aging in Caenorhabditis elegans: a role for heat-shock factor and bacterial proliferation.Genetics. 2002; 161: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), one may argue that changes in epidermal integrity or microbial infections could contribute to the age-dependent increase of nlp-29 expression and PVD dendrite degeneration that we observed. To test these possibilities, we first examined the epidermal integrity using Hoechst 33258 as previously described (Moribe et al., 2004Moribe H. Yochem J. Yamada H. Tabuse Y. Fujimoto T. Mekada E. Tetraspanin protein (TSP-15) is required for epidermal integrity in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5209-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). By counting the percentage of animals with staining of epidermal nuclei, we found that there was no significant difference in epidermal integrity between day 1 and day 7 control animals (Figures S2B and S2C). Also, none of the mutations examined in this study seemed to affect epidermal integrity (Figures S2B and S2C). We further showed that aging-associated PVD dendrite degeneration was unlikely to be associated with microbial infections, as animals grown on dead (heat-killed) OP50 or plates supplemented with anti-fungal drugs (nystatin or amphotericin B) displayed age-dependent Pnlp-29::GFP induction and PVD dendrite degeneration to a similar extent as in animals grown under control conditions (Figures 3E–3H). During infection, the expression level of nlp-29 is regulated by a conserved innate immune signaling cascade in the epidermis, consisting of TIR-1/SARM, NSY-1/MAP3K, SEK-1/MAP2K, and PMK-1/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Dierking et al., 2011Dierking K.

We found that loss of function in pmk-1 or tir-1 also delayed aging-associated PVD dendrite degeneration (Figure S4A). Double mutants of nlp-29 with tir-1 or pmk-1 did not show a stronger delaying effect when compared to nlp-29(lf) single mutants, suggesting that tir-1, pmk-1, and nlp-29 lie within the same pathway to influence aging-associated PVD dendrite degeneration (Figure S4B). A previous study showed that TIR-1 and PMK-1 could function in neurons to regulate neurodegeneration in a C. elegans amyotrophic lateral sclerosis model (Vérièpe et al., 2015Vérièpe J. Fossouo L. Parker J.A. Neurodegeneration in C. elegans models of ALS requires TIR-1/Sarm1 immune pathway activation in neurons.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We examined the potential neuronal functions of TIR-1 and PMK-1 in aging-associated PVD dendrite degeneration by tissue-specific RNAi. PVD-specific knockdown of TIR-1 or PMK-1 did not affect the onset of PVD dendrite degeneration, whereas knockdown of TIR-1 or PMK-1 in the epidermis delayed PVD dendrite degeneration (Figures S4C [epidermis RNAi] and S4D [PVD RNAi]). These results confirm that the TIR-1-PMK-1 pathway functions in the epidermis, but not in neurons, and does this via controlling nlp-29 expression to regulate PVD dendrite degeneration. PVD dendrites are anatomically sandwiched between the epidermis and body wall muscle (Albeg et al., 2011Albeg A. Smith C.J. Chatzigeorgiou M. Feitelson D.G. Hall D.H. Schafer W.R. Miller 3rd, D.M. Treinin M. C. elegans multi-dendritic sensory neurons: morphology and function.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2011; 46: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). One possibility for how epidermal NLP-29, a small peptide, may communicate with PVD dendrites is through ligand-receptor binding. NLP-29 was initially identified and named for its sequence similarity with YGGWamide neuropeptides (Nathoo et al., 2001Nathoo A.N. Moeller R.A. Westlund B.A. Hart A.C. Identification of neuropeptide-like protein gene families in Caenorhabditiselegans and other species.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 14000-14005Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the potential neuronal receptor(s) for NLP-29 might be known or predicted neuropeptide receptors. PVD neurons express at least 8 potential neuropeptide receptors: dmsr-1; npr-2; npr-12; npr-32; pdfr-1; C17H11.1; lat-1; and T21H3.5 (Frooninckx et al., 2012Frooninckx L. Van Rompay L. Temmerman L.

We tested all these receptors and found that two npr-12(lf) alleles had aging-associated PVD dendrite degeneration patterns comparable to that of nlp-29 mutants, whereas mutating or knocking down other neuropeptide receptors did not reproduce the degeneration-delaying effect of nlp-29(lf) (Figures 4A, 4B , S1B, S5A, and S5B). NPR-12, an ortholog of human pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide receptor, is an orphan GPCR predicted to have a neuropeptide Y receptor-like activity (Frooninckx et al., 2012Frooninckx L. Van Rompay L.

https://openalex.org/W2781765654,"Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes, important in immune surveillance and elimination of stressed, transformed, or virus-infected cells. They critically shape the inflammatory cytokine environment to orchestrate interactions of cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Some studies have reported that NK cell activation and cytokine secretion are controlled epigenetically but have yielded only limited insight into the mechanisms. Using chemical screening with small-molecule inhibitors of chromatin methylation and acetylation, further validated by knockdown approaches, we here identified Jumonji-type histone H3K27 demethylases as key regulators of cytokine production in human NK cell subsets. The prototypic JMJD3/UTX (Jumonji domain-containing protein 3) H3K27 demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 increased global levels of the repressive H3K27me3 mark around transcription start sites of effector cytokine genes. Moreover, GSK-J4 reduced IFN-γ, TNFα, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin-10 levels in cytokine-stimulated NK cells while sparing their cytotoxic killing activity against cancer cells. The anti-inflammatory effect of GSK-J4 in NK cell subsets, isolated from peripheral blood or tissue from individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), coupled with an inhibitory effect on formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, suggested that histone demethylase inhibition has broad utility for modulating immune and inflammatory responses. Overall, our results indicate that H3K27me3 is a dynamic and important epigenetic modification during NK cell activation and that JMJD3/UTX-driven H3K27 demethylation is critical for NK cell function."

This step yields green rust, which is oxidized to obtain magnetic nanoparticles, which probably consist of a magnetite/maghemite mixed-phase. Final growth and annealing at 90°C in the presence of a large excess of carboxymethyl dextran gives MCP very promising magnetic properties for magnetic particle imaging (MPI), an emerging medical imaging modality, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The magnetic nanoparticles are biocompatible and thus potential candidates for future biomedical applications such as cardiovascular imaging, sentinel lymph node mapping in cancer patients, and stem cell tracking. The new MCP that we introduce here have three times higher magnetic particle spectroscopy performance at lower and middle harmonics and five times higher MPS signal strength at higher harmonics compared with Resovist®. In addition, the new MCP have also an improved in vivo MPI performance compared to Resovist®, and we here report the first in vivo MPI investigation of this new generation of magnetic nanoparticles."
https://openalex.org/W2782402636,"Purpose To test whether the negative relationship between perceived stress and quality of life (Hypothesis 1) can be buffered by perceived social support in patients with dementia as well as in caregivers individually (Hypothesis 2: actor effects) and across partners (Hypothesis 3: partner effects and actor-partner effects). Method A total of 108 couples (N = 216 individuals) comprised of one individual with early-stage dementia and one caregiving partner were assessed at baseline and one month apart. Moderation effects were investigated by applying linear mixed models and actor-partner interdependence models. Results Although the stress-quality of life association was more pronounced in caregivers (β = -.63, p<.001) compared to patients (β = -.31, p<.001), this association was equally moderated by social support in patients (β = .14, p<.05) and in the caregivers (β = .13, p<.05). From one partner to his or her counterpart, the partner buffering and actor-partner-buffering effect were not present. Conclusion The stress-buffering effect has been replicated in individuals with dementia and caregivers but not across partners. Interventions to improve quality of life through perceived social support should not only focus on caregivers, but should incorporate both partners."
https://openalex.org/W2782475854,"Butana and Kenana are two types of zebu cattle found in Sudan. They are unique amongst African indigenous zebu cattle because of their high milk production. Aiming to understand their genome structure, we genotyped 25 individuals from each breed using the Illumina BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip. Genetic structure analysis shows that both breeds have an admixed genome composed of an even proportion of indicine (0.75 ± 0.03 in Butana, 0.76 ± 0.006 in Kenana) and taurine (0.23 ± 0.009 in Butana, 0.24 ± 0.006 in Kenana) ancestries. We also observe a proportion of 0.02 to 0.12 of European taurine ancestry in ten individuals of Butana that were sampled from cattle herds in Tamboul area suggesting local crossbreeding with exotic breeds. Signatures of selection analyses (iHS and Rsb) reveal 87 and 61 candidate positive selection regions in Butana and Kenana, respectively. These regions span genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with biological pathways that are important for adaptation to marginal environments (e.g., immunity, reproduction and heat tolerance). Trypanotolerance QTL are intersecting candidate regions in Kenana cattle indicating selection pressure acting on them, which might be associated with an unexplored level of trypanotolerance in this cattle breed. Several dairy traits QTL are overlapping the identified candidate regions in these two zebu cattle breeds. Our findings underline the potential to improve dairy production in the semi-arid pastoral areas of Africa through breeding improvement strategy of indigenous local breeds."
https://openalex.org/W2781485880,"Background Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a debilitating mental health illness that affects approximately 3.1% of U.S. adults and can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). With the emergence of digital health technologies, mobile CBT may be a cost-effective way to deliver care. We developed an analysis framework to quantify the cost-effectiveness of internet-based CBT for individuals with GAD. As a case study, we examined the potential value of a new mobile-delivered CBT program for GAD. Methods We developed a Markov model of GAD health states combined with a detailed economic analysis for a cohort of adults with GAD in the U.S. In our case study, we used pilot program efficacy data to evaluate a mobile CBT program as either prevention or treatment only and compared the strategies to traditional CBT and no CBT. Traditional CBT efficacy was estimated from clinical trial results. We calculated discounted incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over the cohort lifetime. Case study results In the base case, for a cohort of 100,000 persons with GAD, we found that mobile CBT is cost-saving. It leads to a gain of 34,108 QALYs and 81,492 QALYs and a cost reduction of $2.23 billion and $4.54 billion when compared to traditional CBT and no CBT respectively. Results were insensitive to most model inputs and mobile CBT remained cost-saving in almost all scenarios. Limitations The case study was conducted for illustrative purposes and used mobile CBT efficacy data from a small pilot program; the analysis should be re-conducted once robust efficacy data is available. The model was limited in its ability to measure the effectiveness of CBT in combination with pharmacotherapy. Conclusions Mobile CBT may lead to improved health outcomes at lower costs than traditional CBT or no intervention and may be effective as either prevention or treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2782425521,"Men have a higher rate of completed suicide than women, which suggests that sex chromosome abnormalities may be related to the pathophysiology of suicide. Recent studies have found an aberrant loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in various diseases; however, no study has investigated whether there is an association between LOY and suicide. The purpose of this study was to determine whether LOY occurs in men who completed suicide. Our study consisted of 286 male Japanese subjects comprised of 140 suicide completers without severe physical illness (130 post-mortem samples of peripheral blood and 10 brains) and 146 age-matched control subjects (130 peripheral blood samples from healthy individuals and 16 post-mortem brains). LOY was measured as the chromosome Y/chromosome X ratio of the fluorescent signal of co-amplified short sequences from the Y-X homologous amelogenin genes (AMELY and AMELX). Regression analyses showed that LOY in the blood of suicide completers was significantly more frequent than that found in controls (odds ratio = 3.50, 95% confidence interval = 1.21-10.10), but not in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) region of brain. Normal age-dependent LOY in blood was found in healthy controls (r = -0.353, p < 0.001), which was not seen in suicide completers (r = -0.119, p = 0.177). DLPFC tissue had age-dependent LOY (B = -0.002, p = 0.015), which was independent of phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that LOY in blood is associated with suicide completion. In addition, our findings are the first to also indicate that age-dependent LOY may occur not only in blood, but also in specific brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2782140699,"Drug repositioning or repurposing, i.e. identifying new indications for existing drugs, has gained increasing attention in the recent years. This approach enables the scientists to discover “new targets” for known drugs in a cost and time efficient manner. Glycation, the non-enzymatic reaction of sugars with proteins or nucleic acids to form early glycation (Amadori or fructosamine) products, is a key molecular basis of diabetic complications. Inhibiting the process of non-enzymatic protein glycation is one of the key strategies to prevent glycation-mediated diabetic complications. The present study focuses on the anti-glycation activity of 18 drugs, commonly used for the treatment of gastrointestinal, central nervous system, inflammatory diseases, bacterial infections, and gout. This study was carried out by using two in-vitro protein anti-glycation assay models. Results revealed that nimesulide (3), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, possesses a good anti-glycation activity in in-vitro BSA-MG and BSA-glucose glycation models with IC50 values of 330.56 ± 2.90, and 145.46 ± 16.35 μM, respectively. Phloroglucinol dihydrate (11), a drug used for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, showed a weak activity in BSA-MG glycation model (IC50 = 654.89 ± 2.50 μM), while it showed a good activity in BSA-glucose assay (IC50 = 148.23 ± 0.15 μM). Trimethylphloroglucinol (9), a drug used for the treatment of pain related to functional disorders of the digestive and biliary tracts, also showed a good antiglycation activity in BSA-MG model (IC50 = 321.15 ± 1.26 μM), while it was found to be inactive in in-vitro BSA-glucose assay (IC50 = 12.95% inhibition). These activities of drugs were compared with the anti-glycation activity of the standard, rutin (IC50 = 294.5 ± 1.50 μM in BSA-MG glycation model, and IC50 = 86.94 ± 0.24 μM in BSA- glucose model). Rest of the drugs exhibited a relatively weak antiglycation activity. This study identifies nimesulide (3), and phloroglucinol dihydrate (11) as new inhibitors of in-vitro protein glycation for further investigations as potential anti-diabetic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2782161442,"Blood hemoglobin (Hb) is a common indicator for diagnosing anemia and is often determined through laboratory analysis of venous samples. One alternative to laboratory-based methods is the handheld HemoCue® Hb 201+ device, which requires a finger prick and wicking of blood into a pretreated cuvette for analysis. An alternative HemoCue® gravity method is being investigated for improved accuracy. Further, recent developments in noninvasive technologies could provide an accurate, rapid, safe, point-of-care option for hemoglobin estimation while addressing some limitations of current tools, but device performance must be assessed in low-resource settings. This study evaluated the performance of two HemoCue® Hb 201+ blood sampling methods and a noninvasive device (Pronto® with DCI-mini™ sensors) in a Rwandan pediatric clinic. Reference hemoglobin values were determined in 132 children 6 to 59 months of age by using a standard hematology analyzer (Sysmex KN21TM). Half were tested using the HemoCue® wicking method; half were tested using the HemoCue® gravity method; and 112 had successful hemoglobin readings with Pronto® DCI-mini™. Statistical analysis was used to assess the level of bias generated by each method and the key drivers of bias. The HemoCue® gravity method was the least biased. The HemoCue® wicking and Pronto® methods biases were inversely related to the Sysmex KN21TM results. Both HemoCue® sampling methods correctly classified patients’ anemic status in 80% or more of instances, whereas the Pronto® device had a correct classification rate of only 69%. The HemoCue® gravity method was more accurate than the traditional HemoCue® wicking method in this study, but its accuracy and operational feasibility should be confirmed by future studies. The Pronto® DCI-mini™ devices showed considerable promise but require further improvements in sensitivity and specificity before wider adoption."
https://openalex.org/W2782390373,"Community pharmacy professionals are being widely accepted as sources of treatment and advice for managing minor ailments, largely owing to their location at the heart of the community. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to document the involvement of community pharmacy professionals in the management of minor ailments and perceived barriers that limit their provision of such services. Simulated patient (SP) visits combined with a qualitative study using in-depth interviews was conducted among community pharmacy professionals in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia. Scenarios of three different minor ailments (uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection, back pain and acute diarrhea) were selected and results were reported as percentages. Pharmacy professionals were also interviewed about the barriers in the management of minor ailments. Out of 66 simulated visits, 61 cases (92.4%) provided one or more medications to the SPs. Pharmacy professionals in 16 visits asked SPs information on details of symptoms and past medical and medication history. Ibuprofen alone or in combination with paracetamol was the most commonly dispensed analgesics for back pain. Oral rehydration fluid (ORS) with zinc was the most frequently dispensed medication (33.3%) for the management of acute diarrhea followed by mebendazole (23.9%). Moreover, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid capsule (35%) followed by Amoxicillin (25%) were the most commonly dispensed antibiotics for uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection. Lack of clinical training and poor community awareness towards the role of community pharmacists in the management of minor ailments were the main barriers for the provision of minor ailment management by community pharmacy professionals. Overall, community pharmacists provided inadequate therapy for the simulated minor ailments. Lack of access to clinical training and poor community awareness were the most commonly cited barriers for providing such services. So as to improve community pharmacists’ involvement in managing minor ailments and optimize the contribution of pharmacists, interventions should focus on overcoming the identified barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2781512160,"Mutations in gyrA are the primary cause of quinolone resistance encountered in gram-negative clinical isolates. The prospect of this work was to analyze the role of gyrA mutations in eliciting high quinolone resistance in uropathogenic E.coli (UPEC) through molecular docking studies. Quinolone susceptibility testing of 18 E.coli strains isolated from UTI patients revealed unusually high resistance level to all the quinolones used; especially norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The QRDR of gyrA was amplified and sequenced. Mutations identified in gyrA of E.coli included Ser83Leu, Asp87Asn and Ala93Gly/Glu. Contrasting previous reports, we found Ser83Leu substitution in sensitive strains. Strains with S83L, D87N and A93E (A15 and A26) demonstrated norfloxacin MICs ≥1024mg/L which could be proof that Asp87Asn is necessary for resistance phenotype. Resistance to levofloxacin was comparatively lower in all the isolates. Docking of 4 quinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin and norfloxacin) to normal and mutated E.coli gyrase A protein demonstrated lower binding energies for the latter, with significant displacement of norfloxacin in the mutated GyrA complex and least displacement in case of levofloxacin."
https://openalex.org/W2781868814,"Cowpea is one of the most important food and forage legumes in drier regions of the tropics and subtropics. However, cowpea yield worldwide is markedly below the known potential due to abiotic and biotic stresses, including parasitism by root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp., RKN). Two resistance genes with dominant effect, Rk and Rk2, have been reported to provide resistance against RKN in cowpea. Despite their description and use in breeding for resistance to RKN and particularly genetic mapping of the Rk locus, the exact genes conferring resistance to RKN remain unknown. In the present work, QTL mapping using recombinant inbred line (RIL) population 524B x IT84S-2049 segregating for a newly mapped locus and analysis of the transcriptome changes in two cowpea near-isogenic lines (NIL) were used to identify candidate genes for Rk and the newly mapped locus. A major QTL, designated QRk-vu9.1, associated with resistance to Meloidogyne javanica reproduction, was detected and mapped on linkage group LG9 at position 13.37 cM using egg production data. Transcriptome analysis on resistant and susceptible NILs 3 and 9 days after inoculation revealed up-regulation of 109 and 98 genes and down-regulation of 110 and 89 genes, respectively, out of 19,922 unique genes mapped to the common bean reference genome. Among the differentially expressed genes, four and nine genes were found within the QRk-vu9.1 and QRk-vu11.1 QTL intervals, respectively. Six of these genes belong to the TIR-NBS-LRR family of resistance genes and three were upregulated at one or more time-points. Quantitative RT-PCR validated gene expression to be positively correlated with RNA-seq expression pattern for eight genes. Future functional analysis of these cowpea genes will enhance our understanding of Rk-mediated resistance and identify the specific gene responsible for the resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2782521784,"The geological, biological and geochemical features of a particular field of hydrothermal vents, discovered in the Panarea Volcanic Complex during a research survey carried out in 2015, are described for the first time. The site, located at 70–80 m depth off the South-western coast of the islet of Basiluzzo, was named Smoking Land for the presence of a large number of wide and high active chimneys and was characterized in terms of dissolved benthic fluxes, associated macrofauna and megafauna communities and preliminary mineralogy and geochemistry of chimney structures. On the whole field, a total of 39 chimneys, different in size and shape, were closely observed and described; 14 of them showed emission of low temperature hydrothermal fluids of marine origin characterized by acidified chemical conditions. The CTD and benthic chamber measurements highlighted that the Smoking Land is able to form a sea water bottom layer characterized by variable acidity and high DIC and trace elements concentrations; these characteristics weaken moving away from the chimney mouths. The SEM-EDS analysis of the collected solid samples revealed a chimney structure principally composed by amorphous and low crystalline Fe-oxyhydroxides of hydrothermal origins. The ROV explorations revealed a wide coverage of red algae (Peyssonnelia spp.) colonized by the green algae Flabiella petiolata and by suspension feeders, mainly sponges, but also bryozoans, and tubicolous polychaetes. Although novent-exclusive species were identified, the benthic communities found in association to the chimneys included more taxa than those observed in the surrounding no-vent rocky areas. These first findings evidence a submarine dynamic habitat where geological, chemical and biological processes are intimately connected, making the Smoking Land an important site in terms of marine heritage that should be safeguarded and protected."
https://openalex.org/W2781806573,"Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is commonly over-expressed and plays critical roles in the development and progression in a variety of cancers. It has previously been shown that HDGF is overregulated in prostate cancer cells compared to normal prostate cells, which is correlated with cellular migration and invasion of prostate cancer. Here, the molecular mechanisms of HDGF in prostate cancer is investigated. It is shown that HDGF knockdown reduces prostate cancer cellular migration and invasion in both androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells and androgen-insensitive DU145 and PC3 cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis reveals that HDGF knockdown inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of prostate cancer cells by upregulation of protein E-cadherin and downregulation of proteins N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail and Slug. In addition, mechanistic studies reveal that proteins MMP2 and MMP9 are down-regulated. In conclusion, our data suggested that HDGF knockdown inhibits cellular migration and invasion in vitro of prostate cancer via modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathway, as well as MMP2 and MMP9 signaling pathway. These results supported that HDGF is a relevant protein in the progression of prostate cancer and may serve as a potentially therapeutic target for prostate cancer as well as its downstream targets."
https://openalex.org/W2781905668,"Neurosteroids are endogenous sterols that potentiate or inhibit pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) and can be effective anesthetics, analgesics, or anti-epileptic drugs. The complex effects of neurosteroids on pLGICs suggest the presence of multiple binding sites in these receptors. Here, using a series of novel neurosteroid-photolabeling reagents combined with top-down and middle-down mass spectrometry, we have determined the stoichiometry, sites, and orientation of binding for 3α,5α-pregnane neurosteroids in the Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a prototypic pLGIC. The neurosteroid-based reagents photolabeled two sites per GLIC subunit, both within the transmembrane domain; one site was an intrasubunit site, and the other was located in the interface between subunits. By using reagents with photoreactive groups positioned throughout the neurosteroid backbone, we precisely map the orientation of neurosteroid binding within each site. Amino acid substitutions introduced at either site altered neurosteroid modulation of GLIC channel activity, demonstrating the functional role of both sites. These results provide a detailed molecular model of multisite neurosteroid modulation of GLIC, which may be applicable to other mammalian pLGICs."
https://openalex.org/W2781780387,"Flowering is an important agronomic trait. Quantile regression (QR) can be used to fit models for all portions of a probability distribution. In Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), QR can estimate SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) effects on each quantile of interest. The objectives of this study were to estimate genetic parameters and to use QR to identify genomic regions for phenological traits (Days to first flower—DFF; Days for flowering—DTF; Days to end of flowering—DEF) in common bean. A total of 80 genotypes of common beans, with 3 replicates were raised at 4 locations and seasons. Plants were genotyped for 384 SNPs. Traditional single-SNP and 9 QR models, ranging from equally spaced quantiles (τ) 0.1 to 0.9, were used to associate SNPs to phenotype. Heritabilities were moderate high, ranging from 0.32 to 0.58. Genetic and phenotypic correlations were all high, averaging 0.66 and 0.98, respectively. Traditional single-SNP GWAS model was not able to find any SNP-trait association. On the other hand, when using QR methodology considering one extreme quantile (τ = 0.1) we found, respectively 1 and 7, significant SNPs associated for DFF and DTF. Significant SNPs were found on Pv01, Pv02, Pv03, Pv07, Pv10 and Pv11 chromosomes. We investigated potential candidate genes in the region around these significant SNPs. Three genes involved in the flowering pathways were identified, including Phvul.001G214500, Phvul.007G229300 and Phvul.010G142900.1 on Pv01, Pv07 and Pv10, respectively. These results indicate that GWAS-based QR was able to enhance the understanding on genetic architecture of phenological traits (DFF and DTF) in common bean."
https://openalex.org/W2782410242,"Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) causes approximately 265,000 illnesses and 3,600 hospitalizations annually and is highly associated with animal contamination due to the natural reservoir of ruminant gastrointestinal tracts. Free STEC-specific bacteriophages against STEC strains are also commonly isolated from fecal-contaminated environment. Previous studies have evaluated the correlation between the prevalence of STEC-specific bacteriophages and STEC strains to improve animal-associated environment. However, the similar information regarding free STEC-specific bacteriophages prevalence in produce growing area is lacking. Thus, the objectives of this research were to determine the prevalence of STEC-specific phages, analyze potential effects of environmental factors on the prevalence of the phages, and study correlations between STEC-specific bacteriophages and the bacterial hosts in pre-harvest produce environment. Surface water from 20 samples sites was subjected to free bacteriophage isolation using host strains of both generic E. coli and STEC (O157, six non-O157 and one O179 strains) cocktails, and isolation of O157 and non-O157 STEC strains by use of culture methods combined with PCR-based confirmation. The weather data were obtained from weather station website. Free O145- and O179-specific bacteriophages were the two most frequently isolated bacteriophages among all (O45, O145, O157 and O179) in this study. The results showed June and July had relatively high prevalence of overall STEC-specific bacteriophages with minimum isolation of STEC strains. In addition, the bacteriophages were likely isolated in the area—around or within city—with predominant human impact, whereas the STEC bacterial isolates were commonly found in agriculture impact environment. Furthermore, there was a trend that the sample sites with positive of free STEC bacteriophage did not have the specific STEC bacterial hosts. The findings of the study enable us to understand the ecology between free STEC-specific phages and STEC bacteria for further pre-harvest food safety management in produce environment."

Here, we describe the discovery of an irreversible and pH-dependent oxidation of the 8α-methyl group to 8-formyl-FAD (8f-FAD), which represents a unique chemical modification of a flavin cofactor in the human flavoproteome. Furthermore, a set of hETF variants revealed that several conserved amino acid residues in the FAD-binding pocket of electron-transferring flavoproteins are required for the conversion to the formyl group. Two of the variants generated in our study, namely αR249C and αT266M, cause glutaric aciduria type II, a severe inherited disease. Both of the variants showed impaired formation of 8f-FAD shedding new light on the potential molecular cause of disease development. Interestingly, the conversion of FAD to 8f-FAD yields a very stable flavin semiquinone that exhibited slightly lower rates of electron transfer in an artificial assay system than hETF containing FAD. In contrast, the formation of 8f-FAD enhanced the affinity to human dimethylglycine dehydrogenase 5-fold, indicating that formation of 8f-FAD modulates the interaction of hETF with client enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, we hypothesize that the FAD cofactor bound to hETF is subject to oxidation in the alkaline (pH 8) environment of the mitochondrial matrix, which may modulate electron transport between client dehydrogenases and the respiratory chain. This discovery challenges the current concepts of electron transfer processes in mitochondria.

Both of the variants showed impaired formation of 8f-FAD shedding new light on the potential molecular cause of disease development. Interestingly, the conversion of FAD to 8f-FAD yields a very stable flavin semiquinone that exhibited slightly lower rates of electron transfer in an artificial assay system than hETF containing FAD. In contrast, the formation of 8f-FAD enhanced the affinity to human dimethylglycine dehydrogenase 5-fold, indicating that formation of 8f-FAD modulates the interaction of hETF with client enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, we hypothesize that the FAD cofactor bound to hETF is subject to oxidation in the alkaline (pH 8) environment of the mitochondrial matrix, which may modulate electron transport between client dehydrogenases and the respiratory chain. This discovery challenges the current concepts of electron transfer processes in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2781912964,"Brucella abortus is a Gram-negative zoonotic pathogen for which there is no 100% effective vaccine. Phagosomes in B. abortus–infected cells fail to mature, allowing the pathogen to survive and proliferate. Interleukin 10 (IL10) promotes B. abortus persistence in macrophages by mechanisms that are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the regulatory role of IL10 in the immune response to B. abortus infection. B. abortus–infected macrophages were treated with either IL10 siRNA or recombinant IL10 (rIL10), and the expression of phagolysosome- or inflammation-related genes was evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Phagolysosome fusion was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. We found that the synthesis of several membrane-trafficking regulators and lysosomal enzymes was suppressed by IL10 during infection, resulting in a significant increase in the recruitment of hydrolytic enzymes by Brucella-containing phagosomes (BCPs) when IL10 signaling was blocked. Moreover, blocking IL10 signaling also enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production. Finally, concomitant treatment with STAT3 siRNA significantly reduced the suppression of proinflammatory brucellacidal activity but not phagolysosome fusion by rIL10. Thus, our data provide the first evidence that clearly indicates the suppressive role of IL10 on phagolysosome fusion and inflammation in response to B. abortus infection through two distinct mechanisms, STAT3-independent and -dependent pathways, respectively, in murine macrophages."

However, methods to secure stored information on mobile devices may adversely affect usability. We tested the reliability and usability of common user authentication techniques in younger and older adults. Methodology Usability testing was conducted in two age groups, 18 to 30 years and 50 years and older. After completing a demographic questionnaire, each participant tested four authentication options in random order: four-digit personal identification number (PIN), graphical password (GRAPHICAL), Android pattern-lock (PATTERN), and a swipe-style Android fingerprint scanner (FINGERPRINT). Participants rated each option using the Systems Usability Scale (SUS). Results A total of 59 older and 43 younger participants completed the study. Overall, PATTERN was the fastest option (3.44s), and PIN had the fewest errors per attempt (0.02). Participants were able to login using PIN, PATTERN, and GRAPHICAL at least 98% of the time. FINGERPRINT was the slowest (26.97s), had an average of 1.46 errors per attempt, and had a successful login rate of 85%. Overall, PIN and PATTERN had higher SUS scores than FINGERPRINT and GRAPHICAL. Compared to younger participants, older participants were also less likely to find PATTERN to be tiring, annoying or time consuming and less likely to consider PIN to be time consuming. Younger participants were more likely to rate GRAPHICAL as annoying, time consuming and tiring than older participants. Conclusions On mobile devices, PIN and pattern-lock outperformed graphical passwords and swipe-style fingerprints. All participants took longer to authenticate using the swipe-style fingerprint compared to other options. Older participants also took two to three seconds longer to authenticate using the PIN, pattern and graphical passwords though this did not appear to affect perceived usability."
https://openalex.org/W2781570078,"Eukaryotic organisms have developed a variety of mechanisms to regulate translation post-transcriptionally, including but not limited to the use of miRNA silencing in many species. One method of post-transcriptional regulation is through miRNAs that bind to the 3′ UTRs to regulate mRNA abundance and influence protein expression. Therefore, the diversity of mRNA 3′ UTRs mediating miRNA binding sites influence miRNA-mediated regulation. Alternative polyadenylation, by shortening mRNA isoforms, increases the diversity of 3′ UTRs; moreover, short mRNA isoforms elude miRNA-medicated repression. Because no current prediction methods for putative miRNA target sites consider whether or not 1) splicing-informed miRNA binding sites and/or 2) the use of 3′ UTRs provide higher resolution or functionality, we sought to identify not only the genome-wide impact of using exons in mRNA 3′ UTRs but also their functional connection to miRNA regulation and clinical outcomes in cancer. With a genome-wide expression of mRNA and miRNA quantified by 395 bladder cancer cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we 1) demonstrate the diversity of 3′ UTRs affecting miRNA efficiency and 2) identify a set of genes clinically associated with mRNA expression in bladder cancer. Knowledge of 3′ UTR diversity will not only be a useful addition to current miRNA target prediction algorithms but also enhance the clinical utility of mRNA isoforms in the expression of mRNA in cancer. Thus, variability among cancer patient’s variability in molecular signatures based on these exon usage events in 3′ UTR along with miRNAs in bladder cancer may lead to better prognostic/treatment strategies for improved precision medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2781906530,"In most eukaryotic organisms, translation elongation requires two highly conserved elongation factors eEF1A and eEF2. Fungal systems are unique in requiring a third factor, the eukaryotic Elongation Factor 3 (eEF3). For decades, eEF3, a ribosome-dependent ATPase, was considered “fungal-specific”, however, recent bioinformatics analysis indicates it may be more widely distributed among other unicellular eukaryotes. In order to determine whether divergent eEF3-like proteins from other eukaryotic organisms can provide the essential functions of eEF3 in budding yeast, the eEF3-like proteins from Schizosaccharomyes pombe and an oomycete, Phytophthora infestans, were cloned and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Plasmid shuffling experiments showed that both S. pombe and P. infestans eEF3 can support the growth of S. cerevisiae in the absence of endogenous budding yeast eEF3. Consistent with its ability to provide the essential functions of eEF3, P. infestans eEF3 possessed ribosome-dependent ATPase activity. Yeast cells expressing P. infestans eEF3 displayed reduced protein synthesis due to defects in translation elongation/termination. Identification of eEF3 in divergent species will advance understanding of its function and the ribosome specific determinants that lead to its requirement as well as contribute to the identification of functional domains of eEF3 for potential drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2782333181,"The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of low-dose radiation on fibroblast cells irradiated by spectrally and dosimetrically well-characterized soft x-rays. To achieve this, a new cell culture x-ray irradiation system was designed. This system generates characteristic fluorescent x-rays to irradiate the cell culture with x-rays of well-defined energies and doses. 3T3 fibroblast cells were cultured in cups with Mylar® surfaces and were irradiated for one hour with characteristic iron (Fe) K x-ray radiation at a dose rate of approximately 550 μGy/hr. Cell proliferation, total protein analysis, flow cytometry, and cell staining were performed on fibroblast cells to determine the various effects caused by the radiation. Irradiated cells demonstrated increased proliferation and protein production compared to control samples. Flow cytometry revealed that a higher percentage of irradiated cells were in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle compared to control counterparts, which is consistent with other low-dose studies. Cell staining results suggest that irradiated cells maintained normal cell functions after radiation exposure, as there were no qualitative differences between the images of the control and irradiated samples. The result of this study suggest that low-dose soft x-ray radiation might cause an initial pause, followed by a significant increase, in proliferation. An initial “pause” in cell proliferation could be a protective mechanism of the cells to minimize DNA damage caused by radiation exposure. The new cell irradiation system developed here allows for unprecedented control over the properties of the x-rays given to the cell cultures. This will allow for further studies on various cell types with known spectral distribution and carefully measured doses of radiation, which may help to elucidate the mechanisms behind varied cell responses to low-dose x-rays reported in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2782380658,"Objectives Previous studies found higher levels of physical activity to be protective against infections and that short and long sleep negatively affects the immune response. However, these relationships remain debatable. We aimed to investigate if physical activity and sleep habits affect incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) in a prospective cohort study. Methods A total of 2,038 adults aged 25–64 years served as a random sample of the gainfully employed population of an industrial town in Sweden. Physical activity and sleep habits were estimated through self-reported questionnaires. Physical activity was expressed as metabolic energy turnover hours per day. Sleep was assessed as number of hours slept per night and its perceived quality. URTI outcome was prospectively self-reported during a 9-month follow-up period. Associations of physical activity and sleep with URTI were estimated using hurdle regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Results During 1,583 person-years 1,597 URTI occurred, resulting in an incidence of 1.01 infections/person-year (95% CI 0.96–1.06). The fitted regression models did not provide support for an association with physical activity or sleep habits. Factors positively associated with experiencing URTI were having children ≤ 6 years, female gender, higher education and treatment for allergy, asthma or lung cancer. Having children ≤ 6 years and female gender were related to a higher number of URTI among those experiencing URTI. Conclusions We did not find any association between physical activity, sleep duration or sleep quality and the occurrence of upper respiratory tract infections in adult Swedish population."
https://openalex.org/W2781837644,"Objective Recently, it has been suggested that oxytocin (OT) has a role in metabolism and neuropsychiatry health and disease, and therefore, it may represent a potential therapeutic target. The current study aimed to investigate relationships between OT and glycemic status along with psycho-social and behavioral factors. Design and methods A total of 92 obese or overweight, African American, male subjects were enrolled in the study. Biometric and biochemical data were collected including oral glucose tolerance testing and urinary OT (measured by ELISA). Subjects also completed questionnaires on social and lifestyle factors. Results OT levels were found to be significantly lower in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to normal glucose tolerance (p<0.05). When stratified by OT tertiles, subjects with higher OT had lower weight, body mass index (BMI) and hemoglobin A1c, but higher eGFR which remained significant after BMI adjustment. The highest OT tertile also had more smokers and more users of psychiatric medications. A stepwise ordered logistic regression supported these findings and could account for 21% of the variation in OT categories (pseudoR2 = 0.21). Conclusions In this unique population, OT was found lower in subjects with diabetes but higher with better renal function, cigarette smoking and use of psychiatric medications. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings and examine the potential therapeutic role of OT."
https://openalex.org/W2781899264,"Rare changes in a stream of otherwise repeated task-irrelevant sounds break through selective attention and disrupt performance in an unrelated visual task by triggering shifts of attention to and from the deviant sound (deviance distraction). Evidence indicates that the involuntary orientation of attention to unexpected sounds is followed by their semantic processing. However, past demonstrations relied on tasks in which the meaning of the deviant sounds overlapped with features of the primary task. Here we examine whether such processing is observed when no such overlap is present but sounds carry some relevance to the participants’ biological need to eat when hungry. We report the results of an experiment in which hungry and satiated participants partook in a cross-modal oddball task in which they categorized visual digits (odd/even) while ignoring task-irrelevant sounds. On most trials the irrelevant sound was a sinewave tone (standard sound). On the remaining trials, deviant sounds consisted of spoken words related to food (food deviants) or control words (control deviants). Questionnaire data confirmed state (but not trait) differences between the two groups with respect to food craving, as well as a greater desire to eat the food corresponding to the food-related words in the hungry relative to the satiated participants. The results of the oddball task revealed that food deviants produced greater distraction (longer response times) than control deviants in hungry participants while the reverse effect was observed in satiated participants. This effect was observed in the first block of trials but disappeared thereafter, reflecting semantic saturation. Our results suggest that (1) the semantic content of deviant sounds is involuntarily processed even when sharing no feature with the primary task; and that (2) distraction by deviant sounds can be modulated by the participants’ biological needs."
https://openalex.org/W2782287140,"Background For health technology assessment (HTA) to be more policy relevant and for health technology-related decision-making to be truly evidence-based, promoting knowledge translation (KT) is of vital importance. Although some research has focused on KT of HTA, there is a dearth of literature on KT determinants and the situation in developing countries and transitional societies remains largely unknown. Objective To investigate the determinants of HTA KT from research to health policy-making from the perspective of researchers in China. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods A structured questionnaire which focused on KT was distributed to HTA researchers in China. KT activity levels in various fields of HTA research were compared, using one-way ANOVA. Principal component analysis was performed to provide a basis to combine similar variables. To investigate the determinants of KT level, multiple linear regression analysis was performed. Results Based on a survey of 382 HTA researchers, it was found that HTA KT wasn’t widespread in China. Furthermore, results showed that no significant differences existed between the various HTA research fields. Factors, such as attitudes of researchers toward HTA and evidence utilization, academic ranks and linkages between researchers and policy-makers, had significant impact on HTA KT (p-values<0.05). Additionally, collaboration between HTA researchers and policy-makers, policy-relevance of HTA research, practicality of HTA outcomes and making HTA reports easier to understand also contributed to predicting KT level. However, academic nature of HTA research was negatively associated with KT level. Conclusion KT from HTA to policy-making was influenced by many factors. Of particular importance were collaborations between researchers and policy-makers, ensuring policy relevance of HTA and making HTA evidence easier to understand by potential users."
https://openalex.org/W2782130367,"Individuals with sickle cell disease particularly with the homozygous (SS) genotype historically have relatively low blood pressure. Nonetheless, they develop vasculopathy-associated organ dysfunction and the risk of organ dysfunction increases at blood pressures that are normal in the general population. This phenomenon is termed relative systemic hypertension (RSH) with a systolic blood pressure range of 120–139 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure range of 70–89 mmHg. The significance of RSH lies in its association with renal insufficiency, pulmonary hypertension, stroke and propensity to progress to systemic hypertension. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 1,000 adults with sickle cell disease at the Ghana Institute of Clinical Genetics, to determine the prevalence of RSH in sickle cell disease in Ghana and associated complications. We found a high prevalence of RSH and hypertension with a relatively low frequency of renal insufficiency. Pulse pressure, a predictor of mortality, was higher in males of all ages. We anticipate that providing an estimate of the burden of RSH will heighten its recognition and clinical management among health care providers."
https://openalex.org/W2781664134,"Rhodococcus equi can cause severe infections in people, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The R. equi virulence plasmids (vap) encoding vapA and vapB are linked to development of infections in domestic animals. Recently, a novel virulence plasmid, vapN, was identified in isolates cultured from cattle, but its prevalence or significance in human R. equi infections has not been extensively studied. To determine the prevalence of vapN in a diverse collection of human-derived isolates from different countries, 65 R. equi isolates collected by various institutions from 1984 to 2002 were screened for the presence of vapN and other virulence plasmids through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using redesigned primer sets. Of the isolates that carried plasmids, 43% (16/37) were vapN-positive and fewer were vapB or vapA-positive (30 and 16%, respectively). This is the first report of vapN carriage in R. equi isolated from human infections. One isolate (H-30) carried vapN but did not amplify the conjugal plasmid transfer gene traA associated with carriage of vap, which could be explained by sequence variation within the traA gene. Another isolate (H-55) amplified traA, but did not amplify vapA, B, or N (traA+ vapABN-) with previously described primer sets or those developed for this study. The H-55 traA sequence had 98% identity to traA sequences in vapA plasmids, which suggests that it may carry a variant of previously characterized virulence plasmids or a novel virulence plasmid. Carriage of vapN in R. equi isolates derived from people is not uncommon and more research is needed to determine its significance in the epidemiology and pathogenesis of human R. equi infections."

Many were found to be infected with a macluravirus and mixtures of different potyviruses, one third of them narcissus yellow stripe virus (NYSV)-like viruses. Genomes of nine of the NYSV-like viruses were sequenced and, together with four already published, provided data for phylogenetic and pairwise identity analyses of their place in the turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) phylogenetic group. Using existing ICTV criteria for defining potyvirus species, the narcissus viruses in TuMV group were found to be from five species; the previously described NLSYV, and four new species we call narcissus virus 1 (NV-1) and narcissus yellow stripe-1 to -3 (NYSV-1, NYSV-2 and NYSV-3). However, as all are from a single host species, and natural recombinants with NV-1 and NYSV-3 'parents have been found in China and India, we also conclude that they could be considered to be members of a single mega-species, narcissus virus; the criteria for defining such a potyvirus species would then be that their polyprotein sequences have greater than 69% identical nucleotides and greater than 75% identical amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2767369325,"Divergence date estimates are central to understand evolutionary processes and depend, in the case of molecular phylogenies, on tests of molecular clocks. Here we propose two non-parametric tests of strict and relaxed molecular clocks built upon a framework that uses the empirical cumulative distribution (ECD) of branch lengths obtained from an ensemble of Bayesian trees and well known non-parametric (one-sample and two-sample) Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit test. In the strict clock case, the method consists in using the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to directly test if the phylogeny is clock-like, in other words, if it follows a Poisson law. The ECD is computed from the discretized branch lengths and the parameter $\lambda$ of the expected Poisson distribution is calculated as the average branch length over the ensemble of trees. To compensate for the auto-correlation in the ensemble of trees and pseudo-replication we take advantage of thinning and effective sample size, two features provided by Bayesian inference MCMC samplers. Finally, it is observed that tree topologies with very long or very short branches lead to Poisson mixtures and in this case we propose the use of the two-sample KS test with samples from two continuous branch length distributions, one obtained from an ensemble of clock-constrained trees and the other from an ensemble of unconstrained trees. Moreover, in this second form the test can also be applied to test for relaxed clock models. The use of a statistically equivalent ensemble of phylogenies to obtain the branch lengths ECD, instead of one consensus tree, yields considerable reduction of the effects of small sample size and provides again of power."
https://openalex.org/W2781505088,"Objective The glutathione system plays an essential role in antioxidant defense after surgery. We assessed the effects of intensive insulin treatment (IIT) on glutathione synthesis rate and redox balance in cancer patients, who had developed stress hyperglycemia after major surgery. Methods We evaluated 10 non-diabetic cancer patients the day after radical abdominal surgery combined with intra-operative radiation therapy. In each patient, a 24-hr period of IIT, aimed at tight euglycemic control, was preceded, or followed, by a 24-hr period of conventional insulin treatment (CIT) (control regimen). Insulin was administered for 24 hours, during total parenteral nutrition, at a dosage to maintain a moderate hyperglycemia in CIT, and normoglycemic blood glucose levels in IIT (9.3±0.5 vs 6.5±0.3 mmol/L respectively, P<0.001; coefficient of variation, 9.7±1.4 and 10.5±1.1%, P = 0.43). No hypoglycemia (i.e., blood glucose < 3.9 mmol/L) was observed in any of the patients. Insulin treatments were performed on the first and second day after surgery, in randomized order, according to a crossover experimental design. Plasma concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and erythrocyte glutathione synthesis rates (EGSR), measured by primed-constant infusion of L-[2H2]cysteine, were assessed at the end of each 24-hr period of either IIT or CIT. Results Compared to CIT, IIT was associated with higher EGSR (2.70±0.51 versus 1.18±0.29 mmol/L/day, p = 0.01) and lower (p = 0.04) plasma TBARS concentrations (2.2±0.2 versus 2.9±0.4 nmol/L). Conclusions In patients developing stress hyperglycemia after major surgery, IIT, in absence of hypoglycemia, stimulates erythrocyte glutathione synthesis, while decreasing oxidative stress."

The pneumonia-causing pathogen Legionella pneumophila delivers more than 330 effectors into the host cell via its type IVB Dot/Icm secretion system. The collective functions of these proteins are the establishment of a replicative niche from which Legionella can recruit cellular materials to grow while evading lysosomal fusion inhibiting its growth. Using a combination of structural, biochemical, and in vivo approaches, we show that one of these translocated effector proteins, Ceg4, is a phosphotyrosine phosphatase harboring a haloacid dehalogenase–hydrolase domain. Ceg4 could dephosphorylate a broad range of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides in vitro and attenuated activation of MAPK-controlled pathways in both yeast and human cells.

The ability to apply the same invasion strategy to invade human alveolar macrophages raises the intriguing possibility that Legionella‘s effectors target host processes that are conserved between distant eukaryotic phyla. The sheer number of Legionella effectors and their apparent functional redundancy makes their functional characterization particularly challenging (16O'Connor T.J. Adepoju Y. Boyd D. Isberg R.R.

To achieve these effects, effectors are often involved in post-translational modification (PTM) of specific host proteins. A key regulation mechanism in both eukaryotic and bacterial cells, PTMs typically involve enzymatic covalent modification of targeted proteins at specific residues that affects that protein's activity, localization, or interactions, thus triggering a change in protein function. Effector proteins can possess not only the PTM activities found in the bacterial world but also ostensibly exclusively eukaryotic PTM activities. Of particular prevalence, bacterial effectors have evolved to mimic the activity of ubiquitin protein ligases, which control the final step in the eukaryote-specific PTM involving attachment of the ubiquitin polypeptide to targeted proteins, usually resulting in this protein's degradation by the proteasome (25Ashida H.

The most common PTM in eukaryotic cells is phosphorylation in which a phosphate group from a donor molecule such as ATP is transferred onto hydroxyl functional groups on residues (serine, threonine, or tyrosine) of the targeted protein (32Khoury G.A.

This PTM is catalyzed by kinases, and the human genome encodes several hundred protein kinases divided into tyrosine- and serine/threonine–specific enzymes (34Manning G. Plowman G.D. Hunter T.

This PTM mechanism is involved in most if not all known human cell processes. One of the best studied examples of phosphorylation-controlled signaling is mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). MAPKs are highly conserved Ser/Thr protein kinases that have been extensively studied for their central roles in mediating signal transduction of extracellular stimuli to the appropriate biological response (35Seger R. Krebs E.G. The MAPK signaling cascade.FASEB J. 1995; 9 (7601337): 726-735https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.812727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues in a Thr-X-Tyr motif located in their activation loops by upstream kinases (MAPK kinases (MAPKKs)) (36Cargnello M. Roux P.P. Activation and function of the MAPKs and their substrates, the MAPK-activated protein kinases.Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

In turn, MAPKs are responsible for phosphorylating and activating downstream MAPK-activated protein kinases (MAPKAPKs or MKs). These downstream targets elicit activation of processes including regulation of stress response, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Their control of processes highly relevant to bacterial infections and their careful regulation and conservation among eukaryotes have made MAPKs attractive targets for bacterial effectors. Icm/Dot substrates LegK1–4 share homology to eukaryotic protein kinases, and activation of MAPKs in response to Legionella is well-documented (37N'Guessan P.D. Etouem M.O. Schmeck B. Hocke A.C.

However, effects of oxytocin on startle reactivity, a well-validated measure of defense system activation related to fear and anxiety, have been inconsistent. Here we investigated the influence of oxytocin on startle reactivity with particular focus on the role of trait anxiety. Methods Forty-four healthy male participants attended two experimental sessions. They received intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) in one session and placebo in the other. Startle probes were presented in combination with pictures of social and non-social content. Eye-blink startle magnitude was measured by electromyography over the musculus orbicularis oculi in response to 95 dB noise bursts. Participants were assigned to groups of high vs. low trait anxiety based on their scores on the trait form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results A significant interaction effect of oxytocin with STAI confirmed that trait anxiety moderated the effect of oxytocin on startle reactivity. Post-hoc tests indicated that for participants with elevated trait anxiety, oxytocin increased startle magnitude, particularly when watching non-social pictures, while this was not the case for participants with low trait anxiety. Conclusion Results indicate that effects of oxytocin on defense system activation depend on individual differences in trait anxiety. Trait anxiety may be an important moderator variable that should be considered in human studies on oxytocin effects."

Using both survey and administrative data, we simulate the evolution of the Quebec population's health status until death, through a series of dynamic transitions that accounts for social and demographic characteristics associated with CVD risk factors.A 25% reduction in CVD mortality between 2012 and 2025 achieved through decreased incidence could contain the pace of healthcare cost growth towards 2050 by nearly 7 percentage points for consultations with a physician, and by almost 9 percentage points for hospitalizations. Over the 2012-2050 period, the present value of cost savings is projected to amount to C$13.1 billion in 2012 dollars. The years of life saved due to improved life expectancy could be worth another C$38.2 billion. Addressing CVD mortality directly instead would bring about higher healthcare costs, but would generate more value in terms of years of life saved, at C$69.6 billion.Potential savings associated with plausible reductions in CVD, aimed at reaching a World Health Organization target over a 12-year period, are sizeable and may help address challenges associated with an aging population."
https://openalex.org/W2782330803,"The nucleoli accumulate rRNA genes and are the sites of rRNA synthesis and rRNA assembly into ribosomes. During mitosis, nucleoli dissociate, but nucleolar remnants remain on the rRNA gene loci, forming distinct nucleolar organizer regions (NORs). Little is known about the composition and structure of NORs, but upstream binding factor (UBF) has been established as its master organizer. In this study, we sought to establish new proteins in NORs. Using UBF-Sepharose to isolate UBF-binding proteins, we identified histone H1.2 as a candidate partner but were puzzled by this observation, given that UBF is known to be located predominantly in nucleoli, whereas H1.2 distributed broadly among the chromatins in interphase nuclei. We then examined cells undergoing mitosis and saw that both H1.2 and UBF were recruited into NORs in this state, reconciling the results of our UBF pulldowns. Inhibiting rRNA synthesis in interphase nuclei also induced NOR-like structures containing both UBF and H1.2. When chromosomes were isolated and spread on coverslips, NORs appeared separated from the chromosomes containing both UBF and H1.2. After chromosomes were fragmented by homogenization, intact NORs remained visible. Results collectively suggest that NORs are independent structures and that the linker histone H1.2 is a novel component of this structure. The nucleoli accumulate rRNA genes and are the sites of rRNA synthesis and rRNA assembly into ribosomes. During mitosis, nucleoli dissociate, but nucleolar remnants remain on the rRNA gene loci, forming distinct nucleolar organizer regions (NORs). Little is known about the composition and structure of NORs, but upstream binding factor (UBF) has been established as its master organizer.

The tripartite nucleolar structural model aligns well with the known function of nucleoli in ribosome generation. rDNA and elements of the rRNA transcription machinery are located in the innermost FC regions (3Pederson T.

During mitosis when rRNA transcription arrests, nucleoli disintegrate, but nucleolar remnants remain associated with the rDNA loci to form NORs (7McStay B. Nucleolar organizer regions: genomic “dark matter” requiring illumination.Genes Dev. 2016; 30 (27474438): 1598-161010.1101/gad.283838.116Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Savino T.M.

Some elements of the nucleolar FC domains are recruited into NORs, but GC and DFC elements disperse at this stage (23Roussel P. André C. Comai L. Hernandez-Verdun D.

Like the chromatids, NORs also divide equivalently into daughter nuclei and then re-emerge as nucleoli (22Savino T.M. Gébrane-Younès J. De Mey J. Sibarita J.B. Hernandez-Verdun D. Nucleolar assembly of the rRNA processing machinery in living cells.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153 (11381093): 1097-111010.1083/jcb.153.5.1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The rDNA loci reside on acrocentric chromosomes, and NORs form adjacent to these rDNA loci, which, unlike the rest of the chromosomal regions, assume distinctly open configurations (25Ghosh S. Paweletz N. The nucleolar chromatin and the secondary constriction.Cell Biol. Int.

These nucleolar remnants precipitate silver nitrite and are therefore also known as AgNORs (27Goodpasture C. Bloom S.E.

The detailed NOR structure and composition, however, are not understood, and the rDNA loci remain incompletely sequenced (7McStay B. Nucleolar organizer regions: genomic “dark matter” requiring illumination.Genes Dev. 2016; 30 (27474438): 1598-161010.1101/gad.283838.116Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Upstream binding factor (UBF), a Pol I-associated transcription factor, is a nucleolar protein that appears essential to both NOR and nucleolus formation around the rDNA loci. Each active rRNA gene contains a core promoter, which is recognized by selective factor 1, and it also contains an upstream enhancer element that is bound by UBF. These jointly recruit Pol I to initiate rRNA transcription (28Russell J. Zomerdijk J.C. RNA-polymerase-I-directed rDNA transcription, life and works.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30 (15691654): 87-9610.1016/j.tibs.2004.12.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, UBF binds not only to the rDNA enhancer but also broadly to other sites in the rDNA locus (29Roussel P. Andre C. Masson C. Geraud G. Hernandez-Verdun D.

Ectopic introduction of these tandemly engineered Xenopus UBF-binding elements into human HT1080 cells demonstrated recruitment of human UBF and Pol I transcription elements to form pseudo-NORs at mitosis and induce nucleolar FC-like structures at interphase (31Mais C. Wright J.E. Prieto J.L. Raggett S.L. McStay B.

When the ectopic DNA construct was completed with rRNA-coding sequences, these engineered neo-rDNA loci were able to develop into nucleoli in interphase nuclei, producing rRNA and ribosomes (32Grob A. Colleran C. McStay B. Construction of synthetic nucleoli in human cells reveals how a major functional nuclear domain is formed and propagated through cell division.Genes Dev. 2014; 28 (24449107): 220-23010.1101/gad.234591.113Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This demonstrates the instrumental roles of UBF in the structure and functions of NORs and the nucleoli. We argued that by identifying new UBF-binding proteins in the nuclei, novel insights could be obtained into the structure and functions of the nucleoli and NORs. Using UBF-Sepharose, we have identified the linker histone H1.2 as a prominent UBF-binding protein, and it was shown to follow UBF into NORs. These NORs containing UBF and H1.2 were structurally separable from chromosomes. To identify UBF-binding proteins, we first prepared a soluble extract from isolated nuclei. Nuclei rather than nucleoli were used because UBF also binds to selected genes outside the nucleoli and regulates RNA Pol II-mediated gene expression (33Zentner G.E. Saiakhova A. Manaenkov P.

The nuclei were first extracted with Triton X-100 to deplete the nuclear envelope, and these nuclei, known as TxN, mostly remained intact and oval and retained the nuclear protein profile (data not shown; Fig. 1A). Proteins were then test-extracted from TxN at increasing NaCl concentrations (100–500 mm). Protein extraction plateaued at 400–500 mm NaCl (Fig. 1A). The otherwise particulate TxN burst into one colloidal gel at 500 mm NaCl (data not shown), suggestive of dissociation of the nuclear scaffold from the chromatins. The nuclear extracts lacked significant core histones, which ruled out significant chromatin contamination (Fig. 1A). For affinity pulldowns, nuclear extract was routinely extracted from TxN at 500 mm NaCl, known as TxNE. Briefly, nuclei were isolated after centrifugation through 2.2 m sucrose and extracted with Triton X-100 to generate TxN (Fig. 1A). TxNE is obtained by extracting TxN at 500 mm NaCl. The inclusiveness of TxNE as a nuclear extract was surveyed by detecting representative nucleolar and nuclear proteins (Fig. 1, B–K). The nucleolar proteins NPM1 (nucleophosmin-1), nucleolin, UBF and fibrillarin were all detectable from the 300 mm NaCl extract (Fig. 1, B–E). The intimately chromatin-associated proteins HP1γ (heterochromatin protein 1γ), Pol II, lamin A/C, and topoisomerase IIα (TopoIIα) were also extracted (Fig. 1, F–I). In contrast, centromere protein A and the nuclear lamina protein LB1 (lamin B1) were absent (Fig. 1, J and K). Overall, TxNE is highly inclusive of nuclear proteins without significant chromatin contamination. To view changes in nuclear chromatin organization upon NaCl extraction, TxN were first adhered to coverslips and then exposed to 100–500 mm of NaCl. TxN became increasingly swollen at rising NaCl concentrations (data not shown). At 500 mm NaCl, TxN burst into extended and often parallel chromatin fibers (Fig. 1L). The otherwise continuous nuclear lamina, as identified by LB1, fractured and scattered among the chromatin fibers (Fig. 1M). By scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the burst TxN displayed parallel fibers corresponding to chromatins (Fig. 1, N and O). UBF-Sepharose was prepared from recombinant UBF and used in affinity chromatography with TxNE. Proteins were eluted from UBF-Sepharose using 500 mm NaCl, which showed heterogeneity in size (Fig. 2A). By LC-MS/MS (Table S1), a group of four high molecular weight proteins were all identified as nucleolin (Fig. 2A). A 36-kDa band was identified as NPM1. A 28-kDa region was abundant with a H1 histone variant H1.2 (Fig. 2A). Being nucleolar proteins, association of nucleolin and NPM1 to UBF-Sepharose was not surprising. However, H1.2 was not known to bind to UBF or to localize to the nucleoli. H1.2–UBF interaction was further examined using H1.2-Sepharose and, as a control, Tris-Sepharose. After TxNE was applied on Tris-Sepharose, UBF remained abundant in the flowthrough fraction and was not subsequently eluted from the resins (Fig. 2B). With H1.2-Sepharose, UBF was depleted in the flowthrough fraction and subsequently eluted from the resins, suggesting UBF binding to H1.2. HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) is structurally similar to UBF (36Malarkey C.S. Churchill M.E. The high mobility group box: the ultimate utility player of a cell.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37 (23153957): 553-56210.1016/j.tibs.2012.09.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), but it showed no binding to Tris- or H1.2-Sepharose (Fig. 2B). This shows specific H1.2 binding to UBF. Whether H1.2 interacts directly with UBF was evaluated with recombinant H1.2 and UBF proteins. When purified H1.2 was applied on UBF-Sepharose, it was completely depleted in the flowthrough fraction and was subsequently eluted from the resins, showing direct H1.2–UBF interaction (Fig. 2C). Likewise, purified UBF also bound to H1.2-Sepharose (Fig. 2D). This H1.2–UBF interaction was apparently disrupted at 500 mm NaCl, a condition at which bound UBF and H1.2 were eluted from the resins and TxNE was also eluted from the chromatins network (Fig. 1). H1.2 contains three clearly demarcated domains: a central globular domain (GD) of ˜80 amino acid residues, a short N-terminal domain (NTD), and a long C-terminal domain (CTD) of ˜100 residues. We then examined which of the three H1.2 domains bound to UBF. To this end, these H1.2 mutants were generated by deleting its NTD, CTD, or both. As shown in Fig. 2E, after the short NTD was deleted, H1.2 still bound to UBF, but binding to UBF was abolished when CTD was deleted from H1.2. The H1.2 GD alone showed no binding to UBF. These results suggest that H1.2 binds to UBF through its CTD, which is more diversified than GD among the H1 variants (37Izzo A. Schneider R. The role of linker histone H1 modifications in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin dynamics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1859 (26348411): 486-49510.1016/j.bbagrm.2015.09.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is known that H1 binds to nucleosomes through the GD, whereas the H1 CTD binds more permissively to linker DNA, RNA, and potentially protein partners (38Fyodorov D.V. Zhou B.R. Skoultchi A.I. Bai Y. Emerging roles of linker histones in regulating chromatin structure and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatins are abundant in the nucleoplasm but scarce in the nucleoli, and it is counterintuitive that H1.2, being a known chromatin-binding protein, also binds to UBF, which is a nucleolar protein (11Németh A. Längst G. Genome organization in and around the nucleolus.Trends Genet. 2011; 27 (21295884): 149-15610.1016/j.tig.2011.01.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Staining of UBF and H1.2 in HeLa cells indeed revealed broad H1.2 distribution in the nucleoplasm, but UBF was concentrated in the chromatin-poor nucleoli (Fig. 3). UBF detection in the nucleoplasm was sparse overall (Fig. 3). Based on this largely disparate H1.2 and UBF distribution patterns, UBF-H1.2 interaction can only be expected at limited, if any, nucleoplasmic foci. Examining mitotic cells, however, revealed condensation of both H1.2 and UBF in a number of granular NORs (Fig. 3). At sequential stages of mitosis, UBF and H1.2 exhibited distinct kinetics in NOR recruitments. At prometaphase, when all nuclear UBF apparently condensed in nine early NOR granules, only a fraction of H1.2 was found in these mitotic structures. Subsequently at metaphase, however, H1.2 was only detectable in NORs (Fig. 3). During anaphase, NORs appeared to divide equivalently like the chromatids based on the intensity of UBF in the divided NORs (Fig. 3), as previously reported (22Savino T.M. Gébrane-Younès J. De Mey J. Sibarita J.B. Hernandez-Verdun D. Nucleolar assembly of the rRNA processing machinery in living cells.J.

At telophase, the chromatins began to unwind, and UBF also began to reorganize into nucleoli. H1.2 rapidly exited the nucleolar regions and became detectable among the unwinding chromatin network (Fig. 3). Mitotic cells develop NORs that contain different amounts of UBF. H1.2 appears to be recruited into these NORs in proportion with UBF. Because UBF is a housekeeping protein in NORs (31Mais C. Wright J.E. Prieto J.L. Raggett S.L. McStay B. UBF-binding site arrays form pseudo-NORs and sequester the RNA polymerase I transcription machinery.Genes Dev. 2005; 19 (15598984): 50-6410.1101/gad.310705Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 32Grob A. Colleran C. McStay B. Construction of synthetic nucleoli in human cells reveals how a major functional nuclear domain is formed and propagated through cell division.Genes Dev. 2014; 28 (24449107): 220-23010.1101/gad.234591.113Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), H1.2 could be recruited through its interaction with UBF. To gauge whether other nuclear proteins in addition to H1.2 are also recruited into mitotic NORs, mitotic cells were stained with a list of antibodies including those used in the Western blotting experiment shown in Fig. 1A, but none stained the NORs. For example, NPM1 and fibrillarin both localized to interphase nucleoli, but they dispersed from NORs during mitosis instead of being condensed into these structures (Fig. 4; data not shown). The human H1 histone family consists of 11 independently coded variants among which six (H1.1–H1.5 and H1.x) are somatically expressed (Fig. S1) (37Izzo A. Schneider R. The role of linker histone H1 modifications in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin dynamics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1859 (26348411): 486-49510.1016/j.bbagrm.2015.09.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When H1.1, H1.3, H1.4, H1.5, and H1.x were immunostained, none were detected in NORs (Fig. S2), further demonstrating that H1.2 recruitment into NORs is a selective event. Interestingly, H1.x was concentrated in the interphase nucleoli (Fig. S2). This was also observed in a previous study (39Takata H. Matsunaga S. Morimoto A. Ono-Maniwa R. Uchiyama S. Fukui K. H1.X with different properties from other linker histones is required for mitotic progression.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581 (17632103): 3783-378810.1016/j.febslet.2007.06.076Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it dispersed at mitosis like fibrillarin (Fig. 4). H1.0 and H1.4 were also significantly detected outside the nuclei. To examine whether other H1 variants also interact with UBF, recombinant H1.1, H1.3, H1.4, H1.5, and H1.x were similarly generated. In a pulldown study with UBF-Sepharose, these purified H1 variants were incubated for 2 h with UBF-Sepharose resins, which were then washed and eluted at 1 m NaCl. H1.2 was markedly depleted in the supernatant and subsequently eluted from the resin (Fig. 2F). As a control, it was not eluted from Tris-Sepharose. Among the other purified H1 variants, only H1.3 was eluted from the UBF-Sepharose resins (Fig. 2F). H1.1, H1.4, H1.5, and H1.x were not detectable in the elution. H1.3 is more closely related to H1.2 than the other H1 variants (Fig. S1). However, its expression in HeLa cells is too low to draw conclusions (Fig. S2). In interphase cells, NOR-like granules can also be induced when Pol I is inhibited with low concentrations of actinomycin D (ActD) (40Jordan E.G. McGovern J.H. The quantitative relationship of the fibrillar centres and other nucleolar components to changes in growth conditions, serum deprivation and low doses of actinomycin D in cultured diploid human fibroblasts (strain MRC-5).J. Cell Sci. 1981; 52 (7334062): 373-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Yung B.Y. Bor A.M. Chan P.K. Short exposure to actinomycin D induces “reversible” translocation of protein B23 as well as “reversible” inhibition of cell growth and RNA synthesis in HeLa cells.Cancer Res. 1990; 50 (1697505): 5987-5991PubMed Google Scholar). When HeLa cells were treated for 2 h with ActD (40 ng/ml), UBF was shown to condense into NOR-like granules of different sizes (Fig. 5). H1.2 was proportionally recruited into all these structures, mirroring UBF and H1.2 recruitment into mitotic NORs (Fig. 3). It was also noted that only a fraction of total nuclear H1.2 and UBF condensed in the ActD-induced NORs, with the rest of each protein being broadly distributed among nucleoplasmic chromatins (Fig. 5). These two distinct pools of UBF and H1.2 may vary in the extents of their chromatin and other nuclear associations. The nucleolar protein nucleolin was similarly stained in ActD-treated cells. Instead of being condensed into NORs, it dispersed from its original nucleolar locations and distributed broadly in the nuclei (Fig. 5). This shows that H1.2 recruitment to the UBF-demarcated NOR-like structures is selective for a distinct pool of H1.2. In both mitotic and ActD-induced recruitments, the arrest of rRNA transcription appeared to be a shared cause. The detection of two pools of H1.2 in the ActD-treated interphase nuclei raised different interpretations with respect to the NOR-associated H1.2: 1) most chromatin-associated H1.2 was degraded in mitotic cells, and therefore the NOR-associated H1.2 only represented a fraction of total H1.2; and 2) all cellular H1.2 was recruited into NORs. Considering the key roles of H1 histone in general chromatin compaction, neither of these are strong possibilities (42Zhou B.R. Feng H. Kato H. Dai L. Yang Y. Zhou Y. Bai Y. Structural insights into the histone H1-nucleosome complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (24218562): 19390-1939510.1073/pnas.1314905110Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we measured total cellular H1.2 following colcemid-induced enrichment of metaphase cells. In these cultures, most HeLa cells are synchronized to metaphase after 15 h. The cells were treated with colcemid for up to 24 h but harvested at 3-h intervals. Total cellular H1.2 was determined by Western blotting, using UBF, TopoIIα, and LB1 as controls. Total cellular UBF level showed steady increase from 9 h and appeared to plateau by 15 h (Fig. 6A). After 24 h, colcemid was removed from the culture, and within 6 h, total cellular UBF decreased to the basal level, and UBF fragments were noticed (Fig. 6A). The cellular level of TopoIIα, which is a major scaffold protein in chromatin compaction into chromosomes (43Maeshima K. Laemmli U.K. A two-step scaffolding model for mitotic chromosome assembly.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4 (12689587): 467-48010.1016/S1534-5807(03)00092-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), largely mirrored that of UBF (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the total cellular levels of H1.2 and LB1 appeared unchanged throughout the colcemid treatment. This ruled out significant H1.2 degradation during mitosis (Fig. 6A), suggesting that either all cellular H1.2 followed UBF into NORs at mitosis or, as a third possibility, the chromatin-associated H1.2 is shielded from antibody detection in the compact chromosomes. UBF and the rDNA loci are perceived to be the backbones of NORs (31Mais C. Wright J.E. Prieto J.L. Raggett S.L. McStay B. UBF-binding site arrays form pseudo-NORs and sequester the RNA polymerase I transcription machinery.Genes Dev. 2005; 19 (15598984): 50-6410.1101/gad.310705Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 32Grob A. Colleran C. McStay B. Construction of synthetic nucleoli in human cells reveals how a major functional nuclear domain is formed and propagated through cell division.Genes Dev. 2014; 28 (24449107): 220-23010.1101/gad.234591.113Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The extent of NOR structural independence relative to the chromosomes remain unclear. With the colcemid-induced metaphase cells, we examined the physical relationship between NORs and the chromosomes by isolating chromosome assemblies from these cells. Unlike interphase chromatins, the chromosomes are fragile during homogenization. However, many intact chromosome assemblies could be generated with mild homogenization at 18-μm clearance. Some chromosome assemblies spread apart on coverslips, revealing significant gaps among chromosomes and also physical relationships between NORs and the chromosomes (Fig. 6B). NORs remained intact but showed clear separation from the chromosomes, containing both UBF and H1.2 (Fig. 6, C and 6D). They appeared loosely tethered to, rather than being integral parts of, the chromosomes (Fig. 6, E and F). H1.2 remained in complete co-localization with UBF in these NORs (Fig. 6G). An additional observation from these spread chromosomes was the presence of H1.2 inside the chromosomes as well as the NORs (Fig. 6, C and F), in contrast to the lack of H1.2 detection in endogenous chromosomes (Fig. 3). To examine the possibility that endogenous chromosomes compact H1.2 from antibody detection, the cells were treated with DNase after fixation and permeabilization. As shown in Fig. 7, a 30-min DNase treatment of the cells diminished chromatins in the endogenous chromosomes, but NORs remained intact containing both UBF and H1.2. Interestingly, H1.2 also became detectable among the residual chromosomes. Because NORs were still intact and abundant with H1.2, the newly revealed chromosomal H1.2 must have been otherwise compacted by chromatins from antibody detection. We also homogenized the colcemid-enriched metaphase cells under more stringent conditions (10 μm clearance) that fragmented most chromosomes (Fig. 8A). In these homogenates, many particles were stained positive for UBF (Fig. 8B). These particles were also strongly stained for H1.2 (Fig. 8C). Many of these particles lacked major chromatin moieties (Fig. 8, D–F). These particles exhibited size heterogeneity like the endogenous chromosome-embedded NORs, suggesting that NORs are structurally robust and remain intact during homogenization, which has, however, broken down the chromosomes (e.g. Fig. 8, G–I). NORs are well known mitotic structures, but their structures and functions remain inadequately defined. NORs were known to form around rDNA loci during mitosis through UBF. Our data show that they are structurally independent of the chromosome bodies. The linker H1 histones were known as chromatin-binding proteins that facilitate chromatin compaction. Our data show that, among the H1 variants, H1.2 binds to UBF, and during mitosis, it is recruited to NORs like UBF. The results collectively suggest additional functions for NORs in addition to organizing the rDNA loci during mitosis and also show selective H1.2 association with this structure. However, the distribution of H1 variants, UBF, and other nuclear proteins is probably often determined by more than one binding partner."

Adequate stratification of the CV risk is an issue of major importance in patients with HS. To analyze the usefulness of carotid ultrasound (US) assessment for the CV disease risk stratification compared with a traditional score, the Framingham risk score (FRS), in a series of patients with HS.Cross-sectional study of 60 patients with HS without history of CV events, diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Information on CV risk factors was collected and the FRS was calculated. Thus, the patients were classified into low, intermediate and high-CV disease risk categories based on FRS. Carotid US was performed in all participants, and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques was considered as a marker of high CV risk.HS patients had a mean age of 45.1±10.2 years, and 55% were female. The median FRS was 5.7 (IQR: 3.1-14.7). Twenty-four (40%) of the patients were classified into the low risk group, 28 (46.7%) in the intermediate risk group, and 8 (13.3%) into the FRS-high risk category. Noteworthy, carotid US revealed that about one-third of the patients (17/52; 32.6%) in the FRS-based low and intermediate risk categories had carotid plaques, and, therefore, they were reclassified into a high-risk category.CV risk in HS patients may be underestimated by using the FRS. Carotid US may be useful to improve the CV risk stratification of patients with HS."
https://openalex.org/W2782221793,"The kidney is the most frequently transplanted solid organ. Recruitment of inflammatory cells, ranging from diffuse to nodular accumulations with defined microarchitecture, is a hallmark of acute and chronic renal allograft injury. Lymphotoxins (LTs) mediate the communication of lymphocytes and stromal cells and play a pivotal role in chronic inflammation and formation of lymphoid tissue. The aim of this study was to assess the expression of members of the LT system in acute rejection (AR) and chronic renal allograft injury such as transplant glomerulopathy (TG) and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA). We investigated differentially regulated components in transcriptomes of human renal allograft biopsies. By microarray analysis, we found the upregulation of LTβ, LIGHT, HVEM and TNF receptors 1 and 2 in AR and IFTA in human renal allograft biopsies. In addition, there was clear evidence for the activation of the NFκB pathway, most likely a consequence of LTβ receptor stimulation. In human renal allograft biopsies with transplant glomerulopathy (TG) two distinct transcriptional patterns of LT activation were revealed. By quantitative RT-PCR robust upregulation of LTα, LTβ and LIGHT was shown in biopsies with borderline lesions and AR. Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of LTβ in tubular epithelial cells and inflammatory infiltrates in transplant biopsies with AR and IFTA. Finally, activation of LT signaling was reproduced in a murine model of renal transplantation with AR. In summary, our results indicate a potential role of the LT system in acute renal allograft rejection and chronic transplant injury. Activation of the LT system in allograft rejection in rodents indicates a species independent mechanism. The functional role of the LT system in acute renal allograft rejection and chronic injury remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2781765082,"The 3-dimensional structure of the nucleocapsid (NC) of bacteriophage φ6 is described utilizing component tree analysis, a topological and geometric image descriptor. The component trees are derived from density maps of cryo-electron microscopy single particle reconstructions. Analysis determines position and occupancy of structure elements responsible for RNA packaging and transcription. Occupancy of the hexameric nucleotide triphosphorylase (P4) and RNA polymerase (P2) are found to be essentially complete in the NC. The P8 protein lattice likely fixes P4 and P2 in place during maturation. We propose that the viral procapsid (PC) is a dynamic structural intermediate where the P4 and P2 can attach and detach until held in place in mature NCs. During packaging, the PC expands to accommodate the RNA, and P2 translates from its original site near the inner 3-fold axis (20 sites) to the inner 5-fold axis (12 sites) with excess P2 positioned inside the central region of the NC."
https://openalex.org/W2782389502,"We identified 37 ubiquitin ligases containing RING-finger and transmembrane domains. Of these, we found that RNF183 is abundantly expressed in the kidney. RNF183 predominantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and lysosome. We identified Sec16A, which is involved in coat protein complex II vesicle formation, as an RNF183-interacting protein. RNF183 colocalized with Sec16A and interacted through the central conserved domain (CCD) of Sec16A. Although Sec16A is not a substrate for RNF183, RNF183 was more rapidly degraded by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) in the absence of Sec16A. Sec16A also stabilized the interacting ubiquitin ligase RNF152, which localizes to the lysosome and has structural similarity with RNF183. These results suggest that Sec16A appears to regulate the protein stability and localization of lysosomal ubiquitin ligases."
https://openalex.org/W2781535669,"Both musical training and native language have been shown to have experience-based plastic effects on auditory processing. However, the combined effects within individuals are unclear. Recent research suggests that musical training and tone language speaking are not clearly additive in their effects on processing of auditory features and that there may be a disconnect between perceptual and neural signatures of auditory feature processing. The literature has only recently begun to investigate the effects of musical expertise on basic auditory processing for different linguistic groups. This work provides a profile of primary auditory feature discrimination for Mandarin speaking musicians and nonmusicians. The musicians showed enhanced perceptual discrimination for both frequency and duration as well as enhanced duration discrimination in a multifeature discrimination task, compared to nonmusicians. However, there were no differences between the groups in duration processing of nonspeech sounds at a subcortical level or in subcortical frequency representation of a nonnative tone contour, for fo or for the first or second formant region. The results indicate that musical expertise provides a cognitive, but not subcortical, advantage in a population of Mandarin speakers."
