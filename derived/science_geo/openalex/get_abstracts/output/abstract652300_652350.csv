https://openalex.org/W3021105102,"Recent large-scale collaborations are generating major surveys of cell types and connections in the mouse brain, collecting large amounts of data across modalities, spatial scales, and brain areas. Successful integration of these data requires a standard 3D reference atlas. Here, we present the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3) as such a resource. We constructed an average template brain at 10 μm voxel resolution by interpolating high resolution in-plane serial two-photon tomography images with 100 μm z-sampling from 1,675 young adult C57BL/6J mice. Then, using multimodal reference data, we parcellated the entire brain directly in 3D, labeling every voxel with a brain structure spanning 43 isocortical areas and their layers, 329 subcortical gray matter structures, 81 fiber tracts, and 8 ventricular structures. CCFv3 can be used to analyze, visualize, and integrate multimodal and multiscale datasets in 3D and is openly accessible (https://atlas.brain-map.org/)."
https://openalex.org/W3022254624,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the United States, we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated effects of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence of widespread sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the United States and highlights the critical need for local surveillance."

https://openalex.org/W3023736115,"Expansions of amino acid repeats occur in >20 inherited human disorders, and many occur in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of transcription factors (TFs). Such diseases are associated with protein aggregation, but the contribution of aggregates to pathology has been controversial. Here, we report that alanine repeat expansions in the HOXD13 TF, which cause hereditary synpolydactyly in humans, alter its phase separation capacity and its capacity to co-condense with transcriptional co-activators. HOXD13 repeat expansions perturb the composition of HOXD13-containing condensates in vitro and in vivo and alter the transcriptional program in a cell-specific manner in a mouse model of synpolydactyly. Disease-associated repeat expansions in other TFs (HOXA13, RUNX2, and TBP) were similarly found to alter their phase separation. These results suggest that unblending of transcriptional condensates may underlie human pathologies. We present a molecular classification of TF IDRs, which provides a framework to dissect TF function in diseases associated with transcriptional dysregulation."

Archaeological research in the Central Andes is extraordinarily rich (Silverman and Isbell, 2008Silverman H. Isbell W. Handbook of South American Archaeology.

Although these studies had large geographic and temporal gaps, they were critical in showing that individuals from the Central and South-Central Andes up to at least ∼9,000 BP are more closely related to modern Andean highland, rather than coastal or Amazonian populations (Lindo et al., 2018Lindo J.

We assembled genome-wide data from 89 individuals from the Central and South-Central Andes over the past ∼9,000 years, including 65 newly reported individuals, and added data from an ∼1,600 BP individual from the Argentine Pampas region (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1; Table S1). We also report 39 direct radiocarbon dates (Table S1). The dataset includes individuals associated with a wide range of archaeological cultures from the Highlands and Coast of three geographic regions within present-day Peru: a northern zone we call “North Peru” (including sites in the Departments La Libertad and Ancash), a central zone we call “Central Peru” (Department of Lima), and a southern zone we call “South Peru” (including sites in the Departments of Ica, Ayacucho, Arequipa, Apurimac) spanning thousands of years through each of the regions. We also assembled data from Cusco in Peru, the South-Central Andean “Titicaca Basin” Highlands (spanning an ecologically and culturally unique region of southernmost Peru as well as western Bolivia), and “North Chile” (see Figure 1). Here, we use the term “archaeological cultures” as a proxy for the particular material cultures and site contexts from which our ancient individuals are derived, acknowledging that the actual human societies that produced the artifacts representing these material cultures often had substantially different social organizations, and our data are not sufficient to capture the full breadth and internal dynamics of each of them.Figure S1Images of Archaeological Sites, Related to STAR MethodsShow full caption(A) Location of Pukara in the Altiplano of northern Chile and South America (https://satellites.pro/mapa_de_Chile#-17.801972,-69.317661,19).

We determined when the genetic structure observed today in the Central Andes first began to develop and assessed the degree to which gene flows over time have modulated this structure. Further, we investigated how changes in the population structure might correlate to archaeologically documented episodes of cultural, political, and socioeconomic change (summary of findings in Data S1). We acknowledge the Indigenous Peoples of Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina who supported this study as well as the ancient and present-day individuals whose samples we analyzed. The analysis of DNA from ancient individuals can have significant implications for present-day communities both because the studies can reveal how ancient people relate to present-day groups and also because the physical handling of the skeletal materials might be sensitive to the groups involved. Thus, it is important to engage with local communities and with scholars who work closely with these communities to incorporate these perspectives (Bardill et al., 2018Bardill J. Bader A.C. Garrison N.A. Bolnick D.A. Raff J.A. Walker A. Malhi R.S.

Commun. 2018; 9: 2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and to do so in a way appropriate for the particular Indigenous communities and political and social history in each region. This study is the result of an international and inter-institutional collaborative effort that includes scientists from the countries where the ancient individuals originated. In all cases, the interest in genetic investigation of human remains centrally involved local co-authors, in most cases the archaeologists that excavated the sites. In many of these countries, archaeological investigations, as well as the permission to conduct biomolecular research on archaeological skeletal remains, is governed by national regulations. In Peru, for example, this is addressed in Ley General del Patrimonio Cultural de la Nación (Law No. 28296) (see also Herrera, 2011Herrera A. Indigenous Archaeology…in Peru?. Routledge, 2011Google Scholar, Silverman, 2006Silverman H. Cultural Resource Management and Heritage Stewardship in Peru.CRM: Journal of Heritage Stewardship. 2006; 3: 57-72Google Scholar). Our primary approach was thereby by necessity to consult with the provincial and state-based offices of the responsible institutions to obtain permission for analysis. In addition to this, however, we engaged with local communities throughout the study as detailed below. All but one of the sample sets presented here were exported from their country of origin for this analysis and studied with direct permission of the local government. For example, the great majority of the samples newly reported in this study come from Peru, where this study was approved by the Ministry of Culture of Peru, which was originally created to revalue indigenous culture, past and present, to promote interculturality, and to fight against racism. The only exception is the San Sebastian samples (Cusco, Peru) that were part of a US collection and were studied there as part of a repatriation effort with permission of Peruvian institutions and are now curated in Cusco. Some of the samples, especially from coastal Peru, come from looted cemetery contexts, and the genomic data and direct radiocarbon dates generated here help to confirm their assignation to cultural epochs. Thus, this work helps to re-contextualize the individuals and has the potential to provide local communities with new ways to engage the past at disturbed sites. For the individual from Argentina, in addition to obtaining permits from the provincial heritage institutions, the Indigenous community living near the site (Comunidad Indígena Mapuche-Tehuelche Cacique Pincen) approved the study after consultation and participation in the rescue excavation (the skeletal remains will be re-buried). The results of this and prior studies and their implications have been discussed with the community, and they have indicated support for this research in discussion with co-authors of the study. The regulations in Bolivia require archaeologists to consult with local communities before field research and turn in their research field reports to these communities. For the individuals from Chile, we obtained permits from the local heritage institutions, but no local Indigenous community lived near the site or indicated a connection to the analyzed skeletons. Both before and during this study, there was substantial engagement with local communities by co-authors J.R.S., R.F., C.B., and G.P., who have a long-term commitment to specific regions and years of experience collecting data and returning results to the communities. Several of the co-authors presented the outcomes of this study and related archaeological and paleogenetic studies in the form of publicly accessible talks.

Restricting to autosomal data, we performed a qualitative assessment of the population structure using unsupervised ADMIXTURE (Figure S3) and principal-component analysis (PCA) (Figures 2 and S4). We also generated a neighbor-joining tree and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plots of the matrix of “outgroup-f3” statistics of the form f3(Mbuti; Pop1, Pop2), which measure shared genetic drift between population pairs (Figures 3 and S5). Genetic structure strongly correlates with geography since at least ∼2,000 BP, with the first eigenvector in PCA corresponding to a north-to-south cline and the second separating Northwest Amazon groups from Central and South-Central Andean groups (Figure 2). The genetic structure is consistent with patterns expected from isolation-by-distance or gene flow among neighbors, with geographically closer individuals sharing more alleles than people separated by long distances (Figure 3). The oldest individuals (Peru_NorthHighlands_Lauricocha_8600BP and Peru_SouthHighlands_Cuncaicha_9000BP) did not plot in a position corresponding to their location, as expected, because these individuals were not affected by the shared drift and gene flow among geographic neighbors that shaped the population structure of much more recent individuals (Figure S4).Figure 2Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of Ancient Individuals Projected onto Modern Variation from Labeled GroupsShow full captionModern individuals are in gray, and ancient individuals form a gradient that correlates to latitude (coloring is directly based on latitude with blue most north and red most south; numbers are latitude degrees).

We compared the brain basis of color knowledge in congenitally (or early) blind individuals, whose color knowledge can only be obtained through language descriptions and/or cognitive inference, to that of sighted individuals whose color-knowledge benefits from both sensory experience and language. We found that some regions support color knowledge only in the sighted, whereas a region in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe supports object-color knowledge in both the blind and sighted groups, indicating the existence of a sensory-independent knowledge coding system in both groups. Thus, there are (at least) two forms of object knowledge representations in the human brain: sensory-derived and language- and cognition-derived knowledge, supported by different brain systems."

Although the physiological role of VGLL3 remains largely unknown, there is evidence suggesting that VGLL3 is involved in tumor development.

VGLL3 was also overexpressed in gastric cancer patients and was associated with a poor prognosis (6Zhang L.H. Wang Z. Li L.H. Liu Y.K. Jin L.F. Qi X.W. Zhang C. Wang T. Hua D.

YAP/TAZ bind to TEADs in the nucleus and drive expression of target genes that are crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Hippo pathway activation induces phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ through the serine/threonine kinases LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2), promoting cytoplasmic retention and protein degradation of YAP/TAZ (12Hao Y. Chun A. Cheung K. Rashidi B. Yang X. Tumor suppressor LATS1 is a negative regulator of oncogene YAP.J. Biol.

The Hippo pathway is the key negative regulator of TEADs, and dysregulation of this pathway causes tissue overgrowth and tumor development (13Harvey K.F. Zhang X. Thomas D.M.

Given the involvement of VGLL3 in tumor development, it is possible that VGLL3 promotes cell growth by regulating TEADs and YAP/TAZ. However, the relationship between these proteins is not clear. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the interaction between VGLL3, YAP/TAZ, TEADs, and the Hippo pathway. Because VGLL3 is thought to bind to TEADs, we first confirmed association between VGLL3 and TEADs using TEAD4 as a representative member of TEADs. Co-expression and a subsequent immunoprecipitation assay showed that TEAD4 co-immunoprecipitated with VGLL3, supporting the notion that VGLL3 binds to TEADs (Fig. 1A). To examine the pro-proliferative effect of VGLL3, we established cell pools stably expressing VGLL3 in human lung tumor A549 cells and breast tumor MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1B). Stably expressed VGLL3 bound endogenous TEAD4 proteins (Fig. 1C). Stable expression of VGLL3 caused a spindle-like morphological change in A549 cells (Fig. 1D). Notably, VGLL3 expression significantly enhanced cell proliferation with activation of mitogenic extracellular signal–regulated kinases (ERKs) (Fig. 1, E and F). Consistent with previous data (4Hélias-Rodzewicz Z. Pérot G. Chibon F. Ferreira C. Lagarde P. Terrier P. Coindre J.M. Aurias A. YAP1 and VGLL3, encoding two cofactors of TEAD transcription factors, are amplified and overexpressed in a subset of soft tissue sarcomas.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010; 49 (20842732): 1161-117110.1002/gcc.20825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), these results showed that VGLL3 has a pro-proliferative effect in tumor cells probably through activation of ERK signaling. TEADs bind to the GTIIC motif (5′-ACATTCCA-3′) in promoter regions and drive gene expression in association with YAP/TAZ (14Dupont S. Morsut L. Aragona M. Enzo E. Giulitti S. Cordenonsi M.

We examined the effect of VGLL3 on the binding of TEADs to the GTIIC motif using reporter assays. YAP expression stimulated GTIIC-driven reporter activity (EGFP expression), whereas VGLL3 expression repressed, rather than induced, reporter activity (Fig. 2A). We also examined expression of CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), CYR61 (cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61), and ANKRD1 (ankyrin repeat domain 1), well-known targets of TEADs in association with YAP/TAZ (17Li C.

CTGF and ANKRD1 expression was almost completely repressed, and only slight induction of CYR61 expression was observed in VGLL3-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the VGLL3-TEAD complex does not bind to the GTIIC motif and that target genes of this complex are distinct from those of YAP/TAZ-TEAD. To investigate the involvement of YAP/TAZ in VGLL3-dependent cell proliferation, we examined activation of the Hippo pathway and subcellular localization of YAP/TAZ in VGLL3-expressing A549 cells. Notably, immunofluorescence revealed that YAP/TAZ levels were significantly reduced in these cells, and residual staining was detected in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus (Fig. 3A). Western blotting showed that TAZ is the main component of YAP/TAZ proteins in A549 cells. In VGLL3-expressing A549 cells, the band of TAZ was weakened and showed increased molecular weight, likely caused by phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). LATS2, the key kinase in the Hippo pathway, showed elevated expression and phosphorylation levels following VGLL3 expression (Fig. 3, B and C). Expression of the angiomotin (AMOT) family, which inhibits nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ (20Zhao B. Li L. Lu Q. Wang L.H. Liu C.Y. Lei Q. Guan K.L. Angiomotin is a novel Hippo pathway component that inhibits YAP oncoprotein.Genes Dev. 2011; 25 (21205866): 51-6310.1101/gad.2000111Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), was also examined. Among this family, AMOTL2 expression was elevated in VGLL3-expressing cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Meanwhile, AMOTL1 expression was reduced, and AMOT expression was not detectable (data not shown). Similar phenomena were observed in VGLL3-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3, D and E). These results suggest that VGLL3 inactivates YAP/TAZ via LATS2- and AMOTL2-mediated activation of the Hippo pathway. To investigate the involvement of the Hippo pathway in down-regulating YAP/TAZ in VGLL3-expressing cells, several knockdown experiments were performed. LATS1 plus LATS2 double knockdown recovered the reduction in TAZ levels, and LATS2 single knockdown increased the lower band of TAZ (unphosphorylated TAZ proteins) (Fig. 4, A and B). AMOTL2 knockdown also recovered TAZ reduction (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that elevated expression of LATS2 and AMOTL2 down-regulates TAZ in VGLL3-expressing cells. To determine the TEAD members that are crucial for induction of LATS2 and AMOTL2, each TEAD was knocked down. Knockdown of TEAD1 or TEAD3 reduced expression of LATS2 and AMOTL2 and recovered TAZ reduction in VGLL3-expressing cells (Fig. 4, E and F). These results suggest that VGLL3 induces LATS2 and AMOTL2 expression via TEAD1 and TEAD3, thereby activating the Hippo pathway. Because the VGLL family was suggested to be involved in breast cancer development (21Zhang Y. Shen H. Withers H.G. Yang N. Denson K.E. Mussell A.L. Truskinovsky A. Fan Q. Gelman I.H. Frangou C. Zhang J. VGLL4 selectively represses YAP-dependent gene induction and tumorigenic phenotypes in breast cancer.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28733631): 619010.1038/s41598-017-06227-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we examined VGLL3 expression in human breast cancer MCF7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells. VGLL3 was highly expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, a malignant type of breast cancer cells. High expression of VGLL3 was also observed in human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells (Fig. 5A). To analyze the role of endogenous VGLL3 in activation of YAP/TAZ and the Hippo pathway, we depleted VGLL3 and analyzed the subcellular localization of YAP/TAZ in MDA-MB-231 and Saos-2 cells. VGLL3 depletion significantly increased the nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ (Fig. 5, B and C). VGLL3 depletion also caused a reduction in LATS2 expression and phosphorylation (Fig. 5, D and E). VGLL3 depletion repressed AMOTL2 mRNA expression but not its protein levels. Notably, knockdown of LATS2 or AMOTL2, as well as knockdown of VGLL3, significantly repressed proliferation in these cells. AMOTL2 depletion did not repress proliferation in Saos-2 cells. These results suggest that VGLL3-dependent induction of LATS2 is critically involved in tumor cell proliferation at the endogenous level (Fig. 5, F and G). The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of tissue and cell growth. Involvement of the Hippo pathway in human tumors was initially recognized by the robust overgrowth of Drosophila melanogaster tissues that had loss-of-function mutations in components of this pathway. Subsequent studies revealed that Hippo pathway dysregulation promotes tumorigenesis in mammals and that several genes of this pathway have mutations and altered expression in human tumors. These observations established that the Hippo pathway is a tumor-suppressing signaling pathway (Fig. 6A) (7Lin K.C. Park H.W. Guan K.L.

In this study, we found that stable expression of VGLL3 promotes cell proliferation. We detected association between VGLL3 and TEAD4, supporting the notion that VGLL3 is a cofactor for TEADs. Because Hippo pathway activation represses TEAD activity, the cell growth–promoting effect of VGLL3 led us to speculate that VGLL3 inhibits the Hippo pathway and in turn induces nuclear translocation and activation of YAP/TAZ. However, contrary to this speculation, components of the Hippo pathway, LATS2 and AMOTL2, were increased, and YAP/TAZ were inactivated in VGLL3-expressing cells. VGLL3 was highly expressed in the malignant breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-231, and its knockdown caused a reduction in LATS2 and AMOTL2 expression and induction of YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. Notably, knockdown of LATS2 or AMOTL2, as well as knockdown of VGLL3, repressed proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that VGLL3-dependent up-regulation of Hippo pathway components and the following down-regulation of YAP/TAZ are required for VGLL3-dependent cell growth. Previous studies showed that VGLL1 and VGLL4 have binding sites on TEADs that overlap with YAP/TAZ-binding sites and thus compete with YAP/TAZ for TEAD binding (10Pobbati A.V. Han X. Hung A.W.

Therefore, VGLL3 is likely to inactivate YAP/TAZ through the Hippo pathway to enhance binding of itself to TEADs to facilitate gene expression for proliferation. In this context, it can be concluded that the Hippo pathway has the potential to act as a tumor-promoting signaling pathway via VGLL3 activation (Fig. 6B). Although VGLL3 was found to have a cell growth–promoting effect, probably through activation of mitogenic ERK signaling, target genes underlying this effect have not been identified. Whereas CTGF is a well-known YAP/TAZ-dependent TEAD target involved in cell proliferation (19Zhao B. Ye X. Yu J. Li L. Li W. Li S. Yu J. Lin J.D. Wang C.Y. Chinnaiyan A.M. Lai Z.C. Guan K.L. TEAD mediates YAP-dependent gene induction and growth control.Genes Dev. 2008; 22 (18579750): 1962-197110.1101/gad.1664408Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar), CTGF expression was almost completely repressed in VGLL3-expressing cells. Reporter assays showed that VGLL3 did not activate GTIIC TEAD-binding site–dependent gene expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that the DNA-binding site and target genes of the VGLL3-TEAD complex are different from those of the YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex. Given that VGLL1 was shown to facilitate anchorage-independent cell growth via expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) (10Pobbati A.V. Han X. Hung A.W. Weiguang S. Huda N. Chen G.Y. Kang C. Chia C.S. Luo X. Hong W. Poulsen A. Targeting the central pocket in human transcription factor TEAD as a potential cancer therapeutic strategy.Structure. 2015; 23 (26592798): 2076-208610.1016/j.str.2015.09.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a cell proliferation-related gene, we analyzed IGFBP5 expression in VGLL3-expressing cells. However, we could not detect IGFBP5 expression in these cells, suggesting that IGFBP5 is not a target of the VGLL3-TEAD complex (data not shown). To determine the genes responsible for VGLL3-induced cell proliferation, analysis of gene expression profiles of a VGLL3-expressing cell is required. In contrast to our findings, VGLL3 was hypothesized to have a tumor-suppressive role in ovarian tumor (23Cody N.A. Ouellet V. Manderson E.N. Quinn M.C. Filali-Mouhim A. Tellis P. Zietarska M. Provencher D.M. Mes-Masson A.M. Chevrette M. Tonin P.N.

This hypothesis was derived from the chromosome transfer experiment: transfer of a chromosome fragment containing the VGLL3 gene suppressed tumor phenotypes in the ovarian tumor cell line OV90. Although transfer of this fragment recovered VGLL3 expression (24Cody N.A. Shen Z. Ripeau J.S. Provencher D.M. Mes-Masson A.M. Chevrette M. Tonin P.N.

Oncol. 2013; 7 (23415753): 513-53010.1016/j.molonc.2012.12.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that the hypothesis of a tumor-suppressive role of VGLL3 may be still disputable. In conclusion, we found that VGLL3 promotes cell growth through activation of the Hippo pathway and subsequent inactivation of YAP/TAZ. Our findings suggest that the Hippo pathway can function as a tumor-promoting signaling pathway via VGLL3 activation. In VGLL3-expressing tumors, such as sarcomas and malignant breast tumors, the Hippo pathway may be a therapeutic target to inhibit VGLL3 activation. cDNA fragments encoding VGLL3, YAP, or TEAD4 were generated by PCR from the reverse-transcribed product of A549 total RNA and subcloned into pIRESpuro3-CAG vector (26Yamaguchi N.

https://openalex.org/W3021005991,"The risk of complications of nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism in Asia is unclear. We estimated the prevalence and risk of complications in patients with nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism.We performed a retrospective cohort study using a nationwide claims database from 2005 to 2016. Among the entire Korean population, we identified 897 patients diagnosed with nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism during 2005-2015. We selected 210 patients with nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism during 2005-2008 who had no complications at baseline and followed them to 2016. Control subjects (n = 2075) were matched using propensity scores based on age, sex, and comorbid disease with a 1:10 ratio and monitored until 2016.The age-standardized prevalence of nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism was 0.2 cases per 100,000 persons in 2005. During a mean follow-up period of 9.5 years, patients with nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism had a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, especially arrhythmia (hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-3.70) and heart failure (HR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.22-4.83). The risk of vertebral fracture was higher in patients than in controls (HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.09-4.72). Patients had a significantly increased risk of renal disease (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.56-4.21), seizure (HR, 5.74; 95% CI, 3.34-9.86), depression and bipolar disease (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.30-2.56), and cataract (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.30-2.79) compared with controls.The prevalence of nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism was very low in Korea but was associated with a higher risk of incident cardiovascular disease and vertebral fracture as well as known complications including renal disease, seizure, and cataract."
https://openalex.org/W3022706678,"Purpose We sought to determine whether the association between physical activity and 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk varies among normal weight, overweight, and obese adults in a nationally-representative sample of the United States. Methods Data were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2016. A subset of 22,476 participants aged 30–64 years was included with no CVD history. Physical activity level was self-reported and stratified into sedentary (0 min/week), inactive (1–149 mins/week), or active (≥150 mins/week) of moderate or vigorous activities. Framingham risk scores were classified as low/intermediate (<20%) or high 10-year CVD risk (≥20%). Results The average age of the population was 45.9 years, 52.3% were female, 33.6% were overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9kg/m2), and 35.7% were obese (BMI≥30kg/m2). Individuals who were overweight and obese had a higher 10-year CVD risk compared to those with normal weight (9.5 vs. 10.1 vs. 6.3%, P<0.001). The association of physical activity and high 10-year CVD risk differed by weight status. Among overweight and obese adults, individuals engaged in any physical activity had lower odds ofhigh 10-year CVD risk compared to sedentary individuals (overweight: OR active = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.36–0.64; OR inactive = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.45–0.86; obese: OR active = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.37–0.68; OR inactive = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49–0.89). Among normal weight adults, individuals who were physically active had lower odds of high 10-year CVD risk (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.28–0.87). When compared the joint effects of physical activity level and weight status, physical activity was associated with a larger magnitude of reduced odds of 10-year CVD risk than weight status. Conclusion Participation in any level of physical activity is associated with a lower 10-year CVD risk for overweight and obese adults. Future studies are needed to identify effective modes and doses of exercise that offer optimal CVD benefits for populations with different weight statuses."
https://openalex.org/W3021366251,"Cancer origin determination combined with site-specific treatment of metastatic cancer patients is critical to improve patient outcomes. Existing pathology and gene expression-based techniques often have limited performance. In this study, we developed a deep neural network (DNN)-based classifier for cancer origin prediction using DNA methylation data of 7,339 patients of 18 different cancer origins from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This DNN model was evaluated using four strategies: (1) when evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation, it achieved an overall specificity of 99.72% (95% CI 99.69%-99.75%) and sensitivity of 92.59% (95% CI 91.87%-93.30%); (2) when tested on hold-out testing data of 1,468 patients, the model had an overall specificity of 99.83% and sensitivity of 95.95%; (3) when tested on 143 metastasized cancer patients (12 cancer origins), the model achieved an overall specificity of 99.47% and sensitivity of 95.95%; and (4) when tested on an independent dataset of 581 samples (10 cancer origins), the model achieved overall specificity of 99.91% and sensitivity of 93.43%. Compared to existing pathology and gene expression-based techniques, the DNA methylation-based DNN classifier showed higher performance and had the unique advantage of easy implementation in clinical settings. In summary, our study shows that DNA methylation-based DNN models has potential in both diagnosis of cancer of unknown primary and identification of cancer cell types of circulating tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W3021400983,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been implicated in the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease (PD); however, it is unclear how mitochondrial impairment and α-synuclein pathology are coupled. Using specific mitochondrial inhibitors, EM analysis, and biochemical assays, we report here that intramitochondrial protein homeostasis plays a major role in α-synuclein aggregation. We found that interference with intramitochondrial proteases, such as HtrA2 and Lon protease, and mitochondrial protein import significantly aggravates α-synuclein seeding. In contrast, direct inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, or formation of reactive oxygen species, all of which have been associated with mitochondrial stress, did not affect α-synuclein pathology. We further demonstrate that similar mechanisms are involved in amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ42) aggregation. Our results suggest that, in addition to other protein quality control pathways, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, mitochondria per se can influence protein homeostasis of cytosolic aggregation-prone proteins. We propose that approaches that seek to maintain mitochondrial fitness, rather than target downstream mitochondrial dysfunction, may aid in the search for therapeutic strategies to manage PD and related neuropathologies."
https://openalex.org/W3023947572,"To determine the performance of 3 circulating markers for the diagnosis and the progression of interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Serum concentrations of 3 circulating markers, lung epithelial-derived surfactant protein D (SPD), chemokine CCL-18 and Krebs von den Lungen-6 glycoprotein (KL-6), were measured by ELISA in consecutive patients with established RA. These patients were recruited from 3 tertiary centers and they all had been investigated by chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). For a subset of French patients, a follow-up HRCT was available (mean interval between HRCT: 3±1.5 years).Among the 147 included patients (age: 66 ± 12 years, 69% women, disease duration 11 ± 10 years), 40 (27%) had RA-ILD on chest HRCT. SPD, CCL18 and KL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with RA-ILD. ROC curve analysis to assess the diagnostic abilities of the three markers for the diagnosis of RA-ILD showed a superiority of KL-6 (Area under the curve, AUC: 0.79 95% CI 0.72-0.86) compared to SPD (AUC: 0.66 95% CI 0.58-0.74) and CCL18 (AUC: 0.62, 95% CI 0.53-0.70). The sensitivity of KL-6 for the diagnosis of RA-ILD was 68% with a specificity of 83%. The combination of KL-6 with SPD and CCL18 improved its diagnostic ability, with increased sensitivity from 68% to 77%, specificity from 83% to 97%. Increased KL-6 levels were independently associated with the presence of RA-ILD after the adjustment on other RA-ILD risk factors. In the French subset with longitudinal data, baseline KL-6 serum levels were predictive of ILD progression and the degree of ILD progression on HRCT was proportional to baseline KL-6 concentrations.These results show that KL-6 is a relevant circulating marker for the diagnosis and might be an interesting marker for the progression of RA-ILD."

https://openalex.org/W3022970486,"Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is an mRNA-binding protein that has an oncofetal pattern of expression. It is also expressed in intestinal tissue, suggesting that it has a possible role in intestinal homeostasis. To investigate this possibility, here we generated Villin CreERT2:Igf2bp1flox/flox mice, which enabled induction of an IGF2BP1 knockout specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) of adult mice. Using gut barrier and epithelial permeability assays and several biochemical approaches, we found that IGF2BP1 ablation in the adult intestinal epithelium causes mild active colitis and mild-to-moderate active enteritis. Moreover, the IGF2BP1 deletion aggravated dextran sodium sulfate–induced colitis. We also found that IGF2BP1 removal compromises barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, resulting from altered protein expression at tight junctions. Mechanistically, IGF2BP1 interacted with the mRNA of the tight-junction protein occludin (Ocln), stabilizing Ocln mRNA and inducing expression of occludin in IECs. Furthermore, ectopic occludin expression in IGF2BP1-knockdown cells restored barrier function. We conclude that IGF2BP1-dependent regulation of occludin expression is an important mechanism in intestinal barrier function maintenance and in the prevention of colitis."
https://openalex.org/W3023457427,"Early infection from enteropathogens is recognised as both a cause and effect of infant malnutrition. Specifically, evidence demonstrates associations between growth shortfalls and Campylobacter infection, endemic across low-income settings, with poultry a major source. Whilst improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) should reduce pathogen transmission, interventions show inconsistent effects on infant health. This cross-sectional, formative study aimed to understand relationships between infant Campylobacter prevalence, malnutrition and associated risk factors, including domestic animal husbandry practices, in rural Ethiopia. Thirty-five households were visited in Sidama zone, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' region. Infant and poultry faeces and domestic floor surfaces (total = 102) were analysed for presumptive Campylobacter spp. using selective culture. Infant anthropometry and diarrhoeal prevalence, WASH facilities and animal husbandry data were collected. Of the infants, 14.3% were wasted, 31.4% stunted and 31.4% had recent diarrhoea. Presumptive Campylobacter spp. was isolated from 48.6% of infant, 68.6% of poultry and 65.6% of floor surface samples. Compared to non-wasted infants, wasted infants had an increased odds ratio (OR) of 1.41 for a Campylobacter-positive stool and 1.81 for diarrhoea. Positive infant stools showed a significant relationship with wasting (p = 0.026) but not stunting. Significant risk factors for a positive stool included keeping animals inside (p = 0.027, OR 3.5), owning cattle (p = 0.018, OR 6.5) and positive poultry faeces (p<0.001, OR 1.34). Positive floor samples showed a significant correlation with positive infant (p = 0.023), and positive poultry (p = 0.013, OR 2.68) stools. Ownership of improved WASH facilities was not correlated with lower odds of positive stools. This formative study shows a high prevalence of infants positive for Campylobacter in households with free-range animals. Findings reaffirm contaminated floors as an important pathway to infant pathogen ingestion and suggest that simply upgrading household WASH facilities will not reduce infection without addressing the burden of contamination from animals, alongside adequate separation in the home."

Here, we found that Ninjurin1 (Ninj1) limits colon inflammation by regulating macrophage polarization and microbiota composition under homeostatic conditions and during colitis development. Ninj1 deletion in mice induced hypersusceptibility to colitis, with increased prevalence of colitogenic Prevotellaceae strains and decreased immunoregulatory Lachnospiraceae strains. Upon co-housing (CoH) with WT mice, Ninj1−/− mice showed increased Lachnospiraceae and decreased Prevotellaceae abundance, with subsequent improvement of colitis. Under homeostatic conditions, M1 macrophage frequency was higher in the Ninj1−/− mouse colons than wild-type (WT) mouse colons, which may contribute to increased basal colonic inflammation and microbial imbalance. Following colitis induction, Ninj1 expression was increased in macrophages; meanwhile Ninj1−/− mice showed severe colitis development and impaired recovery, associated with decreased M2 macrophages and escalated microbial imbalance. In vitro, Ninj1 knockdown in mouse and human macrophages activated M1 polarization and restricted M2 polarization. Finally, the transfer of WT macrophages ameliorated severe colitis in Ninj1−/− mice. These findings suggest that Ninj1 mediates colonic homeostasis by modulating M1/M2 macrophage balance and preventing extensive dysbiosis, with implications for IBD prevention and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3022740829,"Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that can change shape and size depending on the needs of the cell through the processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion. In this work, we investigated the role of mitochondrial dynamics in organismal stress response. By using C. elegans as a genetic model, we could visualize mitochondrial morphology in a live organism with well-established stress assays and well-characterized stress response pathways. We found that disrupting mitochondrial fission (DRP1/drp-1) or fusion (OPA1/eat-3, MFN/fzo-1) genes caused alterations in mitochondrial morphology that impacted both mitochondrial function and physiologic rates. While both mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial fusion mutants showed increased sensitivity to osmotic stress and anoxia, surprisingly we found that the mitochondrial fusion mutants eat-3 and fzo-1 are more resistant to both heat stress and oxidative stress. In exploring the mechanism of increased stress resistance, we found that disruption of mitochondrial fusion genes resulted in the upregulation of multiple stress response pathways. Overall, this work demonstrates that disrupting mitochondrial dynamics can have opposite effects on resistance to different types of stress. Our results suggest that disruption of mitochondrial fusion activates multiple stress response pathways that enhance resistance to specific stresses."

The aim of this study was to compare the density, percentage cover, thickness of clumps, condition index and size-frequency distribution of Mytilus galloprovincialis between urban and non-urban shores, at nested spatial scales, in the Northern Portuguese coast. M. galloprovincialis was selected as model because it is economically and ecologically relevant. Moreover, the relationship between mussel size and the other variables (i.e. density, percentage cover, thickness and condition index) were investigated. Mussels on urban shores showed a smaller density and a greater frequency of larger individuals. A significant negative correlation between mussel length with density and with thickness of clumps was also found. Our results seem to indicate that recruitment has declined on urban shores and, as a result, intraspecific competition is also smaller, leading to more resources being available for a fewer individuals which can reach larger sizes. As mussel beds support a great biodiversity of invertebrates and provide many ecosystem services, urbanisation may have indirect effects on communities associated with mussels. Understanding the vulnerability of mussel beds to urbanisation could inform management."
https://openalex.org/W3023341382,"Climate change is shifting both the habitat suitability and the timing of critical biological events, such as flowering and fruiting, for plant species across the globe. Here, we ask how both the distribution and phenology of three food-producing shrubs native to northwestern North America might shift as the climate changes. To address this question, we compared gridded climate data with species location data to identify climate variables that best predicted the current bioclimatic niches of beaked hazelnut (Corylus cornuta), Oregon grape (Mahonia aquifolium), and salal (Gaultheria shallon). We also developed thermal-sum models for the timing of flowering and fruit ripening for these species. We then used multi-model ensemble future climate projections to estimate how species range and phenology may change under future conditions. Modelling efforts showed extreme minimum temperature, climate moisture deficit, and mean summer precipitation were predictive of climatic suitability across all three species. Future bioclimatic niche models project substantial reductions in habitat suitability across the lower elevation and southern portions of the species’ current ranges by the end of the 21st century. Thermal-sum phenology models for these species indicate that flowering and the ripening of fruits and nuts will advance an average of 25 days by the mid-21st century, and 36 days by the late-21st century under a high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5). Future changes in the climatic niche and phenology of these important food-producing species may alter trophic relationships, with cascading impacts on regional ecosystems."

This process involves high rates of membrane expansion, during which the synthesis of membrane lipids must be tightly regulated. In this work, using a variety of molecular and biochemical assays and approaches, including immunofluorescence microscopy and FRET analyses, we demonstrate that the proto-oncogene c-Fos (c-Fos) activates cytoplasmic lipid synthesis in the central nervous system and thereby supports neuronal differentiation. Specifically, in hippocampal primary cultures, blocking c-Fos expression or its activity impairs neuronal differentiation. When examining its subcellular localization, we found that c-Fos co-localizes with endoplasmic reticulum markers and strongly interacts with lipid-synthesizing enzymes, whose activities were markedly increased in vitro in the presence of recombinant c-Fos. Of note, the expression of c-Fos dominant-negative variants capable of blocking its lipid synthesis–activating activity impaired neuronal differentiation. Moreover, using an in utero electroporation model, we observed that neurons with blocked c-Fos expression or lacking its AP-1–independent activity fail to initiate cortical development.

In fact, membrane expansion can reach an increment of up to 20% according to the different steps of neuronal differentiation (13Pfenninger K.H.

Considering their architecture and size, it is reasonable to hypothesize that neurons will need temporal and domain-specific mechanisms to regulate the synthesis of the components required according to their local demands. In line with this hypothesis, Tsukita and Ishikawa (15Tsukita S. Ishikawa H. Three-dimensional distribution of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in myelinated axons.J. Electron Microsc.

Several reports later convincingly demonstrated a synthetic machinery present in axons, with the capacity to regulate the levels of proteins, lipids, and other macromolecules (16Gonzalez C. Couve A.

Consequently, the mechanisms by which neurons supply components for membrane biogenesis, such as lipids in growing axons, have been the subject of several studies.

Using PC12 cells, we distinguished between the two known functions of c-Fos (i.e. its AP-1 activity and its capacity to activate lipid synthesis). Initially, when cells are stimulated with nerve growth factor to differentiate into a sympathetic neuron phenotype, c-Fos is required in the nucleus to trigger the genomic program of differentiation. However, once the cells have been primed to differentiate, c-Fos is only required at the cytoplasm, associated to the ER, activating phospholipid synthesis, for cells to continue differentiating (32Gil G.A. Bussolino D.F. Portal M.M. Alfonso Pecchio A. Renner M.L. Borioli G.A. Guido M.E. Caputto B.L. c-Fos activated phospholipid synthesis is required for neurite elongation in differentiating PC12 cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15 (14767061): 1881-189410.1091/mbc.e03-09-0705Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Herein, using hippocampal neurons, we have shown that c-Fos is capable of exerting its lipid synthesis activator capacity in the nervous system and that this AP-1–independent activity is crucial for normal neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, by in utero electroporation, we demonstrate that this role is involved in cortical development. In this direction, c-Fos could be an active player in different events required for neuronal plasticity, such as those involved in learning and memory formation. The presence of c-Fos in the brain, and more specifically in the hippocampus, was demonstrated almost 30 years ago by Dragunow et al. (33Dragunow M. Peterson M.R. Robertson H.A. Presence of c-fos-like immunoreactivity in the adult rat brain.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 135 (3106073): 113-11410.1016/0014-2999(87)90767-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34Dragunow M. Robertson H.A. Generalized seizures induce c-fos protein(s) in mammalian neurons.Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 82 (2447534): 157-16110.1016/0304-3940(87)90121-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We initially evaluated c-Fos expression over time in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. At all times examined, c-Fos was expressed at similar levels even after 96 h in culture, as determined by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting (Fig. 1). It is important to highlight that c-Fos expression is observed not only in the nucleus but also extending to the entire cytoplasm of the neurons. We then evaluated whether c-Fos participates in the differentiation of rat hippocampal neurons. The method applied to determine the differentiation stage of the cultured cells was the one described by Dotti et al. (7Dotti C.G. Sullivan C.A. Banker G.A. The establishment of polarity by hippocampal neurons in culture.J. Neurosci. 1988; 8 (3282038): 1454-146810.1523/JNEUROSCI.08-04-01454.1988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in stage 1 of differentiation, shortly after they attach to the substrate, show motile lamellipodia developed around the periphery of the cell. At stage 2, these lamellipodia begin to transform into distinct minor processes that extend to a length of up to 10-15 µm. At stage 3, one of these minor processes begins to grow 5–10 times faster than the rest of them, indicating that the axon of the cell has been formed and the cell has polarized. At stage 4, a significant development of dendrites initiates, and finally, at differentiation stage 5, the axonal and dendritic arbors undergo a maturation process. To evaluate the effect of blocking c-Fos activity during this complex process, primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were profected at 2 h of culture with anti-c-Fos antibodies or with a nonrelated antibody as a control using the BioPORTER system. Cells were examined 48 h later by immunocytochemistry but only using secondary antibodies in the case of the anti-c-Fos–profected cells. As can be seen in the graphs of Fig. 2A, blocking c-Fos activity impairs axon formation. We quantified different morphological features of the neurons, observing that there were no changes in soma size or in the mean number of neurites per cell when comparing cells lacking c-Fos activity and the control ones. It should be noted that we were not able to observe the development of axonal-like processes even after 48 h of culture when c-Fos activity was impaired, a phenomenon not observed in the control cells (Fig. 2A). These results were confirmed by blocking c-Fos expression. When neurons were infected 2 h after seeding with lentiviral vectors designed to express a specific shRNA against c-Fos, impaired differentiation was clearly observed (Fig. 2B). When neurons were classified into the differentiation stages according to their morphology, more than 85% of the c-Fos-knocked-down neurons remained at stages 1 and 2 of differentiation as compared with the almost 50% of neurons in stages 3 and 4 of the control cultures (Fig. 2C). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that upon a subcellular fractionation of PC12 cell homogenates, c-Fos and the ER membranes are predominantly collected in the same fraction (35Silvestre D.C. Maccioni H.J. Caputto B.L. Content of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex membranes positively correlates with the proliferative status of brain cells.J. Neurosci. Res. 2009; 87 (18951474): 857-86510.1002/jnr.21915Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This led us to examine whether the c-Fos/ER co-localization observed previously can be evidenced in neurons of the central nervous system as well. To test this, we performed immunocytochemistry assays on primary rat hippocampal neurons after 48 h of culture, and, as expected, a strong co-localization of c-Fos with the ER marker calnexin was detected (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, c-Fos and the ER were found not only in the perinuclear region of the soma; defined co-localization dots at punctuate structures confined to axonal branching points were also very frequently observed. Previous results from our group have demonstrated that c-Fos physically interacts with and activates particular enzymes of the lipid synthesis pathways. Such is the case for CDP-diacylglycerol synthase (CDS), PI4KIIα (phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase II-α), and Lipin1 (29Alfonso Pecchio A.R. Cardozo Gizzi A.M. Renner M.L. Molina-Calavita M.

Taking this into consideration, it was hypothesized that c-Fos could be involved in neuronal differentiation by a lipid-activating mechanism that requires its physical interaction with specific enzymes. To this end, we examined the possible interaction of c-Fos with CDS, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid into CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), the first step of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate synthesis in the ER. To infer protein-protein interactions, FRET experiments were performed (36Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Quantitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements using fluorescence microscopy.Biophys.

For this, rat primary hippocampal neurons were co-transfected to express c-Fos-mTurquoise2 and CDS-SYFP2 and examined by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), a positive FRET phenomenon is observed between both proteins, indicating that there is indeed a physical interaction between them. To study whether this physical interaction leads to enzyme activation, CDS activity was assayed using cell homogenates obtained from rat hippocampal neurons as the enzyme source and [3H]CTP and dioleoyl-phosphatidic acid as substrates, with or without the addition of recombinant c-Fos to the incubates (29Alfonso Pecchio A.R.

At the times assayed, about 40% more CDP-DAG was synthetized in the +c-Fos incubates as compared with the control (Fig. 4C). This confirms that the lipid synthesis activation mediated by c-Fos observed previously also occurs in hippocampal neurons in culture. The association of c-Fos with CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), the rate-limiting enzyme in phosphatidylcholine synthesis (Fig. S1), suggests that c-Fos could be also mediating the activation of other phospholipid pathways. The results shown so far support the need of c-Fos to normally complete the differentiation events. However, they do not allow us to discern whether the effect is due to the AP-1 or the lipid synthesis activator function of c-Fos. To activate lipid synthesis, c-Fos associates through its N-terminal domain (NA domain, amino acids 1-138 of full-length c-Fos) with the enzymes it activates (29Alfonso Pecchio A.R.

However, this portion of the protein is not sufficient to produce lipid synthesis activation because of the absence of the basic domain (BD, amino acids 139-159), a domain required for enzyme activation to occur. As the NA domain is not involved in c-Fos AP-1 functions, it seems reasonable to propose its use as a dominant negative of its lipid synthesis activator function. In other words, the NA should interfere only with the lipid-synthesizing function of c-Fos and not with its AP-1, transcriptional one. Furthermore, we have previously shown that recombinant NA is not able to activate total phospholipid synthesis and inhibits CDS activity (30Gil G.A. Silvestre D.C. Tomasini N. Bussolino D.F.

Taking this into consideration, we examined whether the impairment in neuronal differentiation could be linked to the lack of c-Fos–dependent lipid synthesis activity. Hippocampal neuronal cells were transfected with a construct that contains the NA domain, which does not activate lipid synthesis, or with the construct NB, which contains amino acids 1–159 (NB domain), which is capable of activating lipid synthesis at levels comparable with those of full-length c-Fos, both fused with YFP. The empty vector was used as a control. Then the differentiation stages of the transfected cells at different fixation times were analyzed. It can be seen in Fig. 5A and its quantification in Fig. 5B (cells fixed at 48 h) that the expression of the NA domain impairs neuronal differentiation as evidenced after a morphological analysis and stage quantification of the NA-transfected cells relative to the NB-transfected or nontransfected ones. Even more, it is clear that the impairment in differentiation promoted by the NA domain is comparable with that observed when c-Fos expression is blocked (Fig. 2, B and C). To test whether this effect was due to the lipid synthesis activator capacity of c-Fos, we performed biochemical assays to assess total phospholipid labeling in homogenates obtained from hippocampal neurons primary cultures. Previous reports have shown that the γ-phosphate group of labeled [32P]ATP can be incorporated into different lipids of cell lysates assayed in vitro, mainly phosphatidylinositol and its derivatives and phosphatidic acid (39Galliard T.

When assaying this in neurons, it is clear that the addition of recombinant c-Fos to the assay promotes a significant increase in total phospholipid labeling, whereas recombinant NA does not (Fig. 5C). However, if both c-Fos and NA are added together, the activating effect of c-Fos is abolished. These results are compatible with a competition between c-Fos and NA for binding of c-Fos to the enzymes as shown previously in other systems (38Racca A.C. Prucca C.G. Caputto B.L.

https://openalex.org/W3021421833,"Zambia is still facing undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies despite fortification and supplementation programmes stressing the need for additional solutions. Fermented foods have the potential to improve nutrient intake and, therefore, could have an important role in food based recommendations (FBRs) to ensure adequate intake of nutrients for optimal health of populations. Secondary dietary intake data was used in Optifood, a linear programming software to develop FBRs, for children aged 1-3 and 4-5 years in Mkushi district of Zambia. Three scenarios per age group were modeled to determine FBRs based on: (1) FBRs based on local available foods (2) FBR and Mabisi, a fermented milk beverage, and (3) FBR with Munkoyo, a cereal fermented beverage. The scenarios were compared to assess whether addition of Mabisi or Munkoyo achieved a better nutrient intake. FBRs based on only locally available non-fermented foods did not meet ≥70% of recommended nutrient intake (RNI) for calcium, fat, iron and zinc, so-called problem nutrients. The addition of Munkoyo to the FBRs did not reduce the number of problem nutrients, but after adding Mabisi to the FBR's only iron (67% of RNI) in the 1-3 year age group and only zinc (67% of RNI) in the 4-5 year age group remained problem nutrients. Mabisi, a fermented milk product in combination with the local food pattern is a good additional source of nutrients for these age groups. However, additional nutrition sensitive and cost-effective measures would still be needed to improve nutrient intake, especially that of iron and zinc."

A large number of samples is required to understand the distribution, abundance and fate of microplastic particles in the environment. Despite more than a decade of widespread study, there is currently no established time series of microplastic measurements and the research community is yet to establish a standardised set of methods that will allow data to be collected in a quick, affordable and interoperable way. We present a sampling technique involving the connection of a custom-built microplastic sampling device to the pump-underway ship intake system of a research vessel (RV) as an unexploited opportunity for oceanic monitoring needs concerning microplastic abundance and distribution. The method is cost effective, highly versatile and accurate, and is able to sample particles down to 50μm from opportunity platforms, thus contributing to an emerging area of study, and in particular helping to increase the monitoring reporting of data, and thereby serving as a valuable aid for the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Sampling was performed during three consecutive oceanographic cruises in the subtropical NE Atlantic over a year, sampling subsurface waters (4 m depth) during navigation and while on coastal and oceanic stations. Microplastic particles were found in all stations and transects sampled.

Handwashing with soap has the potential to halve the burden of diarrhoeal diseases in crisis contexts. This study aimed to identify which determinants drive handwashing behaviour in post-conflict, displacement camps.This study was conducted in two camps for internally displaced people in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. A Barrier Analysis questionnaire was used for assessing the determinants of hand washing behaviour. Participants were screened and classified as either 'doers' (those who wash their hands with soap at critical times) or 'non-doers' (those who do not wash their hands with soap at critical times). Forty-five doers and non-doers were randomly selected from each camp and asked about behavioural determinants. The Barrier Analysis standard tabulation sheet was used for the analysis.No differences were observed between doers and non-doers in relation to self-efficacy, action efficacy, the difficulties and benefits of handwashing, and levels of access to soap and water. In the first of the two camps, non-doers found it harder to remember to wash their hands (P = 0.045), had lower perceived vulnerability to diarrhoea (P = 0.037), lower perceived severity of diarrhoea (P = 0.020) and were aware of 'policies' which supported handwashing with soap (P = 0.037). In the second camp non-doers had lower perceived vulnerability to diarrhoea (P = 0.017).In these camp settings handwashing behaviour, and the factors that determine it, was relatively homogenous because of the homogeneity of the settings and the socio-demographics of population. Handwashing programmes should seek to improve the convenience and quality of handwashing facilities, create cues to trigger handwashing behaviour and increase perceived risk. We identify several ways to improve the validity of the Barrier Analysis method such as using it in combination with other more holistic qualitative tools and revising the statistical analysis."

The high-arabinoxylan (AX) Chinese variety Yumai-34 was crossed with three Central European wheat varieties (Lupus, Mv-Mambo, Ukrainka) and 31 selected high-AX lines were compared for physical (hectolitre weight, thousand grain weight, flour yield), compositional (protein content, gluten content, pentosan) and processing quality traits (gluten index, Zeleny sedimentation, Farinograph parameters) in a three-year experiment (2013-2015) in the F7-F9 generations. The stability and heritability of different traits, including the relative effects of the genotype (G) and environment (E), were determined focusing on grain composition. The contents of total and water-soluble pentosans were significantly affected by G, E and G × E interactions, but the heritability of total (TOT)-pentosan was significantly lower (0.341) than that of water-extractable (WE)-pentosan (0.825). The main component of the pentosans, the amount and composition (arabinose:xylose ratio) of the arabinoxylan (AX), was primarily determined by the environment and, accordingly, the broader heritability of these parameters were 0.516 and 0.772. However, genotype significantly affected the amount of water-soluble arabinoxylan and its composition and thus the heritability of these traits was also significant (0.840 and 0.721). The genotypes exhibiting higher stability of content of TOT-pentosan also showed more stable contents of WE-pentosan. There was a positive correlation between the stability of contents of WE-pentosan and WE-AX, while the stability of the WE-AX content and AX composition were also strongly correlated. Water absorption was strongly genetically determined with a heritability of 0.829 with the genotype determining 38.67% of the total variance.

Methods Cross-sectional study that consecutively included 60 adults with DS. All patients underwent type III polysomnography and clinical and laboratory data were collected; sleep assessment questionnaires were applied. Multiple linear regression models evaluated the associations between OSA severity (measured by the respiratory event index—REI) and clinical and laboratory data and sleep questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, BERLIN and STOP-Bang questionnaires). Results Results show that 60 (100%) adults with DS had OSA, with moderate-severe OSA identified in 49 (81.6%).

However, the prevalence's of the use of substances among pregnant women were not well studied in developing countries such as Ethiopia. Therefore, the study aimed to estimate the prevalence of caffeine and alcohol consumption, khat chewing, and tobacco use during pregnancy and identify key factors associated with excess caffeine consumption.We conducted a community based cross-sectional study and used a random sampling technique to recruit 352 pregnant women. We adapted a questionnaire from Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire-Revised (CCQ-R), Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), and Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey 2016 for caffeine, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and khat chewing assessment, respectively. We conducted non-consecutive two days 24-hour recall to determine the habitual intake of caffeine from caffeinated beverages and foods. Prevalence with 95% confidence interval was estimated for excess caffeine intake per day, alcohol consumption, khat chewing, and passive tobacco smoking. We ran a multivariable binary logistic regression model to identify factors associated with excess caffeine intake.Almost all pregnant women (98.2%) consumed caffeine as estimated using the 2 days 24-hour average. The median daily caffeine intake was 170.5 mg and ranged from 0.00 mg to 549.8 mg per day. In addition, 17.6% (95% CI: 13.9%, 22.0%) of them had a daily caffeine consumption of 300 mg and above exceeding the WHO recommended daily caffeine intake during pregnancy. The prevalence of alcohol consumption and Khat chewing were 10.0% (95% CI: 7.2%, 13.7%) and 35.8% (95% CI: 30.8, 41.0%) respectively. None of the pregnant women were active tobacco smokers.

In myocardial infarction (MI), various inflammatory cells are known to be recruited to the infarcted area, but the function of BLT1 in MI is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of BLT1 in MI and the therapeutic effect of a BLT1 antagonist, ONO-4057, on MI. Mice with infarcted hearts showed increased BLT1 expression and LTB4 levels. BLT1-knockout mice with infarcted hearts exhibited attenuated leukocyte infiltration, proinflammatory cytokine production, and cell death, which led to reduced mortality and improved cardiac function after MI. Bone-marrow transplantation studies showed that BLT1 expressed on bone marrow-derived cells was responsible for the exacerbation of inflammation in infarcted hearts. Furthermore, ONO-4057 administration attenuated the inflammatory responses in hearts surgically treated for MI, which resulted in reduced mortality and improved cardiac function after MI. Our study demonstrated that BLT1 contributes to excessive inflammation after MI and could represent a new therapeutic target for MI."

Medication problems include continuation of acute medications and discontinuation of chronic medications after discharge. Little is known across a national integrated health care system about the extent of these two medication problems. Objective To examine the extent of statin medication discontinuation and new antipsychotic medication use after hospital discharge. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Veterans Affairs healthcare system. Participants Veterans with an inpatient hospitalization from January 1, 2014-December 31, 2016, survived at least 180 days post-discharge, and received at least one medication through the VA outpatient pharmacy within one year around admission were included. Hospitalizations were grouped into: 1) direct admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and a diagnosis of sepsis, 2) direct admission to the ICU without sepsis diagnosis, and 3) no ICU stay during the hospitalization. Main outcome measures Statin medication discontinuation and new antipsychotic use at six months post-hospital discharge. Results A total of 520,187 participants were included in the statin medication and 910,629 in the antipsychotic medication cohorts. Statin discontinuation ranged from 10–15% and new antipsychotic prescription fills from 2–4% across the three hospitalization groups, with highest rates in the ICU admission and sepsis diagnosis group. Statin discontinuation and new antipsychotic use after a hospitalization varied by hospital, with worse performing hospitals having 11% higher odds of discontinuing a statin (median odds ratio at hospital-level, adjusted for patient differences, aMOR: 1.11 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.13)) and 29% higher odds of new antipsychotic use (aMOR, 1.29 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.34)). Risk-adjusted hospital rates of these two medication changes were not correlated (p = 0.49).

https://openalex.org/W3021608275,"Over exploitation of groundwater in Changping District of Beijing city has caused serious land subsidence in the past decades. In recent years, the operation of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project has reduced the land subsidence rate. In this paper, Experimental tests are performed using the GDS Consolidation Testing System to characterize the compression and rebound of soils at depths of less than 100 m caused by groundwater withdrawal and recharge in Changping District. The results indicate that the compressible layers are the main contributors to land subsidence. The first compressible layer experiences greater deformation and more considerable hysteresis than the other compressible layers with the same decrease in the pore water pressure. Therefore, the exploitation of the adjacent aquifer should be controlled in the future. The deformation in the second and third compressible layers is a gradual and long-term process with little rebound; therefore, the subsidence should be seriously addressed when the groundwater in the two compressible layers is exploited on a large scale. In the same compressible layer, silty clay is more compressible and hysteretic than silt. For the same soil sample, the deformation rate decreases gradually as the pore water pressure decreases, whereas the creep deformation shows an overall increasing trend. A parameter named the subsidence index Cw is proposed in this paper to describe the soil compressibility during groundwater withdrawal. All the soil samples are characterized by elastic-plastic deformation, and the shallow soil samples with less pore water pressure decrease are more likely to rebound."

We aimed to investigate how ESD endoscopists have been trained in actual clinical practice.Endoscopists aged <45 years who have completed a gastroenterology fellowship or were currently in a fellowship for ≥2 years were included. We conducted a nationwide survey on the ESD training experiences of these endoscopists.Among 79 young Korean endoscopists invited to participate in the survey, 68 (86.1%) trained in 24 major hospitals responded to the questionnaire. Twenty, 25, and 23 participants belonged to the second-year fellow, <5 years after training, and ≥5 years after training groups, respectively. Sixty-nine percent of the participants observed ≥50 ESD cases before starting ESD under supervision by an expert endoscopist. Additionally, 22% experienced ≥20 supervised ESDs during the training period. The proportion of the participants who underwent a hands-on course differed among the groups (≥5 years after training, 13.0%; <5 years after training, 40.0%; and second-year fellow, 50.0%; P = 0.027). ESD under supervision, observation, and hands-on course were the preferred methods for learning ESD (91.1%, 80.9%, and 35.3%, respectively). Overall, 42.6% of the participants were satisfied with their training program. More experience in supervised ESD (≥20 cases) was associated with an increased satisfaction (odds ratio, 6.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.62-36.31).Observation and performance of ESD under the supervision of an expert endoscopist are the primary methods for learning ESD.

Although, Normal fibroblasts demonstrate anti-tumor effects, cancer associated fibroblasts are principal participant in tumor growth and invasion. The ambiguity of fibroblasts function can be regarded as two heads of its behavioral spectrum and can be subjected for mathematical modeling to identify their switching behavior. In this research, an agent-based model of mutual interactions between fibroblast and cancer cell was created. The proposed model is based on nonlinear differential equations which describes biochemical reactions of the main factors involved in fibroblasts and cancer cells communication. Also, most of the model parameters are estimated using hybrid unscented Kalman filter. The interactions between two cell types are illustrated by the dynamic modeling of TGFβ and LIF pathways as well as their crosstalk. Using analytical and computational approaches, reciprocal effects of cancer cells and fibroblasts are constructed and the role of signaling molecules in tumor progression or prevention are determined. Finally, the model is validated using a set of experimental data. The proposed dynamic modeling might be useful for designing more efficient therapies in cancer metastasis treatment and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3023279266,"Postoperative pain management and pain assessment are still lacking the perspective of the patient. We have developed and studied a prototype smartphone application for patients to self-record postoperative pain. The main objective was to collect patient and stakeholder critique of improvements on the usability in order to develop a definitive version. The secondary objective was to investigate if patient self-recording compared to nurse-led assessment is a suitable method for postoperative pain management. Fifty patients and a stakeholder group consisting of ten healthcare- and ICT professionals and two members of the patient council participated in this study. Main outcome Thirty patients (60%) found it satisfying or very satisfying to communicate their pain with the app. Pain experienced after surgery was scored by patients as ‘no’: 3 (6%), ‘little’: 5 (10%), ‘bearable’: 25 (50%), ‘considerable’: 13 (26%) and ‘severe’: 1 (2%). Forty-five patients (90%) were positive about the ease of recording. Forty-five patients (90%) could correctly record their pain with the app. Thirty-eight patients (76%) agreed that in-app notifications to record pain were useful. Two patients (4%) were too ill to use the application. Based on usability feedback, we will redesign the pain intensity wheel and the in-app pain chart to improve clarity for patients to understand the course of their pain. Secondary outcomes The median patient recorded pain app score 4.0 (range 0 to 10) and nurse recorded numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain NRS 4.0 (range 0 to 9) were not statistically different (p = 0.06). Forty-two percent from a total of 307 patient pain app scores were ≥ 5 (on a scale from 0 no pain at all to 10 worst imaginable pain). Of these, 83% were recorded as ‘bearable’ while only in 18% of the recordings patients asked for additional analgesia. The results suggest that self-recording the severity of postoperative pain by patients with a smartphone application could be useful for postoperative pain management. The application was perceived as user-friendly and had high satisfaction rates from both patients and stakeholders. Further research is needed to validate the 11-point numeric and faces pain scale with the current gold standards visual analogue scale (VAS) and NRS for pain."
https://openalex.org/W3023829309,"Drug susceptibility testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is difficult to perform in resource-limited settings where Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smears are commonly used for disease diagnosis and monitoring. We developed a simple method for extraction of MTB DNA from AFB smears for sequencing-based detection of mutations associated with resistance to all first and several second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs.We isolated MTB DNA by boiling smear content in a Chelex solution, followed by column purification. We sequenced PCR-amplified segments of the rpoB, katG, embB, gyrA, gyrB, rpsL, and rrs genes, the inhA, eis, and pncA promoters and the entire pncA gene.We tested our assay on 1,208 clinically obtained AFB smears from Ghana (n = 379), Kenya (n = 517), Uganda (n = 262), and Zambia (n = 50). Coverage depth varied by target and slide smear grade, ranging from 300X to 12000X on average. Coverage of ≥20X was obtained for all targets in 870 (72%) slides overall. Mono-resistance (5.9%), multi-drug resistance (1.8%), and poly-resistance (2.4%) mutation profiles were detected in 10% of slides overall, and in over 32% of retreatment and follow-up cases.This rapid AFB smear DNA-based method for determining drug resistance may be useful for the diagnosis and surveillance of drug-resistant tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W3021434048,"Background Clinical and animal studies have found that anxiety and depression are significantly more common after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) has a dual role: in higher brain functions and in cardiovascular control, making it a logical candidate for explaining the perceived bidirectional heart-brain connection. We used parallel Electrocardiography (ECG) and Electrocorticography (ECoG) registration to investigate AMI-induced changes in medial PFC bioelectrical activity in a rat model of AMI. Materials and methods Adult male Wistar albino rats were used in the study. Gold-plated recording electrodes were implanted over the frontal cortex for ECoG recording. ECG was recorded via two holter electrodes attached on the skin of the back fixed in place by a jacket. Induction of AMI was performed by isoprenaline (150 mg/kg, i.p.). ECoG and ECG signals were registered at baseline, during 3 hours after isoprenaline administration and at 24 hours after isoprenaline administration. Results Significant increases of theta, alpha, and beta electroencephalographic (EEG) band power were observed in different time intervals after isoprenaline administration. Significant increase of theta band peak frequency was also observed during the first hour after isoprenaline administration. No statistically significant differences in band-power activity were found between the pre-isoprenaline measurements and 24 hours after administration. Conclusion Our results demonstrate significant increases in EEG band power of alpha beta and theta bands during isoprenaline-induced AMI model. These are the first findings to connect heart damage during isoprenaline- induced AMI to disturbances in the cortical bioelectrical activity."
https://openalex.org/W3022888064,"Bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals are crucial for the digestion of dietary nutrients. Bacterial community composition is modified by age and diet in other species. Although horses are adapted to consuming fibre-based diets, high-energy, often high-starch containing feeds are increasingly used. The current study assessed the impact of age on the faecal bacteriome of ponies transitioning from a hay-based diet to a high-starch diet. Over two years, 23 Welsh Section A pony mares were evaluated (Controls, 5-15 years, n = 6/year, 12 in total; Aged, ≥19 years, n = 6 Year 1; n = 5 Year 2, 11 in total). Across the same 30-week (May to November) period in each year, animals were randomly assigned to a 5-week period of study and were individually fed the same hay to maintenance (2% body mass as daily dry matter intake) for 4-weeks. During the final week, 2g starch per kg body mass (micronized steam-flaked barley) was incorporated into the diet (3-day transition and 5 days at maximum). Faecal samples were collected for 11 days (final 3 days hay and 8 days hay + barley feeding). Bacterial communities were determined using Ion Torrent Sequencing of amplified V1-V2 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA. Age had a minimal effect on the bacteriome response to diet. The dietary transition increased Candidatus Saccharibacteria and Firmicutes phyla abundance and reduced Fibrobactres abundance. At the genera level, Streptococcus abundance was increased but not consistently across individual animals. Bacterial diversity was reduced during dietary transition in Streptococcus 'responders'. Faecal pH and VFA concentrations were modified by diet but considerable inter-individual variation was present. The current study describes compositional changes in the faecal bacteriome associated with the transition from a fibre-based to a high-starch diet in ponies and emphasises the individual nature of dietary responses, which may reflect functional differences in the bacterial populations present in the hindgut."
https://openalex.org/W3023830018,"There is ongoing research into the development of novel molecular markers that may complement fluid cytology malignant pleural effusion (MPE) diagnosis. In this exploratory pilot study, we hypothesized that there are distinct differences in the pleural fluid microbiome profile of malignant and non-malignant pleural diseases.From a prospectively enrolled pleural fluid biorepository, samples of MPE were included. Non-MPE effusion were included as comparators. 16S rRNA gene V4 region amplicon sequencing was performed. Exact Sequence Variants (ESVs) were used for diversity analyses. The Shannon and Richness indices of alpha diversity and UniFrac beta diversity measures were tested for significance using permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Analyses of Composition of Microbiome was used to identify differentially abundant bacterial ESVs between the groups controlled for multiple hypothesis testing.38 patients with MPE and 9 with non-MPE were included. A subgroup of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma histology were identified among MPE group (adenocarcinoma of lung origin (LA-MPE) = 11, breast origin (BA-MPE) = 11). MPE presented with significantly greater alpha diversity compared to non-MPE group. Within the MPE group, BA-MPE was more diverse compared to LA-MPE group. In multivariable analysis, ESVs belonging to family S24-7 and genera Allobaculum, Stenotrophomonas, and Epulopiscium were significantly enriched in the malignant group compared to the non-malignant group.Our results are the first to demonstrate a microbiome signature according to MPE and non-MPE. The role of microbiome in pleural effusion pathogenesis needs further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3021547693,"Mycetoma is a chronic, granulomatous infection of subcutaneous tissue, that may involve deep structures and bone. It can be caused by bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). There is an epidemiological association between mycetoma and the environment, including rainfall, temperature and humidity but there are still many knowledge gaps in the identification of the natural habitat of actinomycetes, their primary reservoir, and their precise geographical distribution. Knowing the potential distribution of this infection and its ecological niche in endemic areas is relevant to determine disease management strategies and etiological agent habitat or reservoirs.This was an ambispective descriptive study of 31 patients with actinomycetoma. We determined the biophysical characteristics including temperature, precipitation, soil type, vegetation, etiological agents, and mapped actinomycetoma cases in Northeast Mexico. We identified two disease cluster areas. One in Nuevo Leon, with a predominantly kastanozems soil type, with a mean annual temperature of 22°, and a mean annual precipitation of 585.2 mm. Herein, mycetoma cases were produced by Actinomadura pelletieri, Actinomadura madurae, Nocardia brasiliensis, and Nocardia spp. The second cluster was in San Luis Potosí, where lithosols soil type predominates, with a mean annual temperature of 23.5° and a mean annual precipitation of 635.4 mm. In this area, all the cases were caused by N. brasiliensis. A. madurae cases were identified in rendzinas, kastanozems, vertisols, and lithosols soils, and A. pelletieri cases in xerosols, kastanozems, and rendzinas soils. Previous thorn trauma with Acacia or Prosopis plants was referred by 35.4% of subjects. In these states, the presence of thorny plants, such as Acacia spp., Prosopis spp., Senegalia greggi, Vachellia farnesiana and Vachellia rigidula, are common.Mapping this neglected tropical infection aids in the detection of disease cluster areas, the development of public health strategies for early diagnosis and disease prediction models; this paves the way for more ecological niche etiological agent research."
https://openalex.org/W3022219489,"High-speed imaging equipment can be an expensive investment, especially when certain applications require custom solutions. In this paper, we present a low-cost high-speed prototype camera built on a low-end Zynq-7000 System-on-Chip (SoC) platform and off-the-shelf components with the aim of removing the entry barrier into various high-speed imaging applications. The camera is standalone (does not require a host computer) and can achieve 211 frames per second (fps) at its maximum resolution of 1280x1024, and up to 2329 fps at a 256x256 resolution. With a current cost of only several hundred dollars and resource utilization of ~5%, the open-source design’s modularity and customizability allows users with sufficient hardware or programming experience to modify the camera to suit their needs, potentially driving the cost lower. This can be done by utilizing the large remaining programmable logic for custom image processing algorithms, creating user interface software on the CPU, attaching extensions through the peripheral Module connections, or creating custom carrier or daughter boards. The development and design of the camera is described and a figure-of-merit is presented to provide a value assessment of some available commercial high-speed cameras against which our camera is competitive. Finally, the camera was tested to record low frequency spatial vibration and was found to be useful in investigating phenotypes associated with aging in a leading animal model, the nematode (worm) Caenorhabditis elegans."
https://openalex.org/W3023290949,"The conserved central region (CR) of PrPC has been hypothesized to serve as a passive linker connecting the protein's toxic N-terminal and globular C-terminal domains. Yet, deletion of the CR causes neonatal fatality in mice, implying the CR possesses a protective function. The CR encompasses the regulatory α-cleavage locus, and additionally facilitates a regulatory metal ion-promoted interaction between the PrPC N- and C-terminal domains. To elucidate the role of the CR and determine why CR deletion generates toxicity, we designed PrPC constructs wherein either the cis-interaction or α-cleavage are selectively prevented. These constructs were interrogated using nuclear magnetic resonance, electrophysiology, and cell viability assays. Our results demonstrate the CR is not a passive linker and the native sequence is crucial for its protective role over the toxic N-terminus, irrespective of α-cleavage or the cis-interaction. Additionally, we find that the CR facilitates homodimerization of PrPC, attenuating the toxicity of the N-terminus."
https://openalex.org/W3021844277,"Intimate partners can have a profound influence on individuals' health behaviors. In this exploratory research, we investigated the concordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors including smoking, body mass index, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, red meat intake, and alcohol use within African American heterosexual couples. We also examined whether females' stress is associated with their own (actor effect) and males' cancer-related lifestyle factors (partner effect), and vice versa. We analyzed a total of 216 heterosexual couples (i.e., N = 432 individuals) recruited from black churches. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated and multilevel modeling in which individuals are nested within couples was conducted. Results showed that there was high concordance of body mass index (ICC = 1.68, p < .001), fruit and vegetable intake (ICC = 1.62, p < .001), red meat intake (ICC = 1.50, p = .001), and alcohol use (ICC = 1.74, p < .001) between spouses. A multilevel analysis showed that there were actor and partner effects of stress on females' BMI; females' stress was positively associated with their own BMI (actor effect; β = .42, p = .006) and males' stress was positively associated with females' BMI (partner effect; β = .39, p = .026). Also, females' stress was positively associated with their own red meat intake (actor effect; β = .20, p = .019). In conclusion, high concordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors (BMI, fruit and vegetable intake, red meat intake and alcohol use) exists between African American spouses. Given the identified actor and partner effects of stress on females' BMI, a couple-based lifestyle or weight management intervention that targets both male and female spouses' stress and coping will be promising, particularly to enhance African American women's health behaviors. Future studies need to investigate mechanisms underlying concordance and discordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors in African American couples. Also, factors that explain African American male spouses' health behaviors need to be uncovered."
https://openalex.org/W3023828268,"Background Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is a known issue during minor histocompatibility antigen (mHA) disparity during lung transplantation. This study evaluated gene expression in a murine orthotropic lung transplantation model using microarray analysis. Methods Left lungs from C57BL/10(H-2b) donor mice were transplanted into mHA-mismatched C57BL/6(H-2b) recipient mice. Three groups (OB, non-OB, and sham controls) were confirmed pathologically and analyzed. Gene expression changes in the lung grafts were determined by microarray and immunohistochemical staining, and genes were verified by quantitative PCR in the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs). Results A total of 1343 genes were upregulated in the OB lungs compared to the sham group. Significant upregulation was observed for genes related to innate, e.g. Tlr2 and CCL3 and adaptive immunity, e.g. H2-ab1 and Il-21. Positive labeling for MHC class II antigen was observed in the bronchial epithelium of OB accompanied with B cells. We found increased Tlr2, Ccl3, H2-ab1, Il-21, Ighg3, Ifng, and Pdcd1 mRNA expression in the OB lung, and increased Il-21, Ighg3, and Pdcd1 expression in the OB LNs. Conclusions Adaptive and innate immune reactions were involved in OB after lung transplantation, and genetic examination of related genes could be used for detection of OB."
