https://openalex.org/W1999670767,"Saccharopolyspora erythraea is used for the industrial-scale production of the antibiotic erythromycin A, derivatives of which play a vital role in medicine. The sequenced chromosome of this soil bacterium comprises 8,212,805 base pairs, predicted to encode 7,264 genes. It is circular, like those of the pathogenic actinomycetes Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, but unlike the linear chromosomes of the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and the closely related Streptomyces avermitilis. The S. erythraea genome contains at least 25 gene clusters for production of known or predicted secondary metabolites, at least 72 genes predicted to confer resistance to a range of common antibiotic classes and many sets of duplicated genes to support its saprophytic lifestyle. The availability of the genome sequence of S. erythraea will improve insight into its biology and facilitate rational development of strains to generate high-titer producers of clinically important antibiotics."

https://openalex.org/W2164298973,"MitoQ<sub>10</sub> is a ubiquinone that accumulates within mitochondria driven by a conjugated lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation (TPP<sup>+</sup>). Once there, MitoQ<sub>10</sub> is reduced to its active ubiquinol form, which has been used to prevent mitochondrial oxidative damage and to infer the involvement of reactive oxygen species in signaling pathways. Here we show MitoQ<sub>10</sub> is effectively reduced by complex II, but is a poor substrate for complex I, complex III, and electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF):quinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QOR). This differential reactivity could be explained if the bulky TPP<sup>+</sup> moiety sterically hindered access of the ubiquinone group to enzyme active sites with a long, narrow access channel. Using a combination of molecular modeling and an uncharged analog of MitoQ<sub>10</sub> with similar sterics (tritylQ<sub>10</sub>), we infer that the interaction of MitoQ<sub>10</sub> with complex I and ETF-QOR, but not complex III, is inhibited by its bulky TPP<sup>+</sup> moiety. To explain its lack of reactivity with complex III we show that the TPP<sup>+</sup> moiety of MitoQ<sub>10</sub> is ineffective at quenching pyrene fluorophors deeply buried within phospholipid bilayers and thus is positioned near the membrane surface. This superficial position of the TPP<sup>+</sup> moiety, as well as the low solubility of MitoQ<sub>10</sub> in non-polar organic solvents, suggests that the concentration of the entire MitoQ<sub>10</sub> molecule in the membrane core is very limited. As overlaying MitoQ<sub>10</sub> onto the structure of complex III indicates that MitoQ<sub>10</sub> cannot react with complex III without its TPP<sup>+</sup> moiety entering the low dielectric of the membrane core, we conclude that the TPP<sup>+</sup> moiety does anchor the tethered ubiquinol group out of reach of the active site(s) of complex III, thus explaining its slow oxidation. In contrast the ubiquinone moiety of MitoQ<sub>10</sub> is able to quench fluorophors deep within the membrane core, indicating a high concentration of the ubiquinone moiety within the membrane and explaining its good anti-oxidant efficacy. These findings will facilitate the rational design of future mitochondria-targeted molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2057414337,"How do the fitness effects of several mutations combine? Despite its simplicity, this question is central to the understanding of multilocus evolution. Epistasis (the interaction between alleles at different loci), especially epistasis for fitness traits such as reproduction and survival, influences evolutionary predictions1,2 “almost whenever multilocus genetics matters”3. Yet very few models4,5 have sought to predict epistasis, and none has been empirically tested. Here we show that the distribution of epistasis can be predicted from the distribution of single mutation effects, based on a simple fitness landscape model6. We show that this prediction closely matches the empirical measures of epistasis that have been obtained for Escherichia coli7 and the RNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus8. Our results suggest that a simple fitness landscape model may be sufficient to quantitatively capture the complex nature of gene interactions. This model may offer a simple and widely applicable alternative to complex metabolic network models, in particular for making evolutionary predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2112528220,"Aberrant constitutive expression of c-Rel, p65 and p50 NF-κB subunits has been reported in over 90% of breast cancers1,2. Recently, we characterized a de novo RelB NF-κB subunit synthesis pathway, induced by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) IE1 protein, in which binding of p50–p65 NF-κB and c-Jun–Fra-2 AP-1 complexes to the RELB promoter work in synergy to potently activate transcription3. Although RelB complexes were observed in mouse mammary tumours induced by either ectopic c-Rel expression4 or carcinogen exposure5, little is known about RelB in human breast disease. Here, we demonstrate constitutive de novo RelB synthesis is selectively active in invasive oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-negative breast cancer cells. ERα signalling reduced levels of functional NF-κB and Fra-2 AP-1 and inhibited de novo RelB synthesis, leading to an inverse correlation between RELB and ERα gene expression in human breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Induction of Bcl-2 by RelB promoted the more invasive phenotype of ERα-negative cancer cells. Thus, inhibition of de novo RelB synthesis represents a new mechanism whereby ERα controls epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)."
https://openalex.org/W2150789897,"The management of pain and morbidity due to the spreading and growth of cancer within bone remains to be a paramount problem in clinical care. Cancer cells actively transform bone, however, the molecular requirements and mechanisms of this process remain unclear. This study shows that functional modulation of the αvβ3 integrin receptor in prostate cancer cells is required for progression within bone and determines tumor-induced bone tissue transformation. Using histology and quantitative microCT analysis, we show that αvβ3 integrin is required not only for tumor growth within the bone but for tumor-induced bone gain, a response resembling bone lesions in prostate cancer patients. Expression of normal, fully functional αvβ3 enabled tumor growth in bone (incidence: 4/4), whereas αvβ3 (−), inactive or constitutively active mutants of αvβ3 did not (incidence: 0/4, 0/6 and 1/7, respectively) within a 35-day-period. This response appeared to be bone-specific in comparison to the subcutis where tumor incidence was greater than 60% for all groups. Interestingly, bone residing prostate cancer cells expressing normal or dis-regulated αvβ3 (either inactive of constitutively active), but not those lacking β3 promoted bone gain or afforded protection from bone loss in the presence or absence of histologically detectable tumor 35 days following implantation. As bone is replete with ligands for β3 integrin, we next demonstrated that αvβ3 integrin activation on tumor cells is essential for the recognition of key bone-specific matrix proteins. As a result, prostate cancer cells expressing fully functional but not dis-regulated αvβ3 integrin are able to control their own adherence and migration to bone matrix, functions that facilitate tumor growth and control bone lesion development."

https://openalex.org/W1986946795,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) functions as a coreceptor through interaction with plexin A1 or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor during neuronal development and angiogenesis. NRP1 potentiates the signaling pathways stimulated by semaphorin 3A and VEGF-A in neuronal and endothelial cells, respectively. In this study, we investigate the role of tumor cell-expressed NRP1 in glioma progression. Analyses of human glioma specimens (WHO grade I-IV tumors) revealed a significant correlation of NRP1 expression with glioma progression. In tumor xenografts, overexpression of NRP1 by U87MG gliomas strongly promoted tumor growth and angiogenesis. Overexpression of NRP1 by U87MG cells stimulated cell survival through the enhancement of autocrine hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF)/c-Met signaling. NRP1 not only potentiated the activity of endogenous HGF/SF on glioma cell survival but also enhanced HGF/SF-promoted cell proliferation. Inhibition of HGF/SF, c-Met and NRP1 abrogated NRP1-potentiated autocrine HGF/SF stimulation. Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of c-Met correlated with glioma progression in human glioma biopsies in which NRP1 is upregulated and in U87MG NRP1-overexpressing tumors. Together, these data suggest that tumor cell-expressed NRP1 promotes glioma progression through potentiating the activity of the HGF/SF autocrine c-Met signaling pathway, in addition to enhancing angiogenesis, suggesting a novel mechanism of NRP1 in promoting human glioma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2013966205,"The integrated stress response (ISR) is defined as a highly conserved response to several stresses that converge to the induction of the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Because an uncontrolled response may have deleterious effects, cells have elaborated several negative feedback loops that attenuate the ISR. In the present study, we describe how induction of the human homolog of Drosophila tribbles (TRB3) attenuates the ISR by a negative feedback mechanism. To investigate the role of TRB3 in the control of the ISR, we used the regulation of gene expression by amino acid limitation as a model. The enhanced production of ATF4 upon amino acid starvation results in the induction of a large number of target genes like CHOP (CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein), asparagine synthetase (ASNS), or TRB3. We demonstrate that TRB3 overexpression inhibits the transcriptional induction of CHOP and ASNS whereas TRB3 silencing induces the expression of these genes both under normal and stressed conditions. In addition, transcriptional profiling experiments show that TRB3 affects the expression of many ISR-regulated genes. Our results also suggest that TRB3 and ATF4 belong to the same protein complex bound to the sequence involved in the ATF4-dependent regulation of gene expression by amino acid limitation. Collectively, our data identify TRB3 as a negative feedback regulator of the ATF4-dependent transcription and participates to the fine regulation of the ISR.

Cells have evolved specific signaling pathways to ensure adaptation to stress.

The ISR acts downstream of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) phosphorylation (1Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R.

In mammals, distinct stress signals activate four eIF2α kinases: PKR (activated by double-stranded RNA during viral infection (5Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar)), GCN2 (activated by uncharged tRNAs, adapts cells to amino acid starvation (6Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y.

Investig. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The reversible phosphorylation on serine 51 of eIF2α by either of these kinases inhibits initiation of mRNA translation. Although global protein synthesis is inhibited, the translation of specific mRNAs such as ATF4 is strongly induced (4Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 442-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This transcription factor plays a crucial role for the adaptation to stresses by regulating the expression of many genes. As shown by Harding et al. (1Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar), ATF4 controls many genes involved in metabolism and transport of amino acid and in resistance to oxidative stress. In addition, several ATF4 target genes, such as CHOP, are themselves transcription factors that regulate the expression of a set of stress-induced target genes and amplify the signal initiated by the original stress (10Sok J. Wang X.Z. Batchvarova N. Kuroda M. Harding H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 495-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang X.Z. Kuroda M. Sok J. Batchvarova N. Kimmel R. Chung P. Zinszner H.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because an uncontrolled response to stress may have deleterious effects, cells have elaborated a negative feedback loop that attenuates the ISR. Indeed, in response to stresses, the induction of GADD34 mediates eIF2α dephosphorylation and allows protein synthesis to recover to translate the product of induced genes (13Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 14Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that GADD34 controls a programmed shift from translational repression to stress-induced gene expression and reconciles the apparent contradiction between the translational and transcriptional arms of cellular stress responses. In a context of amino acid starvation, it has been shown that the expression of many genes is induced via the GCN2/ATF4 pathway. For two genes (CHOP and ASNS), a cis-acting element involved in the transcriptional activation by leucine starvation was well characterized and has been respectively named AARE (amino acid response element) (15Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and NSRE (nutrient-sensing response element) (16Siu F. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

J. 2003; 372: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have shown that these elements are able to bind ATF4. Among the mRNA species that are induced by amino acid limitation, the highest induction ratio was obtained for TRB3, the mammalian homologue of Drosophila tribbles, also known as TRIB3, NIPK, SINK, or SKIP3. An emerging literature suggests that this ubiquitously expressed protein has a scaffold-like regulatory function for a number of signaling pathways. Several reports described TRB3 as a regulatory protein for p65/RelA and ATF4. Wu et al. (20Wu M. Xu L.G. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27072-27079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) showed that TRB3 is critically involved in a negative feedback control pathway of Nf-κB-induced gene expression through the p65/RelA regulation. Another set of publications showed that TRB3 interacts with ATF4 and inhibits the transcriptional activity of overexpressed ATF4 (21Ord D. Ord T. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 286: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Ord D. Ord T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study supports the potential regulatory role of TRB3 under stressful conditions by demonstrating that cellular stresses can both up- and down-regulate TRB3 expression (23Corcoran C.A. Luo X. He Q. Jiang C. Huang Y. Sheikh M.S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional relevance of TRB3 induction during stress has been studied by Ohoka et al. (24Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that TRB3 is involved in the coordination of programmed cell death during ER stress. A second line of investigation on TRB3 functions comes from Montminy's laboratory that showed that TRB3 is involved in the control of both glucose and lipid metabolisms (25Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 26Qi L. Heredia J.E. Altarejos J.Y. Screaton R. Goebel N. Niessen S. Macleod I.X. Liew C.W. Kulkarni R.N. Bain J. Newgard C. Nelson M. Evans R.M. Yates J. Montminy M. Science. 2006; 312: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Indeed, they show that: 1) TRB3 inhibits Akt activation, 2) its level is elevated during fasting (27Koo S.H. Satoh H. Herzig S. Lee C.H. Hedrick S. Kulkarni R. Evans R.M. Olefsky J. Montminy M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), 3) an adenovirus-mediated expression of TRB3 in mice leads to alteration in glucose metabolism. Thus, these authors propose that TRB3 serves as a major modulatory mechanism in the balance of glucose metabolism (25Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Recently, the same group demonstrated that TRB3 stimulates lipolysis by triggering the degradation of ACC (acetyl coA carboxylase) in adipose tissue and that transgenic mice overexpressing TRB3 in adipose tissue were protected from diet-induced obesity (26Qi L. Heredia J.E. Altarejos J.Y. Screaton R. Goebel N. Niessen S. Macleod I.X. Liew C.W. Kulkarni R.N. Bain J. Newgard C. Nelson M. Evans R.M. Yates J. Montminy M. Science. 2006; 312: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Taken together, published data demonstrate that TRB3 is up-regulated by many effectors and is involved in the fine control of several signaling pathways. In the context of amino acid regulation of gene expression, we investigated the role of TRB3 in the regulation of the ISR. We demonstrate that TRB3 is a negative feedback regulator of ATF4-regulated transcription and participates to the fine regulation of the amino acid response pathway and more generally of the ISR. Cell Culture and Treatment Conditions—All cells were cultured at 37 °C/CO2 5% in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12 (DMEM F12) (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Parental cell line, i.e. HeLa cells overexpressing Tet-repressor, were cultured in presence of 10 μg/ml Blasticidine and tet-TRB3myc cells in presence of 10 μg/ml blasticidine + 100 μg/ml zeocine. When needed, tetracycline was used for 16 h at 0.1 μm. When indicated, DMEM F12 lacking leucine was used. In all experiments involving amino acid starvation, 10% dialyzed calf serum was used. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient in ATF4 were kindly given by Dr. D. Ron (NYU, New York) (1Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R.

DNA Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells were plated in 12-well dishes and transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (15Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, 1 μg of luciferase plasmid was transfected into the cells along with 0.1 μg of pCMV-βGal, a plasmid carrying the bacterial β-galactosidase gene fused to the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer/promoter region, as an internal control. Cells were then exposed to the precipitate for 16 h, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then incubated with DMEM F12 containing 10% calf serum. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were amino acid-starved for 16 h. Cells were then harvested and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was measured as previously described (28Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). Relative luciferase activity was given as the ratio of relative luciferase unit/relative β-gal unit. Plasmid Constructions—2xAARE.TK.Luciferase and NSRE1 + NSRE2.TK.Luciferase plasmids were generated as previously described (29Bruhat A. Averous J. Carraro V. Zhong C. Reimold A.M. Kilberg M.S. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48107-48114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). pCDNA4.TO.TRB3-FL.Myc.6xHIS plasmid was generated by cloning the full-length coding sequence of TRB3 in frame with the Myc and His tags of the pcDNA4.TO.Myc.6xHIS vector (Invitrogen). pBIND.Gal4-ATF4-(1-85), pBIND. Gal4-ATF4-(1-186) and pBIND.Gal4-ATF4-(86-186) were obtained by inserting ATF4 coding sequence (amino acids 1-85, amino acids 1-186, and amino acids 86-186, respectively), in-frame with the Gal4 coding sequence in the pBIND vector (Promega). Analysis of Gene Expression Using Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared as previously described (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63200) Google Scholar) and treated with DNase I, Amp Grade (Invitrogen) prior to cDNA synthesis. RNA integrity was electrophoretically verified by ethidium bromide staining. RNA (0.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed with 100 units of Superscript II plus RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) using 100 μm random hexamer primers (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers for mouse sequences (used in ATF4+/+, ATF4-/- MEFs): CHOP (forward primer, 5′-CCTAGCTTGGCTGACAGAGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTGCTCCTTCTCCTTCATGC-3′), ASNS (forward primer, 5′-TACAACCACAAGGCGCTACA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AAGGGCCTGACTCCATAGGT-3′), TRB3 (forward primer, 5′-CAGGAAGAAACCGTTGGAGTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTGCTCTCGTTCCAAAAGGA-3′) and primers for human sequences (used in HeLa cells and their derivatives): CHOP (forward primer, 5′-CAGAACCAGCAGAGGTCACA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGCTGTGCCACTTTCCTTTC-3′), ASNS (forward primer, 5′-ATCACTGTCGGGATGTACCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTTCAACAGAGTGGCAGCAA-3′), TRB3 (forward primer, 5′-TGGTACCCAGCTCCTCTACG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GACAAAGCGACACAGCTTGA-3′) were used and yielded PCR products of approximatively 200 bp in size. To control for RNA quality and cDNA synthesis, β-actin mRNA was also amplified (mouse: forward primer, 5′-TACAGCTTCACCACCACAGC-3′; reverse primer 5′-AAGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGAGC-3′; human: forward primer, 5′-CTCGCAGGTCAAGAGCAAG-3′; reverse primer 5′-GACAGCTGCTCCACCTTCTT-3′). Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out using a LightCycler™ System (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (17Averous J. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Thiel G. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5288-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Relative results were displayed as relative levels of CHOP, ASNS, or TRB3 per β-actin. Antibodies—The ATF4 sc-200 antibody, purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, was used for ChIP and immunoblot experiments. The TRB3 antibody was purchased from Calbiochem, the c-Myc antibody was from Sigma, and the β-actin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The antibodies used for acetylated histone immunoprecipitation were acetylated histone H3, 06-599 that recognizes acetylated H3 at Lys-9 and Lys-14 and acetylated histone H4, 06-866 that recognizes acetylated H4 at Lys-5, -8, -12, and -16 from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). Immunoblot Analysis—Nuclear extracts for the detection of ATF4, mouse TRB3, and Myc-tagged TRB3 were obtained as follow: Cells were lysed for 5 min at 4 °C in Harvest buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 m sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktails from Sigma). Intact nuclei were pelleted at 1000 rpm then washed in 500 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktails from Sigma). Nuclei pellets were then lysed 15 min at 4 °C in Buffer C (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktails from Sigma). Whole cell extracts for the detection of human TRB3 were obtained by lysis for 15 min on ice in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1mm PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktails from Sigma). 20-50 μg of proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Protein loading was controlled by Ponceau staining. Membranes were incubated in blocking solution (5% nonfat milk powder in PBS, 0.02% Tween) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then incubated with primary antibody in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies were diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were washed three times in PBS 0.02% Tween and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:10000) from Cell Signaling Technology in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS 0.02% Tween, the blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). ChIP Analysis—ChIP analyses were performed according to the protocol of Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. with minor modifications (31Bruhat A. Cherasse Y. Maurin A.C. Breitwieser W. Parry L. Deval C. Jones N. Jousse C. Fafournoux P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 1 × 106/100-mm dish with DMEM F12 and grown for 24 h. Cells were transferred to fresh DMEM F12 12 h before transfer to either complete DMEM F12 or DMEM F12 lacking leucine for the time period indicated in each figure. Protein-DNA cross-link was performed by adding formaldehyde directly to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and then stopped 8 min later by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cross-linked chromatin was sonicated using a Vibra cell sonicator (Bioblock Scientific Technology) for ten bursts of 30 s at power 2 with 1 min cooling on ice between each burst. Extracts from 1 × 106 HeLa cells or MEF were incubated with 5 μg of antibody. The antibody-bound complex was precipitated by protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology). The DNA fragments in the immunoprecipitated complex were released by reversing the cross-linking overnight at 65 °C and purified using a phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed by using a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) and a SYBR-Green-I-containing PCR mix (Qiagen), following the recommendations of the manufacturer. The immunoprecipitated material was quantified relative to a standard curve of HeLa or MEF genomic DNA. Primers used were the following: human CHOP AARE, 5′-AAGAGGCTCACGACCGACTA-3′ and 5′-ATGATGCAATGTTTGGCAAC-3′; mouse CHOP AARE (amplicon B), 5′-GGGCAGACAAGTTCAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-ATGATGCAATGTTTGGCAAC-3′; mouse CHOP amplicon A, 5′-TCCCCAAGAGAACAAACACC-3′, and 5′-CGGACCTGACATTCCTGACT-3′; mouse CHOP amplicon C, 5′-TAGAAGGGAGAGGCTGAGCA-3′ and 5′-CCAATGGCTTCCTGTTTCAT-3′; mouse ASNS NSRE, 5′-CAGAACACCTCCTGGCTCTC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTTGCCACCTTAGAGT-3′; human ASNS NSRE, 5′-AACAAAAGAGCTCCTCCTTGC-3′ and 5′-AGGGATGTGGACAGCTTGAC-3′. The reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 15 min to activate the polymerase, followed by amplification at 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 20 s for 45 cycles. After PCR, melting curves were acquired by stepwise increases in the temperature from 65 to 95 °C to ensure that a single product was amplified in the reaction. The results are expressed as the ratio to input DNA. Samples are the means from at least three independent immunoprecipitations. Sequential ChIP Analysis—The chromatin extraction and the first immunoprecipitation were performed as described in the previous paragraph. The immunoprecipitated samples were incubated for 5 min at 65 °C in elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS), and the supernatants were used for a second immunoprecipitation. siRNA Preparation and Transfection—siRNA corresponding to human TRB3 mRNA (5′-CGCUGACCGUGAGAGGAAGdTdT-3′ and 5′-CUUCCUCUCACGGUCAGCGdTdT-3′) were designed. A control siRNA (5′-CGCUGACCGUGAAAGAAAGdTdT-3′ and 5′-CUUUCUUUCACGGUCAGCGdTdT-3′) was used as a negative control. siRNA experiments were performed as described previously (17Averous J. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Thiel G. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5288-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected 24 h later with 2 μg of siRNA and 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid when applicable, using the calcium phosphate precipitation. 24 h post-transfection, cells are incubated in either DMEM or leucine-free DMEM for 4 or 16 h then harvested either for luciferase assays or for analysis of gene expression using qRT-PCR, as described above. Microarray Experiments—Total RNA from either MEFs cells (ATF4+/+ or ATF4-/- cells), parental cell line or tet-TRB3myc cells were isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cRNA targets were synthesized and hybridized according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent). Mouse microarrays were provided from Réseau National des Génopoles (Evry, France) and human microarrays were from Agilent Technology. The slides were scanned with an Affimetrix 428 scanner (Affimetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using appropriate gains on the photomultiplier (PMT) to obtain the highest intensity without saturation. Gene expression values were background corrected and normalized using the Genepix software and Lowess normalization. We used a Student's t test with Bonferroni adjustment (with a p value of <0.01) and a ratio cut-off of >2 to identify genes differentially expressed by leucine starvation in ATF4+/+ and tet-TRB3myc cells. TRB3 Induction following Amino Acid Starvation Is ATF4-dependent—To better define the role of the GCN2/ATF4 pathway, we screened genes induced by amino acid starvation. In our experimental conditions, TRB3 has been identified as the most induced transcript following amino acid starvation (data not shown). To better characterize the regulation of TRB3 by amino acid starvation, we first analyzed the kinetic of TRB3 expression in response to leucine starvation. Wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were incubated in either DMEM (control medium) or leucine-free DMEM (leucine-free medium) for 1-8 h and the protein level of TRB3 was measured by Western blot. TRB3 was not detected in control cells but was induced following a leucine starvation for 2-8 h (Fig. 1A). TRB3 induction by amino acid starvation is not restricted to MEF cells nor to leucine starvation since it was observed in different cell lines and for different essential amino acids limitation (data not shown). The expression of TRB3 protein was delayed compared with that of ATF4, consistent with the hypothesis that TRB3 is downstream of ATF4. To investigate the dependence of TRB3 toward ATF4, the TRB3 mRNA level was measured by quantitative RT-PCR after leucine starvation, in ATF4+/+ or ATF4-/- MEFs (Fig. 1B). TRB3 mRNA accumulation was detectable as soon as 1 h after leucine starvation in ATF4+/+ cells and reached a plateau after 2 h. In ATF4-/- cells, the steady state level of TRB3 mRNA was undetectable, furthermore no induction was observed following leucine starvation. Because TRB3 induction following amino acid starvation was found to be entirely ATF4-dependent, we checked whether another stress known to induce ATF4, was also able to induce TRB3. For that purpose ATF4+/+ or ATF4-/- MEFs were treated for 4 h with 200 nm thapsigargin, a drug causing an ER stress. Thapsigargin also strongly induced TRB3 mRNA in ATF4+/+ cells whereas no induction was observed in ATF4-/- cells (Fig. 1C). Overexpression of TRB3 Inhibits CHOP and ASNS Induction by Leucine Starvation—Ord et al. (21Ord D. Ord T. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 286: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have shown that TRB3 interacts with ATF4 and inhibits ATF4 transcriptional activity measured by using reporter gene assays. To investigate the role of TRB3 on the regulation of gene expression by amino acid starvation, a TRB3-inducible cell line was generated. HeLa cells expressing the Tet-repressor were transfected with a plasmid (pCDNA4.TO.TRB3-FL.Myc.6xHIS) containing an in-frame C-terminal fusion of human TRB3 with a peptide encoding the c-myc epitope and a polyhistidine (His6) tag, driven by a hybrid promoter consisting of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV) promoter and tetracycline operator 2 (TetO2) sites. The Zeocin-resistant stable cell line obtained was subsequently named “tet-TRB3myc” cell line. Tet-TRB3myc cell line and its parental counterpart were pretreated or not for 16 h with 0.1 μm tetracycline and then incubated in either control or leucine-free medium for 4 h. A Western blot analysis showed that a Myc-tagged-TRB3 was strongly expressed following a tetracycline treatment in the presence or absence of leucine in the tet-TRB3myc cell line, whereas no tagged protein was observed in the parental cell line (Fig. 2A). Because tetracycline could interfere with the protein synthesis machinery, we made sure that 0.1 μm tetracycline for 16 h did not affect ATF4 expression in both parental and tet-TRB3myc cells. Finally, using an antibody specific for human TRB3, we showed that the level of TRB3-Myc overexpression upon tetracycline induction and the endogenous TRB3 level observed after amino acid starvation were expressed at the same magnitude (data not shown). This observation indicates that the effects of TRB3 induction are physiologic and not pharmacologic. To determine whether TRB3 could affect the induction of genes known to be induced by amino acid starvation in a GCN2/ATF4-dependent way, we measured, by quantitative RT-PCR, CHOP and ASNS mRNA levels in tet-TRB3myc cells. In the experiment described in Fig. 2B, tet-TRB3myc cells were pretreated or not for 16 h with 0.1 μm tetracycline and then incubated in either control or leucine-free medium for 1-8 h. We found that CHOP mRNA was induced up to 9-fold following leucine starvation in untreated cells, whereas in cells treated with tetracycline (i.e. overexpressing TRB3), the induction by leucine starvation was strongly reduced (induction ratio <3). The results were even clearer for ASNS mRNA, whose induction by leucine starvation was completely abolished by TRB3 overexpression. This difference in sensitivity toward TRB3 between CHOP and ASNS could be explained by the existence of other mechanisms that may regulate CHOP expression in response to leucine starvation (i.e. mRNA stabilization) (15Bruhat A.

https://openalex.org/W1991505929,"Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, causes severe motor impairment due to loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). MPTP, a neurotoxin that causes dopaminergic cell loss in mice, was used in an animal model to study the pathogenic mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. We observed the activation of apoptosis signal regulating kinase (ASK1, MAPKKK) and phosphorylation of its downstream targets MKK4 and JNK, 12 h after administration of a single dose of MPTP. Further, Daxx, the death-associated protein, translocated to the cytosol selectively in SNpc neurons seemingly due to MPTP mediated down-regulation of DJ-1, the redox-sensitive protein that binds Daxx in the nucleus. Coadministration of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a thiol antioxidant, abolished the activation of ASK1 and phosphorylation of downstream kinases, MKK4, and JNK and prevented the down-regulation of DJ-1 and translocation of Daxx to the cytosol seen after MPTP. ALA also attenuated dopaminergic cell loss in SNpc seen after subchronic MPTP treatment. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that MPTP triggers death signaling pathway by activating ASK1 and translocating Daxx, in vivo, in dopaminergic neurons in SNpc of mice and thiol antioxidants, such as ALA terminate this cascade and afford neuroprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2102972654,"In neural integrators, transient inputs are accumulated into persistent firing rates that are a neural correlate of short-term memory. Integrators often contain two opposing cell populations that increase and decrease sustained firing as a stored parameter value rises. A leading hypothesis for the mechanism of persistence is positive feedback through mutual inhibition between these opposing populations. We tested predictions of this hypothesis in the goldfish oculomotor velocity-to-position integrator by measuring the eye position and firing rates of one population, while pharmacologically silencing the opposing one. In complementary experiments, we measured responses in a partially silenced single population. Contrary to predictions, induced drifts in neural firing were limited to half of the oculomotor range. We built network models with synaptic-input thresholds to demonstrate a new hypothesis suggested by these data: mutual inhibition between the populations does not provide positive feedback in support of integration, but rather coordinates persistent activity intrinsic to each population."

https://openalex.org/W2029295641,"The dual-function phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is the second most frequently mutated gene in human cancers. PTEN counteracts the functions of many growth factors, the most prevalent of which is insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). PTEN expression is stimulated by IGF-II forming a feedback loop. Investigating IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) modulation of IGF-II actions on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we found that IGFBP-2 also regulates PTEN. The MCF-7 cells were not responsive to high doses of IGF-II due to induction of PTEN, which was not observed with an IGF-II-analog that does not bind to IGFBPs or in the presence of an inhibitor that prevents IGFs associating with IGFBPs. These cells predominantly produce IGFBP-2: blocking IGFBP-2 with a specific antibody, or preventing IGFBP-2 binding to integrins, restored the induction of PTEN and the cells were non-responsive to high doses of the IGF-II-analog. Our findings indicate that breast cancer cells do not respond to high doses of IGF-II due to induction of PTEN, but IGFBP-2, when free from IGF-II can suppress PTEN. Levels of IGFBP-2 are elevated frequently in human tumors: its ability to regulate PTEN could have important implications in relation to therapeutic strategies targeting growth factor pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2091724686,"The prometastatic oncogene synuclein-γ (SNCG) is not expressed in normal lung tissues, but it is highly expressed in lung tumors. Here, we show that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) has strong inducing effects on SNCG gene expression in A549 lung cancer cells through demethylation of SNCG CpG island. CSE treatment also augments the invasive capacity of A549 cells in an SNCG-dependent manner. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the demethylating effects of CSE, we examined expression levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), 1, 3A and 3B in CSE-treated cells. We show that the mRNA expression of DNMT3B is specifically downregulated by CSE with a kinetics concurrent to SNCG reexpression. Utilizing siRNA to knockdown DNMT3B expression, we show that inhibition of DNMT3B directly increases SNCG mRNA expression. We further show that exogenous overexpression of DNMT3B in an SNCG-positive lung cancer cell line H292 suppresses SNCG mRNA and protein expression and induces de novo methylation of SNCG CpG island, whereas overexpression of DNMT1 or DNMT3A has no effects. Taken together, these new findings demonstrate that tobacco exposure induces the abnormal expression of SNCG in lung cancer cells through downregulation of DNMT3B. This work sheds light on the molecular understanding of demethylation of this oncogene during cancer progression."

https://openalex.org/W2015507005,"Commonly used drugs for the treatment of breast cancer patients like paclitaxel and Herceptin often show severe side effects or induce resistance in clinical settings. Thus, we analysed a combination of Plk1 (polo-like kinase 1)-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), a powerful tool to induce ‘mitotic catastrophe’ in cancer cells, together with these drugs to identify conditions for enhanced drug sensitivity. After transfection, the antineoplastic agents were added and cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in breast cancer cells (MCF-7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-435 and BT-474) and in primary human mammary epithelial cells were determined. Downregulation of cellular Plk1 levels led to an elevated percentage of cells in G2/M phase. The percentage of apoptotic nuclei in MCF-7, MDA-MB-435, SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells was clearly increased after incubation with Plk1-specific siRNAs and paclitaxel. Interestingly, the caspase pathway was activated after treatment with Plk1-specific siRNAs and paclitaxel or Herceptin. Treatment of breast cancer cells with siRNAs targeting Plk1 improved the sensitivity toward paclitaxel and Herceptin in a synergistic manner. In all experiments, very low concentrations across a wide range of clinically relevant concentrations were sufficient to induce an antiproliferative effect. The combination of Plk1-specific siRNAs with modern breast cancer drugs seems to represent rational combinations to be tested in preclinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2078312326,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) enzymes are overexpressed during inflammation and multistage tumor progression in many neoplastic disorders including lung, breast and pancreatic cancers. Here we report that the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is oxidized and inactivated during arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism in pancreatic cancer cell lines expressing COX-2 or 5-LOX. Oxidation of PTEN decreases its phosphatase activity, favoring increased phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate production, activation of Akt and phosphorylation of downstream Akt targets including GSK-3beta and S6K. These effects are recapitulated with pancreatic phospholipase A(2), which hydrolyses the release of membrane-bound AA. Interference with PTEN's physiological antagonism of signals from growth factors, insulin and oncogenes may confer risk for hypertrophic or neoplastic diseases associated with chronic inflammation or unwarranted oxidative metabolism of essential fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2126801248,"The orthosteric agonist neurokinin A (NKA) interacts with the tachykinin NK2 receptors (NK2Rs) via an apparent sequential binding process, which stabilizes the receptor in at least two different active conformations (A1L and A2L). The A1L conformation exhibits fast NKA dissociation kinetics and triggers intracellular calcium elevation; the A2L conformation exhibits slow NKA dissociation kinetics and triggers cAMP production. The new compound LPI805 is a partial and noncompetitive inhibitor of NKA binding to NK2Rs. Analysis of NKA dissociation in the presence of LPI805 suggests that LPI805 decreases the number of NKA-NK2R complexes in A2L conformation while increasing those in the A1L conformation. Analysis of signaling pathways of NK2Rs shows that LPI805 dramatically inhibits the NKA-induced cAMP response while slightly enhancing the NKA-induced calcium response. Analysis of NKA association kinetics reveals that LPI805 promotes strong and specific destabilization of the NKA-NK2R complexes in the A2L conformation whereas access of NKA to the A1L conformations is unchanged. Thus, to our knowledge, LPI805 is the first example of a conformation-specific allosteric antagonist of a G-protein-coupled receptor. This work establishes the use of allosteric modulators in order to promote functional selectivity on certain agonist-receptor interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2021935142,"Embryonic stem (ES) cells are self-renewing, pluripotent cell lines, characterized by their potential to differentiate into all cell types. The proto-oncogene product c-Myc has a crucial role in the self-renewal of mouse ES (mES) cells, but its role in human ES (hES) cells is unknown. To investigate c-Myc functions in hES cells, we expressed an inducible c-Myc fused to the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (c-MycER) protein that is activated by 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. In contrast to its role in mES cells, activation of c-MycER in hES cells induced apoptosis and differentiation into extraembryonic endoderm and trophectoderm lineages concomitant with reduced expression of the pluripotent markers Oct4 and Nanog. Neither inhibition of caspase activity nor knockdown of p53 by RNA interference impaired the induction of differentiation markers induced by c-Myc activation. In addition, differentiation induced by c-Myc activation was associated with downregulation of α6 integrin expression, suggesting an important role for the integrin/extracellular matrix interaction in the regulation of ES cell behavior. None of these effects occurred with deletion of the c-Myc transactivation domain, indicating that c-Myc promotes both apoptosis and differentiation in a transcriptional activity-dependent manner. Together, our results provide new insights into the c-Myc functions regulating hES cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2147760284,"Atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) regulate apical-basal polarity in Drosophila and mammalian epithelia. At the apical domain, aPKC phosphorylates and displaces Lgl that, in turn, maintains aPKC inactive at the basolateral region. The mutual exclusion of these two proteins seems to be crucial for the correct epithelial structure and function. Here we show that a cortical aPKC loading induces Lgl cytoplasmic release and massive overgrowth in Drosophila imaginal epithelia, whereas a cytoplasmic expression does not alter proliferation and epithelial overall structure. As two aPKC isoforms (iota and zeta) exist in humans and we previously showed that Drosophila Lgl is the functional homologue of the Human giant larvae-1 (Hugl-1) protein, we argued if the same mechanism of mutual exclusion could be impaired in human epithelial disorders and investigated aPKCiota, aPKCzeta and Hugl-1 localization in cancers deriving from ovarian surface epithelium. Both in mucinous and serous histotypes, aPKCzeta showed an apical-to-cortical redistribution and Hugl-1 showed a membrane-to-cytoplasm release, perfectly recapitulating the Drosophila model. Although several recent works support a causative role for aPKCiota overexpression in human carcinomas, our results suggest a key role for aPKCzeta in apical-basal polarity loosening, a mechanism that seems to be driven by changes in protein localization rather than in protein abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2038504509,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, acetylation of lysine 56 (Lys-56) in the globular domain of histone H3 plays an important role in response to genotoxic agents that interfere with DNA replication. However, the regulation and biological function of this modification are poorly defined in other eukaryotes. Here we show that Lys-56 acetylation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe occurs transiently during passage through S-phase and is normally removed in G2. Genotoxic agents that cause DNA double strand breaks during replication elicit a delay in deacetylation of histone H3 Lys-56. In addition, mutant cells that cannot acetylate Lys-56 are acutely sensitive to genotoxic agents that block DNA replication. Moreover, we show that Spbc342.06cp, a previously uncharacterized open reading frame, encodes the functional homolog of S. cerevisiae Rtt109, and that this protein acetylates H3 Lys-56 both in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, our results indicate that both the regulation of histone H3 Lys-56 acetylation by its histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase and its role in the DNA damage response are conserved among two distantly related yeast model organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1997065981,"Signal regulatory protein (SIRP) alpha is a membrane receptor that sends inhibitory signals to myeloid cells by engagement of CD47. The high resolution x-ray structure of the N-terminal ligand binding domain shows it to have a distinctive immunoglobulin superfamily V-like fold. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that CD47 is bound at a surface involving the BC, FG, and DE loops, which distinguishes it from other immunoglobulin superfamily surface proteins that use the faces of the fold, but resembles antigen receptors. The SIRP interaction is confined to a single domain, and its use of an extended DE loop strengthens the similarity with T cell receptor binding and the suggestion that they are closely related in evolution. The employment of loops to form the CD47-binding surface provides a mechanism for small sequence changes to modulate binding specificity, explaining the different binding properties of SIRP family members."

Here, we show that p68 is modified in vivo on a single site (K53) by the small ubiquitin-like modifier-2 (SUMO-2). We demonstrate that the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 interacts with p68 and enhances its SUMO modification in vivo. To determine the functional consequences of SUMO modification, we compared the transcriptional activity of p68 and a K53R mutant that could not be SUMO-modified. Our data show that SUMO modification enhances p68 transcriptional repression activity and inhibits the ability of p68 to function as a coactivator of p53. These findings may be explained by the ability of wild type, but not K53R p68, to alter the modification state of chromatin by recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)."

To ensure stable membrane growth, energy-independent flippases mediate rapid, bidirectional, and rather unspecific phospholipid flip-flop with half-times of minutes or less (4Bishop W.R. Bell R.M.

A similar flippase activity was also found in the bacterial inner membrane, where lipid synthesis occurs likewise at the cytoplasmic leaflet (8Hrafnsdóttir S. Nichols J.W. Menon A.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4969-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Techniques to determine transbilayer phospholipid movement as well as the activity of flippases have been critically evaluated (9Devaux P.F. Fellmann P. Hervé P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 116: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Spin-labeled and fluorescent lipid analogues have provided much insight into protein-mediated transbilayer dynamics of phospholipids (9Devaux P.F. Fellmann P. Hervé P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 116: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the bulky reporter moieties may affect the absolute values of transbilayer lipid movement.An alternative approach to characterize flip-flop is based on shape changes of deflated, prolate giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) (10Mui B.L. Döbereiner H.G. Madden T.D. Cullis P.R. Biophys J. 1995; 69: 930-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which do not require labeled lipid analogues. Shape transitions can be triggered by a very small excess of lipid in one monolayer (11López-Montero I. Rodriguez N. Cribier S. Pohl A. Velez M. Devaux P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25811-25819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Berndl K. Käs J. Lipowsky R. Sackmann E. Seifert U. Europhys.

Yamashita Y. Yamazaki M. Langmuir. 2004; 20: 9526-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For example, unlabeled lipids were inserted into the external leaflet of GUVs made of egg-PC (11López-Montero I. Rodriguez N. Cribier S. Pohl A. Velez M. Devaux P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25811-25819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because of the low compressibility of lipid monolayers, the asymmetric lipid supply creates a surface area difference between the two leaflets, which in turn results in formation of a bud-like structure (Fig. 1A). If lipids (e.g. lyso-PC, LPC) that are known to undergo a very slow flip-flop similar to that of egg-PC were added, the bud was stable, whereas if the added lipids (e.g. ceramide) were able to rapidly redistribute between the two membrane leaflets, the initial bud formation was reversible, and the prolate shape was recovered (11López-Montero I. Rodriguez N. Cribier S. Pohl A. Velez M. Devaux P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25811-25819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This can be explained by a relaxation of the monolayer area difference due to the transbilayer equilibration of the inserted lipids. The time dependence of shape changes could be used for derivation of the flip-flop rate constant.Here we demonstrate by reconstitution of yeast ER flippase activity into GUVs that dynamics of GUV shape changes can serve as a tool for quantitative characterization of the lipid transport activity of flippases (Fig. 1B). In this case the characteristic time of the sequential shape transformation of protein-containing GUVs is on the order of flip-flop of spin-labeled and fluorescent phospholipid analogues found previously in microsomes (7Marx U. Lassmann G. Holzhütter H.G. Wüstner D. Müller P. Höhlig A. Kubelt J. Herrmann A. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2628-2640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The major advantage of this approach compared with the previous ones is the use of unlabeled lipids, which allows avoiding possible artifacts related to the utilization of lipid analogues with bulky reporter moieties (9Devaux P.F. Fellmann P. Hervé P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 116: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Egg l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (egg-LPC), egg phosphatidylcholine (egg-PC), egg phosphatidylethanolamine (egg-PE), and dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (PG) were from Sigma-Aldrich. 1-Acyl-2-hexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phoshatidylcholine (C6-acyl-PC) was synthesized from egg-PC (15Fellmann P. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 27: 161-175PubMed Google Scholar). C6-ceramide, C16-ceramide, and galactosylceramide were synthesized according to López-Montero et al. (11López-Montero I. Rodriguez N. Cribier S. Pohl A. Velez M. Devaux P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25811-25819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). 7-Diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM), BODIPY FLC5-PC and -Cer were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions—The yeast strain sec61 (MATα ura3-52 leu2-3-112 ade2-10 sec61ts) obtained from J. Holthuis (University Utrecht, The Netherlands) was used. Microsomal membranes containing a green fluorescent protein-tagged transmembrane domain linked to carboxypeptidase yscY (for details, see Ref. 16Taxis C. Hitt R. Park S.H. Deak P.M. Kostova Z. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35903-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) were derived from W303-1C Δder3 (MATα ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 can1-100 prc1-1, Δder3::HIS3) harboring the plasmid pMA1 (kindly provided by D. Wolf, University Stuttgart, Germany). Strains were grown at 27 °C in liquid YPD medium (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone (Difco, 2% glucose). The strain W303-1C Δder3 harboring pMA1 was grown in the absence of uracil in synthetic complete medium with 2% glucose at 27 °C. Cells were harvested in the exponential phase, and growth was monitored by A600.Microsome Preparation—Microsomes were prepared essentially according to Zinser and Daum (17Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pretreated with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm Tris sulfate (pH 9.4) for 10 min, incubated with Zymolyase-100T (ICN Biomedicals, Eschwege, Germany) at 5 mg/g of cells (wet weight) in buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1.2 m sorbitol) at 30 °C for 30 min, harvested, and then lysed in homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.6 m sorbitol) containing protease inhibitors (1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 5 mg/ml antipain, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a Dounce homogenizer with a tight-fitting pestle. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in homogenizing buffer, homogenized, and centrifuged as above. Both supernatants were pooled. Membrane pellets from differential centrifugation (9,000 × g for 10 min, 20,000 × g for 30 min, 40,000 × g for 30 min, 100,000 × g for 45-75 min) were screened for organelle marker proteins by immunoblotting. The green fluorescent protein-tagged ER membrane protein became enriched in the 40,000 × g fraction. Pellets of 40,000 × g and 100,000 × g enriched in ER membrane proteins were resuspended in buffer T (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA) using a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer and stored at -80 °C. If not stated otherwise, the 100,000 × g fraction was used for further preparation of proteoliposomes.Preparation of Proteoliposomes—Microsomal fractions (20 mg/ml protein) were solubilized by diluting half with 1.6% (w/v) Triton X-100 (Roche Diagnostics) in buffer T. After incubation for 45 min on ice, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (177,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatant is designated as Triton extract (TE). For reconstitution, egg-PC in chloroform was dried under nitrogen in a glass tube and then dissolved in buffer TX (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.8% w/v Triton X-100) to a final concentration of 4.5 mm. Various amounts of TE were added to generate proteoliposomes with different lipid/protein ratios. Protein-free liposomes were prepared similarly by substituting buffer for TE. To remove detergent and generate vesicles, 100 mg of SM2 BioBeads (Bio-Rad) per 1 ml of solution were added. After 3-4 h rotating at room temperature (RT), the samples were supplemented with an additional 200 mg/ml of BioBeads and transferred to 4 °C for further 14-16 h of mixing. Turbid suspensions were withdrawn, carefully avoiding collection of any beads, and adjusted to an 8-10-fold excess of buffer T. The vesicles were collected by centrifugation (200,000 × g, 50 min, 4 °C) and resuspended at 9 mm phospholipid using a Dounce homogenizer. Protein recovery in the reconstituted vesicles was about 30-45%; lipid recovery was about 90%. More than 99.9% of the original Triton X-100 was removed, as determined by extraction with four volumes of chloroform/methanol (1/2, v/v) and subsequent measurement of the supernatant at A275.To label microsomal proteins before reconstitution, 450 μl of TE (0.9 mg protein) were mixed with 20 μl of a 10 mm Me2SO solution of the thiol-reactive fluorescent probe CPM and incubated at 4 °C overnight in the dark. Unbound label was removed by dialysis. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and thin layer chromatography demonstrated that at this temperature only proteins but no membrane lipids became labeled (data not shown).Virosome Preparation—Virosomes were prepared from influenza viruses (strain X31) essentially as described for proteoliposomes. A mixture of virosomal TE, Triton X-100-solubilized egg-PC, and egg-PE (14.75/0.275, w/w) was used for reconstitution at lipid/protein ratio of 20 (w/w). To visualize reconstitution of viral proteins, viruses were preincubated for 2 h at RT in the dark with CPM, added from 5 mm Me2SO stock to molar excess of 10 over hemagglutinin. To remove uncoupled CPM, labeled viruses were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and harvested by centrifugation at 45,000 × g. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that only influenza virus hemagglutinin was labeled (data not shown).Preparation of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles—GUVs were generated from proteoliposomes by the electroformation technique in a chamber made of indium-tin-oxide-coated glass slides at RT (18Angelova M. Soleau S. Meleard P. Faucon J.F. Bothorel P. Prog. Colloid. Polym. Sci. 1992; 89: 127-131Crossref Google Scholar, 19Mathivet L. Cribier S. Devaux P.F. Biophys.

J. 2004; 87: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The oscillating electric field that was applied only during GUV formation did not affect the activity of membrane proteins (20Girard P. Pécréaux J. Lenoir G. Falson P. Rigaud J-L. Bassereau P. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For GUVs consisting only of lipids, 70 μl of lipid solution in chloroform (0.25 mg/ml) were deposited in small droplets onto each slide. Subsequently, solvent was evaporated in a desiccator (10 mbar) for 60 min at RT. To prepare GUVs with reconstituted proteins according to Girard et al. (20Girard P. Pécréaux J. Lenoir G. Falson P. Rigaud J-L. Bassereau P. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), proteoliposomes were diluted with distilled water to 0.4 - 0.8 mg/ml lipid, and 25-50 μl of this suspension was deposited onto each glass slide in small droplets. To avoid denaturation, proteoliposomes were dehydrated only partially by placing glass slides in a sealed chamber containing a saturated NaCl solution. After overnight incubation a film had formed on the glass slides.Subsequently, the chamber was assembled by sealing both glass slides with silicon paste. The sucrose solution (250 mm sucrose, 0.02% NaN3) was injected with a syringe (about 1 ml) through a micropore filter immediately before connecting the completely sealed chamber to the generator. The voltage of the applied AC-field was increased stepwise every 6 min from 20 mV up to 1.1 V while continuously increasing the frequency from 4 to 10 Hz within the first minute. The AC field was applied for 3-12 h. To complete the procedure voltage was raised to 1.3 V, and the frequency was lowered to 4 Hz for 1 h. The chamber was then stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C.Observation and Analysis of GUV Shape Changes—Spherical GUVs cannot undergo shape changes due to the minimized surface to volume ratio. Therefore, deflated vesicles appropriate for shape change studies (11López-Montero I. Rodriguez N. Cribier S. Pohl A. Velez M. Devaux P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25811-25819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) were achieved osmotically by transferring 10-50 μl of GUVs into 150 μl of a glucose solution (275 mm glucose, 0.02% Na3) on a microscope slide and allowing water to evaporate for 30-60 min at room temperature. To prolate GUVs, lipids that are known to incorporate rapidly into lipid bilayers were added. Typically, 10 μl of 0.1 mm lipid (typically egg-LPC) in glucose solution was injected (representing time zero in the shape changes analysis). The time points t1 (begin of budding transition) and t2 (begin of bud retraction) were measured by microscopic observation of GUV shapes for each experiment (see “Results”). All experiments were performed at room temperature. To determine the amount of lipid incorporated into GUVs, we used radioactive l-lyso-3-phosphatidylcholine,1-[1-14C]palmitoyl (CFA633, Amersham Biosciences). 50 μl of GUVs were transferred to a microscope slide, and 150 μl of a glucose solution (275 mm glucose, 0.02% NaN3) was added. After GUVs settled, radioactive lipids were added, and the suspension was incubated for up to 2 h. Subsequently, aliquots from the supernatant were taken, and radioactivity was measured.Miscellaneous—Protein content was quantified after TCA precipitation using micro-BCA Protein Assay reagent (Pierce) and BSA as a standard. Phospholipid content was determined by extracting lipids according to Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and measuring the amount of phospholipid phosphorus (22Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar).RESULTSShape Changes of Protein-free GUVs—Insertion of unlabeled lipids such as egg-LPC, C6-acyl-PC, or C6-ceramide into the external leaflet of GUVs made of egg-PC resulted in formation of a bud-like structure (Figs. 1A and 2). If egg-LPC or C6-acyl-PC, which are known to undergo a very slow flip-flop like egg-PC, was added, the bud was stable (Fig. 2). Whereas if lipids were added that rapidly redistribute between the two membrane leaflets, e.g. ceramide, the initial bud was reversible, and the prolate shape was recovered (11López-Montero I. Rodriguez N. Cribier S. Pohl A. Velez M. Devaux P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25811-25819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This can be explained by a decline in the monolayer area difference due to the transbilayer equilibration of inserted lipids. Bud formation was also reversible when egg-LPC was added to egg-PC GUVs containing already a lipid that flips rapidly, such as the long chain C16-ceramide (5 mol %) (not shown). When ceramide was replaced by the slow flipping galactosylceramide, the prolate shape was not recovered after 1 h. The experiments with ceramide and egg-LPC prove that the transversal diffusion of an unlabeled lipid with a fast flip-flop rate can be measured in GUVs even disregarding the flipping ability of the added lipid. However, this conclusion may not be generalized. Although cholesterol is known to flip rapidly across the lipid bilayer (23Leventis R. Silvius J.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2257-2267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 24John K. Kubelt J. Müller P. Wüstner D. Herrmann A. Biophys.

J. 1996; 70: 1112-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) did not observe retraction of the initial bud formation when egg-LPC was added to egg-PC GUVs containing up to 23 mol % of cholesterol. A possible explanation could be that transbilayer redistribution of cholesterol cannot compensate for area asymmetry due its specific molecular properties, e.g. it is known that cholesterol cannot form bilayers.FIGURE 2Shape transition of egg-PC GUVs upon the addition of egg-LPC. Insertion of egg-LPC into the outer leaflet caused the formation of a stable bud that did not retract in the time course of the experiment (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To substantiate our conclusions on lipid translocation drawn from GUV shapes, we chose further processes exploiting microscopic visualization of GUV behavior. First, Cullis and co-workers (Ref. 25Hope M.J. Redelmeier T.E. Wong K.F. Rodrigueza W. Cullis P.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4181-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and publications cited therein) demonstrated that pH gradients influence the distribution of charged phospholipids as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) across the membrane of unilamellar 100-nm vesicles. Using various assays they could prove that PG flips rapidly in its neutral form, whereas it is sequestered within one membrane leaflet in the case of deprotonation in contact with basic environment. Thereby, arising transversal asymmetry could clearly be related to membrane curvature and molecule balance between the leaflets in GUVs (13Farge E. Devaux P.F. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 347-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). When prolate GUVs from egg-PC containing 1 mol % of dioleoyl-PG are exposed to an increased pH (from pH 7 to 9) in the surrounding medium by the addition of NaOH, spontaneous migration of PG from the inner leaflet (pH 7) to the exterior (pH 9) results in relative immobilization due to their acquired head-group charge. The excess molecules account for an area imbalance that is apparent from an instantaneous budding transition (Fig. 3A). The connecting neck is progressively elongated during the following minutes, eventually forming a tether with a highly mobile daughter vesicle (see the change of focus to resolve both structures in last images of series). Control GUVs from egg-PC maintain their prolate shapes for more than 10 min (not shown). By a second independent approach we proved directly that shape changes indeed correlate with the transbilayer distribution of externally added lipids using BODIPY-labeled PC and Cer (see supplemental Fig. 1). Quantification of the fluorescent fraction on the inner surface of the membrane, as determined by protection from trypan blue quenching, is displayed in Fig. 3B. BODIPY-PC proves to be confined essentially to the outer leaflet, whereas the distribution of the Cer analogue resembles that of GUVs prepared with a symmetric BODIPY-PC distribution between both leaflets. We, therefore, conclude that lipid distribution affects the membrane curvature of GUVs, and its dynamics can be reliably visualized as shape changes.FIGURE 3Shape changes of GUVs correlate with transbilayer redistribution of lipids. A, shape changes with pH-induced flip-flop of phosphatidylglycerol. GUVs were prepared from egg-PC containing 1 mol % dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol. Shown is prolate GUV at pH 7 (a) subjected to pH increase (pH 9) by adding ∼10 μl of NaOH (0.5 n) to ∼400 μl of neutral glucose solution in the observation chamber (b). Phase contrast images are taken with respect to time of alkaline addition (0′00″); the bar corresponds to 10 μm. B, assessment of transbilayer distribution of BODIPY-PC and BODIPY-Cer after shape transitions. BODIPY-PC or -Cer were added to GUVs and incubated for 30 and 10 min, respectively. Subsequently, fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the quencher trypan blue (0.0075% w/v) were measured (as described in the supplemental data). Intensity in the absence of trypan blue was set to 1. For comparison, results for GUVs symmetrically labeled with BODIPY-PC are shown (BODIPY-PC*). Data shown are the means ± S.E. of four determinations. Note that fluorescence intensities in the presence of trypan blue do not correlate in a quantitative manner with transbilayer distribution of BODIPY-lipids. For that, higher concentrations of the quencher would be necessary. However, such concentrations affect the stability of the GUVs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Shape Changes of GUVs with Reconstituted ER Proteins—The flippase activity of yeast ER was first reconstituted into proteoliposomes as already described previously for rat liver (6Buton X.

Vehring, A. Herrmann, and T. Pomorski, unpublished data. Subsequently, GUVs were prepared from such proteoliposomes. No significant difference between the size of protein-free and protein-containing GUVs was found (not shown).When egg-LPC or C6-acyl-PC was added, reconstituted GUVs budded within the first 5 min after injection of lipids and subsequently regained the prolate shape within 5-10 min (Fig. 4). We conclude that the reconstituted ER flippase activity triggers the rapid flip-flop that diminishes the surface area difference between the two leaflets. To demonstrate that GUVs undergoing reversible shape changes contain ER proteins, we reconstituted the ER fraction from a yeast strain expressing an ER resident, green fluorescent protein-tagged membrane protein as well as prelabeled TE (supplemental Figs. 3 and 4).FIGURE 4Shape transition of GUVs prepared from proteoliposomes containing microsomal membrane proteins (100,000 × g fraction).

https://openalex.org/W1986187057,"Medulloblastoma, the most common brain tumor in childhood, appears to originate from cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs), located in the external granular layer (EGL) of the cerebellum. The antiproliferative gene PC3 (Tis21/BTG2) promotes cerebellar neurogenesis by inducing GCPs to shift from proliferation to differentiation. To assess whether PC3 can prevent the neoplastic transformation of GCPs and medulloblastoma development, we crossed transgenic mice conditionally expressing PC3 (TgPC3) in GCPs with Patched1 heterozygous mice (Ptc(+/-)), a model of medulloblastoma pathogenesis characterized by hyperactivation of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. Perinatal up-regulation of PC3 in Ptc(+/-)/TgPC3 mice results in a decrease of medulloblastoma incidence of approximately 40% and in a marked reduction of preneoplastic abnormalities, such as hyperplastic EGL areas and lesions. Moreover, overexpression of cyclin D1, hyperproliferation, and defective differentiation--observed in Ptc(+/-) GCPs--are restored to normality in Ptc(+/-)/TgPC3 mice. The PC3-mediated inhibition of cyclin D1 expression correlates with recruitment of PC3 to the cyclin D1 promoter, which is accompanied by histone deacetylation. Remarkably, down-regulation of PC3 is observed in preneoplastic lesions, as well as in human and murine medulloblastomas. As a whole, this indicates that PC3 may prevent medulloblastoma development by controlling cell cycle and promoting differentiation of GCPs."
https://openalex.org/W2069186426,"Prostaglandin E2 plays multiple roles both in the physiology and the physiopathology of human brain, which are not completely understood. We have identified in a subset of human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors, the most common form of adult brain cancer, an increased expression of mPGES-1, the enzyme which catalyses the isomerization of PGH2 into PGE2 downstream of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). The sensitivity of primary cultures of GBM to apoptosis was augmented by the overexpression of mPGES-1, whereas the knockdown of its expression by shRNA decreased the apoptotic threshold in vitro and stimulated tumor growth in vivo. Adding extracellular PGE2 in the culture medium failed to reproduce mPGES-1 effect on the cell viability in vitro. However, the intracellular injection of PGE2 induced a dose-dependent apoptosis in GBM cultures, which was dependent on the presence of Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein. We show that PGE2 physically associates with Bax, triggering its apoptotic-like change in conformation and its subsequent association with mitochondria. Our results raise questions about the role of PGE2 in the control of apoptosis and in its potential impact in central nervous system pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2035852204,"Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality with an annual death toll exceeding one million. Severe malaria is a complex multisystem disorder, including one or more of the following complications: cerebral malaria, anemia, acidosis, jaundice, respiratory distress, renal insufficiency, coagulation anomalies, and hyperparasitemia. Using a combined in vivo/in vitro metabolic-based approach, we investigated the putative pathogenic effects of Plasmodium berghei ANKA on brain, in a mouse strain developing malaria but resistant to cerebral malaria. The purpose was to determine whether the infection could cause a brain dysfunction distinct from the classic cerebral syndrome. Mice resistant to cerebral malaria were infected with P. berghei ANKA and explored during both the symptomless and the severe stage of the disease by using in vivo brain magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. The infected mice did not present the lesional and metabolic hallmarks of cerebral malaria. However, brain dysfunction caused by anemia, parasite burden, and hepatic damage was evidenced. We report an increase in cerebral blood flow, a process allowing temporary maintenance of oxygen supply to brain despite anemia. Besides, we document metabolic anomalies affecting choline-derived compounds, myo-inositol, glutamine, glycine, and alanine. The choline decrease appears related to parasite proliferation. Glutamine, myo-inositol, glycine, and alanine variations together indicate a hepatic encephalopathy, a finding in agreement with the liver damage detected in mice, which is also a feature of the human disease. These results reveal the vulnerability of brain to malaria infection at the severe stage of the disease even in the absence of cerebral malaria. Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality with an annual death toll exceeding one million. Severe malaria is a complex multisystem disorder, including one or more of the following complications: cerebral malaria, anemia, acidosis, jaundice, respiratory distress, renal insufficiency, coagulation anomalies, and hyperparasitemia. Using a combined in vivo/in vitro metabolic-based approach, we investigated the putative pathogenic effects of Plasmodium berghei ANKA on brain, in a mouse strain developing malaria but resistant to cerebral malaria. The purpose was to determine whether the infection could cause a brain dysfunction distinct from the classic cerebral syndrome. Mice resistant to cerebral malaria were infected with P. berghei ANKA and explored during both the symptomless and the severe stage of the disease by using in vivo brain magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. The infected mice did not present the lesional and metabolic hallmarks of cerebral malaria. However, brain dysfunction caused by anemia, parasite burden, and hepatic damage was evidenced. We report an increase in cerebral blood flow, a process allowing temporary maintenance of oxygen supply to brain despite anemia.

Glutamine, myo-inositol, glycine, and alanine variations together indicate a hepatic encephalopathy, a finding in agreement with the liver damage detected in mice, which is also a feature of the human disease. These results reveal the vulnerability of brain to malaria infection at the severe stage of the disease even in the absence of cerebral malaria. Malaria is one of the major tropical diseases. This parasitic infection results in 200 to 300 million clinical cases and 1 to 2 million deaths annually, mostly children under 5 and pregnant women in sub Saharan Africa (1Icke G. Davis R. McConnell W. PLoS Med. 2005; 2: e11Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 2Guerra C.A. Snow R.W. Hay S.I. Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 353-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium falciparum are the four species infecting humans. The latter one causes the most virulent and deadly infections (3Chang K.H. Stevenson M.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 1501-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Plasmodium life cycle includes firstly a non-pathogenic symptomless hepatocyte stage followed by a pathogenic red blood cell stage. Transmission via the bite of an infected female Anopheles species mosquito induces the hepatocyte stage; sporozoites invade hepatocytes, replicate, and produce merozoites, and these later initiate the red blood cell stage with invasion of red blood cells. During the red blood cell stage, clinical malaria may develop (4Malaguarnera L. Musumeci S. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2002; 2: 472-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The classic clinical presentation consists of fever accompanied by other symptoms such as headache, malaise, nausea, muscular pains, and mild diarrhea (5Lou J. Lucas R. Grau G.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14 (table of contents): 810-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A minority of cases progress toward a life-threatening condition due to complications, including severe anemia, acidosis, respiratory distress, jaundice, renal failure, and cerebral malaria (CM) 3The abbreviations used are: CM, cerebral malaria; ADC, apparent diffusion coefficient; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; BBB, blood-brain barrier; Cho, choline-containing compounds; Gd-DTPA, gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; γ-GT, γ-glutamyltransferase; Glx, glutamate plus glutamine; GPC, glycerophosphocholine; HP, hyperparasitized; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; MRS, magnetic resonance spectroscopy; NAA, N-acetylaspartate; NCM, non-cerebral malaria; PbA, P. berghei ANKA; PCr, phosphocreatine; CBF, cerebral blood flow; T, tesla; TE, time of echo; TR, time of repetition; S, sum of all metabolite signal areas. 3The abbreviations used are: CM, cerebral malaria; ADC, apparent diffusion coefficient; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; BBB, blood-brain barrier; Cho, choline-containing compounds; Gd-DTPA, gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; γ-GT, γ-glutamyltransferase; Glx, glutamate plus glutamine; GPC, glycerophosphocholine; HP, hyperparasitized; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; MRS, magnetic resonance spectroscopy; NAA, N-acetylaspartate; NCM, non-cerebral malaria; PbA, P. berghei ANKA; PCr, phosphocreatine; CBF, cerebral blood flow; T, tesla; TE, time of echo; TR, time of repetition; S, sum of all metabolite signal areas. (6Mackintosh C.L. Beeson J.G. Marsh K. Trends Parasitol. 2004; 20: 597-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The clinical course of CM, the most lethal complication of P. falciparum infection, is characterized by diffuse, potentially reversible encephalopathy associated with fitting and loss of consciousness (7Turner G. Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Together with CM, malarial anemia is a leading cause of mortality (3Chang K.H. Stevenson M.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 1501-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Its pathogenesis is complex and undoubtedly involves multiple processes related to both the destruction and the reduced production of red blood cells (6Mackintosh C.L. Beeson J.G. Marsh K. Trends Parasitol. 2004; 20: 597-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). P. berghei ANKA (PbA) is a widely recognized experimental model of malaria. Mice are infected with parasitized red blood cells to skip the hepatocyte stage of the parasite cycle. They directly undergo the red blood cell stage, which is the symptomatic stage. Infected mice develop a different syndrome depending on their genetic background (8Schofield L. Grau G.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 722-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Susceptible mice (CBA/J strain) develop an experimental cerebral syndrome and die approximately 1 week after the infection. On the contrary, resistant mice (BALB/c strain) do not present any apparent neurological signs and die of severe anemia during the third and fourth weeks (5Lou J. Lucas R. Grau G.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14 (table of contents): 810-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying this difference in susceptibility to CM remain to be elucidated (9de Kossodo S. Grau G.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4811-4820PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hansen D.S. Siomos M.A. Buckingham L. Scalzo A.A. Schofield L. Immunity. 2003; 18: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although CM occurs only with certain combinations of parasites and inbred mouse strains, anemia is a pathological feature of all rodent malarial infections (3Chang K.H. Stevenson M.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 1501-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Chang K.H. Tam M. Stevenson M.M. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Hunt N.H. Grau G.E. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 491-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We previously performed the first characterization of the experimental cerebral syndrome using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques (13Penet M.F. Viola A. Confort-Gouny S. Le Fur Y. Duhamel G. Kober F. Ibarrola D. Izquierdo M. Coltel N. Gharib B. Grau G.E. Cozzone P.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7352-7358Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We found that blood-brain barrier (BBB) rupture, major edema, and reduced brain perfusion were the main pathological features. Our findings demonstrated the coexistence of inflammatory and ischemic lesions and proved the preponderant role of edema in the fatal outcome of experimental CM (13Penet M.F. Viola A. Confort-Gouny S. Le Fur Y. Duhamel G. Kober F. Ibarrola D. Izquierdo M. Coltel N. Gharib B. Grau G.E. Cozzone P.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7352-7358Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Here, we were interested in examining the cerebral effects of PbA infection in a mouse strain (BALB/c) resistant to experimental CM. The purpose was to test the hypothesis that PbA infection could elicit brain dysfunction, despite the absence of experimental CM, and by mechanisms different from those involved in CM. We examined the brain of CM-resistant mice at day 8 post-infection, a time when susceptible mice develop the cerebral syndrome with the same parasitemia. In our previous study on CBA/j mice, we identified structural, functional, and metabolic markers characteristic of experimental CM. Here, we aimed at screening these pathological indicators in BALB/c mice to delineate the main differences in the cerebral response to the infection between these two strains. The mice explored at day 8 post-infection were referred to as “non-cerebral malaria” (NCM). Because BALB/c mice progressively develop severe anemia, we explored the impact of this complication on brain, by imaging mice at day 15 post-infection, a stage when hyperparasitized (HP) mice present anemia. We applied multimodal magnetic resonance techniques that provide non-invasive characterization of anatomic, structural, functional, and metabolic brain features. The in vivo metabolic study was completed by high resolution MRS analysis of brain extracts, a technique that gives access to a wider range of metabolites. Finally, taking into account that, during the blood stage of experimental malaria, although the parasite cannot invade hepatocytes as in humans, the infection induces liver injury (14Jacobs T. Plate T. Gaworski I. Fleischer B. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 972-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we investigated hepatic damages and their possible incidence on brain metabolism and function. Thirty female BALB/c mice from Charles River Laboratories (l’Arbresle, France) (8-10 week old, 20-25 g body weight) were maintained at 23-25 °C with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and had free access to food and water. Animal studies were in agreement with the French guidelines for animal care and approved by the local Committee on Ethics. Twenty mice were infected with PbA by intraperitoneal injection of 106 parasitized red blood cells. Parasitemia was determined on Giemsa-stained blood smears and was expressed as the percentage of parasitized red blood cells. Total red blood cell counts and hemoglobin levels were determined from heparinized blood. Hemoglobin levels were assessed in blood collected from healthy BALB/c and infected mice at 8 or 15 days post-infection. Blood was diluted in Drabkin's solution, and the optical density at 580 nm was measured. Hemoglobin level in blood was calculated using standard curves (Randox Kit, Mauguio, France). Biochemistry—Blood samples from control and infected mice were collected from retro-orbital plexus of isoflurane-anesthetized mice with capillaries containing heparin. Blood samples were centrifuged, and plasma was collected. Among indicators of hepatocellular integrity, the most commonly measured in clinical toxicology studies are the enzymatic activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), as well as the levels of ammonia and bilirubin. Analysis of AST, ALT, γ-GT, and ALP activities and measurement of total bilirubin and ammonia concentrations in serum were performed using the Beckman Synchron LX (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France). Enzymatic activities of AST, ALT, γ-GT, and ALP were obtained by colorimetric methods and were expressed as international units per liter. Serum concentrations of total bilirubin and ammonia were derived from a colorimetric method and expressed in micromolar. Histology—Livers from control and infected mice at 8 or 15 days post-infection were collected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm) were processed for hematoxylin-eosin staining. Slides were pictured using an Eclipse 800 microscope (Nikon, Champigny-sur-Marne, France) and a digital camera. The infected mice were explored at days 8 and 15 after infection, on a horizontal Bruker 47/30 AVANCE Biospec magnetic resonance system operating at 4.7 T (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) following a procedure previously described (13Penet M.F. Viola A. Confort-Gouny S. Le Fur Y. Duhamel G. Kober F. Ibarrola D. Izquierdo M. Coltel N. Gharib B. Grau G.E. Cozzone P.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7352-7358Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Animals were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (50-100 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (10-20 mg/kg body weight). The mice were placed in prone position in a cradle equipped with a stereotaxic holder and an integrated heating system that allowed the body temperature to be maintained at 36 ± 1 °C. MRI—T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted images were obtained with the following parameters: 15 contiguous slices; slice thickness, 0.7 mm; matrix, 256 × 256; and field of view, 25 × 25 mm2. Multislice axial T1-weighted images were acquired using a spin echo sequence (time of echo (TE), 15 ms; time of repetition (TR), 0.6 s; and 2 averages), before and after the injection of gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA, 1 ml/kg body weight, Schering, Levallois-Perret, France) in the caudal vein. Injection of Gd-DTPA was performed at the end of the MR protocol. Multislice axial and sagittal T2-weighted images were acquired with a spin echo sequence (TE, 40 ms; TR, 2.5 s; rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement factor 4; and 2 averages). Multislice axial T2*-weighted images were acquired with a gradient-echo sequence (TE, 17 ms; TR, 1 s; flip angle, 20°; and 3 averages). Multislice diffusion-weighted spin-echo segmented echoplanar imaging was used to map the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC, TE, 55 ms; TR, 3 s; 11 contiguous slices, slice thickness, 1 mm; matrix 128 × 128; field of view, 25 × 25 mm2; and 2 averages for each direction (x, y, and z)). Half-sine-shaped diffusion gradients were applied separately along x-, y-, and z-axis directions, with five increasing values of B-factor: 24.31, 388.99, 803.81, 1,367.55, and 1,969.27 s/mm2. Quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps were obtained with a Look-Locker arterial spin labeling technique based on flow-alternating inversion recovery (15Kober F. Iltis I. Izquierdo M. Desrois M. Ibarrola D. Cozzone P.J. Bernard M. Magn. Reson. Med. 2004; 51: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A series of 50 gradient echoes was acquired after each inversion pulse. The in-plane spatial resolution was 156 × 312 μm2; TE, 1.56 ms; slice thickness, 3 mm; matrix, 128 × 64; field of view, 25 × 25 mm2; and flip angle, 10°. Magnetic resonance angiography was performed on a vertical Bruker AVANCE 500WB wide-bore MR system operating at 11.75 T using a transmitter/receiver with a 2.5-mm diameter resonator. Angiograms were acquired with a three-dimensional gradient echo time of flight sequence (TR, 30 ms; TE, 3.6 ms; flip angle, 50°; matrix, 256 × 192 × 64; field of view, 18 × 12 × 9mm3; and 2 averages). MRS—Localized 1H MR spectra of brain were obtained at 4.7 T by using the point resolved spatially localized spectroscopy sequence (TE, 135 ms or TE, 16 ms; TR, 1.5 s; 256 averages; and 1,024 points). Water suppression was achieved using a “variable power radiofrequency pulses with optimized relaxation delays” sequence. The volume of interest (3.5 × 3.5 × 3.5 mm3) was positioned centrally on both hemispheres mainly in striatum and thalamus. At short TE (16 ms) the number of metabolite signals that can be detected is greater than at long TE (135 ms) due to a “T2 effect.” Indeed, brain metabolites are characterized by diverse longitudinal and transverse relaxation times (T1 and T2) that influence the intensity of the MR signal. During the TE, the transverse relaxation is responsible for an exponential decay of the MR signal with a time constant T2. Consequently, this signal will be “T2-weighted” according to the T2 values of the molecules. Because of these differences in the T2 relaxation time, certain metabolite signals are eliminated or too low to be resolved at long TE. Thus, spectra acquired at long TE present less signals when compared with those obtained at short TE. Although the T2 effect may be a source of discrepancies between results obtained at short and long TE, the acquisition of spectra at long TE is motivated by two important reasons: 1) the resulting simplification of the spectrum may facilitate the assignment of metabolites in spectral regions with overlapping signals and 2) long TE allow the unambiguous detection of lactate when present owing to its characteristic negative signal at 1.31 ppm. 31P MRS was performed at 4.7 T using a homemade surface coil (1-cm diameter) tuned to 31P (81.184 MHz) and positioned over the skull. The spectra were acquired with a one-pulse sequence (TR, 2 s; 1,024 averages; 1,024 points; and sweep width, 8 kHz). All MR data were processed under an interactive data language (IDL) environment (Interactive Data Language Research System, Boulder, CO) as previously described (13Penet M.F. Viola A. Confort-Gouny S. Le Fur Y. Duhamel G. Kober F. Ibarrola D. Izquierdo M. Coltel N. Gharib B. Grau G.E. Cozzone P.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7352-7358Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Saywell V. Viola A. Confort-Gouny S. Le Fur Y. Villard L. Cozzone P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). MRI Data—Brain, cerebellum, and ventricle (lateral and third ventricles) volumes were calculated from T1-weighted images. Cerebellar and ventricular fractions were calculated as the ratio between the volume of a given structure to the volume of brain (cerebrum and cerebellum). These ratios were expressed as percentages. Regional mean ADC values were evaluated as an average of pixel values in regions of interest in the cortex and the striatum. Perfusion post processing and CBF maps were done using a customized program under the IDL environment (15Kober F. Iltis I. Izquierdo M. Desrois M. Ibarrola D. Cozzone P.J. Bernard M. Magn. Reson. Med. 2004; 51: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), assuming a blood/tissue partition coefficient for water λ of 0.9 ml/g. T1 of blood was measured for each mouse in a large cerebral vessel. Blood T1 values are different in HP mice probably owing to the modification of blood properties due to the parasite. CBF values >8 ml/g/min were masked in the CBF map to exclude large vessels. Regional CBF was evaluated as an average of pixel values in regions of interest in the cortex and the striatum. Angiograms were produced by generating maximum intensity projections after interpolating raw data to obtain an isotropic resolution (588 μm3/pixel3). MRS Data—1H MRS data processing was performed as already described with an exponential filtering set to 4 Hz (17Viola A. Nicoli F. Denis B. Confort-Gouny S. Le Fur Y. Ranjeva J.P. Viout P. Cozzone P.J. Magma. 2004; 17: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Results were expressed as ratios of the relative area of each metabolite signal to the sum of all metabolite signal areas (S) detectable at each TE: S = N-acetylaspartate (NAA) + total creatine + choline-containing compounds (for spectra recorded with TE = 135 ms) and S = NAA + total creatine + choline-containing compounds + (glutamine + glutamate) (Glx) + myo-inositol + taurine (for spectra recorded with TE = 16 ms). 31P MRS data processing was as follows: after zero-filling (2048 points), the free induction decays were apodized with a line broadening of 15 Hz and Fourier-transformed. Zero-order phase correction was applied. The chemical shifts were referenced to phosphocreatine (PCr, -2.45 ppm). The signal amplitudes corresponding to PCr, inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphomonoesters, and α-, β-, and γ-ATP were calculated using the AMARES time-domain-fitting procedure. The chemical shift (δ) between Pi and PCr was used to calculate brain pH using: pH = 6.8 + log[(δ - 0.77)/(3.39 - δ)]. The metabolites were expressed as ratios of metabolites or as the ratio of each metabolite to the sum of all metabolites (Ptot). At the end of the in vivo exploration, while still anesthetized, mice were sacrificed and the brain was freeze-clamped. Tissues frozen in liquid nitrogen were pulverized and extracted with perchloric acid 6%. Whole brain extracts were homogenized and allowed to settle at 4 °C during 20 min. The samples were then centrifuged and neutralized with a solution of K2CO3 (2 m). The salts were removed by centrifugation, and the extracts were treated by a Chelex resin and subsequently lyophilized. Lyophilized samples were reconstituted in D2O 99.9% and 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid was used as an internal standard for chemical shift and concentration (pH 7.4). Proton spectra were acquired on a vertical Bruker AVANCE 500WB wide-bore MR system operating at 11.75 T with a water presaturation pulse sequence using full relaxation conditions (90° pulse; 32K data points; sweep width, 6 kHz; number of accumulations, 96; and TR, 38 s) with a 5-mm diameter QNP probe (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). Data were processed using XWIN NMR software (Bruker). After zero-filling, apodization (line broadening = 0.3 Hz), Fourier transform, phase, and baseline corrections, spectra were integrated. Areas of overlapping signals were fitted using the XWIN NMR deconvolution procedure. The statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test for two statistical populations and a Kruskal-Wallis analysis followed by a post-hoc test (Scheffé; test) for three statistical populations. Correlations were calculated by using the non-parametric Spearman rank correlation test. Values are reported as means ± S.D. unless otherwise stated. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. NCM Mice Do Not Show Cerebral Lesions—As expected, BALB/c mice did not develop any of the neurological signs associated with cerebral malaria. Mice were explored at day 8 post-infection with a parasitemia of 5.8 ± 1.9% (similar to that seen in susceptible mice developing CM). T2-weighted images did not reveal any cerebral lesions in the cerebral parenchyma, in the corpus callosum, or in the periphery of the caudate putamen, a result in sharp contrast with the lesion profile in experimental CM (Fig. 1A). To assess BBB integrity in infected BALB/c mice, T1-weighted images were acquired before and after the injection of a contrast agent (Gd-DTPA). No signal enhancement attributable to BBB rupture was observed in the group of mice studied at day 8 post-infection (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, T2*-weighted images did not reveal any hemorrhage or abnormal signal in the brain of NCM mice, whereas petechial hemorrhages are a feature of experimental CM (Fig. 1D). NCM Mice Present No Sign of Brain Edema—To assess a possible brain swelling in relation to a vasogenic edema, which is characteristic of experimental CM, we performed a volumetric study of different cerebral structures (brain, ventricle, and cerebellum). NCM mice did not present any change in brain volume (control mice: 340 ± 7mm3; NCM mice: 344 ± 10 mm3, n = 9), ventricle fraction (control mice: 1.6 ± 0.4%; NCM mice: 1.4 ± 0.2%, n = 9), or cerebellar fraction (control mice: 13.3 ± 0.9%; NCM mice: 13.2 ± 1%, n = 9). Cellular edema is a feature of experimental CM, which is associated with a significant and uniform decline in ADC in the whole brain (18Kimelberg H.K. Neuroscience. 2004; 129: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We acquired diffusion-weighted images to determine ADC values (Fig. 1E). ADC values were not different between control and NCM mice in the cortex (control mice: 0.76 ± 0.06 × 10-3 mm2/s; NCM mice: 0.71 ± 0.04 × 10-3 mm2/s, n = 7) and in the striatum (control mice: 0.75 ± 0.07 × 10-3 mm2/s; NCM mice: 0.70 ± 0.03 × 10-3 mm2/s, n = 7). NCM Mice Do Not Have a Cerebral Ischemic Profile—We acquired perfusion-weighted images to measure CBF values (Fig. 2 A). There was no difference in CBF values between control and NCM mice in the cortex (control mice: 1.2 ± 0.3 ml/g/min; NCM mice: 1.0 ± 0.3 ml/g/min, n = 10 and n = 7, respectively) and in striatum (control mice: 1.3 ± 0.3 ml/g/min; NCM mice: 1.2 ± 0.4 ml/g/min, n = 10 and n = 7, respectively). Moreover, angiograms did not evidence any blood void or compression of the arteries (Fig. 2B), another difference with experimental CM. Because metabolic disturbances may precede the onset of lesions at MRI, we performed both in vivo 1H and 31P MRS. On the contrary to previous observations made at the onset of the cerebral syndrome in CBA/J mice, the 1H MRS spectra of NCM mice were normal with no lactate, no reduced NAA, and no increase in Glx (Fig. 3 and Tables 1 and 2). High resolution 1H MRS analysis of brain extracts confirmed the in vivo metabolic results obtained for NCM mice with no significant anomaly (data not shown). In addition, in vivo 31P spectra did not reveal any energetic failure. Cerebral pH values were unchanged (control mice: 7.11 ± 0.14; NCM: 7.16 ± 0.07, n = 7).TABLE 1Brain metabolite analysis determined by in vivo 1H MRS from control, NCM, and HP miceTE = 16 msControl mice (n = 9)NCM mice (n = 7)HP mice (n = 10)Post-hoc testNAA/S0.27 ± 0.050.27 ± 0.050.28 ± 0.04Total creatine/S0.18 ± 0.020.18 ± 0.030.19 ± 0.03Cho/Sa0.12 ± 0.020.13 ± 0.020.11 ± 0.01CTL versus HPap < 0.05.NCM versus HPap < 0.05.Glx/S0.18 ± 0.050.16 ± 0.050.18 ± 0.05Taurine/S0.01 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.01myo-Inositol/S0.04 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.010.02 ± 0.01Mobile lipids/S0.21 ± 0.030.21 ± 0.030.21 ± 0.03TE = 135 msControl mice (n = 10)NCM mice (n = 10)HP mice (n = 7)NAA/S0.31 ± 0.020.34 ± 0.030.30 ± 0.03Total creatine/S0.30 ± 0.030.29 ± 0.040.31 ± 0.05Cho/S0.36 ± 0.030.34 ± 0.030.35 ± 0.04Lactate/SNDbND, not detected.NDNDa p < 0.05.b ND, not detected.

https://openalex.org/W1968002961,"In response to cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, cells rapidly trigger the apoptotic program or undergo growth arrest and senescence at specific phases of the cell cycle. Mitochondrial bcl-xL plays a central role in preventing alteration of mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome c release, caspase activation, DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. However, its pleitropic function depends on its subcellular localization. Here, we show that in addition to its mitochondrial effect that delays apoptosis, bcl-xL colocalizes and binds to cdk1(cdc2) during G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint and its overexpression stabilizes a G2/M-arrest senescence program in surviving cells after DNA damage. Bcl-xL potently inhibits cdk1(cdc2) kinase activity, which is reversible by a synthetic peptide between the 41st amino acid and 60th amino acid surrounding of the Thr47 and Ser62 phosphorylation sites, and Asn52 deamidation site, within the flexible loop domain of bcl-xL. A mutant deleted of this region does not alter the antiapoptotic function of bcl-xL, but impedes its effect on cdk1(cdc2) activity and on the G2/M-arrest senescence program after DNA damage. The nuclear interaction of bcl-xL and cdk1(cdc2) suggests that bcl-xL is coupled to the stabilization of a cell-cycle checkpoint induced by DNA damage, and this effect is genetically distinct from its function on apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2065573772,"The tumour suppressor genes, TP53 and RB1, and four genes involved in their regulation, INK4a, ARF, MDM2 and MDMX, were analysed in a series of 36 post-radiotherapy radiation-induced sarcomas. One-third of the tumours developed in patients carrying a germline mutation of RB1 that predisposed them to retinoblastoma and radiation-induced sarcomas. The genetic inactivation of RB1 and/or TP53 genes was frequently observed in these sarcomas. These inactivations were owing to an interplay between point mutations and losses of large chromosome segments. Radiation-induced somatic mutations were observed in TP53, but not in RB1 or in the four other genes, indicating an early role of TP53 in the radio-sarcomagenesis. RB1 and TP53 genes were biallelically coinactivated in all sarcomas developing in the context of the predisposition, indicating that both genes played a major role in the formation of these sarcomas. In the absence of predisposition, TP53 was biallelically inactivated in one-third of the sarcomas, whereas at least one allele of RB1 was wild type. In both genetic contexts, the TP53 pathway was inactivated by genetic lesions and not by the activation of the ARF/MDM2/MDMX pathway, as recently shown in retinoblastomas. Together, these findings highlight the intricate tissue- and aetiology-specific relationships between TP53 and RB1 pathways in tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1985399907,"Hydroxyurea reduces DNA replication by nucleotide deprivation, whereas UV damage generates DNA photoproducts that directly block replication fork progression. We show that the low fidelity class Y polymerase Pol eta is recruited to proliferating cell nuclear antigen at replication forks both by hydroxyurea and UV light. Under nucleotide deprivation, Pol eta allows cells to accumulate at the G1/S boundary by facilitating slow S-phase progression and promotes apoptosis. Normal cells consequently enter apoptosis at a faster rate than Pol eta-deficient cells. Coincident with hydroxyurea-induced S-phase delay, Pol eta-deficient cells undergo more replication fork breakage and accumulate more foci of the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex and phosphorylated histone H2AX. We conclude that under conditions of nucleotide deprivation, Pol eta is required for S-phase progression but is proapoptotic. However, as Pol eta is reported to require higher nucleotide concentrations than class B replicative polymerases, its recruitment by hydroxyurea requires it to function under suboptimal conditions. Our results suggest that hydroxyurea-induced apoptosis occurs at the G1/S boundary and that initiation of the S-phase requires greater nucleotide concentrations than does S-phase progression."

https://openalex.org/W2035187178,"In mammals, nitric oxide (NO) is an essential biological mediator that is exclusively synthesized by nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs). However, NOSs are also directly or indirectly responsible for the production of peroxynitrite, a well known cytotoxic agent involved in numerous pathophysiological processes. Peroxynitrite reactivity is extremely intricate and highly depends on activators such as hemoproteins. NOSs present, therefore, the unique ability to both produce and activate peroxynitrite, which confers upon them a major role in the control of peroxynitrite bioactivity. We report here the first kinetic analysis of the interaction between peroxynitrite and the oxygenase domain of inducible NOS (iNOSoxy). iNOSoxy binds peroxynitrite and accelerates its decomposition with a second order rate constant of 22 × 104 m–1s–1 at pH 7.4. This reaction is pH-dependent and is abolished by the binding of substrate or product. Peroxynitrite activation is correlated with the observation of a new iNOS heme intermediate with specific absorption at 445 nm. iNOSoxy modifies peroxynitrite reactivity and directs it toward one-electron processes such as nitration or one-electron oxidation. Taken together our results suggest that, upon binding to iNOSoxy, peroxynitrite undergoes homolytic cleavage with build-up of an oxo-ferryl intermediate and concomitant release of a NO·2 radical. Successive cycles of peroxynitrite activation were shown to lead to iNOSoxy autocatalytic nitration and inhibition. The balance between peroxynitrite activation and self-inhibition of iNOSoxy may determine the contribution of NOSs to cellular oxidative stress.

As such, they are involved in a great number of signaling cascades such as the regulation of the vascular tone or neuronal communication (1Lincoln J. Hoyle C.H.V. Burnstock G.

J., ed) Academic Press, San Diego. 2000; Google Scholar). Two major isoforms, the endothelial NOS and the neuronal NOS, are constitutively expressed and are responsible for most of the NO-signaling processes (3Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 118: 215-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mungrue I.N. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2627-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Bredt D.S. J.

However, a third isoform, iNOS, for inducible NOS, has been shown to be the source of a cytotoxic NO production used for nonspecific immune defense or anti-tumoral activity (7MacMicking J. Xie Q-W.

Numerous studies on NOS structure-activity relationships have been carried out to understand the physiological specificities of NOS isoforms (10Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem.

All NOS isoforms exhibit essentially identical crystallographic three-dimensional structure (14Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. Niu X.D. Fossetta J.D. Lunn C.A. Dolphin E. Prongay A.J. Reichert P.

Bruns C.M. Lloyd S.J. Hosfield D.J. Tiso M. Gachhui R. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37918-37927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For the constitutive NOSs, Ca2+-dependent calmodulin binding enables NADPH-derived electrons to transfer from the flavins to the heme and to initiate NO synthesis (18Roman L.J. Martasek P. Masters B.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The chemistry catalyzed by all three isoforms appears also globally identical (19Abu-Soud H.M. Presta A. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10811-10816Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar): NOSs catalyze a two-step oxidation of l-arginine with intermediate formation of Nω-hydroxy-l-arginine (20Stuehr D.J.

To date, all NOSs seem to share similar structure and mechanism, and the numerous structure-function investigations failed to elucidate the factors responsible for the observed different physiological specificities (i.e. signaling versus cytotoxicity) of constitutive and iNOSs. Recently a new NOS catalytic model (Scheme 2) has been proposed by Stuehr and colleagues (23Stuehr D.J. Santolini J. Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Adak S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36167-36170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 24Santolini J. Adak S. Curran C.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Before being released, NO actually binds to the heme within nanoseconds in a geminate recombination process (25Negrerie M. Berka V. Vos M.H. Liebl U. Lambry J.C. Tsai A.L. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24694-24702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus the actual NOS end-product should not be considered simply as NO but as a heme-NO complex, i.e. an FeIIINO complex or an FeIINO complex. This would lead to two different catalytic cycles (Scheme 2) with efficient release of NO from the FeIIINO complex, or oxidation of the NO ligand of the FeIINO complex into other reactive nitrogen species (26Santolini J. Meade A.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48887-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the identities of these reactive nitrogen species remain unknown, the nucleophilic attack of FeIINO on oxygen should theoretically result in the transient build-up of peroxynitrite (PN), as suggested by several studies on FeIINO oxidation in hemoglobins and myoglobins (27Arnold E.V. Bohle D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 41-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Herold S. Rock G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6223-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Andersen H.J.

However, NOSs can potentially produce peroxynitrite in other ways (31Stuehr D. Pou S. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14533-14536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar): (i) in uncoupling conditions, NOSs are prone to produce superoxide anion that will stoichiometrically react with NO to produce peroxynitrite (32Rosen G.M. Tsai P. Pou S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1191-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), (ii) in H4B-free conditions, 3Under these conditions the extent of oxygen activation remained minor compared to FeIIO2 auto-oxidation and superoxide production. it might lead to the transient build-up of an FeIINO complex, which may directly react with oxygen to produce peroxynitrite, or release nitroxyl anion (NO–), whose reaction with oxygen would also result in PN formation (33Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 34Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Therefore, in addition to their “natural” beneficial role as a producer of NO, NOSs are also potentially a source of peroxynitrite, a product that is known to be extremely deleterious for biomolecules. This dual functionality such as the production of either NO or other reactive nitrogen species (such as PN) could be a potential explanation for NOS multiple physiological activities. Peroxynitrite is a versatile chemical that is able to produce various chemical reactions ranging from one- or two-electron oxidations to nitrosation and nitration of various biological targets (36Pfeiffer S. Lass A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J.

Its reactivity is extremely sensitive to the milieu conditions and requires the presence of Lewis acid activators such as CO2, metals, and protons (39Goldstein S. Lind J. Merenyi G. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2457-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 40Koppenol W.H. Redox Rep. 2001; 6: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 41Koppenol W.H. Free Radic Biol.

Bachschmid M. Beckman J.S. Munzel T. Ullrich V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), has been recently investigated. In each case, the catalytic site of these enzymes was shown to interact with peroxynitrite and to accelerate its decomposition. Although the mechanism of such a reaction has not been elucidated yet, we will refer to it as PN “activation” throughout this report. The reactivity of the activated peroxynitrite greatly varies with the nature of the hemoprotein. For example, peroxynitrite was shown to be scavenged (via isomerization into nitrate) by hemohistidylate proteins (43Herold S. Shivashankar K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14036-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas the activation of PN by hemothiolate proteins such as cytochromes P450 led to an enhanced nitration of external and/or endogenous tyrosines (47Daiber A. Schoneich C. Schmidt P. Jung C. Ullrich V. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 49Daiber A. Herold S. Schoneich C. Namgaladze D. Peterson J.A. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6729-6739PubMed Google Scholar). NOSs appear unique among these metalloproteins, because they seem able both to produce and to activate peroxynitrite. The interaction between NOS and PN is therefore crucial for the control and regulation of PN bioactivity. On one hand, if NOSs scavenge PN, or are inhibited by PN, this would lead to the termination of PN production and, as a feedback loop, to the suppression of NOS cytotoxic role. On the other hand, if NOSs enhance PN reactivity while remaining insensitive to PN-damaging effects, this would confer onto them a major role in the generation of a (patho)physiological oxidative stress. Depending on the isoforms, the characteristics of the interaction between PN and NOS could contribute to NOS-specific physiological activities. On the basis of previous studies reported by Herold and colleagues on Mb and Hb (43Herold S. Shivashankar K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14036-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we have carried out an extensive kinetic investigation of the interaction between the iNOS oxygenase domain (iNOSoxy) and PN. Our results suggest that iNOSoxy strongly interacts with PN and modifies its reactivity. We have completed this study by characterizing the nature of activated PN products and by determining the impact of PN activation on NOS structure and function. Chemicals—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich except dihydrorhodamine (DHR) and rhodamine, which were purchased from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA), and PN, which was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI). PN solutions (between 37 and 45 μm in NaOH, 0.3 m) were stored in aliquots of 50 and 100 μl at –80 °C. Before each experiment, peroxynitrite concentrations were measured by UV-visible spectroscopy (ɛ = 1670 m–1. cm–1 at 302 nm). Carbon monoxide and argon gas were purchased from Messer (Messer France SA, Asnières, France). CO2 buffers were obtained by adding the required quantity of a 0.5 m NaHCO3 solution to different reaction buffers (52Herold S. Exner M. Boccini F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Two sets of such buffers differing in CO2 concentration ranges were used: (i) (sub)stoichiometric [CO2] to probe the effect of iNOSoxy on PN decomposition kinetics in the absence and presence of CO2 and (ii) [CO2] in excess to compare the effects of CO2 and iNOSoxy on PN reactivity and to investigate any cumulative effects. Enzyme Preparation—The mouse iNOS oxygenase domain (iNOSoxy) containing a six-histidine tag at its C terminus was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using the PCWori vector and purified as already described (53Ghosh D.K. Crane B.R. Ghosh S. Wolan D. Gachhui R. Crooks C. Presta A. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6260-6270Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in the absence of tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) and l-arginine (Arg). iNOSoxy concentration was determined from the absorbance at 444 nm of the heme ferrous-CO complex (FeIICO; ɛ444 = 74 mm–1·cm–1 (54Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). NOS activity was measured at 24 mol of nitrite·min–1·mol–1 using the Griess assay (55Titheradge M.A. Nitric Oxide Protocols: Methods in Molecular Biology. 1998; (pp. , Totowa, NJ): 83-91Google Scholar). Depending on the experiment, protein samples were incubated in a fresh KPi (100 mm, pH 7.4) buffer in the presence of different combinations of citrulline (250 mm), Arg (10 mm), or H4B (100 μm). Arg and H4B binding were verified by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (UvikonXL, Secomam, France) via the spectral changes of the Soret absorption band from 420 nm (low spin) to 395 nm (high spin). Citrulline binding was controlled by a shift of the Soret band to 417 nm. Kinetics of Peroxynitrite Decomposition—Buffers were strictly degassed to prevent cross-reactions, mainly between PN and CO2, and between PN decomposition products and O2. iNOSoxy was incubated in the absence of Arg and H4B at three different pH values (6.4, 7.4, and 8.4) in a fresh solution of 100 mm KPi buffer containing 300 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. 400 μm PN solutions were prepared just prior to use by dilution of a fresh stock solution in anaerobic NaOH, 0.01 n. Enzyme solutions were rapid-mixed to the PN solution at room temperature. Rapid-sampling stopped-flow experiments were performed on a Biologic (Bio-Logic Science Instruments SA, CLAIX, France) SFM 300 instrument coupled using fiber optics with a Tidas spectrograph (WPI Inc., Sarasota, FL), which was equipped with a rapid-sampling 1024-diode array spectrometer (3 ms/spectrum). The light source was a 150-watt xenon lamp. The spectral range of the monochromator was from 200 to 1015 nm, and spectral resolution was 2 nm (0.8 nm/diode). The wavelength accuracy is quoted by the manufacturer to be 0.1 nm. Mixing sequence was set to give 100 μm PN final concentration. pH values were checked after mixing, and only negligible variations were noticed. Peroxynitrite decomposition was followed by absorbance changes monitored at 302 nm. In general, 750 spectra were recorded with various time intervals to record the entire course of the reaction kinetics. The shortest time frame used to follow the entire reaction was 2.3 s, and the longest was up to 40 s. The sequence dead-time was estimated at ∼2 ms. At pH 8.4, PN decomposition kinetics was directly recorded on a UV-visible absorption spectrometer (UvikonXL, Secomam, France) with a manual mixing time of <2 s. Spectra were superimposed to verify the nature of the transition: clear isosbestic points confirmed the existence of a single-phase transition. Experiments were performed with increasing enzyme concentrations (from 0.5 to 4 μm). For each concentration, three different experiments were recorded; time traces of the absorbance changes at 302 nm were generated for each kinetics measurement and multifitted to mono-exponential functions using the Origin 6.0 software routine (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Fitting to bi-exponential function did not lead to distinct and consistent rate constants. This protocol was repeated three times. The resulting apparent rate constants were averaged and plotted as a function of iNOSoxy concentrations. These experiments were repeated at pH 7.4 in the presence of different combinations of Arg, citrulline, and H4B and in the presence of 0.1 mm soluble CO2. In the presence of CO2, the kinetic traces had to be multifitted to a double-exponential function. The values obtained for the first and second phases were plotted as a function of iNOSoxy concentration. When H4B was present, we observed an additional slow phase that corresponds to the direct interaction between free H4B and PN. Indeed, the oxidation of H4B by peroxynitrite will induce a decrease of H4B absorbance at 302 nm (supplemental Fig. S2). This third phase does not correspond to PN decomposition and is too slow to interfere with PN decay kinetics analysis. Analysis of Peroxynitrite Nitrative and Oxidative Properties Using 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic Acid (HPA)—The reaction of HPA with PN leads to the formation of oxidized and/or nitrated HPA metabolites that can be isolated, identified, and quantified by HPLC. In parallel, fluorescence assays gave an insight into the production of HPA dimers (di-HPA) resulting from the one-electron oxidation of HPA. 10 mm HPA and 20 μm iNOSoxy were added to 100 μl of a freshly degassed reaction buffer (KPi (0.1 m, pH 7.4) and 0.3 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid). Peroxynitrite (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mm final concentrations) was added to the buffer, and the solution was immediately vigorously mixed. The solution was kept at room temperature for 10 min to ensure the completion of the reaction and was then diluted to 1 ml for analysis. Several control samples were measured under the same experimental conditions: (i) in the absence of both iNOSoxy and PN; (ii) in the absence of iNOSoxy, for all PN concentrations; (iii) with decomposed PN, with and without iNOSoxy; in this case, PN was first diluted at the desired concentration in the reaction buffer and kept at room temperature for at least 3 min to ensure full decomposition; and (iv) in the presence of 1 mm soluble CO2. All samples were simultaneously analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy and HPLC. HPA-fluorescence Assays—The presence of di-HPA in the solution was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Emission spectra were recorded with an excitation wavelength of 326 nm. Emission intensity was measured between 400 and 405 nm and plotted as a function of PN concentration. This series of experiments was repeated three times. Each plot was fitted to a linear function using Origin 6.0 software (OriginLab Corp.), and the slopes of all curves were averaged. We verified whether the presence of iNOSoxy could quench the fluorescence of di-HPA. HPA was allowed to react with PN in the absence of enzyme. Subsequent addition of 20 μm iNOSoxy led to negligible variations in the fluorescence emission intensity (<10%) indicating that iNOSoxy is not interfering with HPA fluorescence profile. Samples were frozen and kept at –20 °C until analysis by HPLC. We did not observe any modification of the fluorescence emission of the sample due to the freeze-thaw cycle, which indicates that the samples are not altered by freeze-thaw cycles. HPA-HPLC Assays—iNOSoxy was removed from the solution by centrifugation (2300 × g at 8 °C) using Millipore (Bedford, MA) Ultrafree®-0.5 centrifugal filter device with a membrane filter (30-kDa cut-off). HPA derivatives were separated and analyzed by HPLC using a Dionex P680 instrument coupled to a Dionex UVD170U spectrophotometer (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). The reverse-phase column was a Supelcosil LC-8, 150 × 4.6 mm protected by a Discovery C18, 20 × 4.0 mm pre-column (Sigma-Aldrich). The gradient was provided by changing the mixing ratio of the two eluents: water with 1% (v/v) acetic acid (A), and methanol containing 1% (v/v) acetic acid (B). The column was equilibrated with 5% B before injection of 20 μl of reaction solution. The gradient was then increased to 100% B for 20 min and held for 5 min to wash the column. The gradient returned to the initial condition within 10 min and held for 5 min for equilibration. Detection was achieved at 274, 280, 365, and 428 nm. Chromatograms were analyzed using Chromeleon 6.40 software (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Retention times were identified at 280 and 365 nm using commercially available HPA (retention time = 9.25 min), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPA-OH, retention time = 8 min), and 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetic acid (HPA-NO2, retention time = 11.55 min). Peak areas were calibrated using increasing concentrations of HPA, HPA-OH, and HPA-NO2. Because HPA-NO2 displays a specific peak at 365 nm, its production during HPA reaction with PN was quantified using both absorption peaks at 280 and 365 nm. At 280 nm, because of the crowding of the 11.3- to 11.8-min region, the chromatograms were converted into ASCII file and fitted to multi-Gaussian functions using Origin 6.0 (OriginLab Corp.). Three different chromatogram peaks were identified with absorbance maxima occurring around 11.35, 11.55, and 11.75 min. The areas of the 11.55-min chromatogram peak measured at 365 nm were converted into HPA-NO2 concentrations using calibration curves. HPA-NO2 concentrations were plotted as a function of PN concentrations, and the data were fitted to linear functions. Experiments were repeated twice. DHR Fluorescence Assays—DHR was used to assess the twoelectron oxidative properties of peroxynitrite. The procedure was similar to the one described for HPA. DHR was diluted immediately prior to the assay in a degassed KPi (0.1 m and pH 7.4) buffer with 0.3 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. The final concentration of DHR in the reaction buffer was set at 40 μm. Peroxynitrite at increasing concentrations (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 μm final) was vigorously mixed into the solution, in the presence or absence of iNOSoxy. Fluorescence emission spectra of the different samples were recorded with an excitation wavelength at 500 nm. Emission intensity was measured at 525 nm and plotted as a function of PN concentration. The curves were fitted to linear function, and the slopes of three series of experiments were averaged. Similar control experiments were performed, using the same protocol, with decomposed PN, in the absence of iNOSoxy or by adding iNOSoxy after the completion of the reaction between DHR and PN. Activity Assays—iNOSoxy sample (1.5 μm) was rapid-mixed with successive additions of PN aliquots at 4 equivalents of iNOSoxy concentration. The number of additions ranged between 0 and 10. Bolus additions of 60 μm PN and of 60 μm decomposed PN were performed as controls. All samples were then washed by three successive cycles of concentration/dilution in a KPi (0.1 m and pH 7.4) buffer using a Millipore Ultrafree®-0.5 centrifugal filter device membrane filter concentrator (30-kDa cut-off). NOS activity of each protein sample was then measured using the Griess assay. Nitrite production activity was plotted as a function of the number of addition of PN. Experiments were repeated three times. Kinetics of PN decomposition in the presence of 10 μm iNOSoxy was measured for each sample with the protocol described here above. Absorbance decays at 302 nm were fitted to a mono-exponential function. Fitting to bi-exponential function did not lead to distinct and consistent rate constants. Mono-exponential apparent rate constants were plotted as a function of the number of PN aliquots added. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting Experiments—The samples used for activity measurement were also used to characterize nitration of iNOSoxy upon PN aliquot additions. Samples were denatured by heating at 90 °C for 10 min in a standard denaturing buffe"

We have previously investigated which amino acid residues of Hxt2 are important for high affinity transport activity. Studies with all the possible combinations of 12 transmembrane segments (TMs) of Hxt2 and Hxt1 revealed that TMs 1, 5, 7, and 8 of Hxt2 are necessary for high affinity transport. Systematic shuffling of the 20 amino acid residues that differ between Hxt2 and Hxt1 in these TMs subsequently identified 5 residues as important for such activity: Leu59 and Leu61 (TM1), Leu201 (TM5), Asn331 (TM7), and Phe366 (TM8). We have now studied the relative importance of these 5 residues by individually replacing them with each of the other 19 residues. Replacement of Asn331 yielded transporters with various affinities, with those of the Ile331, Val331, and Cys331 mutants being higher than that of the wild type. Replacement of the Hxt2 residues at the other four sites yielded transporters with affinities similar to that of the wild type but with various capacities. A working homology model of the chimeric transporters containing Asn331 or its 19 replacement residues indicated that those residues at this site that yield high affinity transporters (Ile331, Val331, Cys331) face the central cavity and are within van der Waals distances of Phe208 (TM5), Leu357 (TM8), and Tyr427 (TM10). Interactions via these residues of the four TMs, which compose a half of the central pore, may thus play a pivotal role in formation of a core structure for high affinity transport.

Monosaccharides are an important carbon and energy source for most living cells. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the movement of hexoses across the plasma membrane and into the cell occurs by facilitated diffusion via hexose transporters. The yeast cells must be able to adapt to the broad range of sugar concentrations to which they are exposed under natural conditions. A diversity of hexose transporter genes has evolved in S. cerevisiae, with these genes encoding 17 different transporters (Hxt1–11, Hxt13–17, and Gal2) (1Kruckeberg A.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Boles E. Hollenberg C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 85-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that belong to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) 2The abbreviations used are: MFS, major facilitator superfamily; TM, transmembrane segment. 2The abbreviations used are: MFS, major facilitator superfamily; TM, transmembrane segment. (3Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these 17 hexose transporters, Hxt2 and Hxt1 are high affinity (Km = 3.3 mm) and low affinity (Km = 46 mm) glucose transporters that share ∼70% amino acid sequence identity in corresponding putative transmembrane segments (TMs) and inter-TM loops. There are 252 amino acid residues in the 12 putative TMs of both Hxt2 and Hxt1 (4Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), with 75 of these residues differing between the two transporters. We have been attempting to identify which of these 75 sites of Hxt2 are the key determinants of high affinity transport.We have adopted a comprehensive chimeric approach in studies with two closely related paralogs that differ in substrate specificity (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M.

This approach greatly reduces the number of mutants necessary for saturation mutagenesis. For example, with this approach, the simultaneous random mutation of 12 sites yields 212 = 4,096 independent clones, whereas ordinary random mutagenesis at even four sites yields 204 = 160,000 clones, a number so high as to render screening impractical. We previously studied which TMs of Hxt2 are important for high affinity glucose transport with the use of a new procedure designated TM shuffling (8Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the 12 TMs of Hxt2 was randomly replaced with the corresponding region of Hxt1 at the DNA level, and clones encoding transporters with a high affinity for glucose were selected by plating transformants on glucose-limited agar plates. Our results demonstrated that a minimal combination of TMs 1, 5, 7, and 8 of Hxt2 is necessary for high affinity glucose transport. The chimeric transporter C1578 (supplemental Fig. S1), in which all TMs but 1, 5, 7, and 8 of Hxt2 are replaced with the corresponding TMs of Hxt1, thus showed transport activity similar to that of Hxt2. Twenty amino acid residues in these four TMs differ between Hxt2 and Hxt1. We further examined which residues in C1578 are important for high affinity glucose transport by systematically shuffling these 20 residues with the corresponding residues of Hxt1. Analysis of transporters with high affinity and high capacity revealed that 5 residues of Hxt2 are important for such activity: Leu59 and Leu61 in TM1, Leu201 in TM5, Asn331 in TM7, and Phe366 in TM8 (9Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30274-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18532-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). A working homology model indicated that Asn331 is located in the middle of TM7 and faces the central substrate permeation pathway, whereas the other residues are situated in the hydrophobic periphery (10Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18532-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).As a final step in our analysis, we have now investigated which of these 5 residues of Hxt2 are most important for high affinity transport by replacing each of them with the other 19 amino acid residues and analyzing the transport activity of the resulting transporters. Our results indicate that Asn331 in TM7 is the key determinant of high affinity glucose transport. We thus found that replacement of Asn331 with each of the other 19 residues generated transporters with various affinities, with three of them possessing an affinity higher than that of the wild type.Structural insight into MFS transporters was provided by determination of the crystal structures of two bacterial transporters, the lactose transporter LacY and the glycerol 3-phosphate transporter GlpT (11Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar, 12Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The configurations of the TMs in these two transporters are highly similar. The structures of two additional bacterial MFS transporters also proved to be similar to those of LacY and GlpT (13Hirai T. Heymann J.A. Maloney P.C. Subramaniam S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1712-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Yin Y. He X. Szewczyk P. Nguyen T. Chang G. Science. 2006; 312: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the MFS transporters share a similar conformation regardless of their substantial sequence differences. With the use of a previous homology model based on GlpT (10Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18532-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we have now obtained results consistent with the notion that Asn331 of Hxt2, or its corresponding residue in high affinity mutants, interacts hydrophobically with residues in TMs 5, 8, and 10, thereby generating at least a part of a core TM structure required for high affinity glucose transport.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Vectors—The plasmid Hxt2mnx-pVT, which comprises HXT2 under the control of the ADH1 promoter in the multicopy vector pVT102-U (YEp URA3 bla), was constructed as described previously (8Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vector C1578-pVT, which encodes the chimeric transporter C1578 (in which all of the TMs of Hxt2, with the exception of TMs 1, 5, 7, and 8, are replaced with those of Hxt1), was also described previously (8Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Mutagenesis—Replacement of Leu59, Leu61, Leu201, Asn331, or Phe366 in C1578 with the other 19 residues was performed with the use of a polymerase chain reaction-based approach as described (10Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18532-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In brief, mutation of the 5 target residues was achieved by replacing each target codon with NNK for all mutants with the exception of Leu201 mutants, for which NNN was used. DNA sequences for the mutated transporters were determined with a DNA sequencer (model 310, Applied Biosystems). Most clones were picked up by this procedure, but several were not obtained. To generate these latter clones, we designed specific primers and performed the polymerase chain reaction as described above. Each mutant protein was designated by the mutated residue: for example, 59H for the protein in which Leu59 is replaced with His. Plasmids were introduced into S. cerevisiae strain KY73 (MATα hxt1Δ::HIS3::Δhxt4 hxt5::LEU2 hxt2Δ::HIS3 hxt3Δ::LEU2::Δhxt6 hxt7Δ::HIS3 gal2Δ::DR ura3–52 MAL2 SUC2 MEL) (15Ye L. Kruckeberg A.L. Berden J.A. van Dam K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4673-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Transport Assay—Cells harboring plasmids were grown to log phase (optical density at 650 nm, 0.3–0.6) at 30 °C in synthetic liquid medium supplemented with adenine, amino acids, and maltose (20 mg/ml) but not with uracil (S2Mal) (16Amberg D.C. Burke D.J. Strathern J.N. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2005: 200-201Google Scholar). Glucose transport by the cells was measured at 30 °C for 5 s as described (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Kasahara T. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4422-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transport activities measured at a d-[14C]glucose concentration of 0.1 or 20 mm were expressed as picomoles of glucose/1 × 107 cells/5 s and were corrected for the background activity determined either in the presence of 0.5 mm HgCl2 or with 0.1 or 20 mml-[14C]glucose as substrate. In some experiments, transport activity was calculated as a percentage of that obtained with the cells expressing C1578.Construction of a Three-dimensional Model of Hxt2—The crystal structure of GlpT (Protein Data Bank accession number 1PW4) formed the basis for construction of a structural model of Hxt2. A working homology model of C1578 and Hxt2 was generated with the Biopolymer module of Insight II (version 2000; Accelrys, San Diego, CA) as described (10Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18532-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Other Assays—A crude membrane fraction was prepared from cells as described (18Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and immunoblot analysis of this fraction was performed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for the COOH-terminal region of Hxt2 (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and with 125I-labeled protein A (IM144, GE Healthcare). The intensity of bands corresponding to immune complexes was measured with imaging plates (BAS 1800II, Fuji Film) (18Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) within the range proportional to the amount of protein. Cell number was determined with a particle counter (Z2, Beckman Coulter). Protein concentration was measured with bicinchoninic acid (Pierce).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe previously identified 5 residues of Hxt2 (Leu59 and Leu61 in TM1, Leu201 in TM5, Asn331 in TM7, and Phe366 in TM8) that are required for the high affinity and high capacity glucoses transport activity of C1578 (10Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18532-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). To investigate the relative roles of these 5 residues, we individually replaced each one with each of the other 19 residues. The resulting mutant proteins were expressed in KY73 cells in which genes for the eight major glucose transporters (Hxt1–7, Gal2) are disrupted and which therefore do not exhibit substantial glucose transport activity. The transport activities of the mutant proteins were measured for 5 s at 30 °C at two substrate concentrations, 0.1 and 20 mmd-glucose, and they were normalized by cell number and expressed as a percentage of the activity of C1578 at each substrate concentration (Fig. 1 and supplemental Tables S1–S5). The transport activity of almost all Leu59, Leu61, Leu201, or Phe366 mutants was reduced when compared with that of C1578. A few mutants, however, including 59F, 59T, 59N, and 61Q, maintained >90% of the activity of C1578 at both 0.1 and 20 mm glucose (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). The mutants were distributed more or less along the diagonal line connecting the origin to C1578 in Fig. 1, suggestive of no substantial change in Km and various changes in Vmax. In contrast, the Asn331 mutants showed a pattern markedly different from that of the others (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S4). The transport activity of the mutants 331I, 331V, and 331C with 0.1 mm d-glucose was substantially higher than that of C1578, indicative of an increase in affinity.We performed kinetic analysis for the Asn331 mutants (supplemental Table S6). A wide range of Km (0.87–54 mm) and Vmax (430–1320 pmol/5 s/107 cells) values was obtained. Only the Asn331 mutants showed such a diversity of Km values (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table S7). The 331I, 331V, and 331C mutants exhibited affinities (Km values of 0.87, 1.3, and 2.2 mm, respectively) substantially higher than that of C1578 (5.3 mm). In contrast, the affinities of 331 m, 331P, and 331E (Km values of 20, 21, and 54 mm, respectively) were markedly reduced when compared with that of C1578. The Km values for transporters mutated at the other sites were 80–190% of that of C1578, with the exception of 201H, whose Km was 280% (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table S7).FIGURE 2Affinities of mutant transporters for d-glucose. KY73 cells expressing the indicated Leu59, Leu61, Leu201, Asn331, or Phe366 mutant transporters were cultured to log phase at 30 °C in S2Mal synthetic medium, after which the kinetic parameters of d-glucose transport were measured for 5 s at 30 °C with 0.1–100 mmd-glucose as substrate as described (17Kasahara T. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4422-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Affinity is expressed as 1/Km, and data are means ± S.E. (n ≥ 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also studied whether the role of Asn331 in wild-type Hxt2 is the same as that in C1578. We thus replaced Asn331 of Hxt2 with Ile, Val, or Cys to generate 331I/Hxt2, 331V/Hxt2, and 331C/Hxt2, respectively. The Km and Vmax values (means ± S.E.) were 0.76 ± 0.03 mm and 160 ± 10 pmol/5s/107 cells for 331I/Hxt2 (n = 3), 0.51 ± 0.02 mm and 320 ± 10 pmol/5s/107 cells for 331V/Hxt2 (n = 3), and 0.98 ± 0.05 mm and 900 ± 60 pmol/5s/107 cells for 331C/Hxt2 (n = 3), whereas those for wild-type Hxt2 were 3.3 ± 0.3 mm and 1170 ± 160 pmol/5s/107 cells (n = 8). The 331I, 331V, and 331C mutations thus also markedly increased the affinity of Hxt2 for glucose according to the rank order 331V > 331I > 331C when compared with 331I > 331V > 331C for C1578. The replacement of Asn331 with each of these 3 residues therefore had similar effects in C1578 and Hxt2 with the slight differences in the relative magnitude of these effects possibly reflecting small structural differences between the two transporters.We prepared a crude membrane fraction from cells and examined the expression level of the various mutant transporters by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the COOH-terminal region of Hxt2. All mutants yielded a major immunoreactive band at a position corresponding to that of Hxt2 (47 kDa); representative data for the Asn331 mutants are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Quantitative analysis of these bands revealed that the expression level for the mutants was ∼60–140% (n = 3–5) relative to the value for C1578, with the exception of 201T (170%), 331H (27%), 366K (41%), and 366R (26%) (supplemental Tables S1–S5).The Vmax/Km value provides a measure of transport efficiency (9Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30274-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and was calculated for mutant transporters (supplemental Tables S6 and S7). Normalization by expression level changed individual values but did not affect the general profile (see expression levels in supplemental Tables S1–S5). Most of the Leu59, Leu61, and Phe366 mutants showed Vmax/Km values higher than that of C1578, with the values for 59V, 59I, 61N, and 61Q being similar to that of wild-type Hxt2. The Vmax/Km value for all of the Leu201 mutants examined was reduced when compared with that of C1578, confirming the essential role of Leu201 (9Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30274-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The Asn331 mutants showed a wide range of Vmax/Km values (20–210% of that of C1578). Transport efficiencies of the 331I, 331V, and 331C mutants were greater than that of C1578, with that of 331I also being higher than that of wild-type Hxt2.Substrate specificities were examined for 331I, 331V, and 331C (supplemental Fig. S3). No substantial difference in the effects of the addition of nonradioactive d-galactose or l-glucose on d-glucose transport activity was apparent between the mutants and C1578. The addition of d-fructose inhibited the glucose transport activity of the mutants and C1578 by similar extents. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose, d-mannose, d-xylose, and 6-deoxy-d-glucose each inhibited the glucose transport activity of the mutants to a greater extent than they did that of C1578. 3-O-Methyl-d-glucose is not transported by Hxt2, Hxt1, or C1578 (7Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this hexose inhibited the glucose transport activity of the mutants. We measured the inhibition constant (Ki) for 3-O-methyl-d-glucose with 0.05 mmd-[14C] glucose as the substrate, obtaining values (n = 3) of >50 mm for C1578 when compared with 8.7 ± 0.7 mm for 331I, 14 ± 0 mm for 331V, and 13 ± 0 mm for 331C. These results indicate that the recognition of glucose was less selective in the Asn331 mutants, suggesting that the observed changes in substrate specificity are not due to a change in the recognition of a specific position of glucose.The role of TM7 has been intensively studied in members of the mammalian GLUT family of glucose transporters. Exposure of cells expressing a single Cys-substituted form of GLUT1 to a water-soluble sulfhydryl reagent revealed that the exofacial portion of TM7 is accessible to the external solvent (19Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36176-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A QLS motif present in TM7 of GLUT family proteins has been proposed to interact with the C-1 position of d-glucose (20Seatter M.J. De la Rue S.A. Porter L.M. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and Ile314 situated at the outer edge of TM7 of GLUT7 was shown to be required for fructose transport (21Manolescu A. Salas-Burgos A.M. Fischbarg J. Cheeseman C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42978-42983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Studies of other MFS transporters have also shown the importance of TM7. TM7 contributes to the substrate permeation pathway in the crystal structures of LacY and GlpT (11Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar, 12Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), and one of the expected substrate binding sites (Arg269) in TM7 of GlpT corresponds to Gln327 of C1578 in our current homology model. TM7 of human Na+/H+ exchanger, another MFS transporter, was also shown to play an important role as an interrupted helix (22Ding J. Rainey J.K. Xu C. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29817-29829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These various observations thus indicate that TM7 as a whole plays a key role in substrate recognition by MFS transporters.Construction of a homology model of C1578 based on the structure of GlpT revealed Asn331 to be situated in the middle of TM7 facing the central pore (10Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18532-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A close examination of Asn331 and its environment shows that this residue is located on the edge of a hydrophobic pocket consisting of Phe208 (TM5), Leu357 (TM8), and Tyr427 (TM10) and that these 4 residues are positioned within van der Waals distances of each other (Fig. 3A). The model indicated that TMs 5, 7, 8, and 10 comprised a half of the central pore. Replacement of Asn331 with each of the other 19 residues revealed that Ile, Val, and Cys fit into the pocket and increase the amount of space in the central pore. Replacement of Asn331 with smaller residues such as Gly, Ala, and Ser increases the amount of space in the pocket as a result of weakening of the interactions with the other residues, but the predicted effects on Km are minimal. Breakage of the α helix by replacement of Asn331 with Gly or Pro is also possible. The remaining 12 residues substituted for Asn331 have protruding hydrophilic or hydrophobic side chains that resulted in steric hindrance. These observations are in good agreement with our experimental results showing that Asn, Ile, Val, and Cys at position 331 each support high affinity and high capacity transport, whereas transporters containing the other residues at this position exhibit either lower affinity or impaired activity. They are also consistent with the observation that the recognition of glucose became less strict in the 331I, 331V, and 331C mutants. The unexpected inhibition of the glucose transport activity of these three mutants by 3-O-methyl-d-glucose is thus likely attributable to the extra space conferred by each mutation, which allows recognition of the methyl group of this sugar. The model also reveals that TMs 5, 7, 8, and 10 are closest to this pocket region and form an hourglass-like structure (Fig. 3B). It is thus likely that van der Waals interactions among Phe208, Asn331, Leu357, and Tyr427 pull their respective TMs toward each other, resulting in bending of each TM.FIGURE 3Stereograms showing the predicted locations of residues in TMs 5, 7, 8, and 10 of C1578 that are important for high affinity and high capacity glucose transport. A, perpendicular view from the cytoplasmic side. Asn331, which was identified as important for high affinity transport by C1578, is depicted with green for carbon atoms, red for oxygen, and blue for nitrogen. The replacement of Asn331 with Ile (magenta), Val (cyan), or Cys (yellow) increased the affinity for glucose. A search for possible surrounding interacting residues identified Phe208 (TM5), Leu357 (TM8), and Tyr427 (TM10), which form a hydrophobic pocket with Asn331 located at its edge. For clarity, only a portion of each TM is shown. TMs 5, 7, 8, and 10 comprise a half of the central pore. B, lateral view showing the kinked helices around Asn331. Asn331 and the other residues are depicted by ball-and-stick and stick representations, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With comprehensive chimeric analysis, we had previously identified 5 amino acid residues necessary for high affinity and high capacity glucose transport activity of Hxt2. We have now shown that one of these 5 residues, Asn331, is a critical determinant of transporter affinity for glucose. Monosaccharides are an important carbon and energy source for most living cells. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the movement of hexoses across the plasma membrane and into the cell occurs by facilitated diffusion via hexose transporters. The yeast cells must be able to adapt to the broad range of sugar concentrations to which they are exposed under natural conditions. A diversity of hexose transporter genes has evolved in S. cerevisiae, with these genes encoding 17 different transporters (Hxt1–11, Hxt13–17, and Gal2) (1Kruckeberg A.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Boles E. Hollenberg C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 85-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that belong to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) 2The abbreviations used are: MFS, major facilitator superfamily; TM, transmembrane segment. 2The abbreviations used are: MFS, major facilitator superfamily; TM, transmembrane segment. (3Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these 17 hexose transporters, Hxt2 and Hxt1 are high affinity (Km = 3.3 mm) and low affinity (Km = 46 mm) glucose transporters that share ∼70% amino acid sequence identity in corresponding putative transmembrane segments (TMs) and inter-TM loops. There are 252 amino acid residues in the 12 putative TMs of both Hxt2 and Hxt1 (4Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), with 75 of these residues differing between the two transporters. We have been attempting to identify which of these 75 sites of Hxt2 are the key determinants of high affinity transport. We have adopted a comprehensive chimeric approach in studies with two closely related paralogs that differ in substrate specificity (5Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2018773232,"p16INK4A (p16) has been suggested to be an early biomarker for the detection of cervical cancer. However, its functional role in cervical cancer is not well characterized. In this study, we reported the consistent and significant upregulation of p16 in cervical cancer tissues when compared to both matched non-tumourous tissues of the same patient and normal cervical tissues from non-cancer patients. We have employed p16 small interfering RNA (siRNA) to dissect the role of p16 in cervical carcinogenesis. Although the silencing of p16 was accompanied by the upregulation of p53, p21 and RB in the p16 siRNA-transfected cells, no significant effect on cell cycle progression was observed. When the p16 siRNA-silenced cells were subjected to DNA damage stress including ultraviolet-irradiation and cisplatin treatments, a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells could be observed in the p16-siRNA silenced cells compared to control siRNA-treated cells. Moreover, induction of apoptosis was associated with the activation of p53 through phosphorylation, and this process, when studied by gene profiling experiments, involved both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. The observation that silencing of p16 expression augments DNA damage-induced apoptosis in cervical cancer cells offers alternative strategies for anti-cancer therapies for human cervical cancer."
