https://openalex.org/W4302363656,"The development of optimal strategies to treat impaired mobility related to ageing and chronic disease requires better ways to detect and measure it. Digital health technology, including body worn sensors, has the potential to directly and accurately capture real-world mobility. Mobilise-D consists of 34 partners from 13 countries who are working together to jointly develop and implement a digital mobility assessment solution to demonstrate that real-world digital mobility outcomes have the potential to provide a better, safer, and quicker way to assess, monitor, and predict the efficacy of new interventions on impaired mobility. The overarching objective of the study is to establish the clinical validity of digital outcomes in patient populations impacted by mobility challenges, and to support engagement with regulatory and health technology agencies towards acceptance of digital mobility assessment in regulatory and health technology assessment decisions.The Mobilise-D clinical validation study is a longitudinal observational cohort study that will recruit 2400 participants from four clinical cohorts. The populations of the Innovative Medicine Initiative-Joint Undertaking represent neurodegenerative conditions (Parkinson's Disease), respiratory disease (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), neuro-inflammatory disorder (Multiple Sclerosis), fall-related injuries, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and frailty (Proximal Femoral Fracture). In total, 17 clinical sites in ten countries will recruit participants who will be evaluated every six months over a period of two years. A wide range of core and cohort specific outcome measures will be collected, spanning patient-reported, observer-reported, and clinician-reported outcomes as well as performance-based outcomes (physical measures and cognitive/mental measures). Daily-living mobility and physical capacity will be assessed directly using a wearable device. These four clinical cohorts were chosen to obtain generalizable clinical findings, including diverse clinical, cultural, geographical, and age representation. The disease cohorts include a broad and heterogeneous range of subject characteristics with varying chronic care needs, and represent different trajectories of mobility disability.The results of Mobilise-D will provide longitudinal data on the use of digital mobility outcomes to identify, stratify, and monitor disability. This will support the development of widespread, cost-effective access to optimal clinical mobility management through personalised healthcare. Further, Mobilise-D will provide evidence-based, direct measures which can be endorsed by regulatory agencies and health technology assessment bodies to quantify the impact of disease-modifying interventions on mobility.ISRCTN12051706."
https://openalex.org/W4302762921,"Selecting appropriate feature subsets is a vital task in machine learning. Its main goal is to remove noisy, irrelevant, and redundant feature subsets that could negatively impact the learning model's accuracy and improve classification performance without information loss. Therefore, more advanced optimization methods have been employed to locate the optimal subset of features. This paper presents a binary version of the dwarf mongoose optimization called the BDMO algorithm to solve the high-dimensional feature selection problem. The effectiveness of this approach was validated using 18 high-dimensional datasets from the Arizona State University feature selection repository and compared the efficacy of the BDMO with other well-known feature selection techniques in the literature. The results show that the BDMO outperforms other methods producing the least average fitness value in 14 out of 18 datasets which means that it achieved 77.77% on the overall best fitness values. The result also shows BDMO demonstrating stability by returning the least standard deviation (SD) value in 13 of 18 datasets (72.22%). Furthermore, the study achieved higher validation accuracy in 15 of the 18 datasets (83.33%) over other methods. The proposed approach also yielded the highest validation accuracy attainable in the COIL20 and Leukemia datasets which vividly portray the superiority of the BDMO."
https://openalex.org/W4302363611,"Breast cancer is the second most common malignancy in females worldwide and poses a great challenge that necessitates the identification of novel therapeutic agents from several sources. This research aimed to study the molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations of four proteins (such as PDB: 6CBZ, 1FDW, 5GWK and 2WTT) with the selected phytochemicals from Withania somnifera to identify the potential inhibitors for breast cancer. The molecular docking result showed that among 44 compounds, two of them, Ashwagandhanolide and Withanolide sulfoxide have the potential to inhibit estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), 17-beta-hydroxysteroid -dehydrogenase type 1 (17β-HSD1), topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) and p73 tetramerization domain that are expressed during breast cancer. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations results suggested that Ashwagandhanolide remained inside the binding cavity of four targeted proteins and contributed favorably towards forming a stable protein-ligand complex throughout the simulation. Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) properties confirmed that Ashwagandhanolide is hydrophobic and has moderate intestinal permeability, good intestinal absorption, and poor skin permeability. The compound has a relatively low VDss value (-1.652) and can be transported across ABC transporter and good central nervous system (CNS) permeability but did not easily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This compound does not possess any mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity and skin sensitization. Based on the results obtained, the present study highlights the anticancer potential of Ashwagandhanolide, a compound from W. somnifera. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary to perform before clinical trials to prove the potentiality of Ashwagandhanolide."
https://openalex.org/W4302760599,"In response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, recent research has proposed creating deep learning based models that use chest radiographs (CXRs) in a variety of clinical tasks to help manage the crisis. However, the size of existing datasets of CXRs from COVID-19+ patients are relatively small, and researchers often pool CXR data from multiple sources, for example, using different x-ray machines in various patient populations under different clinical scenarios. Deep learning models trained on such datasets have been shown to overfit to erroneous features instead of learning pulmonary characteristics in a phenomenon known as shortcut learning. We propose adding feature disentanglement to the training process. This technique forces the models to identify pulmonary features from the images and penalizes them for learning features that can discriminate between the original datasets that the images come from. We find that models trained in this way indeed have better generalization performance on unseen data; in the best case we found that it improved AUC by 0.13 on held out data. We further find that this outperforms masking out non-lung parts of the CXRs and performing histogram equalization, both of which are recently proposed methods for removing biases in CXR datasets."
https://openalex.org/W4302761234,"Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is the most common neoplasm originating at the base of the tongue or in the tonsils or soft palate. In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in OPSCC.Tumor tissues of patients with locally advanced OPSCC were analyzed using quantitative multiplex immunohistochemistry. Staining of CD8+ T cells, conventional CD4+FOXP3- T cells (Tconv cells), CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells), CD20+ B cells, and CD68+ macrophages was performed, and cell density was evaluated in both the tumor and its stroma.Among the 71 patients included in this study, males constituted 93.0% of the cohort, and the median age was 59 years (range: 42-80 years). A total of 56 patients (78.9%) had a smoking history, and 53 (74.6%) patients were positive for human papillomavirus (HPV). The most frequent site of OPSCC was the tonsils (70.4%), followed by the base of the tongue (25.4%). The proportion of Treg cells was lower in the tumors of patients with HPV than in those of patients without HPV. Patients with OPSCC whose tumor Treg cell levels were above the median had longer relapse-free survival (RFS) periods than those with tumor Treg cell levels below the median (HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03-0.46; p = 0.02). Our multivariate analysis identified high Treg levels (HR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-1.00; p = 0.05) as an RFS factor that predicted a good prognosis.Our results demonstrated that high Treg cell density in locally advanced OPSCC tumors was correlated with longer RFS."
https://openalex.org/W4302763116,"The importance of emotional labouring and performance of frontline service employees, who in their boundary-spanning positions significantly affect service-rendering organisations' efficiency by their direct communications with customers, continues to increase. However, it is still important to ascertain an efficient understanding of the comprehensive process including behavioural mechanism and a common perception of the rewards' impacts on motivation and creativity. Therefore, guided by self-determination theory, this study examined the mechanism and boundary conditions between emotional labour and job performance (creative and task)-specifically, taking charge has been considered as a mediator and performance-based pay as a moderator in between relationships. The authors selected a time-lagged cross-sectional design to investigate interrelations amongst study variables at two different time points and surveyed 417 team members and 186 team leaders in Pakistan's commercial banks. Findings were consistent with the assumed conceptual framework. For instance, deep-acting affected taking charge positively, surface-acting demonstrated a positive link with task performance and taking charge partially mediated the relationships between deep-acting and performances under boundary conditions of low performance-based pay. By summing up, the study adds to the literature and recommends managerial implications with a more affluent view of nomothetic linkage among frontline employees' emotional labor, HR practices, and the service sector."
https://openalex.org/W4302763284,"Women with breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa are commonly diagnosed at advanced stages. In Tanzania, more than 80% of women are diagnosed with stage III or IV disease, and mortality rates are high. This study explored factors contributing to delayed diagnostic evaluation among women with breast cancer in Tanzania.A qualitative study was performed at Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Twelve women with symptomatic pathologically proven breast cancer were recruited. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Swahili. Interviews explored the women's journey from symptom recognition to diagnosis, including the influence of breast cancer knowledge and pre-conceptions, health seeking behaviors, psychosocial factors, preference for alternative treatments, and the contribution of culture and norms. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and translated into English. Thematic analysis was facilitated by a cloud-based qualitative analysis software.All women reported that their first breast symptom was a self-identified lump or swelling. Major themes for factors contributing to delayed diagnostic presentation of breast cancer included lack of basic knowledge and awareness of breast cancer and misconceptions about the disease. Participants faced barriers with their local primary healthcare providers, including symptom mismanagement and delayed referrals for diagnostic evaluation. Other barriers included financial hardships, fear and stigma of cancer, and use of traditional medicine. The advice and influence of family members and friends played key roles in healthcare-seeking behaviors, serving as both facilitators and barriers.Lack of basic knowledge and awareness of breast cancer, stigma, financial barriers, and local healthcare system barriers were common factors contributing to delayed diagnostic presentation of breast cancer. The influence of friends and family also played key roles as both facilitators and barriers. This information will inform the development of educational intervention strategies to address these barriers and improve earlier diagnosis of symptomatic breast cancer in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W4302363627,"Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) is an intensive and multi-modal intervention developed for individuals with multiple comorbidities and high-risk behaviours. During pandemic-related lockdowns, many DBT services transitioned to delivering treatment via telehealth, but some did not. The current study sought to explore the experience of DBT teams in Australia and New Zealand who did and did not transition to telehealth during the early stages of the COVID19 pandemic, as the majority of research on DBT via telehealth has originated from North America, and focussed on therapists who did make this transition. DBT team leaders in Australia and New Zealand completed a survey with open-ended questions about the barriers they encountered to delivering DBT via telehealth, and for those teams that implemented telehealth, the solutions to those barriers. Respondents were also asked about specific barriers encountered by Indigenous and Pacific people service users. Of the 73 team leaders who took part, 56 reported providing either individual therapy, skills training or both modalities via video-call during lockdown. Themes emerging from perceived barriers affecting just DBT providers included the assessment & management of emotions and high-risk behaviours, threats to privacy and information security posed by telehealth, logistical issues related to remote sessions, and the remote management of therapy-interfering behaviour. Themes emerging from perceived barriers affecting both providers and service users included disruptions to therapeutic alliance, lack of willingness, lack of technical knowledge, lack of private spaces to do DBT via telehealth, and lack of resources. The solutions most frequently cited were the provision of education and training for therapists and service users in the use of telehealth, and the provision of resources to access telehealth. These findings are relevant to clinical delivery of DBT, as well as planning and funding for DBT telehealth services."
https://openalex.org/W4302363631,"In Brazil, the notification of congenital (CS) and syphilis in pregnant women (SiP) is compulsory. Notification data provided by the Ministry of Health in combination with the mapping of vulnerable geographic areas is essential to forecasting possible outbreaks and more effectively combating infection through monitoring. We aim to evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution and epidemiological aspects of reported cases of CS and SiP in Brazil. A retrospective ecological study was carried out using secondary surveillance data obtained from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) database, considering all reported cases of CS and SiP between 2001 to 2017. Epidemiological characteristics and time trends were analyzed using joinpoint regression models and spatial distribution, considering microregions or states/macroregions as units of analysis. A total of 188,630 (359/100,000 birth lives) CS and 235,895 of SiP (6.3/100,000 inhabitants) were reported during the period studied. In general, the epidemiologic profile of Brazil indicates most reported CS cases occurred in ""mixed-race"" newborns who were diagnosed within seven days of birth and whose mothers had received prenatal care, but the epidemiologic profile varies by Brazilian macroregion. Regarding SiP, most cases were among women who self-reported 'mixed-race', were aged 20-39 years, had up to eight years of formal education and were diagnosed with primary or latent syphilis. Approximately 549 (98.4%) and 558 (100%) microregions reported at least one case of CS and SiP, respectively. From 2012 to 2016, CS cases increased significantly in almost all Brazilian states, most notably in the South, Southeast, and Central-West macroregions, from 2001-2017 and the relative risk (RR) of SiP increased around 400% (RR: 1,00 to 445,50). Considering the epidemiological scenario of the infection in Brazil, it is necessary to enhance preventive, control and eradication measures."
https://openalex.org/W4302763280,"Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are a costly and pervasive medical problem for millions of aging men. Recent studies have showed that peri-urethral tissue fibrosis is an untreated pathobiology contributing to LUTS. Fibrosis results from excessive extracellular matrix deposition which increases transition zone and peri-urethral tissue stiffness and compromises prostatic urethral flexibility and compliance, producing urinary obstructive symptoms. Inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, and T-lymphocytes, secrete a medley of pro-fibrotic proteins into the prostatic microenvironment, including IFNγ, TNFα, CXC-type chemokines, and interleukins, all of which have been implicated in inflammation-mediated fibrosis. Among these, IL-4 and IL-13 are of particular interest because they share a common signaling axis that, as shown here for the first time, promotes the expression and maintenance of IL-4, IL-13, their cognate receptors, and ECM components by prostate fibroblasts, even in the absence of immune cells. Based on studies presented here, we hypothesize that the IL-4/IL-13 axis promotes prostate fibroblast activation to ECM-secreting cells.N1 or SFT1 immortalized prostate stromal fibroblasts were cultured and treated, short- or long-term, with pro-fibrotic proteins including IL-4, IL-13, TGF-β, TNF-α, IFNγ, with or without prior pre-treatment with antagonists or inhibitors. Protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, ELISA, immunoblot, or Sircoll assays. Transcript expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR. Intact cells were counted using WST assays.IL-4Rα, IL-13Rα1, and collagen are concurrently up-regulated in human peri-urethral prostate tissues from men with LUTS. IL-4 and IL-13 induce their own expression as well as that of their cognate receptors, IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1. Low concentrations of IL-4 or IL-13 act as cytokines to promote prostate fibroblast proliferation, but higher (>40ng/ml) concentrations repress cellular proliferation. Both IL-4 and IL-13 robustly and specifically promote collagen transcript and protein expression by prostate stromal fibroblasts in a JAK/STAT-dependent manner. Moreover, IL-4 and IL-13-mediated JAK/STAT signaling is coupled to activation of the IL-4Rα receptor.Taken together, these studies show that IL-4 and IL-13 signal through the IL-4Rα receptor to activate JAK/STAT signaling, thereby promoting their own expression, that of their cognate receptors, and collagens. These finding suggest that the IL-4/IL-13 signaling axis is a powerful, but therapeutically targetable, pro-fibrotic mechanism in the lower urinary tract."
https://openalex.org/W4302363629,"To assess baseline characteristics and antithrombotic treatment (ATT) prescription patterns in patients enrolled in the third phase of the GLORIA-AF Registry Program, evaluate predictors of treatment prescription, and compare results with phase II.GLORIA-AF is a large, global, prospective registry program, enrolling patients with newly diagnosed nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) at risk of stroke. Patients receiving dabigatran were followed for two years in phase II, and all patients were followed for 3 years in phase III. Phase II started when dabigatran became available; phase III started when the characteristics of patients receiving dabigatran became roughly comparable with those receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKAs).Between 2014 and 2016, 21,241 patients were enrolled in phase III. In total, 82% of patients were prescribed oral anticoagulation ([OAC]; 59.5% novel/nonvitamin K oral anticoagulants [NOACs], 22.7% VKAs). A further 11% of patients were prescribed antiplatelets without OAC and 7% were prescribed no ATT. A high stroke risk was the main driver of OAC prescription. Factors associated with prescription of VKA over NOAC included type of site, region, physician specialty, and impaired kidney function.Over the past few years, data from phase III of GLORIA-AF show that OACs have become the standard treatment option, with most newly diagnosed AF patients prescribed a NOAC. However, in some regions a remarkable proportion of patients remain undertreated. In comparison with phase II, more patients received NOACs in phase III while the prescription of VKA decreased. VKAs were preferred over NOACs in patients with impaired kidney function."

It worked well in removing organic dyes from aqueous solutions. Contact time, pH, dosage, initial concentration and temperature were studied. The optimum conditions were achieved by using 20 mg/L dye concentration, 50 mg dose of adsorbent and pH 9.0 at room temperature. The adsorption process was remarkably fast and reached equilibrium within 10 min for both Brilliant Green and Malachite Green while 70 min for Safranin. The batch adsorption experiments followed a pseudo 2nd order and Langmuir model with maximum adsorption capacity 19.26 mg/g, 18.28 mg/g, and 14.35 mg/g for Brilliant Green, Malachite green and Safranin respectively. The process was endothermic and spontaneous in nature. Adsorbent regeneration test provides an excellent value 5 times."
https://openalex.org/W4302363718,"Qualitative studies have described girls' varying levels of confidence in managing their menstruation, with greater confidence hypothesized to positively impact health, education, and social participation outcomes. Yet, measurement of this and other psychosocial components of adolescent girls' menstrual experiences has been weak in global health research, in part due to a dearth of appropriate psychometric tools. We describe the development and validation of the Self-Efficacy in Addressing Menstrual Needs Scale (SAMNS-26).We conducted nine focus group discussions with girls in schools in rural and urban Bangladesh to identify tasks involved in menstrual self-care. This informed our creation of an initial pool of 50 items, which were reviewed by menstrual health experts and refined through 21 cognitive interviews with schoolgirls. Using a self-administered survey, we administered 34 refined items plus additional validation measures to a random sample of 381 post-menarcheal girls (ages 9-17) and retested a subsample of 42 girls two weeks later. We examined the measure's dimensionality using exploratory factor analysis and assessed internal consistency, temporal stability, and construct validity.Exploratory factor analysis suggested a 26-item scale comprising three correlated sub-scales: the 17-item Menstrual Hygiene Preparation and Maintenance (α = 0.86), the 5-item Menstrual Pain Management (α = 0.87), and the 4-item Executing Stigmatized Tasks (α = 0.77). Sub-scales exhibited good temporal stability. SAMNS-26 scores correlated negatively with measures of anxiety, and girls who preferred to stay at home during their periods had lower SAMNS-26 scores than those who did not.The SAMNS-26 provides a reliable measure of a schoolgirl's confidence in her capabilities to address her menstrual needs. There is initial evidence to support the measure's construct validity in the Bangladesh context as indicated by its relationships with other factors in its theorized nomological network. The tool enables incorporation of self-efficacy into multivariate models for exploring the relationships among antecedents to menstrual experiences and hypothesized impacts on health, wellbeing, and education attainment. Further testing of the tool is recommended to strengthen evidence of its validity in additional contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4302760590,"The bronchoscopy (BS) experience provokes anxiety amongst some patients. It can have a negative impact on the course of the procedure and on the willingness of patients to undergo the next BS in the future.We aimed to identify factors influencing patients' satisfaction with BS.The prospective study had been conducted between January and June 2019. It included patients hospitalized in our Department, who underwent elective BS. Patients assessed their anxiety and satisfaction level before and after BS using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Data concerning the course of the bronchoscopy was collected.The median level of anxiety prior to the procedure was moderate, higher in women (p<0.0001). The majority of patients (116/125, 93%) were satisfied with appropriate information before the procedure. Almost one-third of the interviewees (39/125, 31%) declared complete satisfaction (VAS = 0) with their procedure, 17 patients (14%) were dissatisfied (VAS >5/10). Overall 113 (90%) patients declared unconditional consent for future bronchoscopy. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed two factors affecting patients' satisfaction with bronchoscopy: anxiety prior to BS (standardized regression coefficient β = 0.264, p = 0.003) and discomfort (β = 0.205, p = 0.018). Neither age, degree of amnesia, duration of the procedure nor its type added any significant value as factors affecting patient satisfaction. The most common factors inducing patients' discomfort during BS were local anesthesia of the throat (56/125, 45%) and cough (47/125, 38%).Low anxiety level before bronchoscopy and reduced discomfort during the procedure are associated with better patient satisfaction. Thus, it is important to reduce patient anxiety and discomfort during the procedure."
https://openalex.org/W4302761428,"Previous cross-sectional studies have indicated that low relative appendicular lean mass (ALM) against body weight (divided by body weight, ALM/Wt, or divided by body mass index, ALM/BMI) was negatively associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Conversely, previous cross-sectional studies have indicated that the absolute ALM or ALM divided by squared height (ALM/Ht 2 ) were positively associated with MetS. The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate the association between low absolute or relative skeletal muscle mass, leg muscle power, or percent body fat and the development of MetS in Japanese women in a 7-y prospective study. The study participants included 346 Japanese women aged 26 to 85 years. The participants were divided into low and high groups based on the median values of ALM/Wt, ALM/BMI, ALM/Ht 2 , absolute ALM, or leg power. The longitudinal relationship between ALM indices or leg power and MetS development was examined using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models (average follow-up duration 7 years, range 1 to 10 years). During follow-up, 24 participants developed MetS. MetS incidence was higher in the low ALM/Wt group than the high ALM/Wt group even after controlling for age, obesity, waist circumference, family history of diabetes, smoking, and physical activity [adjusted hazard ratio = 5.60 (95% CI; 1.04–30.0)]. In contrast, MetS incidence was lower in the low ALM/Ht 2 group than the high ALM/Ht 2 group [adjusted hazard ratio = 10.6 (95%CI; 1.27–89.1)]. MetS incidence was not significantly different between the low and high ALM/BMI, absolute ALM, and leg power groups. Both ALM/Ht 2 and ALM/Wt were not significant predictive variables for MetS development when fat mass or percent body fat was taken into account in the Cox model. At the very least, the results of this study underscore the importance of body composition measurements in that percent body fat, but not ALM, is associated with MetS development."
https://openalex.org/W4302761459,"A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was undertaken to unravel marker-trait associations (MTAs) between SNP markers and phenotypic traits. It involved a subset of 421 cacao accessions from the large and diverse collection conserved ex situ at the International Cocoa Genebank Trinidad. A Mixed Linear Model (MLM) in TASSEL was used for the GWAS and followed by confirmatory analyses using GAPIT FarmCPU. An average linkage disequilibrium (r2) of 0.10 at 5.2 Mb was found across several chromosomes. Seventeen significant (P ≤ 8.17 × 10-5 (-log10 (p) = 4.088)) MTAs of interest, including six that pertained to yield-related traits, were identified using TASSEL MLM. The latter accounted for 5 to 17% of the phenotypic variation expressed. The highly significant association (P ≤ 8.17 × 10-5) between seed length to width ratio and TcSNP 733 on chromosome 5 was verified with FarmCPU (P ≤ 1.12 × 10-8). Fourteen MTAs were common to both the TASSEL and FarmCPU models at P ≤ 0.003. The most significant yield-related MTAs involved seed number and seed length on chromosome 7 (P ≤ 1.15 × 10-14 and P ≤ 6.75 × 10-05, respectively) and seed number on chromosome 1 (P ≤ 2.38 × 10-05), based on the TASSEL MLM. It was noteworthy that seed length, seed length to width ratio and seed number were associated with markers at different loci, indicating their polygenic nature. Approximately 40 candidate genes that encode embryo and seed development, protein synthesis, carbohydrate transport and lipid biosynthesis and transport were identified in the flanking regions of the significantly associated SNPs and in linkage disequilibrium with them. A significant association of fruit surface anthocyanin intensity co-localised with MYB-related protein 308 on chromosome 4. Testing of a genomic selection approach revealed good predictive value (genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV)) for economic traits such as seed number (GEBV = 0.611), seed length (0.6199), seed width (0.5435), seed length to width ratio (0.5503), seed/cotyledon mass (0.6014) and ovule number (0.6325). The findings of this study could facilitate genomic selection and marker-assisted breeding of cacao thereby expediting improvement in the yield potential of cacao planting material."
https://openalex.org/W4302762761,"Gasdermin A (GSDMA) and gasdermin B (GSDMB) have been associated with childhood and adult asthma in many populations including the Jordanian population. It is also known that IgE plays a crucial role in various allergic disorders, such elevated levels of total serum IgE were detected in asthma and allergic rhinitis. IgE immunoglobulin is responsible for the release of numerous inflammatory mediators, such as histamine and prostaglandins, from mast cells in asthmatic patients.In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms of GSDMA (rs7212938, T/G) and GSDMB (rs7216389, T/C) in Jordanian population were investigated for their association with total IgE levels in serum of asthmatic children and adult subjects.The genetic polymorphism analysis for SNPs was performed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/restriction fragment length polymorphism method (RFLP). Three analysis models were applied to the genotype data: co-dominant, dominant and recessive.Our data demonstrate a significant correlation between GSDMB genetic SNP (rs7216389) and the total IgE serum level. Where one minor allele in the GSDMB gene is sufficient to induce significant changes in the IgE serum levels and plays a role in the pathogenesis of asthma in asthmatic children of the Jordanian population. Suggesting that this polymorphism might have a protective effect against asthma risk. While the presence of the GSDMB polymorphism alone might not be sufficient to associate with the high risk of developing asthma or responding to it in adults in Jordanian population.In conclusion, the current study confirms the significant association of GSDMB genetic SNP (rs7216389) with IgE levels in asthma patients in Jordanian population, while no significant correlation of GSDMA and IgE level was found in both child and adult asthmatic patients."
https://openalex.org/W4302762847,"Tendons consist of passive soft tissue with non linear material properties. They play a key role in force transmission from muscle to skeletal structure. The properties of tendons have been extensively examined in vitro. In this work, a non linear model of the distal biceps brachii tendon was parameterized based on measurements of myotendinous junction displacements in vivo at different load forces and elbow angles. The myotendinous junction displacement was extracted from ultrasound B-mode images within an experimental setup which also allowed for the retrieval of the exerted load forces as well as the elbow joint angles. To quantify the myotendinous junction movement based on visual features from ultrasound images, a manual and an automatic method were developed. The performance of both methods was compared. By means of exemplary data from three subjects, reliable fits of the tendon model were achieved. Further, different aspects of the non linear tendon model generated in this way could be reconciled with individual experiments from literature."
https://openalex.org/W4302763371,"The occurrence of freezing stress around herbicides application is one of the most important factors influencing their performance. This experiment was performed to evaluate the efficacy of clodinafop-propargyl and 2,4-D plus MCPA (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid plus 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid), the most important herbicides used in wheat fields in Iran, under the influence of a freezing treatment (-4°C). Wheat and its two common weeds, winter wild oat (Avena ludoviciana Durieu) and turnipweed [Rapistrum rugosum (L.) All.], were exposed to the freezing treatment for three nights from 7:00 P.M. to 5:00 A.M. before and after herbicide application, and their response was compared with plants that did not grow under freezing stress. Under no freezing (NF) and freezing after spray (FAS) conditions, winter wild oat was completely controlled with the recommended dose of clodinafop-propargyl (64 g ai ha-1; hereafter g ha-1). However, the survival percentage of winter wild oat in the freezing before spray (FBS) of clodinafop-propargyl 64 g ha-1 was 7%, and it was completely controlled with twice the recommended dose (128 g ha-1). Under NF conditions and FAS treatment, turnipweed was completely controlled with twice the recommended dose of 2,4-D plus MCPA (2025 g ae ha-1; hereafter g ha-1), while there was no complete control under recommended rate. However, in the FBS treatment, the survival of turnipweed was 7% under double dose. The LD50 (dose required to control 50% of individuals in the population) and GR50 (dose causing 50% growth reduction of plants) rankings were NF<FBS<FAS for clodinafop-propargyl and NF<FAS<FBS for 2,4-D plus MCPA. Selectivity index for clodinafop-propargyl in NF conditions, FBS, and FAS treatments was 2.4, 0.91, and 0.78, respectively, and, for 2,4-D plus MCPA, it was 2.6, 0.12, and 0.88, respectively. According to the results of LD50, it can be stated that the freezing stress after the spraying of clodinafop-propargyl and before the spraying of 2,4-D plus MCPA would further reduce the efficacy of these herbicides."
https://openalex.org/W4294537094,"The economic literature is so far overwhelmingly dedicated to the effect of incidental emotions on virtuous behavior. However, it is not so explicit for destructive behavior and the way it evolves with emotional states. To fill this gap, we explore how incidental emotions impact antisocial behavior in a laboratory experiment. As our vehicle of research, we used the open treatment of the joy-of-destruction mini-game. In addition to that, we elicited players' first and second-order beliefs via an incentivized questionnaire. We find that destructive behavior is driven by two motives: spite (Machiavellian traits) and preemptive retaliation (Expected destruction by partners). Emotional states do not impact destructive behavior directly. However, positive emotions brighten the expectations of other player beliefs on his partner's destruction, and indirectly reduces the willingness to destroy partner's money."
https://openalex.org/W4302363556,"Background Variations in cancer occurrence between populations in different places are expected because of many factors. In Ethiopia there is no national cancer registry and here we are reporting the pattern of cancer in Wolaita Sodo University hospital located in Southern region of Ethiopia with catchment area of over ten million peoples. Methodology A retrospective record analysis of all pathologically confirmed malignancies from January 2021 up to June 2021. Data was filtered and descriptive analysis was done using IBM SPSS version 22 (Chicago IL USA). Result In the Wolaita Sodo University Teaching Referral Hospital during the first six months of 2021, out of 1,810 histopathologically tested samples 19.5% (354) were confirmed malignant cases. Among 354 patient samples, most of them (62.4%) were in females and the rest (37%) found to be in males. The age pattern shows occurrence of 336 (95%) cases in adults and 18 (5%) cases in children. Breast cancer, soft tissue sarcomas, cancer of uteri cervix, non melanomatous skin cancer, and non hodgkin lymphomas were the five top common cancers of all age groups. In adult population, breast cancer, soft tissue sarcomas, and cancer of uteri cervix are the most common. In children of age less than 14 years non hodgkin lymphomas, soft tissue sarcomas and bone sarcomas were the three top cancers. Breast cancer, cancer of uteri cervix and soft tissue sarcomas are found to be the commonest cancers in females. On the other hand, soft tissue sarcomas, non melanomatous skin cancers and Non Hodgkin lymphomas, are the three top commonest cancers in males. Conclusion Based on our current study cancer is one of the common finding from histopathology samples analyzed at the hospital and the pattern of cancer was similar to those reported in other regions of the country as well as neighboring countries. However, Comprehensive demographic and clinical data using population or facility-based cancer registry is required to get better information. Additionally, our finding of higher proportion of soft tissue sarcomas both in males and females of all age groups in this region is disparate and requires further investigation."

The potential of ultrasound B-mode image texture features in monitoring temperature or coagulation zones studied in this article. Materials and methods The experiments carried out on eighteen in vitro porcine liver samples heated from 20°C to 60°C in the water bath. The ultrasound radiofrequency signal at different temperature collected to reconstruct B-mode ultrasound images. The texture features based on gray level histogram (GLH), gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix (GGCM) extracted, respectively. Accordingly, we analyze the correlations between these texture features and temperature based on the experiment results. Results The results showed that five texture feature parameters closely related to temperature, including mean gray scale of GLH, homogeneity of GLCM, hybrid entropy, inverse difference moment, and correlation of GGCM. Some of these feature parameters have correlation coefficients larger than 0.9 within the temperature range of 20°C to 60°C. Conclusions The above-mentioned five feature parameters expected to apply for noninvasive monitoring of MH or TA."
https://openalex.org/W4302363781,"Although gait speed changes are associated with various geriatric conditions, standard gait analysis systems, such as laboratory-based motion capture systems or instrumented walkways, are too expensive, spatially limited, and difficult to access. A wearable inertia sensor is cheap and easy to access; however, its accuracy in estimating gait speed is limited. In this study, we developed a model for accurately estimating the gait speed of healthy older adults using the data captured by an inertia sensor placed at their center of body mass (CoM). We enrolled 759 healthy older adults from two population-based cohort studies and asked them to walk on a 14 m long walkway thrice at comfortable paces with an inertia sensor attached to their CoM. In the middle of the walkway, we placed GAITRite ™ to obtain the gold standard of gait speed. We then divided the participants into three subgroups using the normalized step length and developed a linear regression model for estimating the gold standard gait speed using age, foot length, and the features obtained from an inertia sensor, including cadence, vertical height displacement, yaw angle, and role angle of CoM. Our model exhibited excellent accuracy in estimating the gold standard gait speed (mean absolute error = 3.74%; root mean square error = 5.30 cm/s ; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.954). Our model may contribute to the early detection and monitoring of gait disorders and other geriatric conditions by making gait assessment easier, cheaper, and more ambulatory while remaining as accurate as other standard gait analysis systems."

WBPs were prepared by fermenting whey with seven lactic acid bacteria, Limosilactobacillus fermentum SMFM2017-CK1 (LF-CK1), L . plantarum SMFM2017-NK2 (LP-NK2), Pediococcus pentosaceus SMFM2017-NK1 (PP-NK1), L . plantarum SMFM2017-NK1 (LP-NK1), L . paraplantarum SMFM2017-YK1 (LPP-YK1), L . plantarum SMFM2017-YK1 (LP-YK1), and L . fermentum SMFM2017-NK1 (LF-NK1)]; the pH of the fermented whey was adjusted to 6.5, followed by centrifugation. WBPs were examined for their effect on cell viability and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens. The selected WBPs were used in animal experiments. After inducing periodontitis through right mandibular first molar ligation, WBPs were administered orally for 8 weeks. After sacrifice, gene and protein expression analyses of genes related to inflammatory and oxidative stress were performed, and histopathological analysis of gingival tissue was conducted. Our results showed that LP-YK1 WBP (WBP produced by LP-YK1) and LF-NK1 WBP (WBP produced by LF-NK1) groups exerted higher anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects compared to the control group ( p &lt; 0.05). Histopathological analysis revealed that infiltration of inflammatory cells and epithelial cell proliferation were reduced in the LP-YK1 WBP group. These results indicate that WBPs prepared with LP-YK1 can be used as a postbiotic to alleviate periodontitis."

The Kenya government is promoting the use of modern methods of family planning through various mechanisms. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with the use of LAPM among married women of reproductive age in targeted rural sub-counties of Kilifi and Kisii counties, Kenya. Baseline and end line Data from a program implemented on improving Access to Quality Care and Extending and Strengthening Health Systems (AQCESS) in Kilifi and Kisii counties of Kenya were used. Multi-stage sampling was used to sample 1117 and 1873 women for the end line and baseline surveys, respectively. Descriptive analysis was used to explore the respondents' characteristics and use of LAPM on a self-weighted samples. Univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression models using svy command were used to assess factors associated with the use of LAPM. A total of 762 and 531 women for the baseline and end line survey, respectively were included in this study. The prevalence of use of LAPM for baseline and end line survey were 21.5% (95% CI: 18.7-24.6%) and 23.2% (95% CI: 19.6%-27.0%), p-value = 0.485. The use of LAPM in Kisii and Kilifi counties was higher than the national average in both surveys. The multivariable analysis for the end line survey showed having 3-5 number of children ever born (aOR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.24-3.36) and future fertility preference to have another child (aOR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.26-0.96) were significantly associated with odds of LAPM use. The baseline showed that having at least secondary education (aOR = 1.93; 95%CI: 1.04-3.60), joint decision making about woman's own health (aOR = 2.08; 95%CI: 1.36-3.17), and intention to have another child in future (aOR = 0.59; 95%CI: 0.40-0.89) were significantly associated with the use of LAPM. Future fertility preference to have another child was significantly associated with the use of LAPM in the two surveys. Continued health promotion and targeted media campaigns on the use of LAPM in rural areas with low socioeconomic status is needed in order to improve utilization of these methods. Programs involving men in decision making on partner's health including family planning in the rural areas should be encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W4302761395,"Background Physical, emotional, and social changes, including exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, increases youth vulnerability to mental illness. These factors interfere with development, limit opportunities, and hamper achievement of a fulfilling life as adults. Addressing these issues can lead to improved outcomes at the population level and better cost-effectiveness for health services. Cash transfer programs have been a promising way to address social drivers for poor mental health. However, it is still unclear which pathways and mechanisms explain the association between socioeconomic support and lower mental illness among youth. Therefore, we will evaluate the effect of social drivers on youth mental health-related hospitalizations and suicide, test mechanisms and pathways of a countrywide socioeconomic intervention, and examine the timing of the intervention during the life course. Methods We will combine individual-level data from youth national hospitalization, mental health disorders and attempted suicide, suicide registries and notifications of violence, with large-scale databases, including “The 100 Million Brazilian Cohort”, over an 18-year period (2001–2018). Several approaches will be used for the retrospective quasi-experimental impact evaluations, such as Regression Discontinuity Designs, Propensity Score Matching and difference-in-differences, combined with multivariable regressions for cohort analyses. We will run multivariate regressions based on hierarchical analysis approach to evaluate the association between important social drivers (mental health care, demographic and economic aspects) on mental health-related hospitalizations and suicide among youth. Furthermore, we will perform microsimulations to generate projections regarding how mental health-related hospitalizations and suicide trends will be in the future based on the current state, and how BFP implementation scenarios will affect these trends. Discussion The results of this project will be of vital importance to guide policies and programs to improve mental health and reduce mental health-related hospitalizations and suicide in youth. It will provide information to improve the effectiveness of these programs worldwide. If cash transfers can decrease mental health problems among youth and reduce suicide."
https://openalex.org/W4302761542,"HIV-related stigma exacerbates Latino immigrants' risk of HIV infection and delayed care. Following the implementation of the social marketing campaign Sólo Se Vive Una Vez (You Only Live Once) to increase HIV testing that addressed stigmatizing beliefs, we conducted a survey among Latinos in Baltimore, Maryland (N = 357). The aims of this paper are to 1) characterize the sociodemographic characteristics, HIV-related stigma beliefs, and testing behaviors of the survey respondents by campaign exposure, and 2) model the effects of Vive exposure on stigma beliefs and testing behaviors. Comparing post-campaign survey respondents exposed and unexposed to the campaign to survey findings previously obtained and reported before the campaign implementation, respondents to the post-Vive survey continued to hold high levels of stigma beliefs, and compared to the pre-Vive survey sample, were more likely to hold four or more stigmatizing beliefs (from the six survey items). Among the post-Vive survey respondents, those for whom religion was important or very important had an increased odds of 1.6 of holding four or more stigmatizing beliefs. Survey respondents who were exposed to the campaign, however, had an increased odds of 2.25 of reporting ever having been tested for HIV. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the changing social context in addressing stigma within emerging immigrant communities and highlight the critical role of religious leaders in efforts to address HIV-related stigma."
https://openalex.org/W4302762764,"Individual cow identification is a prerequisite for intelligent dairy farming management, and is important for achieving accurate and informative dairy farming. Computer vision-based approaches are widely considered because of their non-contact and practical advantages. In this study, a method based on the combination of Ghost and attention mechanism is proposed to improve ReNet50 to achieve non-contact individual recognition of cows. In the model, coarse-grained features of cows are extracted using a large sensory field of cavity convolution, while reducing the number of model parameters to some extent. ResNet50 consists of two Bottlenecks with different structures, and a plug-and-play Ghost module is inserted between the two Bottlenecks to reduce the number of parameters and computation of the model using common linear operations without reducing the feature map. In addition, the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is introduced after each stage of the model to help the model to give different weights to each part of the input and extract the more critical and important information. In our experiments, a total of 13 cows' side view images were collected to train the model, and the final recognition accuracy of the model was 98.58%, which was 4.8 percentage points better than the recognition accuracy of the original ResNet50, the number of model parameters was reduced by 24.85 times, and the model size was only 3.61 MB. In addition, to verify the validity of the model, it is compared with other networks and the results show that our model has good robustness. This research overcomes the shortcomings of traditional recognition methods that require human extraction of features, and provides theoretical references for further animal recognition."

(Pgt) threatens the global production of both durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (Desf.) Husnot) and common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The objective of this study was to evaluate a durum wheat recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a cross between a susceptible parent 'DAKIYE' and a resistant parent 'Reichenbachii' developed by the International Center for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat (CIMMYT) 1) for seedling response to races JRCQC and TTRTF and 2) for field response to a bulk of the current Pgt races prevalent in Ethiopia and Kenya and 3) to map loci associated with seedling and field resistances in this population. A total of 224 RILs along with their parents were evaluated at the seedling stage in the Ethiopian Institute for Agricultural Research greenhouse at Debre Zeit, Ethiopia and in the EIAR and KALRO fields in Ethiopia and Kenya, for two seasons from 2019 to 2020. The lines were genotyped using the genotyping-by-sequencing approach. A total of 843 single nucleotide polymorphism markers for 175 lines were used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses. Composite interval mapping (CIM) identified three QTL on chromosomes 3B, 4B and 7B contributed by the resistant parent. The QTL on chromosome 3B was identified at all growth stages and it explained 11.8%, 6.5%, 6.4% and 15.3% of the phenotypic variation for responses to races JRCQC, TTRTF and in the field trials ETMS19 and KNMS19, respectively. The power to identify additional QTL in this population was limited by the number of high-quality markers, since several markers with segregation distortion were eliminated. A cytological study is needed to understand the presence of chromosomal rearrangements. Future evaluations of additional durum lines and RIL families identification of durable adult plant resistance sources is crucial for breeding stem rust resistance in durum wheat in the future."

The objective of the study was to evaluate the maternal and fetal morbidity of homozygous sickle cell pregnant pregnant women with complicated malaria.We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 982 pregnancies in sickle cell pregnant women, during which a group of sickle cell pregnant women who received antimalarial chemoprophylaxis was compared to another group without chemoprophylaxis. We analyzed the clinical evolution of pregnant women (VOCs and transfusions, pregnancy weight gain) and parasite (parasite density at the time of diagnosis of complicated malaria and during treatment for three days). We analyzed the parameters of newborns at birth (age of pregnancy at the time of delivery, birth weight, weight of the placenta and histopathological examination of the placenta.Out of 982 pregnancies, 15% of pregnant women suffered from complicated malaria, 57% suffered from uncomplicated malaria and 28% did not suffer from malaria. Pregnancy weight gain, birth weight, was better in the group of pregnant women who received chemoprophylaxis and the placenta had less histological lesions. Parasite density was low. There was a significant positive correlation between parasite density and the number of CVOs and transfusions and between parasite density and histological lesions of the placenta and low birth weight.Complicated malaria is associated with high maternal and fetal morbidity in sickle cell patients. Malaria chemoprophylaxis can reduce maternal and fetal complications and parasite density during malaria infection."

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of the rifamycin derivative, rifalazil (RLZ) (also known as KRM-1648), in an advanced M . ulcerans infection model. Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were infected with 3.25 x 10 4 colony-forming units (CFU) of M . ulcerans subcutaneously into the bilateral hind footpads. At 33 days post-infection, when the footpads exhibited significant redness and swelling, mice were treated orally with 5 or 10 mg/kg of RLZ for up to 15 weeks. Mice were followed for an additional 15 weeks following treatment cessation. Untreated mice exhibited a progressive increase in footpad redness, swelling, and erosion over time, and all untreated mice reached to endpoint within 5–8 weeks post-bacterial injection. In the RLZ-treated mice, footpad redness and swelling and general condition improved or completely healed, and no recurrence occurred following treatment cessation. After 3 weeks of treatment, the CFU counts from the footpads of recovered RLZ-treated mice showed a 10 4 decrease compared with those of untreated mice. We observed a further reduction in CFU counts to the detection limit following 6 to 15 weeks of treatment, which did not increase 15 weeks after discontinuing the treatment. Histopathologically, bacteria in the treated mice became fragmented one week after RLZ-treatment. At the final point of the experiment, all the treated mice (5mg/kg/day; n = 6, 10mg/kg/day; n = 7) survived and had no signs of M . ulcerans infection. These results indicate that the rifamycin analogue, RLZ, is efficacious in the treatment of an advanced M . ulcerans infection mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W4302763098,"A social network is one of the efficient tools for information propagation. The content is the bridge between the product and its customers. Evaluating the user's content creation is a valuable feature to improve information spreading on the social network. This paper proposes a method for extracting brand value with influencers by combining the user's amplification and content creation in influencer marketing. The amplification factors are studied based on the propagation of the posts on the social network in a duration time. Those factors are more valuable than before when using influencer marketing at a determined time. Moreover, the content creation score is also studied to measure content creation based on the passion point with a brand and its quality. The amplification factors and content creation score are combined to analyze posts' interest in detecting the emerging influent users for a product in the influencer marketing campaign. Using the amplification factors, the passion points, and the content creation score, a system to manage the influencer marketing on Facebook has been constructed and tested in the real-world campaign. The experimental results show that the proposed method's influencers bring the conversion rate's efficiency and revenue in the influencer marketing campaign."
https://openalex.org/W4302363599,"We investigated the succession process of intestinal bacteria during seed production in full-cycle aquaculture of Pacific bluefin tuna ( Thunnus orientalis ). During the seed production, eggs, healthy fish, rearing water, and feeds from three experimental rounds in 2012 and 2013 were collected before transferring to offshore net cages and subjected to a fragment analysis of the bacterial community structure. We identified a clear succession of intestinal bacteria in bluefin tuna during seed production. While community structures of intestinal bacteria in the early stage of larvae were relatively similar to those of rearing water and feed, the bacterial community structures seen 17 days after hatching were different. Moreover, although intestinal bacteria in the late stage of larvae were less diverse than those in the early stage of larvae, the specific bacteria were predominant, suggesting that the developed intestinal environment of the host puts selection pressure on the bacteria in the late stage. The specific bacteria in the late stage of larvae, which likely composed ‘core microbiota’, were also found on the egg surface. The present study highlights that proper management of the seed production process, including the preparation of rearing water, feeds, and fish eggs, is important for the aquaculture of healthy fish."

We use BERT to extract text features, and use Faster R-CNN to ex-tract visual features to provide a useful input representation for our model to answer questions. In addition, we have constructed a Modality Attention Fusion (MAF) framework for the attention fusion matrix from different modalities (video, subtitles, QA), and use a Hybrid Multi-headed Self-attention (HMS) to further determine the correct answer. Experiments on three separate scene datasets show our overall model outperforms the baseline methods by a large margin.

This study was completed in two parts. The first portion (Norming Study) was a US online survey conducted to serve as a reference population. The Norming Study included a total of 139 patients with CLL, excluding those treated with ibrutinib: 64 were treatment naive (Tx naive), 36 were 1st line (1L), and 38 were in or had completed ≥2 lines (2L+) patients with CLL. The second portion (CLL Ibrutinib Study) included 1L and 2L+ ibrutinib patients with CLL treated for ≥6 months in which 118 patients (1L n = 88 and 2L+ n = 30) completed the study. Respondents completed demographic and clinical information and the following HRQoL surveys: (Short Form-12v2® Health Survey [SF-12v2], Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G], FACT-Leukemia [FACT-Leu] Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy [FACIT]-Fatigue, and Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire [CTSQ]). Higher scores indicate better HRQoL/treatment satisfaction. Differences in effect sizes between the two samples at the group level were calculated using Hedges' g. Medium to large positive effects were seen in the CLL Ibrutinib group on several measures compared to the Reference Study groups. The FACT-G total score was 89.2±11.1 for CLL Ibrutinib Study patients compared to 75.8±22.6 CLL Norming Tx naïve patients, 61.3±21.8 in 1L, and 61.7±20.7 in 2L+. Similar trends were seen with FACT-Leu total score and FACIT-Fatigue. CLL Ibrutinib Study patients scored higher on all CTSQ domain scores compared to the CLL Norming patients treated with other CLL therapies. We found that Ibrutinib-treatment had better HRQoL and treatment satisfaction compared to patients receiving other therapies, irrespective of line of therapy."

This paper provides evidence from China by using the survey data from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), which contains sport-types, personal characteristics, and CES-D20 depression-scale score data of 33,236 individuals. In addition to the Ordinary Least Squares regression model, we adopt the Two-way Fixed Effect and Propensity Score Matching method to alleviate the endogeneity. The empirical result shows that for every additional time of physical exercise, the depression level drops by an average of 0.152; the depression level of people who participate in sports is significantly lower than that of non-participants by 0.397 points. The lowering effect of physical activity on depression is not linear, and excessive exercise may lead to increased depression. Furthermore, heterogeneity analyses discover that with the increase of age and education, the impact continued to expand. For every increase in physical exercise of the group over 76-year old, the depression level decreased by 0.373 points; while for individuals with primary school education, their depression level decreased only by 0.124 points."
https://openalex.org/W4302761503,"Receptor-ligand binding has been analyzed at the protein level using isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance and at the cellular level using interaction-associated downstream gene induction/suppression. However, no currently available technique can characterize this interaction directly through visualization. In addition, all available assays require a large pool of cells; no assay capable of analyzing receptor-ligand interactions at the single-cell level is publicly available. Here, we describe a new microfluidic chip–based technique for analyzing and visualizing these interactions at the single-cell level. First, a protein is immobilized on a glass slide and a low-flow-rate pump is used to isolate cells that express receptors that bind to the immobilized ligand. Specifically, we demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by immobilizing biotin-conjugated FGL2 on an avidin-coated slide chip and passing a mixture of GFP-labeled wild-type T cells and RFP-labeled FcγRIIB-knockout T cells through the chip. Using automated scanning and counting, we found a large number of GFP+ T cells with binding activity but significantly fewer RFP+ FcγRIIB-knockout T cells. We further isolated T cells expressing a membrane-anchored, tumor-targeted IL-12 based on the receptor’s affinity to vimentin to confirm the versatility of our technique. This protocol allows researchers to isolate receptor-expressing cells in about 4 hours for further downstream processing."
https://openalex.org/W4302761505,"Myostatin (MSTN) is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth, thus it was hypothesized that immunization of hens against MSTN would enhance post-hatch growth and muscle mass via suppression of MSTN activity by anti-MSTN IgY in fertilized eggs. This study investigated the effects of immunization of hens against chicken MSTN (chMSTN) or a MSTN fragment (Myo2) on the growth and muscle mass of offspring. In Experiment 1, hens mixed with roosters were divided into two groups and hens in the Control and chMSTN groups were immunized with 0 and 0.5 mg of chMSTN, respectively. In Experiment 2, hens in the chMSTN group were divided into chMSTN and Myo2 groups while the Control group remained the same. The Control and chMSTN groups were immunized in the same way as Experiment 1. The Myo2 group was immunized against MSTN peptide fragment (Myo2) conjugated to KLH. Eggs collected from each group were incubated, and chicks were reared to examine growth and carcass parameters. ELISA showed the production of IgYs against chMSTN and Myo2 and the presence of these antibodies in egg yolk. IgY from the chMSTN and Myo2 groups showed binding affinity to chMSTN, Myo2, and commercial MSTN in Western blot analysis but did not show MSTN-inhibitory capacity in a reporter gene assay. In Experiment 1, no difference was observed in the body weight and carcass parameters of offspring between the Control and chMSTN groups. In Experiment 2, the body weight of chicks from the Myo2 group was significantly lower than that of the Control or chMSTN groups. The dressing percentage and breast muscle mass of the chMSTN and Myo2 groups were significantly lower than those of the Control group, and the breast muscle mass of Myo2 was significantly lower than that of the chMSTN. In summary, in contrast to our hypothesis, maternal immunization of hens did not increase but decreased the body weight and muscle mass of offspring."
https://openalex.org/W4302762933,"Background Breast cancer is the leading cancer among women with an annual crude incidence of 27.4 per 100,000 in Ethiopia. The aims of this study were to (a) estimate the unit cost of breast cancer treatment for the standard Ethiopian patient, (b) identify the cost drivers, (c) project the total cost of breast cancer treatment for the next five years, and (d) estimate the economic burden of the disease in the main specialized tertiary hospital—Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH) Addis Ababa. Methods Primary data were collected from health and non-health professionals. Secondary data were collected from patient`s charts and official reports from various national and international organisations including data from TASH. To establish work-time estimates, we asked professionals on their time usage. Result A total of US$ 33,261 was incurred to treat 52 Addis Ababa resident female breast cancer patients in TASH between July 2017 and June 2019. The unit cost of treatment for a hypothetical breast cancer patient to complete her treatment was US$ 536 for stage I and US$ 705 for stage II and III using the existing infrastructure. This cost increased to US$ 955 for stage I and US$ 1157 for stage II and III when infrastructure amortization was considered. The projected total costs of breast cancer treatment in TASH is between US$ 540,000 and US$ 1.48million. However, this will increase to US$ 870,000 and US$ 2.29 million when the existing fixed assets are changed. Conclusion The economic burden of breast cancer treatment is high compared to the economic status of the country. Thus, it is recommended that TASH should revise its charges and breast cancer should be included in the Social and Community based health insurance scheme. JEL classification: H51, H75, I18, P46"
https://openalex.org/W4302762964,"First birth and labor induction are risk factors for negative childbirth experiences. As labor inductions are increasing, research into this high-risk group's childbirth experiences is important. We aimed to investigate whether nulliparity or factors related to labor induction, labor, and delivery explain the association.This was a prospective study of 711 women undergoing labor induction at Helsinki University Hospital, Finland, between January 1, 2019, and January 31, 2020. The participants answered the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) after delivery (response rate 69.4%). The patient characteristics and delivery outcomes were collected from patient records. We analyzed the results for nulliparous and parous women.The mean CEQ scores were 2.9 (SD 0.5) for nulliparous women (n = 408) and 3.2 (SD 0.5) for parous women (n = 303), on a scale of 1-4; higher scores represent more positive experiences. However, 7.3% of the women had negative childbirth experiences (8.8% nulliparous; 5.3% parous, p = 0.08). Negative experiences were associated with a cesarean section (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.8-9.3, p < 0.001) and a hemorrhage ≥ 1500 ml in vaginal delivery (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.1-7.5, p = 0.03). In the separate CEQ domains analyses, nulliparity was associated with negative experiences in the ""Own Capacity"" domain (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.4, p = 0.03). Cervical ripening, oxytocin use, and daytime delivery were associated with negative experiences in at least one domain, whereas epidural or spinal analgesia was regarded positively in two domains and negatively in one.Nulliparous women undergoing labor induction risk negative childbirth experiences mainly due to labor and delivery-related factors, similar to parous women. Their perceptions of their capacity and preparedness for labor and delivery should be enhanced antenatally. An effective labor induction protocol promoting as high a rate of vaginal delivery as possible and preparedness to promptly respond to postpartum hemorrhage are key for avoiding negative childbirth experiences."
https://openalex.org/W4302763089,"Housewives play a crucial role in their families' and communities' quality of life. However, musculoskeletal disorders are common among housewives due to housework and lack of physical activity. These musculoskeletal problems have been associated to leisure physical activity. As a result, the goal of this study was to determine the incidence of musculoskeletal problems and their association to physical activity among low-income women in Kuala Lumpur. A cross-sectional research was done among 82 housewives in Kuala Lumpur's low-income housing area. Housewives were asked to fill out a sociodemographic questionnaire, a short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ), and body mass index were measured by researcher. The total prevalence of musculoskeletal problems was found to be 89.0%, with the lowest frequency in the lower back (35%), followed by the knee (31%), ankle or foot (31%), and elbow (1% %). The subjects spent an average of 117.6 + 474.8 minutes per week on MVPA and 524 + 810.3 MET minutes per week on physical activity. A total of 88% of the participants had a low level of physical activity, 8.5 percent had a moderate level of activity, and 3.7% had a high level of activity. In a Chi-square test, there was no significant association between musculoskeletal problems and physical activity. The primary sociodemographic factors impacting musculoskeletal diseases were body mass index and household income, while the primary variables influencing physical activity were household income and education level, according to a logistic regression test. In a Poisson regression test, only body mass index had a significant relationship with number of musculoskeletal disorders. In conclusion, housewives are likely to suffer from musculoskeletal problems, with a high incidence in the lower back, knees, ankles, and feet, and the majority of them engage in little physical activity. Furthermore, the high percentage of musculoskeletal problems in this study varies with the findings of other research based on the type of housework done by housewives in low-cost housing areas. Future research should look at identifying the sorts of household tasks and positions employed, as well as the amount of hours spent on housework each week."
https://openalex.org/W4302763137,"Background The definition of women’s autonomy used in the study is control over finances, decision–making power, and the extent of freedom of movement by women. Lower autonomy of women affects the socio-economic, emotional, fertility decision, contraceptive use, and sexual life of the women. Thus, this study aimed to assess maternal autonomy and associated factors in making a decision to utilize health services for themselves and neonates in south Ethiopia. Methods Community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from January 1 to March 2, 2021, in Shashamane town. Four hundred ten postpartum mothers were selected using a stratified random sampling technique and interviewed for the survey using questions composed of decision-making autonomy components (decision–making power, control over finances, and freedom of movement). The data were checked for consistency, coded, and entered using EpiData Manager (version 4.6.0.4) and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 26. Descriptive statistics, composite score analysis, and binary and multivariate logistic regression were done to capture the objectives. Result 410 postpartum mothers were interviewed while the mean and standard deviation of the participants’ age was 26.96 ± 5.38. About 48.5% of mothers had high decision-making autonomy for their own and their neonates’ health service utilization. Being in monogamous marriage (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.21, 2.74), and mode of delivery (Cesarean section) (AOR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.18, 3.07) were significantly associated with having high maternal decision-making autonomy. Conclusions More than half of the study participants had low maternal decision-making autonomy for their own and their neonates’ health service utilization. Being in monogamous marriage, and mode of delivery (Cesarean section) were factors significantly associated with high maternal decision-making autonomy. Encouraging mothers to use facility delivery was recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4302763239,"With the implementation of urban central rail transit and old city reconstruction projects, construction vehicles frequently enter and depart the urban area. And because of its large volume and other characteristics, it increases the risk probability and severity of urban traffic accidents. This study takes the transportation path selection of construction vehicles as the breakthrough point, weighs the transportation efficiency and safety of construction vehicles, establishes a bi-objective optimization model, involving constraints such as height limit, weight limit, speed limit, direction limit and traffic limit and uses genetic algorithm to solve it. Finally, through case analysis, the user preference is adjusted to conduct functional test and description of the model. The results indicate that the model has the function of transportation vehicle path optimization. In the meantime, compared with the safest route, the time-consuming of the optimal route decreases by 16% and the risk increases by 7.4%, while the time-consuming of it increases by 5% and the risk decreases by 15.4% compared with the shortest route. Moreover, the corresponding coefficients of time-consuming and safety preference can reach about 0.65, and the relevant stakeholders have high acceptance of the route. Further improvement of construction vehicle management mechanism based on path optimization is one of the limited ways to effectively improve the current situation of construction vehicle management."
https://openalex.org/W4302763250,"Although it is relevant to understand spine and lower body motions in healthy individuals for a variety of applications, such as clinical diagnosis, implant design, and the analysis of treatment outcomes, proper assessment and characterization of normative gait symmetry in healthy individuals remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the in vivo 3-dimensional (3D) spine and lower body gait symmetry kinematics during treadmill walking in healthy individuals. Sixty healthy young adults (30 males and 30 females) were evaluated during normal and fast treadmill walking using a motion capture system approach. Statistical parametric mapping and the normalized symmetry index approaches were used to determine spine, pelvis, and lower body asymmetries during treadmill walking. The spine and pelvis angular motions associated with the left and right lower limb motions, as well as the left and right lower extremity joint angles were compared for normal and fast treadmill walking. The lower lumbar left-right rotation (5.74±0.04°) and hip internal rotation (5.33±0.18°) presented the largest degrees of asymmetry during normal treadmill. Upper lumbar left-right lateral flexion (1.48±0.14°) and knee flexion (2.98±0.13°) indicated the largest asymmetries and during fast treadmill walking. Few asymmetry patterns were similar between normal and fast treadmill walking, whereas others appeared either only during normal or fast treadmill walking in this cohort of participants. These findings could provide insights into better understanding gait asymmetry in healthy individuals, and use them as reference indicators in diagnosing and evaluating abnormal gait function."
https://openalex.org/W4302763293,"To investigate changes in uroflowmetry parameters in men undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer.Four hundred and twenty-eight patients received uroflowmetry testing before and after RARP from November 2011 to December 2018. Clinicopathological data, including age, initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, clinical stage, body mass index (BMI), uroflowmetry parameters, and core lower urinary tract symptom scores (CLSS) were retrospectively obtained from clinical records. Changes in uroflowmetry parameters were analyzed for statistical predictors and effects on post-operative outcomes.A significant increase in maximum flow rate (MFR) and decreases in voided volume (VV) and post-void residual urine (PVR) were seen. In multivariate analysis, age was a negative predictor of MFR increase, while prostate volume was a positive predictor of PVR decrease and MFR increase. VV decrease led to worse incontinence symptoms, while PVR decrease and MFR increase led to improvement in voiding symptoms such as slow stream and straining. Continence recovery curves showed that VV decrease were associated with a delay in continence recovery.Significant changes were seen in uroflowmetry results after RARP, each parameter directly related to urinary symptoms. In particular, VV decrease was associated with a worsening of incontinence symptoms and continence recovery."
https://openalex.org/W4302763305,"MotherSafe is a free telephone-based counseling service for Australian consumers and health-care providers concerned about drug exposures during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Anti-infectives are the most commonly prescribed drugs for pregnant women. This study aims to provide a descriptive analysis of prospectively collected calls received by MotherSafe regarding anti-infective exposures during pregnancy between 2000 and 2020. Aggregate data were examined by type of caller, reason for call, pregnancy category and exposure type. Inductive thematic analysis of the comments recorded by MotherSafe counsellors at the time of call was undertaken.Over the study period, 25,890 calls related to exposure to anti-infectives during pregnancy (antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal medications). Calls from patients were dominated by low-risk exposures (pregnancy category A) to drugs while calls from health care professionals related to drugs with limited human information (pregnancy category B3). Analysis of MotherSafe counsellor comments revealed over 200 instances of concerns relating to health care professional advice to the patient. Three themes emerged: incorrect or conflicting advice, poor counselling, and refusal to treat, prescribe or dispense. It is likely that these comments are biased to the negative as patients would not call MotherSafe if they were happy with HCP advice. However, the findings are concerning as they reveal an underlying lack of knowledge in some health care professionals which may have led to undertreatment of patients. This study reinforced the importance of Teratogen Information Services such as MotherSafe in providing counselling and clear communication of evidence-based information to guide decision-making, reducing potential emotional distress in pregnant women, and optimizing maternal, pregnancy and infant outcomes."
