Chemical structure of the compound was elucidated as dihydroaflatoxin B(1). Biological activity was determined in day-old male white Pekin ducklings. The criteria of activity were reduction in growth and liver size and the extent of bile-duct hyperplasia."

https://openalex.org/W2019310596,"AN earlier communication1 concerned with the structures of ferrichrome and ferrichrome A left open the particular arrangement of the 3 residues of neutral amino-acids and 3 residues of δ-N-hydroxyornithine2 within the cyclic hexapeptide moiety of the naturally occurring ferric trihydroxamates. The peptide portion of ferrichrome contains 3 residues each of glycine and δ-N-hydroxyornithine while, in ferrichrome A, 2 of the 3 glycine residues are replaced by serine residues. In the present report we propose that the sequence for ferrichrome is cyclo-triglcyl-tri-δ-N-hydroxyonithyl while that for ferrichrome A is most probably cyclo-diseryl-glycyl-tri-δ-N-hydroxyornithyl."

https://openalex.org/W2027679002,"A macromolecule of protein and chondroitin sulfate (PP-L) inhibits sedimentation of barium-polystyrene sulfonate (BaPSS) and of calcium phosphate at low but not at high values of gravity. Sedimentation of BaPSS removes a large fraction of PP-L from solution, but sedimentation of calcium phosphate does not. The results suggest entanglement among linear polyanionic chains."

https://openalex.org/W2063639656,THIN-LAYER chromatographic procedures are used widely and accepted as efficient and rapid means of separating numerous organic compounds on a micro scale. The following procedure is presented to illustrate the thin layer chromatographic separation and rapid quantitative determination of several free amino-acids of avian liver tissue.

https://openalex.org/W2137313735,"THE primary reaction between an enzyme and a substrate or a poison is essentially an adsorption reaction involving the concentration of the substance in the enzyme/water interface. Homogenates are bio-colloids where the surface energy, particularly at interfaces, is a predominating form of energy on changes of which depend certain phenomena. In aqueous preparations of enzymes, substances which lower surface energy by concentrating at the enzyme/water interface may behave as barrier between enzyme and substrate, unless the latter has a higher affinity for interfaces."

Among other effects, prolongation of the heparin-tolerance- and recalcification-times (Howell-time) as well as lowering of the factors II and VII occur1."

https://openalex.org/W2020750838,"THERE are 11 genetically independent blood-group systems (loci) in cattle1 which provide markers on perhaps a third of their chromosomes. Attempts to discover linkage between these blood-group genes and those controlling production traits have generally been unsuccessful2. Recent discoveries of various inherited biochemical polymorphisms such as transferrins, haemoglobins, β-lactoglobulins, α-lactoalbumins, etc.3, now provide additional markers for linkage investigations. This report presents the results of tests for linkage between the transferrin locus and seven of the blood-group loci."

https://openalex.org/W2093830328,"IT has been observed1,2 that substances like thyroxine, Ca++, orthophosphate, induce swelling in rat liver mitochondria when suspended in a medium containing 0.3 M sucrose, and 0.02 M tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, at pH 7.4. That the swelling of mitochondria is dependent on the respiratory chain is shown by the fact that 2,4-dinitrophenol, which is an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, is a strong inhibitor of mitochondrial swelling1. The swelling of mitochondria is associated with the active water uptake, which was first pointed out by Raaflaub3. The active water uptake is also inhibited by adenine triphosphate4. Other substances like spermine, spermidine, and related polyamine also inhibit swelling5. It has also been observed that many antihistamine drugs inhibit mitochondrial swelling6 where permeability change has been suggested. It is known that pyridoxal phosphate intensifies the uptake of amino-acids by Ehrlich ascites tumour cells7 with the concomitant uptake of water. A study of the effect of pyridoxal phosphate and other analogues of vitamin B6 on the active water uptake by rat liver mitochondria will be of some interest."
