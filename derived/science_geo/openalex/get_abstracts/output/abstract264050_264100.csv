https://openalex.org/W2086518905,"In the laboratory, fertilization rates achieved by male lemon tetras decline with spawning frequency. Even when the number of females is not limited, males can produce only four times as many offspring as females. Females show a preference for males that have not recently spawned as opposed to those that have. The cost of producing sufficient sperm to maximize fertilization rates may therefore reduce the intensity of sexual selection in this polygamous fish species."

Algal cells which encounter patches of phosphorus-33 released by swimming animals accumulate more label than cells that do not enter the patches. Differential labeling of algae does not occur when turbulence in the fluid is increased by stirring. Nutrient patchiness at the scale of millimeters or less in nature probably influences the course of competition and coexistence among the phytoplankton.

Mean absorption values of 3400, 1200, and 100 milligrams of carbon dioxide per square meter per hour, respectively, are consistent with reported ground-based observations of carbon dioxide flux. Such information, gathered by aircraft, could be used to provide a quantitative evaluation of source and sink distributions of carbon dioxide in the biosphere, to establish a correlation between satellite data and near-surface measurements, and to monitor crop performance."
https://openalex.org/W1980191631,"Old, buried, deformed, crystalline rocks apparently make up most of the 40-kilometer-thick continental crust. This part of the earth is poorly explored and constitutes a major frontier of modern earth science. Two techniques, seismic reflection profiling and drilling, which were developed by industry for other purposes, offer special potential for such exploration. Seismic profiling of the deep crust by COCORP (the Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling) has already produced important information, including evidence for extensive thin-skinned thrusting of older rocks over a continental margin as the corresponding ocean basin closed. Deep drilling of crystalline rocks of the continents for scientific purposes is so far relatively unexploited in the United States but is already being carried on elsewhere. In general, big science is likely to become more important in basic geology as this frontier is explored."

https://openalex.org/W2052811197,Postural reflexes act through a single excitatory motoneuron of the several that innervate a flexor muscle of the cockroach leg. A peripheral inhibitory neuron whose axon accompanies this excitatory motoneuron is able to suppress muscle tensions developed from postural reflexes without affecting centrally generated muscle tensions. The inhibitory neuron could thus serve to rapidly suppress postural tensions at the initiation of escape.

https://openalex.org/W2140351849,"Once each year we come together to renew our strength in unison, like Antaeus, by touching the earth. I am conscious of taking some degree of liberty in departing from the usual form of this established functionâ€”the annual address. It would gratify me and might in some measure have diverted or persuaded you, if this occasion were given to the illumination of some specific technical theme. But the spirit of the hour seems to impel me rather to read from my experience and observation, or at least to portray as I see it, some part of the obligation of the State to our science and the responsibility of this science to the State. The occasion is perhaps opportune, not so much in this place of meeting which happens to be the seat of government of but one of the many States here represented, and in the presence of members . . ."
