https://openalex.org/W2046138985,"Electrostatic interactions with negatively charged membranes contribute to the subcellular targeting of proteins with polybasic clusters or cationic domains. Although the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine is comparatively abundant, its contribution to the surface charge of individual cellular membranes is unknown, partly because of the lack of reagents to analyze its distribution in intact cells. We developed a biosensor to study the subcellular distribution of phosphatidylserine and found that it binds the cytosolic leaflets of the plasma membrane, as well as endosomes and lysosomes. The negative charge associated with the presence of phosphatidylserine directed proteins with moderately positive charge to the endocytic pathway. More strongly cationic proteins, normally associated with the plasma membrane, relocalized to endocytic compartments when the plasma membrane surface charge decreased on calcium influx."

https://openalex.org/W2124317881,"Caveolae are abundant cell-surface organelles involved in lipid regulation and endocytosis. We used comparative proteomics to identify PTRF (also called Cav-p60, Cavin) as a putative caveolar coat protein. PTRF-Cavin selectively associates with mature caveolae at the plasma membrane but not Golgi-localized caveolin. In prostate cancer PC3 cells, and during development of zebrafish notochord, lack of PTRF-Cavin expression correlates with lack of caveolae, and caveolin resides on flat plasma membrane. Expression of PTRF-Cavin in PC3 cells is sufficient to cause formation of caveolae. Knockdown of PTRF-Cavin reduces caveolae density, both in mammalian cells and in the zebrafish. Caveolin remains on the plasma membrane in PTRF-Cavin knockdown cells but exhibits increased lateral mobility and accelerated lysosomal degradation. We conclude that PTRF-Cavin is required for caveola formation and sequestration of mobile caveolin into immobile caveolae."

Here, using mouse models of pulmonary metastasis, we identify bone marrow (BM)-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) as critical regulators of this angiogenic switch. We show that tumors induce expression of the transcription factor Id1 in the EPCs and that suppression of Id1 after metastatic colonization blocked EPC mobilization, caused angiogenesis inhibition, impaired pulmonary macrometastases, and increased survival of tumor-bearing animals. These findings establish the role of EPCs in metastatic progression in preclinical models and suggest that selective targeting of EPCs may merit investigation as a therapy for cancer patients with lung metastases."

https://openalex.org/W2112546324,"Proper distribution of mitochondria within axons and at synapses is critical for neuronal function. While one-third of axonal mitochondria are mobile, a large proportion remains in a stationary phase. However, the mechanisms controlling mitochondrial docking within axons remain elusive. Here, we report a role for axon-targeted syntaphilin (SNPH) in mitochondrial docking through its interaction with microtubules. Axonal mitochondria that contain exogenously or endogenously expressed SNPH lose mobility. Deletion of the mouse snph gene results in a substantially higher proportion of axonal mitochondria in the mobile state and reduces the density of mitochondria in axons. The snph mutant neurons exhibit enhanced short-term facilitation during prolonged stimulation, probably by affecting calcium signaling at presynaptic boutons. This phenotype is fully rescued by reintroducing the snph gene into the mutant neurons. These findings demonstrate a molecular mechanism for controlling mitochondrial docking in axons that has a physiological impact on synaptic function."

XMAP215 belongs to a conserved family of proteins that promote microtubule growth. To determine how XMAP215 accelerates growth, we developed a single-molecule assay to visualize directly XMAP215-GFP interacting with dynamic microtubules. XMAP215 binds free tubulin in a 1:1 complex that interacts with the microtubule lattice and targets the ends by a diffusion-facilitated mechanism. XMAP215 persists at the plus end for many rounds of tubulin subunit addition in a form of “tip tracking.” These results show that XMAP215 is a processive polymerase that directly catalyzes the addition of up to 25 tubulin dimers to the growing plus end. Under some circumstances XMAP215 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, namely microtubule shrinkage. The similarities between XMAP215 and formins, actin polymerases, suggest that processive tip tracking is a common mechanism for stimulating the growth of cytoskeletal polymers.

Microtubules are long, slender filaments with which cellular structures such as the cytoskeleton, the mitotic spindle, and the axoneme are built. These structures are not static. Rather, they are broken down and rebuilt when a cell moves, changes shape, or progresses through the cell cycle. This remodeling is achieved by the disassembly and reassembly of microtubules and occurs primarily through the removal and addition of tubulin dimers at microtubule ends. Microtubule growth is fast. For example, in Xenopus oocytes (Gard and Kirschner, 1987bGard D.L. Kirschner M.W. Microtubule assembly in cytoplasmic extracts of Xenopus oocytes and eggs.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and C. elegans embryos (Srayko et al., 2005Srayko M. Kaya A. Stamford J. Hyman A.A.

Cell. 2005; 9: 223-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) microtubules grow at rates of up to 40 μmċmin−1. These high growth rates are necessary in order for the reassembly of the cytoskeleton to keep up with the progression of these rapidly dividing cells through the cell cycle. These in vivo growth rates are more than ten times higher than the corresponding rates for purified tubulin in vitro (Kinoshita et al., 2001Kinoshita K. Arnal I. Desai A. Drechsel D.N. Hyman A.A.

The accelerated microtubule growth rates in cells are mediated by members of the so-called Dis1/XMAP215 family of microtubule-associated proteins (Kinoshita et al., 2002Kinoshita K. Habermann B.

XMAP215 was first identified in Xenopus laevis egg extracts, where it was purified as a factor that increased the growth rate of microtubules in vitro 10-fold (Gard and Kirschner, 1987aGard D.L.

Disruption of gene products in the Dis1/XMAP215 family results in the following phenotypes: (1) shorter meiotic or mitotic spindles in Xenopus egg extracts (Tournebize et al., 2000Tournebize R.

These phenotypes are consistent with the observation that interfering with Dis1/XMAP215 decreases microtubule growth rates in Xenopus egg extracts (Tournebize et al., 2000Tournebize R. Popov A.

Several members of the Dis1/XMAP215 family localize to microtubule plus ends in vivo and in vitro (Hestermann and Graf, 2004Hestermann A. Graf R.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This localization pattern is likely to be of general significance for the function of these proteins as the plus end is the primary site of microtubule growth in vivo. How does XMAP215 increase the growth rate of microtubules? A hint about the mechanism comes from structural studies. Electron micrographs have shown both XMAP215 (Cassimeris et al., 2001Cassimeris L. Gard D. Tran P.T. Erickson H.P. XMAP215 is a long thin molecule that does not increase microtubule stiffness.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3025-3033PubMed Google Scholar) and Stu2p, the S. cerevisiae homolog (Al-Bassam et al., 2006Al-Bassam J. van Breugel M. Harrison S.C. Hyman A. Stu2p binds tubulin and undergoes an open-to-closed conformational change.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), to be elongated and flexible molecules, with a contour length of ∼60 nm. The most conserved features of the Dis1/XMAP215 family are the N-terminal TOG domains. The number of TOG domains varies from two to five, depending on the species; for example, Stu2p has two TOG domains, four in the Stu2p dimer (van Breugel et al., 2003van Breugel M. Drechsel D. Hyman A. Stu2p, the budding yeast member of the conserved Dis1/XMAP215 family of microtubule-associated proteins is a plus end-binding microtubule destabilizer.J.

A microtubule-associated protein from Xenopus eggs that specifically promotes assembly at the plus-end.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2203-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), has five TOG domains. Each TOG domain contains six HEAT repeats that fold into a paddle-like structure (Al-Bassam et al., 2007Al-Bassam J. Larsen N.A. Hyman A.A. Harrison S.C.

An individual TOG domain is sufficient to bind tubulin (Al-Bassam et al., 2007Al-Bassam J. Larsen N.A. Hyman A.A. Harrison S.C.

Harrison S.C. Hyman A. Stu2p binds tubulin and undergoes an open-to-closed conformational change.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TOGp, the human homolog, binds tubulin in vitro (Spittle et al., 2000Spittle C. Charrasse S. Larroque C. Cassimeris L. The interaction of TOGp with microtubules and tubulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20748-20753Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and XMAP215 coimmunoprecipitates with tubulin in Xenopus egg extracts (Niethammer et al., 2007Niethammer P. Kronja I.

Discrete states of a protein interaction network govern interphase and mitotic microtubule dynamics.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 190-202Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The binding of these proteins to tubulin dimers suggests that they bring tubulin from solution to the microtubule end. Acceleration of growth could result from rapid cycling onto and off the microtubule end or from multiple tubulins being brought at once. The high-affinity binding of tubulin has been proposed to account for the paradoxical finding that some of these family members can cause depolymerization in vitro (Al-Bassam et al., 2006Al-Bassam J. van Breugel M. Harrison S.C. Hyman A. Stu2p binds tubulin and undergoes an open-to-closed conformational change.J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The prevailing model to explain the acceleration of microtubule growth by XMAP215 is that it acts as a “tubulin shuttle” that brings several tubulin dimers to the microtubule end (Gard and Kirschner, 1987aGard D.L.

XMAP from Xenopus eggs promotes rapid plus end assembly of microtubules and rapid microtubule polymer turnover.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Recent evidence for this model has come from high-resolution optical trapping experiments in which discrete length changes of up to 60 nm, the length of 7–8 tubulin dimers, were observed during microtubule growth (Kerssemakers et al., 2006Kerssemakers J.W. Munteanu E.L. Laan L. Noetzel T.L. Janson M.E. Dogterom M. Assembly dynamics of microtubules at molecular resolution.Nature. 2006; 442: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and from turbidity measurements in which artificially tetramerized TOG domains promoted microtubule nucleation in vitro (Slep and Vale, 2007Slep K.C.

The model is not consistent, however, with experiments on other members of the Dis1/XMAP215 family. For example, Stu2p binds only one tubulin dimer in solution (Al-Bassam et al., 2006Al-Bassam J. van Breugel M. Harrison S.C. Hyman A. Stu2p binds tubulin and undergoes an open-to-closed conformational change.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, the observation that XMAP215, under certain conditions in vitro, can depolymerize microtubules has led to an alternative model in which XMAP215 acts as an antipause factor (Shirasu-Hiza et al., 2003Shirasu-Hiza M. Coughlin P. Mitchison T. Identification of XMAP215 as a microtubule-destabilizing factor in Xenopus egg extract by biochemical purification.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To distinguish among the different possible ways that XMAP215 might promote microtubule growth, we developed an assay to visualize single XMAP215 molecules during microtubule polymerization. We demonstrate that XMAP215 does not, in fact, act as a tubulin shuttle. Rather, XMAP215 acts as a processive polymerizing enzyme or polymerase: XMAP215 forms a 1:1 complex with tubulin and resides for long periods at microtubule plus ends, where it catalyzes repeated rounds of addition of tubulin into the microtubule polymer. To determine how XMAP215 increases the growth rate of microtubules, we developed a fluorescence microscopy assay to visualize microtubule growth. To overcome the background fluorescence from free tubulin, which obscures the growing microtubule, we used total-internal-reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF), in which the excitation light is restricted to a narrow region near the cover glass. To keep the microtubule within the excitation field, we used antibodies specific to rhodamine to adhere GMPCPP-stabilized, rhodamine-labeled microtubule seeds to the cover glass surface (see Figure 1A and Experimental Procedures). Microtubules grew by extension from the microtubule seeds. When a mixture of 4.5 μM unlabeled tubulin and 0.5 μM Alexa Fluor 488-labeled tubulin (Alexa-tubulin) was perfused into the chamber in the presence of 100 nM XMAP215 and 1 mM GTP, microtubules were observed to grow from the GMPCPP seeds. Polarity-marked microtubules were used to confirm this growth occurred from the plus end, as expected (see Supplemental Data, section 2.1). At this tubulin concentration, no microtubule growth was observed either at the minus ends or in the absence of XMAP215. Figure 1B shows a kymograph of a microtubule plus end undergoing two rounds of growth and shrinkage (see also Movie S1). XMAP215 promoted microtubule growth in a concentration-dependent manner, as shown in Figure 1C. These XMAP215-stimulated microtubule growth rates are in agreement with published values (Gard and Kirschner, 1987aGard D.L. Kirschner M.W. A microtubule-associated protein from Xenopus eggs that specifically promotes assembly at the plus-end.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2203-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, Kinoshita et al., 2001Kinoshita K. Arnal I. Desai A. Drechsel D.N. Hyman A.A.

Cassimeris L. XMAP from Xenopus eggs promotes rapid plus end assembly of microtubules and rapid microtubule polymer turnover.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We measured microtubule growth rates as a function of tubulin concentration, and at 200 nM XMAP215 the growth rates correspond to a second-order association rate constant of tubulin to the microtubule end of 19.8 ± 2.6 μM−1ċ s−1 (mean ± SEM, n = 9, see Supplemental Data, section 2.2). This association rate constant is 5- to 10-fold higher than the rate constant measured for the growth of tubulin alone in our assay (see Supplemental Data, section 2.2) and reported in the literature (Howard, 2001Howard J. Mechanics of Motor Proteins and the Cytoskeleton. Sinauer Associates, Publishers, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). In order to investigate how XMAP215 stimulates the association rate of tubulin, we looked at the interaction of XMAP215 with microtubules during microtubule growth. We visualized XMAP215 using a C-terminal GFP tag and TIRF microscopy; the microtubule seed is visualized by epifluorescence. The GFP-tagged XMAP215 had similar microtubule growth-promoting properties to the untagged protein (see Figure 1C). At XMAP215-GFP concentrations between 50 and 200 nM, we observed distinct GFP foci at the microtubule plus end by time-lapse microscopy (see Figure 2A and Movie S2). These foci grew from the ends of the microtubules with an outward velocity that correlated with the previously measured microtubule growth rates for the given concentration of XMAP215 and tubulin (see above). Therefore, we conclude that these foci represent XMAP215-GFP molecules at the growing end of the microtubules, indicating that XMAP215 molecules “tip track” with the plus end of microtubules. In Figure 2A, we estimate there are ∼10 XMAP215 molecules at the end based on fluorescence intensity. We note with interest that XMAP215-GFP also remained associated with the plus ends of microtubules during shrinkage (Figure 2B), often traveling >4 μm before encountering the microtubule seed. In addition, XMAP215-GFP molecules on the lattice were “picked up” by the shrinking plus end, causing an increase in GFP signal at the microtubule end as the shrinkage continued (data not shown). This phenomenon is similar to that observed for the Dam1 complex on shrinking microtubules (Westermann et al., 2006Westermann S. Wang H.W. Avila-Sakar A. Drubin D.G. Nogales E. Barnes G. The Dam1 kinetochore ring complex moves processively on depolymerizing microtubule ends.Nature. 2006; 440: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, XMAP215-GFP binds to both growing and shrinking plus ends of dynamic microtubules. The presence of multiple XMAP215-GFP molecules at the microtubule end and the use of time-lapse microscopy prevented us from observing the behavior of individual XMAP215-GFP molecules. To follow individual XMAP215-GFP molecules during microtubule polymerization, we performed “spike” experiments in which <5 nM XMAP215-GFP was added to ∼95 nM unlabeled XMAP215, and movies were recorded using continuous streaming video. Single molecules of XMAP215-GFP were observed diffusing on the dynamic microtubule lattice and the microtubule seed (see Figure 2C, white arrows). The diffusion coefficient of this motion was D = 0.30 ± 0.01 μm2ċs−1, and the mean residence time on the lattice was 〈t〉= 2.45 ± 0.21 s (see Supplemental Data, section 3). In addition, XMAP215 molecules were observed to diffuse to and then bind to the microtubule ends (see Figure 2C, blue arrow). Further analysis of the spike experiments showed that single XMAP215-GFP molecules resided for extended periods at the growing microtubule end (see Figure 2C, yellow arrows, and Movie S3). After correction for photobleaching, the mean residence time of XMAP215 at the microtubule end was 〈tEND〉 = 3.8 ± 0.7 s (Figure 2D, n = 198 molecules, see Supplemental Data, section 3). In these experimental conditions, no microtubule growth occurred in the absence of XMAP215; we can therefore attribute all tubulin dimer additions to XMAP215. During the 3.8 s residence time of individual XMAP215-GFP molecules, the microtubule grew by ∼0.2 μm (for the measured growth rate of 3.0 μmċmin−1 or 82 dimersċs−1), corresponding to ∼330 tubulin dimers or ∼25 tubulin dimers onto each of 13 protofilaments. Therefore, on average, the XMAP215-GFP molecules are present during the addition of at least 25 tubulin dimers if one XMAP215-GFP binds to each protofilament and greater numbers if fewer than 13 XMAP215s bind to the microtubule end at once. The results in the previous section show that on average XMAP215 resides at the growing plus end of the microtubule for a time during which the microtubule grows by ∼0.2 μm. To see whether XMAP215 moved with the growing end during its residence time, we examined the single-molecule end events more closely. We observed single XMAP215 molecules moving away from the microtubule seed (Figure 2E), suggesting that XMAP215 tracks with the growing plus end. To test whether this tracking corresponded to the observed microtubule growth, we measured the outward displacement of the single molecules of XMAP215 at microtubule ends in the spike experiments. The mean displacement was 0.17 ± 0.1 μm (mean ± SEM, n = 198), which corresponds to ∼21 tubulin dimer lengths. Furthermore, the mean velocity of outward displacement was 2.7 ± 0.25 μmċmin−1 (Figure 2F), which is similar to the measured growth rate of microtubules in the presence of 100 nM XMAP215. Therefore, the outward displacements are consistent with single XMAP215 molecules tracking with the plus end of the microtubule during growth. How does XMAP215 promote the addition of so many tubulin dimers during its interaction with the microtubule end? Previous work has shown that TOG domains can bind tubulin (Al-Bassam et al., 2007Al-Bassam J. Larsen N.A. Hyman A.A. Harrison S.C.

Using size-exclusion chromatography, we confirmed that XMAP215, like the S. cerevisiae homolog Stu2p (Al-Bassam et al., 2006Al-Bassam J. van Breugel M. Harrison S.C. Hyman A. Stu2p binds tubulin and undergoes an open-to-closed conformational change.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), binds tubulin (see Figures 3A and 3B and Supplemental Data, section 4.1). We analyzed the XMAP215:tubulin complex by negative stain electron microscopy and compared it with free XMAP215. As previously observed (Cassimeris et al., 2001Cassimeris L. Gard D. Tran P.T. Erickson H.P. XMAP215 is a long thin molecule that does not increase microtubule stiffness.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3025-3033PubMed Google Scholar), free XMAP215 is a thin rod with multiple flexible joints (Figure 3C). These joints are likely to be the disordered sequences between XMAP215's five ordered TOG domains; free Stu2p has a similar appearance (Al-Bassam et al., 2006Al-Bassam J. van Breugel M. Harrison S.C. Hyman A. Stu2p binds tubulin and undergoes an open-to-closed conformational change.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The elongated structure is consistent with our measurement of the sedimentation coefficient of XMAP215 (see Supplemental Data, section 4.2). When it binds tubulin XMAP215 forms well-ordered globular complexes with a diameter of approximately 10 nm (Figure 3D). That is, the jointed, monomeric XMAP215 rod closes up around a tubulin dimer, forming a complex similar to that seen with dimeric Stu2p and tubulin (Al-Bassam et al., 2006Al-Bassam J. van Breugel M. Harrison S.C. Hyman A. Stu2p binds tubulin and undergoes an open-to-closed conformational change.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The formation of an XMAP215:tubulin complex suggests that XMAP215 could escort free tubulin to the end of a microtubule, thereby increasing the association rate of tubulin dimers to the end. If this idea were correct, our measurements of the end-residence time indicate that either (1) one XMAP215 molecule binds to multiple tubulins and brings them en masse to the end of the microtubule, or (2) XMAP215 executes multiple rounds of tubulin addition at the microtubule end. We have distinguished between these possibilities by examining the stoichiometry of the XMAP215-tubulin interaction. First, we used our size-exclusion chromatography to show that XMAP215 and tubulin dimers are in a 1:1 complex (see Supplemental Data, section 4.1). We observed that XMAP215:tubulin complexes do not change their elution profile at tubulin concentrations higher than those used in our polymerization assays, demonstrating that it is not possible to force more than one tubulin dimer into the complex. Using sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation, we measured a molecular mass of 220 ± 10 kDa for XMAP215 alone (see Supplemental Data, section 4.3), confirming that XMAP215, with a predicted molecular mass of 228 kDa, is a monomer (Cassimeris et al., 2001Cassimeris L.

We analyzed how H3 histone methylation and demethylation control expression of estrogen-responsive genes and show that a DNA-bound estrogen receptor directs transcription by participating in bending chromatin to contact the RNA polymerase II recruited to the promoter. This process is driven by receptor-targeted demethylation of H3 lysine 9 at both enhancer and promoter sites and is achieved by activation of resident LSD1 demethylase. Localized demethylation produces hydrogen peroxide, which modifies the surrounding DNA and recruits 8-oxoguanine–DNA glycosylase 1 and topoisomeraseIIβ, triggering chromatin and DNA conformational changes that are essential for estrogen-induced transcription. Our data show a strategy that uses controlled DNA damage and repair to guide productive transcription."

Following stimulation, GPCRs are rapidly phosphorylated by members of a family of GPCR kinases (GRKs) (Premont and Gainetdinov, 2007Premont R.T. Gainetdinov R.R.

The phosphorylation of receptors by GRKs leads to β-arrestin recruitment, resulting in the uncoupling of the receptors from G proteins and GPCR internalization. However, evidence obtained from cell culture systems (Luttrell et al., 1999Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.

We have recently shown in vivo that the Akt/glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) signaling cascade can be regulated by a signaling complex scaffolded by βArr2 (Beaulieu et al., 2005Beaulieu J.M. Sotnikova T.D. Marion S. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G.

Akt is a serine/threonine kinase regulated by phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3K)-mediated signaling. Activation of Akt involves phosphorylation of a regulatory threonine residue (Thr308) by phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and additional phosphorylation of Ser473 by the PDK2/TORC2 kinase (Alessi and Cohen, 1998Alessi D.R.

In turn, activated Akt phosphorylates GSK3β, a constitutively active kinase, on the Ser 9 residue and renders it inactive (Cross et al., 1995Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 by insulin mediated by protein kinase B.Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor (D2R), a prototypical GPCR, in the mouse striatum results in Akt inactivation and concomitant activation of GSK3β (Beaulieu et al., 2004Beaulieu J.M.

Importantly, βArr2 is essential for the regulation of Akt and GSK3 by D2R. Activation of this GPCR by tonic DA and/or dopaminergic drugs leads to the formation of a signaling complex composed of Akt, βArr2, and the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which dephosphorylates/inactivates Akt, as demonstrated pharmacologically (Beaulieu et al., 2005Beaulieu J.M.

Furthermore, regulation of the Akt/GSK3 signaling by βArr2 plays an important role for the expression of behavioral responses to DA or drugs such as amphetamine, which act on DA neurotransmission (Beaulieu et al., 2005Beaulieu J.M.

Although multiple molecular targets of lithium have been identified (Berridge et al., 1989Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6791-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of this kinase in mice reproduces behavioral correlates of hyperactivity and mania (Prickaerts et al., 2006Prickaerts J.

Here we provide evidence for the involvement of the Akt:βArr2:PP2A signaling complex in the pharmacological actions of lithium in vivo, thus indicating that β-arrestin signaling complexes may represent a target for drug intervention aimed at the regulation of GPCR signaling. To investigate the actions of lithium on the Akt:βArr2:PP2A signaling complex, wild-type (WT) and βArr2-KO mice were treated with lithium under conditions shown to activate brain Akt and affect behavior without toxicity in rodents (Beaulieu et al., 2004Beaulieu J.M. Sotnikova T.D. Yao W.D. Kockeritz L. Woodgett J.R. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Lithium antagonizes dopamine-dependent behaviors mediated by an AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 signaling cascade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 5099-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Administration of lithium (200 mg/kg i.p.), which produces brain concentrations of lithium of ∼1 mM (see Table S1 available online), to WT mice increased striatal levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-GSK3β (Figures 1A–1C). A similar increase of striatal GSK3β phosphorylation in WT mice was also evident with 100 mg/kg lithium (Figure 1D). In contrast, administration of lithium to βArr2-KO mice resulted in a minor reduction in striatal phospho-Akt and did not affect phospho-GSK3β levels (Figures 1A–1C). Comparison of basal phospho-Akt and phospho-GSK3β levels in WT and βArr2-KO mice showed that a lack of βArr2 markedly increased the phosphorylation of these kinases without changing their overall levels (Figures 1E and 1F). These data are consistent with a contribution of βArr2 in the regulation of Akt by PP2A in mice having a normal dopaminergic tone (Beaulieu et al., 2005Beaulieu J.M. Sotnikova T.D. Marion S. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. An Akt/beta-arrestin 2/PP2A signaling complex mediates dopaminergic neurotransmission and behavior.Cell. 2005; 122: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). However, since βArr2 may affect many signaling pathways it is important to verify if it is still possible to increase the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β in βArr2-KO mice in response to PI3K signaling. To assess this, we used bis peroxovanadium 1,10-phenanthroline (bpV(phen)), a potent activator of PI3K signaling that enhances Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation in cells (Lavoie et al., 1999Lavoie L. Band C.J. Kong M. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. Regulation of glycogen synthase in rat hepatocytes. Evidence for multiple signaling pathways.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28279-28285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown (Figures 1G–1J), intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of bpV(phen) to either WT or βArr2-KO mice resulted in an increased phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK3β in the striatum of these mice. Taken together these data indicate that βArr2 is essential for the regulation of Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation by lithium but not by PI3K-mediated signaling. We then proceeded to investigate the contribution of βArr2 to the acute behavioral responses to lithium. Inhibition of locomotor activity in a novel environment, a documented behavioral effect of acute lithium treatment (Beaulieu et al., 2004Beaulieu J.M. Sotnikova T.D. Yao W.D. Kockeritz L. Woodgett J.R. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Lithium antagonizes dopamine-dependent behaviors mediated by an AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 signaling cascade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 5099-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), was evaluated in WT and βArr2-KO mice. In nonhabituated WT mice, LiCl (100 or 200 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of horizontal activity (Figure 2A). As previously reported (Beaulieu et al., 2005Beaulieu J.M. Sotnikova T.D. Marion S. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. An Akt/beta-arrestin 2/PP2A signaling complex mediates dopaminergic neurotransmission and behavior.Cell. 2005; 122: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), βArr2-KO mice displayed reduced horizontal activity as compared to WT littermates when placed in a novel environment (Figure 2A). However, administration of LiCl to βArr2-KO mice did not affect horizontal activity (Figure 2A). LiCl was also administered by ICV injection under conditions known not to elicit peripheral responses to lithium in rodents (Smith, 1980Smith D.F. Central and peripheral effects of lithium on conditioned taste aversions in rats.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1980; 68: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In line with results obtained following systemic lithium administration, ICV lithium injections provoked a marked reduction of locomotor activity in WT mice while having no effect in βArr2-KO mice (Figure 2B), thus demonstrating that βArr2-dependent behavioral effects of lithium are centrally mediated. To assess the involvement of GSK3β in this action of lithium on behavior, GSK3β haploinsufficient mice (gsk3β+/−) (Hoeflich et al., 2000Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Requirement for glycogen synthase kinase-3beta in cell survival and NF-kappaB activation.Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar) were also tested. As shown (Figure 2C), vehicle-treated gsk3β+/− and WT littermates exhibited comparable locomotor activity in a novel environment. However, administration of LiCl (100 mg/kg i.p.) had a more pronounced effect on locomotion in gsk3β+/− than in WT mice, thus supporting the involvement of GSK3β inhibition in the locomotor-suppressing action of lithium. To further examine the contribution of GSK3β, we used direct pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 with the blood brain barrier-permeable GSK3β inhibitor thiadiazolidinone (TDZD-8) (Beaulieu et al., 2004Beaulieu J.M. Sotnikova T.D. Yao W.D. Kockeritz L. Woodgett J.R. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Lithium antagonizes dopamine-dependent behaviors mediated by an AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 signaling cascade.Proc.

Aging. 2006; 27: S13Google Scholar). Administration of TDZD-8 (30 mg/kg i.p.) to WT mice led to a reduction of novelty-induced horizontal activity comparable to that observed following lithium administration (Figure 2D). To address the possibility of a nonspecific toxic action of TDZD-8 we also administered this drug to habituated animals and monitored activity. Importantly, the effect of TDZD-8 on locomotion was specific to novelty-induced locomotor activity since this drug had no effect in habituated mice (Figure 2E). Lithium can inhibit GSK3β both directly (Klein and Melton, 1996Klein P.S. Melton D.A. A molecular mechanism for the effect of lithium on development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) and indirectly by enhancing Akt activity (Beaulieu et al., 2004Beaulieu J.M. Sotnikova T.D. Yao W.D. Kockeritz L. Woodgett J.R. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Lithium antagonizes dopamine-dependent behaviors mediated by an AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 signaling cascade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 5099-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, Chalecka-Franaszek and Chuang, 1999Chalecka-Franaszek E. Chuang D.M. Lithium activates the serine/threonine kinase Akt-1 and suppresses glutamate-induced inhibition of Akt-1 activity in neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 8745-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To address the relative contributions of these mechanisms we treated βArr2-KO mice with TDZD-8 to evaluate whether direct inhibition of GSK3β can affect novelty-induced locomotor activity in these mice. TDZD-8 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a reduction of horizontal activity in βArr2-KO mice resulting in activity levels comparable to those obtained with this drug in WT mice (Figure 2D). This indicates that novelty-induced locomotor activity can be further suppressed by a direct inhibition of GSK3 in mice lacking βArr2. Thus, the absence of a lithium effect on locomotion in βArr2-KO mice likely reflects a disruption of the indirect, Akt-mediated, inhibitory action of lithium on GSK3β (Figure 2F). Apart from their action on locomotion, lithium and GSK3 inhibitors also have effects on behavioral paradigms used to evaluate the action of antidepressants in mice (Gould et al., 2004Gould T.D. Einat H. Bhat R. Manji H.K. AR-A014418, a selective GSK-3 inhibitor, produces antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test.Int. J.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta haploinsufficiency mimics the behavioral and molecular effects of lithium.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6791-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Reduction of immobility times in the tail suspension test is a paradigm commonly used to evaluate “antidepressant-like” effects of drugs in rodents (Crowley et al., 2004Crowley J.J. Jones M.D. O'Leary O.F. Lucki I. Automated tests for measuring the effects of antidepressants in mice.Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2004; 78: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A first set of tests showed that acute administration of different doses of LiCl reduces immobility in WT mice (Figures 3A and 3B) and that GSK3β haploinsufficiency phenocopies this behavioral effect (Figure 3B). Furthermore administration of lithium to gsk3β+/− mice resulted in more pronounced reduction of immobility than in WT littermates (Figure 3B), thus supporting a role for GSK3β inhibition in the “antidepressant-like” action of lithium. To further establish the involvement of βArr2 in behavioral responses to lithium we performed the tail suspension test following acute LiCl administration to βArr2-KO mice. As shown (Figure 3A), while LiCl (75 or 100 mg/kg i.p.) caused pronounced reductions of immobility time in WT mice, these same treatments failed to induce significant changes in βArr2-KO mice. Measurement of the latency to cross from a dark compartment to an illuminated one in the dark-light emergence test is a simple behavioral assay used to assess the anxiolytic efficacy of antidepressants and anxiolytics in rodents (Crawley and Goodwin, 1980Crawley J. Goodwin F.K. Preliminary report of a simple animal behavior model for the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines.Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1980; 13: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, Weisstaub et al., 2006Weisstaub N.V. Zhou M. Lira A. Lambe E. Gonzalez-Maeso J. Hornung J.P. Sibille E. Underwood M. Itohara S. Dauer W.T. et al.Cortical 5–HT2A receptor signaling modulates anxiety-like behaviors in mice.Science. 2006; 313: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3C, acute lithium treatment markedly reduces the latency to cross in WT animals. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of GSK3β with TDZD-8 exerts a similar effect in these mice, thus suggesting a contribution of GSK3-mediated signaling events in this effect of acute lithium (Figure 3D). However, acute administration of LiCl (75 mg/kg) had no effect on this behavioral paradigm in βArr2-KO mice (Figure 3C). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that βArr2 is an important determinant of the regulation of behavior by acute lithium and suggest that this compound may exert part of its actions by interfering with the regulation of Akt and GSK3β by the Akt:βArr2:PP2A signaling complex. The observation that immunoprecipitation of Akt from striatal extracts led to a coimmunoprecipitation of the endogenous catalytic C subunit of PP2A in WT mice but not in βArr2-KO mice (Figure 4A) indicates that βArr2 is an essential scaffold for the interaction of these two signaling proteins in the mouse striatum (Beaulieu et al., 2005Beaulieu J.M. Sotnikova T.D. Marion S. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. An Akt/beta-arrestin 2/PP2A signaling complex mediates dopaminergic neurotransmission and behavior.Cell. 2005; 122: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). We next investigated the effect of lithium on the stability of the Akt:βArr2:PP2A signaling complex. In a first set of in vitro experiments, Akt immunoprecipitations were performed using striatal extracts from nontreated WT mice with lysis buffers containing various lithium concentrations (0 to 10 mM). These experiments revealed a destabilization of the Akt:βArr2 and Akt:PP2A C subunit interactions in lysis buffers containing LiCl concentrations greater than 0.5 mM (Figure 4B), thus suggesting that at these concentrations lithium can destabilize preassembled Akt:βArr2:PP2A signaling complexes in vitro. To further test this possibility, immunoprecipitations using antibodies directed against the B subunit of PP2A were carried out in the presence of 1 mM LiCl. PP2A is a multimeric protein complex composed of a structural A subunit, a catalytic C subunit, and one of a variety of targeting B subunits (Janssens and Goris, 2001Janssens V. Goris J. Protein phosphatase 2A: a highly regulated family of serine/threonine phosphatases implicated in cell growth and signalling.Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results, lithium prevented the immunoprecipitation of Akt with the targeting B subunit of PP2A (Figure 4C). In contrast, it did not affect the interaction of PP2A B and C subunits, thus indicating that lithium disrupts the Akt:βArr2:PP2A signaling complex without affecting the integrity of PP2A. To rule out the possibility that increased salt concentrations may nonspecifically affect the integrity of the complex, immunoprecipitations were carried out in the presence of higher concentrations of various chloride salts. As shown (Figure 4D), in contrast to LiCl (20 mM), other salts, KCl (20 mM), NaCl (20 and 100 mM), CaCl2 (20 mM), or MgCl2 (20 mM) did not markedly affect the βArr2-mediated interaction of Akt and PP2A, thus suggesting a selective role of lithium in destabilizing the Akt:βArr2:PP2A complex. To examine the effect of lithium on the Akt:βArr2:PP2A complex in vivo, we performed coimmunoprecipitations using a lithium-free lysis buffer and striatal extracts obtained from LiCl (200 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle-treated WT mice at 30 min post-injection. As shown (Figure 4E), lithium treatment prevented the βArr2-dependent interaction of Akt and PP2A, indicating that lithium also destabilizes the Akt:βArr2:PP2A signaling complex in vivo. It has been suggested that lithium may exert some of its pharmacological effects by competing with magnesium, a cofactor of multiple enzymes including kinases such as GSK3 (Birch, 1974Birch N.J. Letter: Lithium and magnesium-dependent enzymes.Lancet. 1974; 2: 965-966Abstract PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Ryves and Harwood, 2001Ryves W.J. Harwood A.J. Lithium inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 by competition for magnesium.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To explore the possible involvement of a lithium/magnesium competition on the destabilization of Akt:βArr2:PP2A complexes, coimmunoprecipitations were carried out using lysis buffers containing both lithium and various other cations. Remarkably, MgCl2 but not NaCl or KCl interfered with the disruption of preassembled Akt:βArr2:PP2A complexes by LiCl in vitro (Figure 4F). We then used purified recombinant proteins to examine the impact of lithium and magnesium on the Akt:βArr2 interaction. As previously shown (Beaulieu et al., 2005Beaulieu J.M. Sotnikova T.D. Marion S. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. An Akt/beta-arrestin 2/PP2A signaling complex mediates dopaminergic neurotransmission and behavior.Cell. 2005; 122: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), purified recombinant phospho-Akt1 directly and specifically interacts with a recombinant βArr2 tagged with glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Figure 4G). Purified GST-βArr2 was incubated with the recombinant Akt1 in salt-free buffer or in buffers containing either MgCl2, LiCl, or both salts. Immunoprecipitation of recombinant Akt1 following these incubations revealed that while Akt1 can form a complex with the recombinant GST-βArr2 in the presence of magnesium (20 mM), this interaction fails to occur in salt-free buffer (Figure 4H). Moreover, addition of LiCl (50 mM) to the buffer containing magnesium also prevents the interaction of Akt and GST-βArr2 (Figure 4H). These results indicate that magnesium is a cofactor for the interaction of Akt and βArr2. Furthermore, this suggests that lithium competition with magnesium can affect not only enzymatic activity but also the stability of higher-order protein complexes, thus providing a potential mechanism for the destabilization of the Akt:βArr2:PP2A complex by lithium. To address the general effect of lithium on βArr2-mediated GPCR desensitization and signaling, we tested whether it would interfere with the formation and cellular functions of other βArr2 protein complexes in vitro, in a cellular system, and in vivo. In a first set of experiments, a recombinant Flag-βArr2 was expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and endogenous cellular proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with the recombinant βArr2 in the presence or absen"

In response to ER stress, Ire1 catalyzes the splicing of target mRNAs in a spliceosome-independent manner. We have determined the crystal structure of the dual catalytic region of Ire1at 2.4 A resolution, revealing the fusion of a domain, which we term the KEN domain, to the protein kinase domain. Dimerization of the kinase domain composes a large catalytic surface on the KEN domain which carries out ribonuclease function. We further show that signal induced trans-autophosphorylation of the kinase domain permits unfettered binding of nucleotide, which in turn promotes dimerization to compose the ribonuclease active site. Comparison of Ire1 to a topologically disparate ribonuclease reveals the convergent evolution of their catalytic mechanism. These findings provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of action of RNaseL and other pseudokinases, which represent 10% of the human kinome."

We investigated the effects of removing large mammals on an ant- Acacia mutualism in an African savanna. Ten years of large-herbivore exclusion reduced the nectar and housing provided by plants to ants, increasing antagonistic behavior by a mutualistic ant associate and shifting competitive dominance within the plant-ant community from this nectar-dependent mutualist to an antagonistic species that does not depend on plant rewards. Trees occupied by this antagonist suffered increased attack by stem-boring beetles, grew more slowly, and experienced doubled mortality relative to trees occupied by the mutualistic ant. These results show that large mammals maintain cooperation within a widespread symbiosis and suggest complex cascading effects of megafaunal extinction."

https://openalex.org/W2054414357,"During development of the nervous system, axons and growth cones contain mRNAs such as beta-actin, cofilin and RhoA, which are locally translated in response to guidance cues. Intra-axonal translation of these mRNAs results in local morphological responses; however, other functions of intra-axonal mRNA translation remain unknown. Here, we show that axons of developing mammalian neurons contain mRNA encoding the cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB). CREB is translated within axons in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) and is retrogradely trafficked to the cell body. In neurons that are selectively deficient in axonal CREB transcripts, increases in nuclear pCREB, CRE-mediated transcription and neuronal survival elicited by axonal application of NGF are abolished, indicating a signalling function for axonally synthesized CREB. These studies identify a signalling role for axonally derived CREB, and indicate that signal-dependent synthesis and retrograde trafficking of transcription factors enables specific transcriptional responses to signalling events at distal axons."

We found that specific Hsp70/40s act before ubiquitination and facilitate Ste6p∗ association with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, suggesting an active role for chaperones. Furthermore, polyubiquitination was a prerequisite for retrotranslocation, which required the Cdc48 complex and ATP. Surprisingly, the substrate was soluble, and extraction was independent of a ubiquitin chain extension enzyme (Ufd2p). However, Ufd2p increased the degree of ubiquitination and facilitated degradation.

Newly synthesized soluble secretory and transmembrane proteins fold in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but those that fail to achieve their correct conformations may be retained in the ER and degraded by the cytoplasmic proteasome via a process referred to as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (Kostova and Wolf, 2003Kostova Z.

Misfolded proteins are sorted by a sequential checkpoint mechanism of ER quality control.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Soluble ERAD substrates are retrotranslocated, or dislocated from the ER to the cytoplasm after selection, and are easily accessed by the proteasome. In contrast, the identification and targeting of membrane proteins—particularly those that possess multiple transmembrane spans—are likely to involve more elaborate machineries given substrate complexity and difficulties during substrate solubilization and proteasome recruitment. The vast majority of ERAD substrates are ubiquitinated by E2 conjugating enzymes and E3 ligases, which, respectively, catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin from a ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) and are thought to aid in substrate recognition (Elsasser and Finley, 2005Elsasser S.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two integral membrane E3 ligase complexes, the Hrd1p complex and the Doa10p complex, play important roles during ERAD (Carvalho et al., 2006Carvalho P. Goder V.

Chaperones can help prevent the aggregation of misfolded lumenal proteins and soluble domains in membrane proteins during ERAD (Meacham et al., 1999Meacham G.C. Lu Z. King S. Sorscher E. Tousson A.

However, recent reports suggested that an Hsp70-containing or putative lectin-containing complex in the ER helps recruit a misfolded substrate to the Hrd1p complex (Hebert et al., 2005Hebert D.N.

Overall, the mechanism by which chaperones facilitate the degradation of a given class of substrates is not well understood. After selection, ubiquitinated ERAD substrates are delivered to the 26S proteasome, which is composed of two 19S “caps” (PA700) that mediate substrate deubiquitination and ATP-dependent unfolding and a single proteolytic 20S “core” (Voges et al., 1999Voges D.

Proteasome delivery requires an ER-associated AAA ATPase, Cdc48p (in yeast) or p97 (in mammals) (Jentsch and Rumpf, 2007Jentsch S. Rumpf S.

During the degradation of membrane proteins, Cdc48p might actively pull a transmembrane domain and a subsequent lumenal domain from the ER (Carlson et al., 2006Carlson E.J. Pitonzo D.

Alternatively, Cdc48p might “segregate” a polypeptide that has already been extracted or retrotranslocated from the ER membrane. Cdc48p might also act after retrotranslocation of the ERAD substrate by virtue of its interaction with a series of ubiquitin-binding proteins, including the E4 polyubiquitin chain extension enzyme, Ufd2p (Richly et al., 2005Richly H.

In principle, the degradation of polytopic membrane substrates could start from either end of the polypeptide, as proposed for FtsH in bacteria (Akiyama and Ito, 2003Akiyama Y. Ito K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18146-18153Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or degradation may commence from an internal site after an endoproteolytic “clip” (Liu et al., 2003Liu C.W. Corboy M.J.

In addition, treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors can result in the cytosolic deposition of aggregated Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) and other polytopic membrane substrates. The resulting aggresomes concentrate at a pericentriolar locus (Johnston et al., 1998Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. Aggresomes: a cellular response to misfolded proteins.J.

Dynamic association of proteasomal machinery with the centrosome.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), suggesting that ubiquitinated membrane proteins can be degraded in the cytoplasm after they are completely released from the ER membrane. To define the ERAD of misfolded polytopic membrane proteins, we reconstituted each step in this reaction using components (either microsomes or cytosol) prepared from the yeast S. cerevisiae. We demonstrate that ER membrane-associated Hsp70 and Hsp40s assist the recognition of a substrate by the E3 ligase, Doa10p, and must act “in cis,” and that Cdc48p binds to the ubiquitinated substrate and releases it from the ER membrane. Further, we show that Ufd2p elongates the polyubiquitin chain before the substrate is processed by the proteasome. Substrate ubiquitination could also be reconstituted with two other integral membrane proteins (CFTR and Sec61-2p). Thus, our system is robust and in principle may be employed to elucidate the ERAD pathway of any membrane protein that can be expressed in yeast. Ste6p∗, a 12 transmembrane ERAD substrate, is retained in the ER and is degraded by the proteasome in yeast. In addition, degradation is slowed when specific E2 conjugating enzymes (Ubc6p and Ubc7p), E3 ligases (Doa10p and Hrd1p), an Hsp70 (Ssa1p), and functionally redundant Hsp40s (Ydj1p and Hlj1p) are disabled (Huyer et al., 2004Huyer G.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Because the ERAD pathway for this substrate is relatively well-defined, and because of its structural similarity to CFTR, Ste6p∗ was selected for our first attempts to reconstitute the destruction of a constitutively degraded membrane protein. ER-derived microsomes were prepared from cells expressing HA-tagged Ste6p∗, and the membranes were incubated with yeast cytosol (which supplies the E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme and other factors potentially needed for ERAD), an ATP regenerating system, and 125I-labeled ubiquitin (125I-Ub). We chose 125I-Ub because the subsequent isolation of the ubiquitinated substrate would provide quantitative data. After Ste6p∗ was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and resolved by SDS-PAGE, ubiquitinated Ste6p∗ was observed as a “smear” with a minimum molecular mass of ∼140 kDa, which corresponds to the native size of Ste6p∗ (Figure 1A, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3). Substrate ubiquitination depended upon cytosol, physiological temperature, and ATP (Figure 1A, upper panel, lanes 4, 5, and 7). Methylated ubiquitin (Me-Ub), an inhibitor for polyubiquitin chain formation (Hershko and Heller, 1985Hershko A. Heller H. Occurrence of a polyubiquitin structure in ubiquitin-protein conjugates.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), reduced the extent of ubiquitination (Figure 1A, upper panel, lane 8). The addition of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, did not alter the amount of either the polyubiquitinated protein or the unmodified protein (see below). Consistent with in vivo data, microsomes lacking Ubc6p and Ubc7p failed to support Ste6p∗ ubiquitination (Figure 1B, lanes 2 and 8). Other in vivo data indicated that depletion of Doa10p does not completely inhibit Ste6p∗ turnover, possibly because Hrd1p partially compensates for Doa10p's absence (Huyer et al., 2004Huyer G. Piluek W.F. Fansler Z. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. Brodsky J.L. Michaelis S. Distinct machinery is required in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of a multispanning membrane protein and a soluble luminal protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38369-38378Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar; see Figure S1 available online). Indeed, microsomes lacking Doa10p or Hrd1p supported Ste6p∗ ubiquitination, whereas the simultaneous deletion of the genes encoding these enzymes inhibited ubiquitination (Figure 1B, lanes 3–6 and 9–12). The Hsp70 chaperone, Ssa1p, and the Hsp40 cochaperones, Ydj1p and Hlj1p, are required for Ste6p∗ ERAD in vivo, and as observed for other substrates these Hsp70 and Hsp40 homologs facilitate substrate ubiquitination (Han et al., 2007Han S. Liu Y. Chang A. Cytoplasmic Hsp70 promotes ubiquitination for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of a misfolded mutant of the yeast plasma membrane ATPase, PMA1.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26140-26149Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar; reviewed in Nishikawa et al., 2005Nishikawa S. Brodsky J.L. Nakatsukasa K. Roles of molecular chaperones in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control and ER-associated degradation (ERAD).J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, their mechanism of action has not been investigated. We therefore prepared cytosol and Ste6p∗-containing microsomes from wild-type SSA1 and temperature-sensitive ssa1-45 mutant cells. Before harvesting, cells were shifted to a nonpermissive temperature of 37°C for 45 min, which inactivates Ssa1-45p (Becker et al., 1996Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Functional interaction of cytosolic hsp70 and a DnaJ-related protein, Ydj1p, in protein translocation in vivo.Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3453-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Strikingly, Ste6p∗ was ubiquitinated in the SSA1 microsomes, whereas ssa1-45 mutant microsomes failed to support ubiquitination (Figure 2A, lanes 2 and 4). A similar result was obtained when microsomes were prepared from a strain bearing a temperature sensitive allele of YDJ1 (ydj1-151) and a deletion of HLJ1 (lanes 6 and 8). It is notable that these components must be supplied in microsomes and that cytosolic supplementation is ineffective (see Discussion). To generalize these results, we measured the in vitro ubiquitination of CFTR, whose degradation in yeast similarly depends on Ubc6p/Ubc7p, Doa10p/Hrd1p and Ssa1p (Gnann et al., 2004Gnann A. Riordan J.R. Wolf D.H. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator degradation depends on the lectins Htm1p/EDEM and the Cdc48 protein complex in yeast.Mol. Biol.

Hsp70 molecular chaperone facilitates endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As anticipated, CFTR was ubiquitinated in vitro in an ATP, cytosol, Ubc6p/Ubc7p, and Doa10p/Hrd1p dependent manner, and the ssa1-45 mutant microsomes failed to support ubiquitination (Figure S2). Together, the results indicate that the Ssa1p and Ydj1p/Hlj1p chaperones facilitate substrate ubiquitination. Because Ssa1p and Ydj1p/Hlj1p play multiple roles during protein translocation, folding, and degradation (Nishikawa et al., 2005Nishikawa S. Brodsky J.L. Nakatsukasa K. Roles of molecular chaperones in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control and ER-associated degradation (ERAD).J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we wondered if the impaired ubiquitination of Ste6p∗ resulted from a nonspecific secondary effect. However, we observed that the inclusion of purified Ssa1p/Ydj1p improved ubiquitination efficiency when added during a preincubation prior to cytosol addition (Figure 2B). Second, we assayed the in vitro ubiquitination of Sec61-2p, an ERAD substrate whose degradation is independent of Ssa1p (Nishikawa et al., 2001Nishikawa S.I. Fewell S.W. Kato Y. Brodsky J.L. Endo T. Molecular chaperones in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum maintain the solubility of proteins for retrotranslocation and degradation.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar; Figure S3). Sec61-2p was ubiquitinated in vitro in an ATP- and cytosol-dependent manner (Figure S3). Moreover, Sec61-2p ubiquitination was robust in ssa1-45 mutant microsomes (Figure 2C). We next asked whether Ste6p∗ ubiquitination is Ssa1p-dependent in vivo. Consistent with the results obtained from our in vitro assay, Ste6p∗ was poorly ubiquitinated in doa10Δ/hrd1Δ and ssa1-45 cells (Figure 2D). Given the fact that microsomes contain not only unmodified Ste6p∗ but also ubiquitinated Ste6p∗, 125I-labeled Ub may be attached directly onto Ste6p∗ and/or onto pre-existing, ubiquitin chains on Ste6p∗. Regardless, our results demonstrate that cytoplasmic Hsp70/Hsp40 chaperones directly facilitate Ste6p∗ ubiquitination in vivo and in vitro and validate the ability of the in vitro assay to recapitulate cellular phenomena. Based on these data, we hypothesized that the chaperones facilitate the incorporation of Ste6p∗ into the Doa10p complex and thus performed a chemical crosslinking experiment. Microsomes were prepared from Ste6p∗HA and Doa10p13myc-expressing SSA1 and ssa1-45 cells grown at 23°C and shifted to 37°C (Figure 3A). The microsomes were then treated with a membrane-permeable crosslinker (DSP) and Ste6p∗ was precipitated with anti-HA antibody. Although Doa10p precipitated with Ste6p∗, approximately half as much of the E3 ligase precipitated with Ste6p∗ when Ssa1-45p function was ablated (Figure 3B). In parallel, we performed the in vitro ubiquitination assay and observed a corresponding decrease in Ste6p∗ ubiquitination (Figure 3C). We also noted that the Doa10p-Ste6p∗ coimmunoprecipitation efficiency and Ste6p∗ ubiquitination efficiency rose in SSA1 microsomes from cells shifted to 37°C. This may result from the induction of Ssa1p and/or the ubiquitination machinery. In addition, we employed another crosslinker, DTSSP, a water-soluble analog of DSP. As shown in one of three representative experiments, an ∼2-fold reduction in Ste6p∗-Doa10p interaction was observed when ssa1-45 microsomes were employed (Figure 3D, lane 6). Furthermore, we noted a decrease in Ste6p∗-Doa10p association when microsomes from the ydj1-151/hlj1Δ strain were used (data not shown). These results suggest that Hsp70-Hsp40 facilitate Ste6p∗ ubiquitination by assisting in E3 ligase recognition. Substrate solubility is vital for the ubiquitination and degradation of ERAD substrates (Nishikawa et al., 2005Nishikawa S. Brodsky J.L. Nakatsukasa K. Roles of molecular chaperones in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control and ER-associated degradation (ERAD).J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was possible that Ste6p∗ aggregates in the ssa1 mutant and is excluded from the Doa10p complex. However, we failed to detect a significant loss of Ste6p∗ detergent solubility in ssa1-45 mutant microsomes as compared to WT microsomes when the mixture was centrifuged at 18,000 × g, a condition at which CFTR aggresomes can be pelleted (Johnston et al., 1998Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. Aggresomes: a cellular response to misfolded proteins.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar) and at 30,000 × g (Figure S6 and data not shown). We next asked if Ste6p∗ degradation might be reactivated in ssa1-45 mutant cells, which would otherwise be unlikely if the substrate formed a dead-end aggregate. Ssa1-45 cells were grown at a nonpermissive temperature for 40 min and then returned to 23°C (Figure 4A). To focus on the population of Ste6p∗ which was in a ubiquitination and degradation-incompetent state, cycloheximide (CHX) was added to the media before the temperature was lowered. We found that the Ste6p∗-Doa10p interaction (Figure 4B upper and lower panels) and that Ste6p∗ ubiquitination and degradation (Figures 4C and 4D, respectively) were restored after the temperature had been returned to 23°C. Moreover, Ssa1p was a component of a putative multichaperone complex, which may include Ydj1p and Hsp82p, and Ste6p∗ (Figure 4E). Ubiquitin chain assembly usually requires only an E1, an E2, and an E3. However, polyubiquitination sometimes requires the E4 polyubiquitin chain extension enzyme, which is encoded by UFD2 (Koegl et al., 1999Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. A novel ubiquitin"

These findings reveal the regulated deployment of a toxin gene for developmental programmed cell death in bacteria. While programmed cell death (PCD) pathway is a well-established eukaryotic developmental process, it is not clear if any developmental process in bacteria similarly require a well-defined PCD pathway. Obligatory cell lysis observed during Bacillus sporulation and Myxobacteria fruiting body formation exemplify forms of bacterial PCD (Lewis, 2000Lewis K. Programmed death in bacteria.Microbiol. Mol.

Myxococcus xanthus, a unique soil Gram-negative bacterium, exhibits social behavior during vegetative growth and multicellular development forming fruiting bodies upon nutrient starvation. The developmental processes of M. xanthus have been shown to be regulated by a series of sophisticated intercellular signaling pathways that activate expression of a different set of genes with precise temporal patterns during development (Dworkin, 1996Dworkin M. Recent advances in the social and developmental biology of the myxobacteria.Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 70-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Julien et al., 2000Julien B. Kaiser A.D. Garza A. Spatial control of cell differentiation in Myxococcus xanthus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). During M. xanthus fruiting body formation, the majority (approximately 80%) of the cells undergo altruistic obligatory cell lysis, while the remaining 20% are converted to myxospores (Wireman and Dworkin, 1977Wireman J.W. Dworkin M. Developmentally induced autolysis during fruiting body formation by Myxococcus xanthus.J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 798-802PubMed Google Scholar, Nariya and Inouye, 2003Nariya H. Inouye S. An effective sporulation of Myxococcus xanthus requires glycogen consumption via Pkn4-activated 6-phosphofructokinase.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although the exact autolysis mechanism remains obscure, M. xanthus contains a large number of autolysin genes encoding for enzymes that degrade the cell wall (TIGR: http://cmr.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/GenomePage.cgi?org=gmx). Curiously, however, none of these autolysin genes have been shown to be essential for developmental autolysis. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are widely found in bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. These systems generally consist of an operon that encodes a stable toxin and its cognate labile antitoxin. They form a stable complex under normal growth conditions, while under stress conditions the toxin is released from the complex to exert its toxic function as a result of antitoxin degradation. Genomic analysis of 126 prokaryotes revealed that there are at least eleven genome-encoded TA systems (MazEF, RelEB, DinJ/YafQ, YefM/YeoB, ParDE, HigBA, VapBC, Phd/Doc, CcdAB, HipAB, and ɛζ) in free-living bacteria, while obligate host-associated bacteria living in constant environmental condition do not posses the TA modules (Pandey and Gerdes, 2005Pandey D.P.

Alonso J.C. pSM19035-encoded zeta toxin induces stasis followed by death in a subpopulation of cells.Microbiology. 2006; 152: 2365-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it can be suggested that TA systems may play important roles during adaptation to environmental stresses. Among the TA systems, the MazE-MazF system is one of the best-studied systems; MazF from Escherichia coli has been shown to be an mRNA interferase specifically cleaving cellular mRNAs at ACA sequences to effectively inhibit protein synthesis and subsequently cell growth (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. MazF cleaves cellular mRNAs specifically at ACA to block protein synthesis in Escherichia coli.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). MazF induction in E. coli leads to a new physiological cellular state termed “quasi-dormancy,” under which cells are fully metabolically active and are still capable of producing a protein in the complete absence of other cellular protein synthesis if the mRNA for the protein is engineered to be devoid of ACA sequences (Suzuki et al., 2005Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Single protein production in living cells facilitated by an mRNA interferase.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2007Kolodkin-Gal I. Hazan R. Gaathon A. Carmeli S. Engelberg-Kulka H. A linear pentapeptide is a quorum-sensing factor required for mazEF-mediated cell death in Escherichia coli.Science. 2007; 318: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar reported that for the mazEmazF-mediated cell death a pentapeptide is required, of which production is growth phase dependent. Here, we analyzed the TA systems in the M. xanthus genome and found that it contains only a solitary mazF gene without a cognate mazE-like antitoxin gene. This mazF gene (mazF-mx) was found to be developmentally regulated and required for the obligatory cell death during fruiting body formation, as its deletion eliminated developmental cell death with a dramatic reduction in spore formation. Surprisingly, we observed that MrpC, an essential developmental transcription factor involved in the regulation of mazF-mx expression, functions as an antitoxin for MazF-mx by forming a stable complex with MazF-mx. We further demonstrate that the expression of the MrpC-MazF system is negatively regulated at the level of transcription via MrpC phosphorylation by a eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr protein kinase cascade (Pkn8(Pkn14 kinase)-Pkn14(MrpC kinase)) (Nariya and Inouye, 2005aNariya H. Inouye S. Identification of a protein Ser/Thr kinase cascade that regulates essential transcriptional activators in Myxococcus xanthus development.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Nariya and Inouye, 2006Nariya H. Inouye S. A protein Ser/Thr kinase cascade negatively regulates the DNA-binding activity of MrpC, a smaller form of which may be necessary for the Myxococcus xanthus development.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) under nutrient-rich growth conditions. Under these conditions, MazF forms a stable complex with a nonphosphorylated form of MrpC and the remaining free MrpC is inactivated by phosphorylation, so that MrpC transcription activator function is suppressed. We also show that MazF-mx is an mRNA interferase, which recognizes a specific five-base sequence, GUUGC in RNA, and cleaves between the two U residues. These findings uncover that a PCD cascade is involved in bacterial development, associating with a Ser/Thr protein kinase cascade, and is reminiscent of eukaryotic PCD. We found that in contrast to all known MazE-MazF systems in a number of prokaryotes, M. xanthus MazF (MazF-mx) is encoded by a monocistronic operon without any cognate antitoxin genes. Genomic analysis for the eleven known TA families using TBLASTN-Search, Pfam, and COG lists on the M. xanthus genomic database (TIGR) revealed the existence of a single MazF homolog (MazF-mx; MAXN1659) with no identifiable MazE homolog (Figure 1A). MazF-mx (122 aa) has 24% identity and 58% similarity to E. coli MazF (111 aa) (Figure 1B). The finding of such a solitary mazF gene appeared to be an exception to the hypothesis that the TA modules may play essential roles in bacterial cell growth during adaptation to environmental stresses by inducing a state of reversible bacteriostasis (Pandey and Gerdes, 2005Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). It also raises intriguing questions as to whether MazF-mx expression may be developmentally regulated and associated with developmental autolysis, and if there is an antitoxin for MazF-mx, considering the highly diverse nature of MazF antitoxins (Pandey and Gerdes, 2005Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). In order to identify the antitoxin for MazF-mx, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using MazF-mx as a bait and an M. xanthus genomic library (Nariya and Inouye, 2005bNariya H. Inouye S. Modulating factors for the Pkn4 kinase cascade in regulating 6-phosphofructokinase in Myxococcus xanthus.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1314-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). From 32 positive interactions found to associate with MazF-mx, 15 were encoded by mazF-mx and 17 were encoded by mrpC, indicating that MazF-mx forms an oligomer (dimer) and that MrpC may be a likely candidate antitoxin for MazF-mx. Interestingly, MrpC is a 248 residue protein that is a member of the CRP transcription regulator family and is chromosomally located 4.44 Mbp downstream of the mazF-mx gene. Importantly, the mrpC gene is essential for M. xanthus development (Sun and Shi, 2001Sun H. Shi W. Genetic studies of mrp, a locus essential for cellular aggregation and sporulation of Myxococcus xanthus.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4786-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and is a key early-developmental transcription activator for the gene for FruA, another essential developmental regulator (Ueki and Inouye, 2003Ueki T. Inouye S. Identification of an activator protein required for the induction of fruA, a gene essential for fruiting body development in Myxococcus xanthus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 8782-8787Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Additionally, phosphorylation of MrpC by a Ser/Thr protein kinase cascade is also involved in the regulation of MrpC function (Nariya and Inouye, 2006Nariya H. Inouye S. A protein Ser/Thr kinase cascade negatively regulates the DNA-binding activity of MrpC, a smaller form of which may be necessary for the Myxococcus xanthus development.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MrpC and MazF interaction can be further detected by pull-down assays using purified N-terminal histidine-tagged MrpC and nontagged MazF-mx expressed in the soluble fraction of E. coli cell extract (Figure 2A). Furthermore, in vegetative DZF1 cells, chromosomally encoded MazF-mx was coimmunoprecipitated with MrpC using anti-MrpC IgG (lanes 1 and 3 in Figure 2B), demonstrating that MazF-mx forms a complex with MrpC in vivo. In order to elucidate the role of MazF in the life cycle of M. xanthus, a mazF-mx in-frame deletion strain (ΔmazF) was constructed. While vegetative growth of ΔmazF was normal, we observed that development was profoundly affected. When the concentrated vegetative cells at the mid-log phase (2 × 1010 cells/ml) of ΔmazF and the parental cells (DZF1) were spotted (5 μl; 108 cells) onto limited-nutrient CF agar plate, DZF1 developed normally within 48 hr forming compact fruiting bodies (FB) consisting of myxospores, while development of ΔmazF was delayed and compact FB were not formed resulting in very poor spore yields (at only 8% of the yield of wild-type spores; Figure 2C). Even after 72, 96, and 120 hr of development, FB of ΔmazF cells appeared to be very loose and relatively translucent with poor spore yield (15%, 18%, and 18%, respectively) compared to DZF1. Cell autolysis and viability during development were also examined (Figure 2D); cell numbers for both ΔmazF and DZF1 almost doubled cell numbers at 12 hr after spotting on CF plates. After this time point, DZF1 cell numbers dramatically decreased to 18% due to autolysis. At the 24 hr time point, the surviving wild-type cells begin to be converted to myxospores. In contrast, ΔmazF cell numbers only slightly reduced to 77% and were maintained at that level even at 48 hr (Figure 2D). Interestingly, DZF1 cell viability was substantially reduced (less than 1%) after 24 hr of development, while over 30% of ΔmazF cells were able to form colonies on CYE plates (Figure 2E). When development-defective ΔmrpC cells (Nariya and Inouye, 2006Nariya H. Inouye S. A protein Ser/Thr kinase cascade negatively regulates the DNA-binding activity of MrpC, a smaller form of which may be necessary for the Myxococcus xanthus development.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were examined in a similar manner, they were found to be completely incapable of growth on CF plates (Figure 2D), while cell viability only gradually decreased in contrast to DZF1 and ΔmazF cells. The ΔmrpC cell could not form FB (Figure 2B), and the ΔmrpC cell viability continued to decrease (Figure 2E). A LIVE/DEAD stain technique (Invitrogen) was also applied to detect cell death during M. xanthus development. At 18 hr of development, approximately 63% of DZF1 cells lysed, which cannot be detected by the staining, but the remaining 37% of the cells were stainable, among which 54.3% were stained as dead cells (Figure 2F). On the other hand, only 9.2% of stainable ΔmazF cells were found dead (Figure 2F). These observations indicate that MazF-mx is required for developmental autolysis to achieve effective fruiting body formation and sporulation. Since the expression of the mazEF operon in E. coli is negatively autoregulated by the MazE-MazF complex (Marianovsky et al., 2001Marianovsky I. Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. The regulation of the Escherichia coli mazEF promoter involves an unusual alternating palindrome.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5975-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we next examined the role of MrpC in regulating mazF-mx expression. By primer extension (Figure 3A) using total RNAs isolated from DZF1, the transcriptional initiation site of mazF-mx was localized 164 bases upstream from the initiation codon (Figure 1C) for both vegetative growth and the development phases. Notably, the level of mazF-mx transcript significantly increased upon nutritional starvation (Figure 3A), indicating that mazF-mx is developmentally induced. To further confirm this notion, a lacZ-mazF-mx fusion was constructed and introduced into DZF1 at the original chromosomal location. β-galactosidase assay of this constructed strain (mazF-mxP-lacZ/DZF1) showed that mazF-mx-lacZ was expressed at approximately 20∼30 U during vegetative growth and steadily increased after 6 hr at the onset of development and reached 55 U at 24 hr (Figure 3B). These results are in agreement with the results of primer-extension analysis (Figures 3A and 3E). Next, we examined whether MrpC can bind to the mazF-mx promoter. Gel-shift assay using purified MrpC and the mazF-mx promoter region from −73 to +166 (PmazF; Figure 3C) showed that MrpC binds to at least two sites on the mazF-mx promoter region. On the basis of the consensus sequence: A/GTTTC/GAA/G and GTGTC-N8-GACAC (N is any base; Nariya and Inouye, 2006Nariya H. Inouye S. A protein Ser/Thr kinase cascade negatively regulates the DNA-binding activity of MrpC, a smaller form of which may be necessary for the Myxococcus xanthus development.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), two MrpC-binding sites may be assigned at the regions from −56 to −50 (MazF1) and from −29 to −12 (MazF2; Figure 1C). Binding of MrpC to the promoter region was found to be inhibited when MrpC was preincubated with MazF-mx (Figure 3D). Furthermore, the mazF-mx expression in ΔmrpC, analyzed by primer extension (Figure 3E), became undetectable during both vegetative growth and the development phase, indicating that MrpC is a transcription activator for developmental mazF-mx expression. In order to detect MazF-mx toxicity in M. xanthus, mazF-mx was cloned in an M. xanthus expression vector, pKSAT, which can constitutively express a cloned gene during vegetative growth and the development phase. The resulting pKSAT-MazF-mx was then integrated into the chromosome by site-specific (attB/attP) recombination. Furthermore, a hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged mazF-mx was also constructed and cloned in pKSAT (pKSAT-HA-MazF) to detect its expression in M. xanthus by western blot analysis. These constructs were first introduced into ΔmazF, resulting in the strains pKSAT/ΔmazF (vector control), pKSAT-MazF/ΔmazF, and pKSAT-HA-MazF/ΔmazF. No significant growth defect was observed in any of the strains during vegetative growth (Figure 4A). Note that MrpC expression level in ΔmazF was similar to that in DZF1 during both vegetative growth and development (not shown). The formation of the MrpC-MazF (HA-tagged) complex in pKSAT-HA-MazF/ΔmazF cells was detected by immunoprecipitation using anti-MrpC IgG in vivo (not shown). Importantly, the defective developmental phenotypes of ΔmazF were partially restored by the introduction of pKSAT-MazF, which could form compact FBs and yield myxospores at an intermediate level (Figure 4B), while the introduction of pKSAT vector alone was unable to restore the phenotypes. Notably, severe cell toxicity by MazF-mx was observed in ΔmrpC. While pKSAT-HA-MazF/ΔmrpC was able to grow in CYE medium, its growth-rate was significantly reduced and the cells could not reach to the maximum density (350 Klett) as the growth stopped at 220 Klett density (Figure 4A). Interestingly, the cells then rapidly lysed forming aggregates (to 50 Klett), while the density of control cells only gradually decreased without forming aggregates (to 220 Klett) at 72 hr. A very similar phenotype was observed with pKSAT-MazF/ΔmrpC. In this strain, significantly higher populations of the cells were found dead by the LIVE/DEAD stain (Figure 4C). Constitutive expression of HA-tagged MazF-mx in M. xanthus was confirmed by the western blot analysis using an HA antibody at the mid-log and mid-stationary phases (not shown). These results indicate that MazF-mx expression in the absence of MrpC expression is toxic, confirming the prediction that MrpC functions as an antitoxin to MazF-mx. Since MazF-mx expression did not exhibit strong cellular toxicity in E. coli (not shown), we speculated that MazF-mx may cleave mRNAs at more specific sites as compared to E. coli MazF. Purified MazF-mx did show endoribonuclease activity against M. xanthus total RNAs yielding free 5′-OH group (Figure 5A). When MS2 phage ssRNA (3569 bases) was used as substrate, it was cleaved into two major bands of approximately 2.8 and 0.8 kb with many minor bands between them (Figure 5B), suggesting that MS2 ssRNA may contain a preferential cleavage site for MazF-mx. Importantly, preincubation of MazF-mx with MrpC almost completely inhibited the MazF-mx endoribonuclease activity (Figure 5C), further demonstrating that MrpC functions as an antitoxin for MazF-mx. Next, to determine which of the two major fragments contains the 5′-end of MS2 ssRNA, the RNA labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase was incubated with MazF-mx and the 0.8 kb band was found to be derived from the 5′-end (not shown). Thus, we designed four primers at positions 1337, 1078, 0660, and 0252 from the 5′ end of MS2 ssRNA to identify the cleavage site. As shown in Figure 5D, the amount of the full-extended products decreased with primers 1337 and 1078 as the amount of MazF-mx was increased in the reaction, whereas no significant change was observed with primers 0660 and 0252, indicating that the preferential cleavage site exists between positions 0660 and 1078. Subsequently, the primer-extension analysis by primer 1337 was carried out with different amounts of MazF-mx to identify the exact cleave site (Figure 5E). At a low concentration of MazF-mx (0.1 μg; lane 2), a preferential cleavage was observed at the 3′ end of the U-0724 residue (GAGU!UGCA; ! indicates the cleavage site), which yields a 0.8 kb fragment. Preincubation of MazF-mx (0.1 μg) with MrpC (0.5 μg) resulted in complete inhibition of the cleavage (lane 5). When higher concentrations of MazF-mx (lanes 3 and 4) were used, new cleavage sites appeared at 1087 (AUGU!CAGG), 1106 (ACGU!AAUA), and 1241 (ACGU!AAAG) with several other minor cleavage sites that were detected after prolonged autoradiography of the gel (Table 1). A secondary structure of MS2 ssRNA predicted by MFOLD program (Zuker, 1989Zuker M. Computer prediction of RNA structure.Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 62-88Google Scholar; http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/mfold-simple.html) is shown in Figure 5F in which major cleavage sites are indicated by arrows. Interestingly, all cleavage sites are located on single-stranded regions, consistent with the previous finding that E. coli MazF cleaves only single-stranded RNAs (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang Y. Zhang J.

From the alignment of all cleavage sites (Table 1), the most preferred cleavage sequence for MazF-mx is GU!UGC, in which the first G residue may be replaced with A residue.Table 1Cleavage Sites of MS2 ssRNAPositionaPosition of U cleaved by MazF-mx at 3′-end in MS2 ssRNA.StrengthbStrength of cleavage observed by the primer-extension analyses.

Open table in a new tab Since MazF endoribonuclease activity has been shown to be inhibited by a moderate salt concentration and does not require metal ions (Pellegrini et al., 2005Pellegrini O. Mathy N. Gogos A. Shapiro L. Condon C. The Bacillus subtilis ydcDE operon encodes an endoribonuclease of the MazF/PemK family and its inhibitor.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of NaCl and MgCl2 on MazF-mx endoribonuclease activity using a synthetic 14 nt oligoribonucleotide, MS2-0724 (UUGGAGU!UGCAGUU). When 5′-end γ-32P-labeled MS2-0724 (0.01 pmole) was incubated with MazF-mx (50 ng) for 30 min at 30°C in 20 μl of MazF buffer without NaCl, the substrate was completely cleaved; however the cleavage reaction was found to be very sensitive to NaCl and MgCl2 at higher than 100 and 25 mM, respectively (not shown). This salt sensitivity of MazF-mx was found to be quite useful for purification of MazF-mx because a very high expression of MazF-mx in E. coli can be achieved in LB medium with high salt concentrations without coexpressing its antitoxin, as even low MazF-mx expression was lethal in the absence of salt (not shown). Interestingly, a severe developmental defect has been observed on CF plates containing NaCl at 100∼150 mM (Kimura et al., 2002Kimura Y. Mishima Y. Nakano H. Takegawa K. An adenylyl cyclase, CyaA, of Myxococcus xanthus functions in signal transduction during osmotic stress.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3578-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which may be at least partially due to the salt sensitivity of MazF-mx. During vegetative growth, MrpC is reported to be phosphorylated by a eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr protein kinase cascade that suppresses MrpC function to prevent untimely switch-on of the early developmental pathway (Pkn8(Pkn14 kinase)-Pkn14(MrpC kinase) cascade) (Nariya and Inouye, 2006Nariya H. Inouye S. A protein Ser/Thr kinase cascade negatively regulates the DNA-binding activity of MrpC, a smaller form of which may be necessary for the Myxococcus xanthus development.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The genetic disruption of the Pkn8-Pkn14 cascade causes upregulation of mrpC resulting in acceleration of FB formation but with less spore yield (Nariya and Inouye, 2005aNariya H. Inouye S. Identification of a protein Ser/Thr kinase cascade that regulates essential transcriptional activators in Myxococcus xanthus development.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the effect of MrpC phosphorylation on the MrpC-MazF system. In the pkn14 mutant (Δpkn14), the mazF-mx expression was also shown to be upregulated as in the case of mrpC expression during both vegetative growth and development (Figure 3E), and as expected a higher accumulation of the MrpC-MazF complex was detected (Figure 2B). Furthermore, it has been shown that the Pkn8-Pkn14 cascade is functioning mainly during vegetative growth (Nariya and Inouye, 2005aNariya H. Inouye S. Identification of a protein Ser/Thr kinase cascade that regulates essential transcriptional activators in Myxococcus xanthus development.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2C, constitutive expression of Pkn14 in DZF1 using pKSAT resulted in delayed development, while expression of Pkn14KN, which is unable to phosphorylate MrpC, in DZF1 caused faster development as previously shown with Δpkn14 (Nariya and Inouye, 2005aNariya H. Inouye S. Identification of a protein Ser/Thr kinase cascade that regulates essential transcriptional activators in Myxococcus xanthus development.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (see Figure 2C), probably because Pkn14KN forms inactive heterotetramers with wild-type Pkn14 produced in DZF1. Furthermore, we also examined the effect of phosphorylation of MrpC on its ability to form the complex with MazF. For this purpose, we tested how the pretreatment of MrpC with Pkn14 affects the mRNA interferase activity of MazF-mx using MS2-0724 RNA as substrate (Figures 6A and 6B). When 50 ng of MazF-mx was preincubated with 200 ng of MrpC (a ratio of MrpC to MazF-mx of 1.6), MazF-mx-mediated cleavage of MS2-0724 was completely inhibited (Figure 6A and also compare lane 1 with lane 2 of Figure 6B). However, when MrpC was incubated with Pkn14 in the presence of 1 mM ATP, the inhibitory function of MrpC decreased (lane 4, Figure 6B), while the addition of Pkn14K48N had no effect on the MrpC activity (lane 3). Pkn14 by itself did not show any RNase activity (lane 5). Next we examined if MrpC in the complex with MazF-mx can be phopsphorylated by Pkn14. As shown in"
https://openalex.org/W2086254897,"The Turonian (93.5 to 89.3 million years ago) was one of the warmest periods of the Phanerozoic eon, with tropical sea surface temperatures over 35 degrees C. High-amplitude sea-level changes and positive delta18O excursions in marine limestones suggest that glaciation events may have punctuated this episode of extreme warmth. New delta18O data from the tropical Atlantic show synchronous shifts approximately 91.2 million years ago for both the surface and deep ocean that are consistent with an approximately 200,000-year period of glaciation, with ice sheets of about half the size of the modern Antarctic ice cap. Even the prevailing supergreenhouse climate was not a barrier to the formation of large ice sheets, calling into question the common assumption that the poles were always ice-free during past periods of intense global warming."
https://openalex.org/W2075229853,"During spermatogenesis in the mammalian testis, preleptotene/leptotene spermatocytes differentiate from type B spermatogonia and traverse the blood-testis barrier (BTB) at stage VIII of the seminiferous epithelial cycle for further development. This timely movement of germ cells involves extensive junction restructuring at the BTB. Previous studies have shown that these events are regulated by testosterone (T) and cytokines [e.g., the transforming growth factor (TGF) -betas], which promote and disrupt the BTB assembly, respectively. However, the mechanisms underlying the ""opening"" of the BTB above a migrating preleptotene/leptotene spermatocyte and the ""resealing"" of the barrier underneath this cell remain obscure. We now report findings on a novel mechanism utilized by the testes to regulate these events. Using cell surface protein biotinylation coupled with immunoblotting and immunofluorescent microscopy, we assessed the kinetics of endocytosis and recycling of BTB-associated integral membrane proteins: occludin, JAM-A, and N-cadherin. It was shown that these proteins were continuously endocytosed and recycled back to the Sertoli cell surface via the clathrin-mediated but not the caveolin-mediated pathway. When T or TGF-beta2 was added to Sertoli cell cultures with established functional BTB, both factors accelerated the kinetics of internalization of BTB proteins from the cell surface, perhaps above the migrating preleptotene spermatocyte, thereby opening the BTB. Likewise, T also enhanced the kinetics of recycling of internalized biotinylated proteins back to the cell surface, plausibly relocating these proteins beneath the migrating spermatocyte to reassemble the BTB. In contrast, TGF-beta2 targeted internalized biotinylated proteins to late endosomes for degradation, destabilizing the BTB. In summary, the transient opening of the BTB that facilitates germ cell movement is mediated via the differential effects of T and cytokines on the kinetics of endocytosis and recycling of integral membrane proteins at the BTB. The net result of these interactions, in turn, determines the steady-state protein levels at the Sertoli-Sertoli cell interface at the BTB."
https://openalex.org/W2059774047,"The structure of the E. coli beta clamp polymerase processivity factor has been solved in complex with primed DNA. Interestingly, the clamp directly binds the DNA duplex and also forms a crystal contact with the ssDNA template strand, which binds into the protein-binding pocket of the clamp. We demonstrate that these clamp-DNA interactions function in clamp loading, perhaps by inducing the ring to close around DNA. Clamp binding to template ssDNA may also serve to hold the clamp at a primed site after loading or during switching of multiple factors on the clamp. Remarkably, the DNA is highly tilted as it passes through the beta ring. The pronounced 22 degrees angle of DNA through beta may enable DNA to switch between multiple factors bound to a single clamp simply by alternating from one protomer of the ring to the other."

Using structurally guided site-directed mutagenesis combined with several spectroscopic methods, we examined the roles of conserved amino acids within the bilin-binding domain of Deinococcus radiodurans bacteriophytochrome with respect to chromophore ligation and Pr/Pfr photoconversion. Incorporation of biliverdin IXα (BV), its structure in the Pr state, and its ability to photoisomerize to the first photocycle intermediate are insensitive to most single mutations, implying that these properties are robust with respect to small structural/electrostatic alterations in the binding pocket.

By cycling between Pr and Pfr, Phys act as light-regulated switches in various photosensory cascades. Phys are homodimeric complexes with each polypeptide containing a single bilin (or linear tetrapyrrole) chromophore, which binds autocatalytically via a thioether linkage to a positionally conserved cysteine (1Rockwell N.C.

BV is then attached to a cysteine residue upstream of the PAS domain via the C32 carbon of the pyrrole ring A vinyl side chain (8Wagner J.R. Zhang J. Brunzelle J.S. Vierstra R.D. Forest K.T. J. Biol.

In contrast, cyanobacterial and higher plant Phys incorporate phycocyanobilin (PCB) and phytochromobilin (PΦB), respectively, which are generated from BV, in part, by enzymatic reduction of the C3 vinyl side chain on pyrrole ring A to generate an ethylidene group (1Rockwell N.C.

Soc. 1980; 102: 4821-4828Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar). PCB and PΦB then bind via the C31 carbon of this side chain to a cysteine within the GAF domain, which is predicted to extend toward the same space as the N-terminal binding-site cysteine used by proteobacterial/fungal Phys (8Wagner J.R.

Thus far, most of our understanding has been derived from absorption and resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy, which have collectively identified several distinct but ill-defined steps during Pr → Pfr photoconversion (Fig. 1A). As Pr, the bilin is cationic with all four of the pyrrole ring nitrogens protonated (12Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Mark F. Schaffner K.

Using plant Phys as the example, photoexcitation with red light converts Pr (absorption maximum of the Q band at 666 nm) within picoseconds to the partially bleached Lumi-R photoproduct (absorption maximum at 688 nm) (14Andel F.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This conversion is predicted to involve a Z to E isomerization of the C15–C16 methine double bond between the C and D pyrrole rings of the chromophore (16Andel 3rd, F. Lagarias J.C. Mathies R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15997-16008Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Mizutani Y. Tokutomi S. Kitagawa T.

On the microsecond time scale, thermal relaxation steps lead to the formation of the Meta-Ra intermediate with a maximum absorption at 663 nm (19Tu S.-L., and Lagarias, J. C. (2005) in Handbook of Photosensory Receptors (Briggs, W. R., and Spudich, J. L., eds) pp. 121-149, Wiley-VCH Press, Weinheim, GermanyGoogle Scholar). The Meta-Ra intermediate in turn decays in microto milliseconds to a deprotonated Meta-Rc intermediate with an absorption maximum at 725 nm (20Foerstendorf H. Benda C. Gartner W. Storf M. Scheer H.

Finally, the Meta-Rc photoproduct decays to Pfr (absorption maximum at 730 nm) on a millisecond time scale in a process that likely requires reprotonation of the chromophore (12Kneip C.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Coupled with these chromophore relaxation steps are conformational changes within the polypeptide that alter the structure of Pfr versus Pr, which in turn are presumed to affect the kinase activity of the photoreceptor and/or its photoreversible interaction(s) with downstream signaling partner(s) (1Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 837-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 2Vierstra R.D., and Karniol, B. (2005) in Handbook of Photosensory Receptors (Briggs, W.

Once formed, Pfr will slowly revert nonphotochemically back to Pr or can be photoconverted rapidly back to Pr with far-red light (Fig. 1A). Neither pathway is well understood. The photoinduced Pfr → Pr conversion likely proceeds via a pathway distinct from that for the Pr → Pfr conversion but may use a similar but inverted proton migration cycle (1Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 837-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 21Braslavsky, S. E. (2003) in Photochromisms, Molecules and Systems (BrouasLaurent, D. H., and BrouasLaurent, H., eds) pp. 738-755, Elsevier Science BV, AmsterdamGoogle Scholar). To help understand the photochromicity of Phys at the atomic level, the three-dimensional structures of the Pr and Pfr forms would clearly be helpful. Recently, we accomplished part of this objective by determining the structure of the CBD as Pr, using the sole bacteriophytochrome photoreceptor (BphP) in Deinococcus radiodurans assembled with BV as the source. The original structure solved to 2.5 Å resolution (11Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), followed by a more refined model at 1.45 Å resolution (8Wagner J.R. Zhang J. Brunzelle J.S. Vierstra R.D. Forest K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12298-12309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), revealed that the GAF domain forms a deep pocket that cradles the Pr chromophore in a ZZZsyn,syn,anti configuration corresponding to a Z geometry for all methine bridge double bonds and a syn geometry for the A–B and B–C and an anti geometry from the C–D methine bridge single bonds (Fig. 1B). Other than positioning Cys-24 that forms the thioether linkage, the PAS domain has no direct contact with BV in the Pr conformer. Instead, it is connected indirectly to the bilin and the GAF domain through a rare figure-of-eight knot in the polypeptide (Fig. 1C). The structures also identified a heretofore unknown dimerization interface between sister GAF domains that could impact signaling within the Phy dimer and/or photochemical cooperatively between the adjacent bilins (8Wagner J.R. Zhang J. Brunzelle J.S. Vierstra R.D. Forest K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12298-12309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A similar crystallographic model was recently described by Yang et al. (26Yang X. Stojkovic E.M. Kuk J. Moffat K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) for BphP3 from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris, suggesting that the CBDs of all Phys have related tertiary structures. Inspection of the bilin pocket of the D. radiodurans and R. palustris BphP CBDs revealed a number of amino acids that could be important for covalent binding of the bilin, the unique spectral properties of Pr and Pfr, and the steps required for their interconversion (8Wagner J.R.

A. 2007; 104: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). Most of these amino acids are highly conserved throughout the Phy superfamily, further supporting their functional significance (5Karniol B. Wagner J.R. Walker J.M. Vierstra R.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Here we tested the importance of many of these residues through the analysis of engineered protein variants by absorption, fluorescence, and RR spectroscopy. Surprisingly, although nearly all of the DrBphP variants retained their ability to fold correctly, covalently attach BV, and form Pr, a majority failed to properly photoconvert to Pfr. In particular, we demonstrated the importance to Pr → Pfr photoconversion of contacts involving the propionate side chains of BV, the hydrophobic pocket that surrounds the D pyrrole ring, and the highly conserved Asp-207 and His-260 residues, which participate in an extensive hydrogen bond network involving several ordered waters and the bilin. Even subtle substitutions of Asp-207 became trapped in a deprotonated and presumably Meta-Rc-like state after red light irradiation. Collectively, the mutant analysis revealed that although assembly of the Pr form and photoconversion to the Meta-R intermediates are generally insensitive to most changes in the chromophore pocket, complete photoconversion to the Pfr form is strongly compromised, suggesting that the transition from the Meta-R intermediates to Pfr is a dynamic process requiring a number of critical protein/protein and protein/chromophore contacts. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—The full-length D. radiodurans BphP (encoding 755 amino acids) gene (27Davis S.J. Vener A.V. Vierstra R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2517-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using primers designed to introduce BamHI and XhoI sites before and after the designated length of coding region, respectively. The BamHI-XhoI-digested PCR products were cloned into pET21b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI), which was similarly digested, resulting in the addition of codons for an N-terminal T7 tag and codons for a His6 tag just before the stop codon. All site-directed mutations were introduced by the PCR-based QuickChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each coding region was sequenced completely by the dideoxy method to confirm introduction of the appropriate mutation(s) and the absence of secondary mutations. The DrBphP variants were expressed in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen, Madison WI) either by themselves or simultaneously with the Synechocystis PCC6803 HO gene cloned into pET 24a(+) (Novagen) (6Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). After harvesting the cells, all further steps were performed under green safe lights. Cells were homogenized in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole, and the resulting extract was clarified at 10,000 × g. To encourage complete chromoprotein assembly, the crude soluble extracts were incubated in darkness for 1 h in at least a 10-fold molar excess of BV or protoporphyrin IXa (PPIXa) prior to affinity purification. The holoproteins were then purified via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) using 1 m imidazole and 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for elution. The eluate was brought to 0.3 m ammonium sulfate and subjected to phenyl-Sepharose FPLC (GE Healthcare), using 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for elution. Covalent binding of BV to the apoproteins was monitored by zinc-induced fluorescence of the chromoproteins following SDS-PAGE (6Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric Analyses—UV-visible absorption spectroscopy was performed with a Lambda 650 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All proteins were diluted with 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) so that the Pr absorption maxima at ∼700 nm had an absorbance between 0.25 and 0.6. Spectra of Pr were measured for all proteins following an extended incubation in the darkness. The absorption spectrum of the photoconversion product was obtained immediately following saturating red light (690 nm) irradiation generated using a 10-nm half-bandwidth interference filter (Andover Corp. Salem, NH). Difference spectra were calculated by subtracting the red light-irradiated spectrum from the Pr spectrum. Fluorescence spectra were obtained using a QuantaMaster model C-60/2000 spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technologies International, Birmingham, NJ) with both monochrometers set to a 4-nm band pass. To obtain a more complete excitation spectrum for some of the DrBphP mutants, fluorescence emission was measured at 642 nm in addition to 620 nm. RR spectra were recorded with 1064-nm excitation (Nd-YAG cw laser, line width <1 cm–1) using Digilab Bio-Rad or an RFS 100/S (Bruker Optics, Ettlinger, Germany) Fourier-transform Raman spectrometers (4 cm–1 spectral resolution). The near-infrared excitation line was sufficiently close to the first electronic transition to generate a strong pre-resonance enhancement of the chromophoric vibrational bands, such that Raman bands of the protein matrix remained very weak in the spectra of the parent states (12Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Mark F. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15185-15192Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Michael N. Scheerer P.

PPIXa also did not contribute to the experimental RR data since it does not gain any resonance enhancement with near-infrared excitation. All spectra were measured at –140 °C using a liquid-nitrogen cooled cryostat (Linkam, Waterfield, Surrey, UK). The laser power at the sample was set at ∼700 milliwatts, which did not damage the chromoproteins as checked by comparing the absorption spectra of the samples obtained before and after RR data acquisition. The total accumulation time was less than 2 h for each spectrum. For all RR spectra shown in this work, the background was subtracted manually. Photoconversion intermediates were enriched by irradiating the samples with red light for a few minutes at the specified temperatures. Raw RR spectra measured from these irradiated samples included a substantial contribution from residual Pr, which was removed by subtraction, taking the characteristic RR bands of Pr as a reference. Further RR experimental details have been described previously (12Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Mark F. Schaffner K.

Here we exploited our high resolution models of D. radiodurans BphP (Protein Data Bank codes 1ZTU, 2O9B, and 2O9C (8Wagner J.R. Zhang J. Brunzelle J.S. Vierstra R.D. Forest K.T. J. Biol.

Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar)) as guides to directly test the importance of potentially key and often highly conserved amino acids in the CBD with a special focus on those close to the chromophore or central to the knot (Fig. 1, B and C). To minimize secondary effects caused by using truncated chromoproteins, all mutations were introduced into the full-length DrBphP polypeptide with its sequential arrangement of PAS, GAF, PHY, and HK domains. RR analysis revealed that the BV geometry of the unmodified full-length chromoprotein as Pr is nearly identical to that bound to the CBD truncation (supplemental Fig. 1A), 6D. von Stetten, J. R. Wagner, J. Zhang, R. D. Vierstra, and P. H. Hildebrandt, unpublished data. indicating that our CBD models should accurately predict the consequences of the mutations at least for the Pr state. How the mutations might affect Pfr awaits structural resolution of this state. Relative to full-length DrBphP, the CBD chromoprotein becomes trapped in a deprotonated Meta-Rc-like state in red light (supplemental Fig. 1B) (11Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), indicating the CBD structure by itself is missing key features for full Pr to Pfr photoconversion. BV assembly was either achieved in vivo following co-expression of the variant BphPs with a HO or in the crude E. coli lysates following the addition of purified BV (6Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Although these approaches could generate ample quantities of photoactive holoproteins, they precluded quantitative measurement of BV assembly rates. The complete list of variant proteins (38 substitutions/deletions affecting 16 positions), their solubility, ability to assemble with BV, and some of their photochemical and fluorescence characteristics are presented in Table 1.TABLE 1Spectroscopic and photochemical properties of DrBphP variantsConstructionExpression/solubilityBV covalent attachmentPr λmaxRed-irradiated λmaxQ/Soret ratioPhotoconversionPorphyrin fluorescencenmnmWild type+/+Yes7007512.69Pr/PfrNoΔN1-20+/+Yes7017522.34IntermediateNDE25A/E27A+/+Yes6987512.23Pr/PfrNo135A+/+Yes6997512.34IntermediateNDQ36A+/-YesNANANANANAQ36D+/+Yes6987522.47Pr/PfrNDQ36K+/-YesNANANANANAQ36L+/+Yes7017502.62Pr/PfrNDQ36N+/-NANANANANANAP37A+/+Yes7007562.42Pr/PfrNDY176H+/+Yes6967501.28IntermediateNoF203A+/+Yes6967382.13IntermediateNoF203H+/+Yes6957422.16IntermediateNoF203W+/+Yes7017512.37Pr/PfrNoD207A+/+Yes7007511.91IntermediateYesD207E+/+Yes7017512.20IntermediateNoD207H+/+Yes700NA0.83Locked in PrYesD207K+/+Yes700NA1.95Locked in PrYesD207L+/+Yes700NA1.93Locked in PrYesD207N+/+Yes7007511.74IntermediateYesD207Q+/+Yes7017462.02IntermediateYesD207S+/+Yes701NA1.59Locked in PrYesD207T+/+Yes7047511.87IntermediateYesI208A+/+Yes6957512.26Pr/PfrNoP209G+/+Yes6907451.97Pr/PfrNDY216H+/+Yes6977482.42Pr/PfrNoY216W+/+Yes6987510.67IntermediateNDR254A+/+Yes7007501.14Pr/PfrNDR254K+/+Yes7017502.45Pr/PfrNDR254Q+/+NoNANANANANAH260A+/+Yes6987481.16IntermediateNoH260D+/+NoNANANANANAH260K+/+NoNANANANANAH260N+/+Yes6987542.62IntermediateNoH260Q+/+Yes6977482.35Pr/PfrNoH260S+/+Yes6947481.50IntermediateNDY263H+/+Yes6987421.78IntermediateYesH290N+/+Yes6997472.95IntermediateNoH290Q+/+Yes7027462.58IntermediateYes Open table in a new tab Amino"

https://openalex.org/W2083001281,"Fragmentation can strongly influence population persistence and expression of life-history strategies in spatially-structured populations. In this study, we directly estimated size-specific dispersal, growth, and survival of stream-dwelling brook trout in a stream network with connected and naturally-isolated tributaries. We used multiple-generation, individual-based data to develop and parameterize a size-class and location-based population projection model, allowing us to test effects of fragmentation on population dynamics at local (i.e., subpopulation) and system-wide (i.e., metapopulation) scales, and to identify demographic rates which influence the persistence of isolated and fragmented populations. In the naturally-isolated tributary, persistence was associated with higher early juvenile survival ( approximately 45% greater), shorter generation time (one-half) and strong selection against large body size compared to the open system, resulting in a stage-distribution skewed towards younger, smaller fish. Simulating barriers to upstream migration into two currently-connected tributary populations caused rapid (2-6 generations) local extinction. These local extinctions in turn increased the likelihood of system-wide extinction, as tributaries could no longer function as population sources. Extinction could be prevented in the open system if sufficient immigrants from downstream areas were available, but the influx of individuals necessary to counteract fragmentation effects was high (7-46% of the total population annually). In the absence of sufficient immigration, a demographic change (higher early survival characteristic of the isolated tributary) was also sufficient to rescue the population from fragmentation, suggesting that the observed differences in size distributions between the naturally-isolated and open system may reflect an evolutionary response to isolation. Combined with strong genetic divergence between the isolated tributary and open system, these results suggest that local adaptation can 'rescue' isolated populations, particularly in one-dimensional stream networks where both natural and anthropogenically-mediated isolation is common. However, whether rescue will occur before extinction depends critically on the race between adaptation and reduced survival in response to fragmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2132849547,"CPT1c is a carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) isoform that is expressed only in the brain. The enzyme has recently been localized in neuron mitochondria. Although it has high sequence identity with the other two CPT1 isoenzymes (a and b), no CPT activity has been detected to date. Our results indicate that CPT1c is expressed in neurons but not in astrocytes of mouse brain sections. Overexpression of CPT1c fused to the green fluorescent protein in cultured cells demonstrates that CPT1c is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum rather than mitochondria and that the N-terminal region of CPT1c is responsible for endoplasmic reticulum protein localization. Western blot experiments with cell fractions from adult mouse brain corroborate these results. In addition, overexpression studies demonstrate that CPT1c does not participate in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, as would be expected from its subcellular localization. To identify the substrate of CPT1c enzyme, rat cDNA was overexpressed in neuronal PC-12 cells, and the levels of acylcarnitines were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Palmitoylcarnitine was the only acylcarnitine to increase in transfected cells, which indicates that palmitoyl-CoA is the enzyme substrate and that CPT1c has CPT1 activity. Microsomal fractions of PC-12 and HEK293T cells overexpressing CPT1c protein showed a significant increase in CPT1 activity of 0.57 and 0.13 nmol·mg-1·min-1, respectively, which is ∼50% higher than endogenous CPT1 activity. Kinetic studies demonstrate that CPT1c has similar affinity to CPT1a for both substrates but 20–300 times lower catalytic efficiency. CPT1c is a carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) isoform that is expressed only in the brain. The enzyme has recently been localized in neuron mitochondria. Although it has high sequence identity with the other two CPT1 isoenzymes (a and b), no CPT activity has been detected to date. Our results indicate that CPT1c is expressed in neurons but not in astrocytes of mouse brain sections. Overexpression of CPT1c fused to the green fluorescent protein in cultured cells demonstrates that CPT1c is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum rather than mitochondria and that the N-terminal region of CPT1c is responsible for endoplasmic reticulum protein localization. Western blot experiments with cell fractions from adult mouse brain corroborate these results. In addition, overexpression studies demonstrate that CPT1c does not participate in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, as would be expected from its subcellular localization. To identify the substrate of CPT1c enzyme, rat cDNA was overexpressed in neuronal PC-12 cells, and the levels of acylcarnitines were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Palmitoylcarnitine was the only acylcarnitine to increase in transfected cells, which indicates that palmitoyl-CoA is the enzyme substrate and that CPT1c has CPT1 activity. Microsomal fractions of PC-12 and HEK293T cells overexpressing CPT1c protein showed a significant increase in CPT1 activity of 0.57 and 0.13 nmol·mg-1·min-1, respectively, which is ∼50% higher than endogenous CPT1 activity. Kinetic studies demonstrate that CPT1c has similar affinity to CPT1a for both substrates but 20–300 times lower catalytic efficiency.

There are three different CPT1 isozymes: CPT1a (also called L-CPT1) encoded by CPT1a, CPT1b (also called M-CPT1) encoded by CPT1b, and the recently described CPT1c (also called CPT1-C) encoded by CPT1c. CPT1a and CPT1b have been extensively studied since they were cloned for the first time, in 1993 and 1995, respectively (1Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). CPT1a is the most ubiquitous expressed isoform and is found not only in liver but also in pancreas, kidney, brain, blood, and embryonic tissues. CPT1b is expressed only in brown adipose tissue, muscle, and heart. Both isozymes present significantly different kinetic and regulatory properties: CPT1a displays higher affinity for its substrate carnitine and a lower affinity for the physiological inhibitor malonyl-CoA than the muscle isoform (3McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). In addition, the amino acid residues that are critical for catalytic activity or malonyl-CoA sensitivity have been identified for both enzymes, and three-dimensional structures have been predicted based on the carnitine acetyl transferase, carnitine octanoyl transferase, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase II crystals (4Lopez-Vinas E. Bentebibel A. Gurunathan C. Morillas M. Arriaga de D. Serra D. Asins G. Hegardt F.G. Gomez-Puertas P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18212-18224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). CPT1a and CPT1b are localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane with the N and C termini facing to the cytosolic side. Western blotting and activity characterization suggested that CPT1a is also localized in microsomes, but expression studies with EGFP fused to the C terminus of CPT1a showed that CPT1a is targeted only to mitochondria and that previous detection of CPT1a in microsomes was probably derived from membrane contact sites between ER and mitochondria (5Broadway N.M. Pease R.J. Birdsey G. Shayeghi M. Turner N.A. Saggerson David E. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CPT1a and CPT1b have a critical role in the heart, liver, and pancreatic β-cells and are potential targets for the treatment of metabolic disorders, including diabetes and coronary heart disease. Less is known about CPT1c. Although the protein sequence is highly similar to that of the other two isozymes, CPT1c expressed in yeast or HEK293T cells displays no catalytic activity with common acyl-CoA esters as substrates (6Price N. der Leij van F. Jackson V. Corstorphine C. Thomson R. Sorensen A. Zammit V. Genomics. 2002; 80: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 7Wolfgang M.J. Kurama T. Dai Y. Suwa A. Asaumi M. Matsumoto S. Cha S.H. Shimokawa T. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7282-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). One explanation is that palmitoyl-CoA is not a substrate for CPT1c and that another brain-specific acyl-CoA might be its natural substrate. Expression studies indicate that CPT1c is localized exclusively in the central nervous system, with homogeneous distribution in all areas (hippocampus, cortex, hypothalamus, and others). The pattern resembles that of FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α (enzymes related to biosynthesis) rather than CPT1a or ACC-β (enzymes related to oxidation) (6Price N. der Leij van F. Jackson V. Corstorphine C. Thomson R. Sorensen A. Zammit V. Genomics. 2002; 80: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 8Sorensen A. Travers M.T. Vernon R.G. Price N.T. Barber M.C. Brain Res. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2002; 1: 167-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The capacity of CPT1c to bind malonyl-CoA has been demonstrated, and it has been suggested that CPT1c regulates malonyl-CoA availability in the brain cell. It has recently been reported that knock-out mice for CPT1c ingest less food and have a lower body weight when fed a standard diet. When these animals are fed high fat chow, body weight increases more than control animals, and they become resistant to insulin, suggesting that CPT1c is involved in energy homeostasis and control of body weight (7Wolfgang M.J. Kurama T. Dai Y. Suwa A. Asaumi M. Matsumoto S. Cha S.H. Shimokawa T. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7282-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Moreover, ectopic overexpression of CPT1c by stereotactic hypothalamic injection of a CPT1c adenoviral vector protects mice from adverse weight gain caused by high fat diet (9Dai Y. Wolfgang M.J. Cha S.H. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Herein we report that CPT1c is localized in neurons but not in astrocytes of adult brain. We also demonstrate that CPT1c is localized in the ER of the cells and not in mitochondria, and that CPT1c shows carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity. The human neuroblastoma cell line, SHSY5Y, the human embryonic kidney-derived cell line, HEK293T, and human fibroblasts cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose containing 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Medium for PC-12 cells was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose containing 2 mm glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 5% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells cultured in 24-wells plates were transfected with 0.8 μg of plasmid (purified with the Qiagen Maxi Prep Kit) using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiency was ∼30–50%. For pCPT1c-EGFP and pCPT1a-EGFP, rat CPT1c cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR performed with 2 μg of total rat brain RNA. The 2700-bp fragment amplified was cloned in pBluescript and sequenced. pEGFP-N3 vector (from Clontech, BD Biosciences) was used to clone the coding region of CPT1c or CPT1a, to create pCPT1c-EGFP and pCPT1a-EGFP, respectively. pCPT1c-EGFP and pCPT1a-EGFP plasmids encode CPT1c and CPT1a proteins fused to the N-terminal region of EGFP, respectively. pCPT1ac-EGFP—460 bp of the 5′ coding sequence of rat CPT1a gene was PCR-amplified with primers that created an HindIII site and an HpaI site at the ends of the amplified fragment. This PCR product was cloned into a pCPT1c-EGFP plasmid previously digested by HindIII and HpaI (which deleted the 460 bp of the 5′ terminus of CPT1c coding sequence). The resulting plasmid encodes a fused protein constituted by the N terminus and the two transmembrane domains of CPT1a, the catalytic domain of CPT1c, and EGFP. pCPTca-EGFP—A segment of the first 462 bp of rat CPT1c gene was PCR-amplified with two primers that created a HindIII site a PpuMI site at the ends of the amplified fragment. This PCR product was digested and cloned into a pCPT1a-EGFP plasmid, previously digested by HindIII and PpuMI (which deleted the 460 bp of the 5′ terminus of CPT1c coding sequence). The resulting vector contained the N terminus, the two transmembrane domains of CPT1c, and the catalytic domain of CPT1a fused to EGFP. pIRES-CPT1a and pIRES-CPT1c—The coding regions of rat CPT1a and CPT1c were cloned in vector pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech, BD Biosciences), which permits both the gene of interest and the EGFP gene to be translated from a single bicistronic mRNA. For co-localization studies we performed combined in situ hybridization/immunocytochemistry or double immunofluorescence, using standard protocols. For combined in situ hybridization, coronal sections (30 μm) from adult mouse forebrains were used. Processed sections were hybridized overnight at 56 °C, with cpt1c Riboprobes (full rat cDNA) labeled with digoxigenin-d-UTP (Roche Applied Science) at a concentration of 500 ng/ml. After stringent washing, sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with an anti-DIG antibody (1/2000) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Invitrogen). Tissue sections were mounted on gelatinized slides with Mowiol. Those sections that were hybridized with control sense Riboprobes did not give any hybridization signal. After in situ hybridization, some slices were collected and processed by immunofluorescence. The primary antibody was mouse anti-NeuN (1:75, Chemicon). The secondary antibody was biotinylated (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex was from Amersham Biosciences. Sections were developed with 0.03% diaminobenzidine and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide, mounted onto slides, and dehydrated, and coverslips were added with synthetic resin. In double immunofluorescence experiments, sections obtained as indicated above were incubated with primary antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (1/500, Chemicon MAB360) and CPT1c (1/100) overnight at 4 °C in the same blocking solution. The sections were washed three times in PBS (0.1 m) and incubated for 2 h with secondary antibodies coupled to fluorochromes Alexa 488 (for green fluorescence) and Alexa 568 (for red fluorescence) at a dilution of 1/500. Sections were mounted with Mowiol and observed using a confocal Leica TCS SP2 microscope (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Images were saved in TIFF format and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop 3.0. Cultured cells were grown on lysine-treated coverslips in 24-well plates. Co-localization studies were performed 48 h after transfection with plasmids containing CPT1c or CPT1a fused to the 5′-end of EGFP. To visualize the ER, cells were washed twice in PBS (10 mm), fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer and 60 mm sucrose for 15 min at room temperature, and then washed twice in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 1% (w/v) of Triton X-100 in PBS and 20 mm glycine for 10 min at room temperature and then washed twice in PBS. Nonspecific binding of antibody was blocked by incubation with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS with glycine 20 mm at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with mouse anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (BD Biosciences, 1:50 in 1% (w/v) BSA/PBS/20 mm glycine/0.2% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing twice in PBS/20 mm glycine, cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexafluor 546 (Molecular Probes, 1:500 in 1% (w/v) BSA/PBS/20 mm glycine/0.2% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 37 °C, and then washed twice in PBS. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol. Mitochondria were visualized by incubating cells with 500 nm MitoTracker Orange CM-H2TMRos (Molecular Probes) in complete medium for 30 min, followed by 30 min in complete medium without MitoTracker, after which they were fixed as mentioned above. Fluorescent staining patterns were visualized by using a fluorescence microscope (Leica). The captured images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. RNA was extracted from cells by the TRIzol method (Invitrogen) and quantified spectrophotometrically. 2 μg of total RNA was incubated with DNase and reverse transcribed by Superscript III (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's conditions. 2 μl of reaction was used in the real-time PCR amplification with TaqMan and primers designed by Applied Biosystems, following the manufacturer's conditions. An 18 S expression assay was used to normalize the samples. Cells were washed in cold PBS buffer and gently collected with a pipette. They were then centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed in PBS. 20 μl of samples was taken for Bradford protein assay. After that, 200 μl of 0.2 m NaCl was added to the pellet, and the mixture was immediately frozen in liquid N2. To separate aqueous and lipid phases, 750 μl of Folch reagent (chloroform:methanol, 2:1) and 50 μl of 0.1 m KOH were added, and, after vigorous vortex mixing, the phases were separated by 15-min centrifugation at 2000 × g at 4 °C. The top aqueous phase was removed, and the lipid phase was washed in 200 μl of methanol/water/chloroform (48:47:3). After vortex mixing, centrifugation was performed at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the lower phase (lipid extract) was dried. Acylcarnitines were analyzed via an LC-ESI-MS/MS System (API 3000 PE Sciex) in positive ionization mode as described in a previous study (10Jáuregui O. Sierra A.Y. Carrasco P. Gratacós E. Hegardt F.G. Casals N. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2007; 599: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Quantification was done through multiple reaction monitoring experiments using the isotope dilution method with deuterated palmitoylcarnitine as internal standard (200 ng·ml-1). 10 μl of sample was injected in the LC-ESI-MS/MS system. Multiple reaction monitoring transitions were as follows: 400.4/85.2 for quantification of palmitoylcarnitine, 4001.4/341.4 for confirmation of palmitoylcarnitine, and 403.4/85.2 for quantification of d2-palmitoylcarnitine. The method was linear over the range from 2 to 2000 ng·ml-1. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification were 0.14 ng·ml-1 (0.35 nmol·liter-1) and 0.48 ng·ml-1 (1.2 nmol·liter-1), respectively (in standard solutions). Cells were recovered by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed in 1.5 ml of PBS, and re-suspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 10 ng/ml leupeptin, and 100 ng/ml pepstatin). Cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization (30 pulses with loose pestle and 30 pulses with tight pestle). Homogenates were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. This crude extracted was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove the mitochondrial fraction. Supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to sediment the microsomal fraction. Pellets were immediately used in the carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity assay. Radiometric Method—Carnitine acyltransferase activity was determined by the radiometric method as previously described (11Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45001-45008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The substrates were palmitoyl-CoA and l-[methyl-3H]carnitine. Enzyme activity was assayed for 4 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 200 μl. The protein sample, 40 μl (20 μg), was preincubated for 1 min, and then 160 μl of the reaction mixture was added. The final concentrations were 105 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 2 mm KCN, 15 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 250 μm reduced glutathione, 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA, 400 μm l-[methyl-3H]carnitine (0.3 μCi), and 0.1% defatted bovine albumin. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of HCl 1.2 n, and the product acyl-l-[methyl-3H]carnitine was extracted with water-saturated n-butanol. Values were estimated by analyzing the data from three experiments performed in triplicate. All protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine albumin as standard. Chromatographic Method—The same procedure used previously (11Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45001-45008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was followed except that all carnitine used was cold (not radioactive). In addition, acylcarnitines extracted with water-saturated n-butanol were analyzed by an LC-ESI-MS/MS system, as described above. A polyclonal rabbit antibody against the last 15 residues (796–810) of mouse CPT1c was developed following the indications in a previous study (7Wolfgang M.J. Kurama T. Dai Y. Suwa A. Asaumi M. Matsumoto S. Cha S.H. Shimokawa T. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7282-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), by Sigma-Genosys. The specificity of the antibody was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot experiments. For CPT1a detection, a polyclonal antibody against amino acids 317–430 of rat-CPT1a (12Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was used. Generally, 60 μg of protein extracts was subjected to SDS-PAGE. A 1:2000 dilution of anti-CPT1c was used as primary antibody. The secondary antibody was used at 1:5000 dilution. The blots were developed with the ECL Western blotting system from Amersham Biosciences. Palmitate oxidation to CO2 and acid-soluble products were measured in PC-12 cells 48 h after transfection. On the day of the assay, cells were washed in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate/Hepes buffer (KRBH)/0.1% BSA, preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in KRBH/1% BSA, and washed again. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with fresh KRBH containing 2.5 mm glucose, 0.8 mm carnitine, 0.25 mm palmitate, and 1 μCi/ml [1-14C]palmitate bound to 1% BSA. Oxidation measurements were performed as previously described (13Herrero L. Rubi B. Sebastian D. Serra D. Asins G. Maechler P. Prentki M. Hegardt F.G. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To identify the types of brain cell in which CPT1c is expressed, co-localization studies with NeuN (a nuclear neuronal marker), or glial fibrillary acidic protein (an astrocyte marker), antibodies were performed in adult mouse brain sections. Fig. 1 shows co-labeling of CPT1c mRNA, as revealed by in situ hybridization studies, with NeuN. This pattern confirms that CPT1c is expressed mainly in neurons. In addition, no co-localization was detected between CPT1c and glial fibrillary acidic protein (double immunohistochemistry) (Fig. 1d), indicating that CPT1c is not present in brain astrocytes. CPT1c Is Localized in ER of Cultured Cells—To study the intracellular localization of CPT1c, fibroblasts were transiently transfected with pCPT1a-EGFP or pCPT1c-EGFP, which encode CPT1a or CPT1c proteins, respectively, fused at their C-terminal end to EGFP. 48–52 h after transfection, the fluorescence pattern shown by CPT1a-EGFP (which was expressed in a punctuate manner) was different from that of CPT1c-EGFP (which was expressed in a reticular manner). Co-localization studies were performed with MitoTracker, a potential-sensitive dye that accumulates in mitochondria, and with anti-calnexin, an ER integral protein. In some experiments cells were co-transfected with pDsRed2-ER (Clontech, Takara BioEurope, SAS), a subcellular localization vector that stains the ER red. Fig. 2 clearly shows that CPT1c is localized in the ER membrane, but not in mitochondria. In contrast, CPT1a is localized in mitochondria, as previously described in other cells (5Broadway N.M. Pease R.J. Birdsey G. Shayeghi M. Turner N.A. Saggerson David E. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The slight co-localization of CPT1a with the product of pDsRed2-ER may be due to the contacts between the ER membrane and the mitochondrial outer membrane, labeled as mitochondrial-associated membranes. To assess whether either isoform is localized in peroxisomes, other organelles implicated in fatty acid oxidation, co-localization studies were performed with anti-PMP70, a peroxisomal membrane protein. No major co-localization was observed between PMP70 and CPT1c or CPT1a. The slight co-localization of CPT1c with PM70 may be due to a residual localization of this protein in peroxisomes (Fig. 3). The same experiments were performed with SH-SY5Y cells, PC-12 cells, and HEK293T cells with same results.FIGURE 3Co-localization studies of CPT1c in perixosomes. HEK293T cells transfected by pCPT1c-EGFP or pCPT1a-EGFP were incubated with anti-PMP70 as primary antibody. Images were taken by confocal microscopy with a filter to see green emission, red emission, or the merged image.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CPT1c Is Localized in Microsomal Fraction of Adult Mouse Brain—To eliminate the possibility that overexpression experiments in cultured cells could modify the subcellular localization of CPT1c, we performed Western blot experiments with different cellular fractions of some adult mouse tissues. CPT1c was only present in brain tissue and absent in any other tissues analyzed (Fig. 4). In addition, CPT1c was localized in the microsomal fraction of brain (Fig. 4). Only some levels of CPT1c protein were present in brain mitochondria, probably by residual contamination from microsomes. The same membranes, once de-hybridized, were used with CPT1a antibodies, as a positive control for mitochondria. CPT1a was present at high levels in mitochondria from liver and kidney, and some residual levels were found in the microsomal fraction of all tissues examined. The N-terminal Region of the Protein Is Responsible for CPT1c-specific Subcellular Localization—We aimed to test whether the N-terminal end of CPT1c was responsible for the ER localization. We made new chimeric plasmid constructions in which 460 bp of the 5′ end of CPT1a gene (which encodes the two trans-membrane domains) and the mitochondrial import signal described by the Prip-Buus group (14Cohen I. Guillerault F. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5403-5411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was replaced by the 5′ end of CPT1c, and vice versa (see scheme in Fig. 5). The recombinant plasmids were called pCPT1ca-EGFP and pCPT1ac-EGFP, respectively. SY-SHSY cells transiently transfected with those constructions showed that CPT1ca-EGFP was localized in ER, and that CPT1ac-EGFP was localized in mitochondria, indicating that exchange of N-terminal ends between the two CPT1 isoforms swapped the intracellular localization of recombinant chimeric proteins (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that the N-terminal end of CPT1c lacks the mitochondrial import signal present in CPT1a and contains a putative microsomal targeting signal responsible for ER localization. CPT1c Does Not Participate in Fatty Acid Oxidation—To examine whether CPT1c participates in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, we measured increases in CO2 in PC-12 cells overexpressing CPT1c. As expected by its subcellular localization, CPT1c did not increase fatty acid oxidation, whereas CPT1a did (Table 1).TABLE 1Palmitate oxidation in PC-12 cells overexpressing CPT1c 48 h after transfection of cultured cells with pIRES-CPT1c, pIRES-CPT1a, or empty pIRES, cells were incubated for 2 h with [1-14C]palmitate. Palmitate oxidation to CO2 was determined. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Data for CPT1a are significantly different from control cells (p < 0.05).[14C]CO2 productionnmol/mg/hEmpty pIRES6.1 ± 0.9pIRES-CPT1c5.7 ± 0.7pIRES-CPT1a9.2 ± 2.1 Open table in a new tab To identify the substrate of CPT1c, we overexpressed the enzyme in PC-12 cells and attempted to identify any increased acylcarnitine species present in the lipid cell extract, 48 h after transient transfection. PC-12 cells were easily transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or Metafecten (Biontex, Germany) with transfection efficiencies of ∼40–70% of total PC-12 cells, as measured by the fluorescence in a cell-counter FACS Scan. PC-12 cells were transfected with pIRES-CPT1c, pIRES-CPT1a, or empty pIRES. Western blot experiments showed a 5- to 10-fold increase in CPT1c and CPT1a levels in transfected cells. The lipid fraction of transfected cells was extracted, and the levels of acylcarnitines were measured. To quantify acylcarnitines, we used a new HPLC-MS/MS method where no derivatization or ionic-pair chromatography is needed (10Jáuregui O. Sierra A.Y. Carrasco P. Gratacós E. Hegardt F.G. Casals N. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2007; 599: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Precursor ion scan of m/z 85 experiment allows the identification of all acylcarnitines present in the sample. Areas below chromatographic peaks (chromatograms acquired in multiple reaction monitoring mode) were measured for all acylcarnitines detected. Fig. 6 shows relative areas from chromatographic peaks present in overexpressing cells compared with control (cells transfected with empty expression vector). Cells transfected with pIRES-CPT1c showed an increase of >2-fold in palmitoylcarnitine levels (Fig. 6). No other acylcarnitine was significantly increased. Cells transfected with pIRES-CPT1a (positive control) showed a 5-fold increase in palmitoylcarnitine levels and a 2- to 3-fold increase in other long chain acylcarnitines. The Wilcoxon statistic test (a non-parametric test for two paired samples) between CPT1c-transfected cells and control cells indicated that only palmitoylcarnitine levels increased significantly in CPT1c-transfected cells. These results indicate that CPT1c has carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity and that palmitoyl-CoA is a substrate for the CPT1c isoenzyme. Once palmitoyl-CoA had been identified as a CPT1c substrate, we compared CPT1 activity in isolated microsomal fractions of PC-12 and HEK293T cells transfected with pIRES-CPT1c with the activity in fractions transfected with empty pIRES vector. CPT1c was overexpressed >10-fold, and the protein was found mainly in"
https://openalex.org/W1966381151,"The analysis of natural contact interfaces between protein subunits and between proteins has disclosed some general rules governing their association. We have applied these rules to produce a number of novel assemblies, demonstrating that a given protein can be engineered to form contacts at various points of its surface. Symmetry plays an important role because it defines the multiplicity of a designed contact and therefore the number of required mutations. Some of the proteins needed only a single side-chain alteration in order to associate to a higher-order complex. The mobility of the buried side chains has to be taken into account. Four assemblies have been structurally elucidated. Comparisons between the designed contacts and the results will provide useful guidelines for the development of future architectures."

Using old yeast as a model of α-synuclein expression in post-mitotic cells, we show that α-synuclein toxicity depends on chronological aging and results in apoptosis as well as necrosis. Neither disruption of key components of the unfolded protein response nor deletion of proapoptotic key players (including the yeast caspase YCA1, the apoptosis-inducing factor AIF1, or the serine protease OMI) did prevent α-synuclein-induced cell killing. However, abrogation of mitochondrial DNA (rho0) inhibited α-synuclein-induced reactive oxygen species formation and subsequent apoptotic cell death. Thus, introducing an aging yeast model of α-synuclein toxicity, we demonstrate a strict requirement of functional mitochondria. α-Synuclein is one of the principal toxic triggers of Parkinson disease, an age-associated neurodegeneration.

Furthermore, three missense mutations (A53T, A30P, and E46K) in the α-synuclein gene are linked to early onset dominant familial PD (2Kruger R. Kuhn W. Muller T. Woitalla D. Graeber M. Kosel S.

Recently, overexpression of wild type α-synuclein due to gene duplication or triplication was found to be sufficient to cause a familial form of PD (5Hardy J. Cai H. Cookson M.R. Gwinn-Hardy K.

In mammalian cell culture, α-synuclein has been reported to have polymorphic, dopamine-dependent neurotoxic effects as well as neuroprotective and antiapoptotic functions, depending on the specific type of neurons or mutants (6Xu J.

The biochemistry and pathogenicity of α-synuclein has been studied extensively in non-human model organisms including flies, nematodes, and transgenic mice, suggesting a role for α-synuclein in lipid and vesicle dynamics, proteasomal dysfunction, or oxidative stress (8Chandra S.

Most recently, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to succumb to human α-synuclein expression. Using this new model, a conserved link between endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi traffic and α-synuclein toxicity has been established (11Cooper A.A. Gitler A.D. Cashikar A. Haynes C.M. Hill K.J.

In addition, yeast is increasingly recognized as a model organism for the study of apoptosis and necrosis (13Madeo F. Frohlich E. Frohlich K.U. J.

In addition, yeast apoptotic death occurs in dependence of complex apoptotic scenarios such as mitochondrial fragmentation (19Fannjiang Y. Cheng W.C. Lee S.J. Qi B. Pevsner J. McCaffery J.M.

Finally, chronologically aged yeast cells are currently used as a valuable model to study oxidative damage and molecular conserved aging pathways of post-mitotic mammalian cells, and recent studies have demonstrated that aged yeast cells die exhibiting an apoptotic phenotype (23Fabrizio P. Battistella L. Vardavas R. Gattazzo C. Liou L.L. Diaspro A. Dossen J.W. Gralla E.B. Longo V.D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 24Herker E. Jungwirth H.

Here, we introduce chronologically aged yeast cultures as a new model to study α-synuclein toxicity during aging. Using strains devoid of mitochondrial DNA (rho0), we demonstrate that mitochondrial function is required for the deleterious consequences of α-synuclein expression. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—Experiments were carried out in BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) and respective null mutants, obtained from Euroscarf. All strains were grown on SC medium containing 0.17% yeast nitrogen base (BD Diagnostics), 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, and 30 mg/liter of all amino acids (except 80 mg/liter histidine and 200 mg/liter leucine), 30 mg/liter adenine, and 320 mg/liter uracil with 2% glucose or 2% galactose for induction of expression of α-synuclein-FLAG constructs. Induction of α-synuclein expression in rho0 strains was achieved using SC medium containing 1.5% galactose and 0.5% glucose since BY4741 rho0 cells are unable to grow on pure galactose medium. To construct WT-αSynFLAG and A53TFLAG, inserts were amplified by PCR with primers 3′-ATC TAC TAG TAT GGA TGT ATT CAT GAA AGG ACT TTC-5′ and 3′-ATC TAT CGA TGT GGC TTC AGG TTC GTA GTC TTG-5′, using previously described YEp181-synuclein or YEp181-A53T as template (26Zabrocki P.

Fluorescence microscopy to detect protein aggregation was performed using previously published pUG23-WT-αSynEGFP and pUG23-A53TEGFP constructs (26Zabrocki P. Pellens K. Vanhelmont T. Vandebroek T. Griffioen G. Wera S. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1386-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For abrogation of the mtDNA (rho0), BY4741 wild type cells were grown in full medium containing 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 3 days. The resulting respiratory deficiency was confirmed by complete lack of growth on obligatory respiratory medium (glycerol). Survival Plating and Test for Apoptotic Markers—Chronological aging experiments were performed as described (16Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K.

Notably, at least three different clones were tested for the survival plating to rule out clonogenic variation of the observed effects. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining, annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) costaining, and TUNEL staining were performed and quantified using FACSAria or a fluorescence reader as described (15Buttner S. Eisenberg T. Carmona-Gutierrez D. Ruli D. Knauer H. Ruckenstuhl C. Sigrist C. Wissing S. Kollroser M. Frohlich K.U. Sigrist S. Madeo F. Mol.

Immunoblotting—Preparation of cell extracts and immunoblotting were performed as described (16Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J.

Blots were probed with murine monoclonal antibodies against FLAG-epitope (Sigma), murine monoclonal antibodies against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma), and the respective peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified secondary antibody (Sigma). Age-dependent α-Synuclein-mediated Death Is Accompanied by Phenotypic Manifestations of Apoptosis and Necrosis—Although most neurodegenerative disorders only manifest well beyond adulthood, the relationship between cellular aging and eventual cellular demise has not been elucidated. To approach this question, we investigated toxicity mediated by human α-synuclein in the context of yeast chronological aging, an established model for regulation of aging in postmitotic mammalian cells (23Fabrizio P. Battistella L. Vardavas R. Gattazzo C. Liou L.L. Diaspro A. Dossen J.W. Gralla E.B. Longo V.D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 24Herker E. Jungwirth H.

Expression of wild type α-synuclein (WT-αSyn) and the hereditary toxic point mutant A53T under the control of an inducible galactose promoter accelerated chronological aging of BY4741 wild type yeast. After 3 days of aging, cells expressing WT-αSyn or A53T exhibited only ∼20% survival compared with ∼70% of the cells harboring the empty vector, as determined by clonogenicity (Fig. 1A). We next investigated whether α-synuclein-mediated death of aged yeast cells is of apoptotic nature. To quantify the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the superoxide-driven conversion of non-fluorescent DHE into fluorescent ethidium was assessed in an automated assay. The prolonged expression of WT-αSyn or A53T caused massive generation of ROS (Fig. 1, B and D). Moreover, the excessive death of cells expressing WT-αSyn or A53T was accompanied by a major increase (3-fold) in apoptotic DNA fragmentation as detectable by TUNEL staining (Fig. 1, C and D). The simultaneous detection of phosphatidylserine externalization and loss of membrane integrity with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and PI, respectively, discriminates between early apoptosis (annexin V+), late apoptosis eventually leading to secondary necrosis (annexin V+/PI+), and primary necrosis (PI+). As shown in Fig. 1C, expression of WT-αSyn or A53T stimulated the apoptotic externalization of phosphatidylserine and simultaneously led to an increase in cells only positive for PI indicative of necrosis (Fig. 1, C and D). Similar results were obtained using the wild type W303 transformed with constructs allowing expression of α-synuclein from the constitutive TPI1 promoter (data not shown). We conclude that α-synuclein triggers both apoptosis and necrosis during chronological aging of yeast. Under chosen conditions (high expression levels due to 2% galactose), WT-αSyn and the point mutant A53T exhibited similar toxicity (Fig. 1). However, at lower expression levels (using 0.5% galactose), A53T exacerbated WT-αSyn toxicity when survival and ROS accumulation was monitored at early time points after induction of expression. Fig. 2A shows that A53T killed a significantly higher portion of the cells when compared with WT-αSyn (24, 36, and 48 h after promoter induction). Consistently, the point mutation A53T enhanced α-synuclein-induced ROS production (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis was performed to ensure similar expression levels of WT-αSyn and A53T on 0.5% galactose (Fig. 2C). As previously shown (12Outeiro T.F. Lindquist S. Science. 2003; 302: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), WT-αSyn as well as A53T are associated with the plasma membrane and form cytoplasmatic inclusions (Fig. 2D). Thus, in aging yeast, α-synuclein expression leads to cellular toxicity, which is enhanced by introduction of the hereditary point mutation A53T. α-Synuclein-mediated Death of Aged Cells Does Not Depend on the Apoptotic Key Players Yca1p, Aif1p, or OMI (Nma111p)—Recent studies indicated that the mammalian apoptotic serinep-rotease OMI (also called HtrA2) and the yeast caspase Yca1p might be involved in α-synuclein-mediated toxicity (27Flower T.R. Chesnokova L.S. Froelich C.A. Dixon C. Witt S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 1081-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 28Strauss K.M. Martins L.M. Plun-Favreau H. Marx F.P. Kautzmann S. Berg D. Gasser T. Wszolek Z. Muller T. Bornemann A. Wolburg H. Downward J. Riess O. Schulz J.B. Kruger R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2099-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Therefore, we comparatively analyzed α-synuclein-mediated cell killing during chronological aging in yeast cells lacking YCA1, NMA111, or the mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor AIF1. Deletion of YCA1 had no effect on cell survival upon WT-αSyn expression during aging (Fig. 3A). Consistently, α-synuclein-induced DHE-detectable ROS accumulation during chronological aging was not affected by the absence of YCA1 (Fig. 3D). These results were confirmed using another ROS-sensitive probe, dihydrorhodamine (data not shown). Cytofluorometric quantification of DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) and phosphatidylserine externalization and/or membrane permeabilization (annexin V/PI costaining) further confirmed that Yca1p did not influence the α-synuclein-facilitated cell killing (data not shown). Furthermore, neither deletion of AIF1 nor deletion of NMA111 reduced α-synuclein-mediated death (Fig. 3, B and C) or ROS production during chronological aging (Fig. 3D). Similar expression levels of α-synuclein were confirmed in all knock-out strains using Western blot analysis (Fig. 3E). Autophagy has been implicated in cellular aging and α-synuclein toxicity during PD (29Gomez-Santos C. Ferrer I. Santidrian A.F. Barrachina M. Gil J. Ambrosio S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 73: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, survival of cells expressing WT-αSyn was not affected by disruption of the essential macroautophagy genes ATG5 or ATG6 (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that yeast death induced by α-synuclein is independent from autophagy. Functional Mitochondria Are Essential for α-Synuclein Toxicity—Oxidative processes mediated by enhanced ROS production are prominent traits of apoptosis and organismal aging throughout phylogeny. ROS are generated mainly from two sources: the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the unfolded protein response (UPR) machinery. The accumulation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum leads to prolonged activation of the UPR, which in turn causes oxidative stress and finally cell death in yeast (30Haynes C.M. Titus E.A. Cooper A.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). To test whether α-synuclein-mediated death depends on the UPR-activated cell death pathway, α-synuclein was expressed in the deletion mutants Δire1 and Δhac1, two key players of the UPR. Ire1p initiates the UPR by regulating the synthesis of the transcription factor Hac1p (31Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Neither deletion of IRE1 nor deletion of HAC1 affected α-synuclein-mediated toxicity (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting a pathway in which UPR signaling via Ire1p and Hac1p does not contribute to the loss of viability induced by α-synuclein. As mammalian and yeast apoptosis are under mitochondrial control (17Wissing S. Ludovico P. Herker E. Buttner S. Engelhardt S.M. Decker T. Link A. Proksch A. Rodrigues F. Corte-Real M. Frohlich K.U.

Med. 1995; 181: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), we next investigated the impact of mitochondrial function on α-synuclein-triggered cell death. Therefore, we generated cells that lack mitochondrial DNA (rho0) and thus are incapable of oxidative phosphorylation. Contrasting with its marked toxicity on wild type (rho+) cells, enforced expression of WT-αSyn or A53T failed to provoke the death of rho0 cultures during chronological aging (Fig. 4, A and B), although rho0 and wild type cells expressed similar levels of α-synuclein (data not shown). It should be noted that the lack of respiratory function via abrogation of mtDNA compromised overall survival during aging, presumably because these cells cannot switch from fermentation to respiration during the diauxic shift. Thus, we decided to closely monitor the kinetics of early α-synuclein-mediated death in wild type and rho0 cells. Wt-αSyn and A53T expression led to massive cell killing in the wild type at early time points (16–48 h) of aging, whereas death was completely inhibited in rho0 cells (Fig. 4C). Concomitantly, the deletion of mtDNA completely inhibited α-synuclein-induced ROS-generation (as determined by DHE staining, Fig. 4D) and phosphatidylserine externalization (Fig. 4E). Remarkably, at early time points of aging, death caused by WT-αSyn or A53T expression is predominantly due to apoptosis since cells only positive for PI did not increase within the first 48 h (Fig. 4E). Thus, abrogation of mtDNA, and therefore respiratory function, suppresses the apoptotic component of α-synuclein-mediated yeast cell killing. Interestingly, upon deletion of the mtDNA, and therefore prevention of the toxic function of α-synuclein, expression of WT-αSyn but not of A53T even suppressed the onset of apoptotic markers. At early time points, WT-αSyn expressed in rho0 cells significantly reduced the accumulation of ROS when compared with the corresponding vector control (p = 0.024 at 24 h) (Fig. 4D). Additionally, the externalization of phosphatidylserine and the loss of membrane integrity was diminished upon expression of WT-αSyn but not of A53T (Fig. 4E). These data are consistent with previous findings in mammalian cells showing that α-synuclein can have antiapoptotic functions (6Xu J. Kao S.Y. Lee F.J. Song W. Jin L.W. Yankner B.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 7Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In yeast, this protective effect becomes apparent only after abrogation of the toxic function via deletion of mtDNA and is absent in the A53T point mutant. In this study, we investigated α-synuclein-mediated toxicity during chronological aging of yeast cells using clonogenic assays combined with the assessment of cell death markers. Our data indicate that expression of WT-αSyn and the early onset PD-associated point mutant A53T dramatically reduces the survival of aging yeast cells due to a marked increase in ROS generation and the induction of apoptotic and necrotic cell death. These data extend previous observations made in yeast showing that α-synuclein-induced toxicity is related to the ability of α-synuclein to interact with the plasma membrane and to form inclusions (12Outeiro T.F. Lindquist S. Science. 2003; 302: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 26Zabrocki P. Pellens K. Vanhelmont T. Vandebroek T. Griffioen G. Wera S. Van Leuven F. Winderickx J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1386-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast to earlier findings using exponentially growing yeast cells expressing α-synuclein (27Flower T.R. Chesnokova L.S. Froelich C.A. Dixon C. Witt S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 1081-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), our results indicate that α-synuclein toxicity does not depend on the metacaspase Yca1p. Recent observations in mammalian cellular models and histopathological specimens from PD patients indicate enhanced UPR activity to be a primary cause for the loss of viability (34Yamamuro A. Yoshioka Y. Ogita K. Maeda S. Neurochem. Res. 2006; 31: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the apoptotic serine protease Omi/HtrA2 to be an executor of α-synuclein-mediated cell death (28Strauss K.M. Martins L.M.

However, in yeast, neither key components of the UPR nor Omi (Nma111p) or the apoptosis-inducing factor Aif1p seem to impart α-synuclein toxicity.

However, in yeast, α-synuclein must rely on other, more general mechanisms, for the simple reason that yeast lacks analogues of neuron-specific ion channels or neurotransmitters. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have long been recognized as key factors that operate in the pathogenesis of PD (9Kroemer G. Blomgren K. PLoS. Biol. 2007; 5: e206Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A significant reduction of cardiolipin in mitochondrial membranes concomitant with a drop in complex II and complex III activity was noticed in α-synuclein knock-out mice (37Ellis C.E. Murphy E.J. Mitchell D.C. Golovko M.Y. Scaglia F. Barcelo-Coblijn G.C. Nussbaum R.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10190-10201Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of the mitochondria-associated proteins Parkin, DJ-1, and PINK1 has further strengthened the importance of mitochondrial functions and placed apoptosis to the forefront of PD biology (38Abou-Sleiman P.M. Muqit M.M. Wood N.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 39Wood-Kaczmar A. Gandhi S. Wood N.W. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 521-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In this line, our studies identified mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation as central players in α-synuclein-mediated apoptosis and necrosis of yeast cells since deletion of mtDNA completely abrogates the toxic function of WT-αSyn and A53T. It should be noted that survival of rho0 cells is compromised during aging, especially at later time points (since these cells cannot switch from fermentation to respiration during the diauxic shift). Nonetheless, under conditions where deletion of mtDNA itself does not sensitize cells to apoptosis (early time points during aging, Fig. 4, C and D), it still clearly protects cells against death mediated by α-synuclein expression. Moreover, under these conditions, a protective function of WT-αSyn on apoptotic and necrotic markers is observable. Once more, these studies show the potential offered by yeast models for defining novel fundamental mechanisms and factors involved in the pathogenesis of PD.

Here we demonstrate that protons can act as a direct transmitter from intestinal cells to stimulate muscle contraction. During the C. elegans defecation motor program the posterior body muscles contract even in the absence of neuronal inputs or vesicular neurotransmission. In this study, we demonstrate that the space between the intestine and the muscle is acidified just prior to muscle contraction and that the release of caged protons is sufficient to induce muscle contraction. PBO-4 is a putative Na+/H+ ion exchanger expressed on the basolateral membrane of the intestine, juxtaposed to the posterior body muscles. In pbo-4 mutants the extracellular space is not acidified and the muscles fail to contract. The pbo-5 and pbo-6 genes encode subunits of a “cys-loop” proton-gated cation channel required for muscles to respond to acidification. In heterologous expression assays the PBO receptor is half-maximally activated at a pH of 6.8.

In heterologous expression assays the PBO receptor is half-maximally activated at a pH of 6.8. The identification of the mechanisms for release and reception of proton signals establishes a highly unusual mechanism for intercellular communication. The release of small molecule transmitters is the major mechanism of fast information exchange in the central nervous system. Usually, classical neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles. Calcium stimulates the fusion of the synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane and releases the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. The transmitter then binds to ligand-gated ion channels that either excite or inhibit the target cell. However, other neurotransmitters are released via noncanonical mechanisms. For example, gaseous neurotransmitters are not released via synaptic vesicles but pass directly through membranes (Baranano et al., 2001Baranano D.E. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Atypical neural messengers.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 99-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These unusual properties concealed the functions of gaseous neurotransmitters for quite some time. There are other candidate molecules that may function as bona fide neurotransmitters but have been set aside due to our incomplete understanding of their biological functions. The proton in particular has properties that make it well suited to play a role in neurotransmission. Although sparse, hydrogen ions (H+) are of enormous biological significance (Kaila and Ransom, 1998Kaila K. Ransom B.R. pH and brain function. Wiley-Liss, New York1998Google Scholar). For example, free H+ ions can ionize the side groups of proteins and thereby affect the structure and function of proteins. Recently it has been demonstrated that molecules involved in proton signaling are vital for appropriate central nervous system function. Specifically, mouse knockouts have demonstrated that proteins involved in both proton secretion and sensing are required for broad physiological functions that range from pH homeostasis to learning and memory (Bell et al., 1999Bell S.M. Schreiner C.M. Schultheis P.J. Miller M.L. Evans R.L. Vorhees C.V. Shull G.E. Scott W.J. Targeted disruption of the murine Nhe1 locus induces ataxia, growth retardation, and seizures.Am. J.

USA. 2006; 103: 16556-16561Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To function as an intercellular signal, H+ ions must be released from a cell in a regulated way. Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) are ubiquitously expressed proteins capable of regulated release of protons. NHEs catalyze the electroneutral exchange of Na+ and H+ ions. In general, eukaryotic NHEs transport one Na+ ion in and one H+ ion out of the cell, thereby alkalinizing the cytoplasm and acidifying the extracellular environment. NHEs are regulated by many distinct signaling molecules, including calmodulin (CaM), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and calcineurin homologous protein (CHP) (Aharonovitz et al., 2000Aharonovitz O.

NHEs have been implicated in numerous physiological processes such as acidification of the intestinal lumen, intracellular pH homeostasis, cell volume regulation, and reabsorption of NaCl across epithelial cells (Counillon and Pouyssegur, 2000Counillon L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, some phenotypes suggest that proton secretion may play broader roles in cellular function. For example, NHE1 mutant mice exhibit growth retardation, ataxia, seizures, and defects in cell morphology and adhesion (Bell et al., 1999Bell S.M. Schreiner C.M. Schultheis P.J. Miller M.L. Evans R.L. Vorhees C.V. Shull G.E. Scott W.J. Targeted disruption of the murine Nhe1 locus induces ataxia, growth retardation, and seizures.Am. J.

However, it is unclear whether these phenotypes are due to a loss of proton-mediated intercellular signaling or to a side effect of pH misregulation. If H+ ion secretion mediates signals between cells, there must be proton receptors. It is known that protons can modulate neurotransmission. Practically all ligand-gated ion channels are affected by extracellular pH shifts. Ionotropic acetylcholine and NMDA receptors are reversibly inhibited by acidic pH and potentiated by alkaline pH (Del Castillo et al., 1962Del Castillo J. Nelson Jr., T.E. Sanchez V.

Conversely, ionotropic GABA receptors are potentiated by acidic pH and inhibited by alkaline pH (Kaila, 1994Kaila K. Ionic basis of GABAA receptor channel function in the nervous system.Prog.

Anion permeability of the inhibitory post-synaptic membrane of the crayfish neuromuscular junction.J. Physiol. 1967; 191: 575-590PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to playing a modulatory role in neurotransmission, protons have been demonstrated to be the major ligand for particular classes of ligand-gated ion channels. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are members of the ENaC/ Degenerin family of ion channels and are gated by protons (Kaila and Ransom, 1998Kaila K. Ransom B.R. pH and brain function. Wiley-Liss, New York1998Google Scholar, Waldmann and Lazdunski, 1998Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. H(+)-gated cation channels: neuronal acid sensors in the NaC/DEG family of ion channels.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Some of these channels are involved in monitoring pH in external environments and may act in nociceptive sensory neurons (Krishtal, 2003Krishtal O. The ASICs: signaling molecules? Modulators?.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 477-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Recently, a “cys-loop” family proton-gated ion channel was identified in cyanobacteria that could be involved in adaptation to environmental pH (Bocquet et al., 2007Bocquet N. Prado de Carvalho L. Cartaud J. Neyton J. Le Poupon C. Taly A. Grutter T. Changeux J.P. Corringer P.J. A prokaryotic proton-gated ion channel from the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor family.Nature. 2007; 445: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It is possible that some pH receptors sense internally generated pH changes, since a subset of ASIC receptors are expressed in the central nervous system and mouse mutants lacking ASIC1 exhibit locomotory and dendritic spine defects (Wemmie et al., 2002Wemmie J.A. Chen J. Askwith C.C. Hruska-Hageman A.M. Price M.P. Nolan B.C. Yoder P.G. Lamani E. Hoshi T.

Wemmie J.A. Green S.H. Welsh M.J. Acid-sensing ion channel 1a is a postsynaptic proton receptor that affects the density of dendritic spines.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 16556-16561Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear if protons are released in a physiologically relevant manner to mediate intercellular communication. Here we demonstrate that H+ ions act as a transmitter for muscle contraction during the defecation cycle in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The defecation cycle is a stereotyped behavior that occurs every 50 s for the life of the animal and is characterized by the coordinated activation of three independent muscle contractions (Croll, 1975Croll N.A. Behavioural analysis of nematode movement.Adv. Parasitol. 1975; 13: 71-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Thomas, 1990Thomas J.H. Genetic analysis of defecation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1990; 124: 855-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The defecation motor program begins with a sustained contraction of the posterior body muscles; these muscles relax, 3 s later the anterior body muscles contract, and a moment later the enteric muscles contract, expelling the contents of the intestine (Figure 1A). The intestine itself is the timekeeper for the defecation cycle (Dal Santo et al., 1999Dal Santo P. Logan M.A. Chisholm A.D. Jorgensen E.M. The inositol trisphosphate receptor regulates a 50-second behavioral rhythm in C. elegans.Cell. 1999; 98: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The cycle period is set by the activity of the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor, which regulates release of calcium from storage organelles in the intestine. An anteriorly directed calcium wave directly precedes the motor program and controls the dynamics of the posterior body muscle contraction (Espelt et al., 2005Espelt M.V. Estevez A.Y. Yin X. Strange K. Oscillatory Ca2+ Signaling in the Isolated Caenorhabditis elegans Intestine: Role of the Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate Receptor and Phospholipases C beta and gamma.J. Gen.

Biol. 2007; 17: 1601-1608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). How might the activity in the posterior intestine direct the contraction of the posterior body muscles? Neither extensive laser ablations of neurons nor mutants in synaptic transmission disrupted the posterior body contraction, suggesting that signaling for this muscle contraction appears to be controlled via a non-neuronal mechanism. To identify the genes required for signaling posterior body contractions, we screened for mutants defective for this motor step (Pbo mutants). In this study, we describe the pbo-4, pbo-5, and pbo-6 genes. PBO-4 is most closely related to the mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 and is localized to the posterior intestine. PBO-5 and PBO-6 encode subunits of a proton-gated cys-loop cation channel. These studies suggest that H+ ions act as a primary transmitter that activates the posterior body contraction during the defecation cycle in C. elegans. Calcium is released from intracellular stores in the intestinal cells immediately before the posterior body contraction of the defection cycle, suggesting that this calcium spike might initiate the behavioral program (Dal Santo et al., 1999Dal Santo P. Logan M.A. Chisholm A.D. Jorgensen E.M. The inositol trisphosphate receptor regulates a 50-second behavioral rhythm in C. elegans.Cell. 1999; 98: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). During locomotion, all body muscles are stimulated by acetylcholine motor neurons. As expected, mutants lacking acetylcholine synthesis (cha-1, choline acetyltransferase) are paralyzed; however, these animals exhibit perfectly normal posterior body contractions (posterior body contractions/cycle: ChAT cha-1(b401ts)42/43). Furthermore, mutations that disrupt synaptic vesicle fusion (unc-13) or dense core vesicle fusion (unc-31/CAPS) result in animals that are also paralyzed but still have normal posterior body contractions (unc-13(s69) 46/49; CAPS unc-31(e928)87/87). Finally extensive laser ablations failed to identify any neuron that contributed to the initiation of posterior body contraction, suggesting that this behavior is mediated via a non-neuronal mechanism (E.M.J. and H.R. Horvitz, unpublished data). To identify components of the signaling pathway required for posterior body contraction, we screened for mutants defective in this motor step. Recessive mutations in two genes, pbo-4 and pbo-5, specifically eliminate this step in the motor program (Figures 1B and 1C). Importantly, locomotion is normal in both pbo-4 and pbo-5 mutants. Because locomotion and posterior body contraction rely on the same muscles, the lack of muscle contraction during the defecation cycle in pbo-4 and pbo-5 mutants is not a result of degeneration or a developmental defect in the posterior body muscles. The pbo-4(n2658) allele was mapped by standard two and three factor mapping and the pbo-4 gene identified by microinjection rescue. The cosmid K09C8 rescued the phenotype of n2658 and ok583 mutants, and an 8.5 kb subclone fragment containing only the K09C8.1 open-reading frame was sufficient to rescue the posterior body contraction defect in ok583 mutants (Figure S1A). To confirm the identity of pbo-4, we sequenced genomic DNA from mutants and found mutations within the K09C8.1 open-reading frame in each pbo-4 allele (Figure S1A and Table S1). The K09C8.1 gene is also known as nhx-7 (Nehrke and Melvin, 2002Nehrke K. Melvin J.E. The NHX family of Na+-H+ exchangers in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29036-29044Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but for clarity we refer to it as pbo-4. The cDNA of pbo-4 encodes a predicted 783 amino acid protein (Figure S2) that is homologous to Na+/H+ exchangers. Plasma membrane Na+/H+ ion exchangers mediate the electroneutral exchange of one Na+ ion into the cell for one H+ ion out of the cell and, thus, increase intracellular pH while acidifying the extracellular space. Na+/H+ ion exchangers are multidomain proteins containing an intracellular N-terminal domain, 12 transmembrane domains, and an intracellular carboxy terminal tail (Figures S1B and S2) (Wakabayashi et al., 2000Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. A novel topology model of the human Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). NHEs can be subdivided into separate families and are distinguished by their subcellular localization and regulatory mechanisms. PBO-4 shares the highest sequence identity with NHE1 (26% identity) and, conversely, the closest homolog to NHE1 in the C. elegans genome is PBO-4. PBO-4 also shares relatively high sequence identity with NHE2 and NHE3 (22% and 21%, respectively). The carboxy-terminal domain is not well conserved among the diverse members of the Na+/H+ ion exchanger family, and each member contains distinct modulatory sites that greatly affect transport activity. For example, the carboxy terminus of NHE1 contains PIP2-binding domains, a calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain, and numerous phosphorylation sites, whereas NHE3 lacks the PIP2- and calmodulin-binding domains (Orlowski and Grinstein, 2004Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Diversity of the mammalian sodium/proton exchanger SLC9 gene family.Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Similar to NHE1, the carboxy tail of PBO-4 contains a predicted PIP2-binding domain, a CaM-binding domain, and CamKII and PKC phosphorylation sites (Figure S2). The defect in the posterior body contractions in mutants suggested that PBO-4 would be expressed in either the posterior body muscles, where the defect occurs, or in the intestine, where the defecation clock resides (Dal Santo et al., 1999Dal Santo P. Logan M.A. Chisholm A.D. Jorgensen E.M. The inositol trisphosphate receptor regulates a 50-second behavioral rhythm in C. elegans.Cell. 1999; 98: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We generated a transgene with superecliptic pHluorin GFP (pHluorin) inserted into the N-terminal domain of PBO-4 and expressed it in pbo-4(ok583) mutants. pHluorin is a pH-sensitive form of GFP whose fluorescence is quenched by acidic media (Miesenbock et al., 1998Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins.Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar), and the superecliptic form is a version of pHluorin with enhanced pH sensitivity (Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2000Sankaranarayanan S. Ryan T.A. Real-time measurements of vesicle-SNARE recycling in synapses of the central nervous system.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The pHluorin::PBO-4 fusion protein rescued the posterior body contraction defect of the mutants, demonstrating that the protein was functional and properly localized (Figure 1B). The fluorescently tagged protein was expressed on the basolateral surface of the intestine, exclusively in the most posterior intestinal cells (Figure 2A), consistent with previous observations (Nehrke and Melvin, 2002Nehrke K. Melvin J.E. The NHX family of Na+-H+ exchangers in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29036-29044Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To confirm basolateral expression, we exposed the posterior intestine in situ—without exposing the apical, luminal surface—to acidic media, which quenched the majority of the pHluorin::PBO-4 fluorescence (Figure S3). The expression pattern of PBO-4 demonstrates that the protein resides on the basolateral surface of the intestine, appropriately localized to release a signal from the intestine to the posterior body wall muscles. Electron micrographs of the posterior intestine-muscle interface demonstrate that muscle arms extend from the posterior muscles and form intestino-muscular junctions (Figure 2B). To further demonstrate that PBO-4 functions in the intestine, we rescued pbo-4(n2658) with the pHluorin::PBO-4 fusion driven by the promoter from the vitellogenin gene vit-2, which is expressed in all intestinal cells. Vitellogenin is synthesized in the intestine and transported to oocytes, where it serves to provide essential nutrients to the developing embryo. Because vitellogenins are only required in mature oocytes, the vit-2 promoter is expressed only in adult stages. We found that L4 animals were not rescued by this construct, while 1-day-old adults were almost fully rescued (Figure 3). This result demonstrates that PBO-4 is required solely in intestinal cells, and that the pbo-4 defect is due to an acute loss of signaling function, not due to a developmental defect in the intestine. Since the posterior body contraction is not mediated by classical neurotransmitters or peptides it is possible that acidification of the coelomic space by PBO-4 may stimulate contraction of the posterior body muscles. To visualize such a signal, we used superecliptic pHluorin, a pH-sensitive GFP whose fluorescence exhibits a pKa of pH 7.1 and is quenched at low pH (Miesenbock et al., 1998Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins.Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar, Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2000Sankaranarayanan S. Ryan T.A. Real-time measurements of vesicle-SNARE recycling in synapses of the central nervous system.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The superecliptic pHluorin was inserted into the first extracellular loop of PBO-4 (pHluorin::PBO-4) to monitor extracellular pH (Figures S1B and S2). If dissected intestines were exposed to acidic media, fluorescence was rapidly quenched demonstrating that the pH sensor was on the surface (Figure S3). To determine whether the posterior coelomic space was acidified in vivo prior to a posterior body contraction, we glued worms to agar but left the tip of the tail free to observe muscle contractions. Rapid fluorescence quenching always preceded the posterior body contraction (Figures 4A and 4D and Movie S1). Fluorescence spikes were characterized by a steep rise to peak (τ = 1.9 ± 0.09 s, n = 18 recordings from separate animals; 10%–90% of peak), and a slower exponential decay to baseline fluorescence (τ = 2.9 ± 0.3 s, n = 18) and preceded the muscle contraction with a latency of approximately 2 s (Figures 4E–4H). To test whether PBO-4 is fully required for the acidification, we deleted the C-terminal tail of the pHluorin::PBO-4 transgene to generate a nonrescuing fusion (pHluorin::PBO-4(ΔC)). This truncated construct expressed in the posterior intestinal cells, but there were very few, if any, fluorescence transients. In 5 of 14 animals with the truncated construct no transients were detected. The remaining nine animals possessed significantly reduced transients (ΔF/F = 5.0% ± 0.7%, n = 18 for pHluorin::PBO-4 versus ΔF/F = 1.0% ± 0.2%, n = 14 for truncated pHluorin::PBO-4((ΔC), p < 0.0001) that were quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from the rescuing pHluorin reporter (Figures 4B and 4E–4H and Movie S2). The small changes in pH remaining in this strain could represent residual activity of the truncated PBO-4 protein or activity from another Na+/H+ ion exchanger such as NHX-6, which is also expressed in the intestine (Nehrke and Melvin, 2002Nehrke K. Melvin J.E. The NHX family of Na+-H+ exchangers in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29036-29044Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, PBO-4 is required for the transient acidification of the extracellular space that precedes posterior body contractions. To test whether the fluorescent events were merely artifacts produced by the posterior body contractions, the reporter construct was introduced into the pbo-5(ox4) mutant that fails to execute posterior body contractions. In pbo-5 mutants, fluorescence transients were detected with similar frequency, amplitude, and kinetics as in the wild-type background, indicating that fluorescence transients cannot be attributed to posterior body contraction motion (Figures 4C and 4E–4H). Because pbo-5 mutants retain the pH transient but lack a posterior body contraction, it is likely that the pbo-5 gene product acts downstream of PBO-4, possibly as part of the pH sensing pathway in the muscle. The pbo-5 gene was mapped to a small region on the right arm of chromosome V by standard two and three factor mapping (Figure S4A). The posterior body contraction defect observed in pbo-5(n2303) mutants was rescued by injection of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) Y44A6 containing C. elegans genomic DNA from this region. To further localize the rescuing activity, a series of deletions were made from the Y44A6 YAC and injected into pbo-5(n2303) animals (Figure S4A). In addition, we analyzed the breakpoints of several chromosome V terminal deletions. From these experiments rescuing activity was localized to a single predicted open reading frame, Y44A6E.1 (Figure S4B). To demonstrate pbo-5 was encoded by Y44A6E.1, we constructed a minigene composed of genomic DNA containing 4.2 kb of promoter sequences and exons 1 and 2; exon 2 was fused to the rest of the open-reading frame using sequences from a cDNA. Animals carrying this plasmid were fully rescued for posterior body contraction (Figure 1C, ox4; oxEx[PBO-5]). Additionally, we sequenced 20 pbo-5 alleles and found mutations within the Y44A6E.1 open-reading frame in all of them (Figure S4C and Table S2). The pbo-5 mutations fall into four categories: (1) nine terminal deletions, (2) three nonsense mutations, (3) seven missense mutations, and (4) one splice junction mutation (Table S2). The predicted pbo-5 cDNA encodes a 504 amino acid protein. The primary structure of the pbo-5 cDNA was determined by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The pbo-5 cDNA includes an SL1 trans-spliced leader sequence at the 5′ end and a total of nine exons spanning a 7 kb genomic region (Figure S4C). BLAST and protein motif queries of PBO-5 demonstrated that the predicted protein is a subunit of the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. Each member of the cys-loop protein family contains a signal peptide, an extracellular amino terminus that contains consensus ligand-binding sites and an invariant disulfide bonded loop (the cys-loop), f"

Crystal structures of several kinds of potassium channels have revealed open and closed conformations, which provide static pictures of gating status. Here we studied KcsA potassium channels undergoing conformational changes at the single-molecule level. A KcsA channel with a gold nanocrystal attached was irradiated by white X-rays and motions of the diffraction spot from the nanocrystal were tracked in real time. Upon gating, the KcsA channels twisted around the axis of the pore. These conformational changes were prevented by an open-channel blocker, tetrabuthylammonium. Random clockwise and counterclockwise twisting in the range of several tens of degrees originated in the transmembrane domain and was transmitted to the cytoplasmic domain. This coupling suggests a mechanical interplay between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains."
https://openalex.org/W2081821053,"Processing of visual information is both parallel and hierarchical, with each visual area richly interconnected with other visual areas. An example of the parallel architecture of the primate visual system is the existence of two principal pathways providing input to the middle temporal visual area (MT): namely, a direct projection from striate cortex (V1), and a set of indirect projections that also originate in V1 but then relay through V2 and V3. Here we have reversibly inactivated the indirect pathways while recording from MT neurons and measuring eye movements in alert monkeys, a procedure that has enabled us to assess whether the two different input pathways are redundant or whether they carry different kinds of information. We find that this inactivation causes a disproportionate degradation of binocular disparity tuning relative to direction tuning in MT neurons, suggesting that the indirect pathways are important in the recovery of depth in three-dimensional scenes."

The definition of antigens targeted by these cells is paramount for the development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies for treating human cancers. In a screen for endogenous tumor-associated T cell responses in a primary mouse model of prostatic adenocarcinoma, we identified a naturally arising CD8+ T cell response that is reactive to a peptide derived from histone H4. Despite the ubiquitous nature of histones, T cell recognition of histone H4 peptide was specifically associated with the presence of prostate cancer in these mice. Thus, the repertoire of antigens recognized by tumor-infiltrating T cells is broader than previously thought and includes peptides derived from ubiquitous self antigens that are normally sequestered from immune detection."

The results of mass spectrometric and shotgun-proteomic analyses of SOD1-containing aggregates isolated from spinal cords of symptomatic transgenic ALS mice using two different isolation strategies are presented, including 1) resistance to detergent extraction and 2) size exclusion-coupled anti-SOD1 immunoaffinity chromatography. Forty-eight spinal cords from three different ALS-SOD1 mutant mice were analyzed, namely G93A, G37R, and the unnatural double mutant H46R/H48Q. The analysis consistently revealed that the most abundant proteins recovered from aggregate species were full-length unmodified SOD1 polypeptides. Although aggregates from some spinal cord samples contained trace levels of highly abundant proteins, such as vimentin and neurofilament-3, no proteins were consistently found to co-purify with mutant SOD1 in stoichiometric quantities. The results demonstrate that the principal protein in the high molecular mass aggregates whose appearance correlates with symptoms of the disease is the unmodified, full-length SOD1 polypeptide."

One region consisted of the last 10 residues of the C terminus, whereas the other was an internal polypeptide loop composed of residues 177-195. Subsequent studies have shown that part of the disorder of the internal loop was because of the presence of a heavy atom, and that crystals of the mutant enzyme GTB/C209A grown in the absence of heavy atoms display a smaller disordered segment of the internal loop consisting of residues 177-187 (20Letts J.A.

GTA and GTB are the two most homologous glycosyltransferases known that utilize different nucleotide donors and differ by only 4 of 354 amino acids as follows: Arg/Gly176, Gly/Ser235, Leu/Met266, and Gly/Ala268 in GTA and GTB, respectively (29Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). The role of each critical residue in donor and acceptor recognition has been studied through the generation of chimeric GTA/GTB enzymes. A nomenclature based on these four critical amino acid residues has been developed to describe GTA and GTB chimera, where GTA can be referred to as AAAA and GTB as BBBB with each letter corresponding to one critical residue in increasing order, such that the ABBB chimera would correspond to the GTB/G176R mutant enzyme and AABB would correspond to the GTB/G176R/S235G mutant enzyme.

Structural studies in the past have been hampered by the fact that Arg/Gly176 lies at the edge of the internal disordered loop from residues 176-195; however, the development of crystallization conditions for BBBB (GTB), ABBB, and AABB in the absence of heavy atoms permits a structural investigation of the influence of residue 176 on loop ordering and substrate binding. We now report the kinetic characterization of several chimeric enzymes along with high resolution structures of GTB (BBBB) and the chimeric enzyme ABBB in their unliganded states, BBBB and ABBB in the presence of UDP, BBBB and AABB in the presence of synthetic H antigen disaccharide α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-O(CH2)7CH3, BBBB and ABBB in the presence of UDP, and the H antigen acceptor analog α-l-2-deoxy-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-3-amino-Galp-O(CH2)7CH3, BBBB, and ABBB and in the presence of both UDP and H antigen disaccharide, and AABB in complex with UDP-Gal and the H antigen acceptor analog α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-3-deoxy-Galp-O(CH2)7CH3. Construction of the Synthetic Glycosyltransferase Chimeric Genes ABBB and AABB—The synthetic wild-type GTA (designated AAAA, amino acids 53-354) gene was constructed from synthetic oligonucleotides as described previously (34Seto N.O.L.

The synthetic gene was designed with unique restriction sites to facilitate mutagenesis. Glycosyltransferase chimeric mutants ABBB and AABB were synthesized by digesting the AAAA gene with KpnI/SphI and ligating in the appropriate oligonucleotides to form the desired gene sequence. The -10/ABBB and -10/AABB genes (amino acids 63-354) were made by PCR amplification using the wild-type ABBB and AABB genes as templates. The forward primer 5′-ATA TGA ATT CAT GGT TTC CCT GCC GCG TAT GGT TTA CCC GCA GCC GAA-3′ (MIN2) introduced an EcoRI site in the 5′ end, and the reverse primer 5′-ATA ATT AAG CTT CTA TCA CGG GTT ACG AAC AGC CTG GTG GTT TTT-3′ (PCR-3B) introduced a HindIII site in the 3′ end. The PCR profile used was 94 °C/3 min (94 °C, 30 s, 55 °C, 30 s, and 72 °C, 1 min) for 30 cycles. After gel purification, the PCR products were digested with EcoRI and HindIII for 2 h at 37 °C and were ligated into pCWΔlac, which had been opened with EcoRI/HindIII. Each ligation was transformed into BL21-competent cells. The DNA sequences were confirmed on both strands. All insert and plasmid purifications were made by Qiagen plasmid purification system (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). All ligations were made by the use of T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1 h. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. For GTB R188S, R188K, and R188H (amino acids 63-354), site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene).

Res. 2000; 324: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), with the exception of R188H and R188K where cells were disrupted at 1.35 kbar with a constant system cell disrupter. Expression levels for mutants were good, and the yields of final purified proteins were ABBB 36 mg/liter, AABB 50 mg/liter, R188S 8 mg/liter, R188K 66 mg/liter, and R188H 15 mg/liter. Kinetic Characterization—Kinetics using α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-O-R as an acceptor were carried out with a radiochemical assay, where a Sep-Pak reverse-phase cartridge is used to isolate radiolabeled reaction products created when the label is transferred from a radioactive donor to the hydrophobic acceptor (37Palcic M.M. Heerze L.D. Pierce M. Hindsgaul O. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 37 °C in a total volume of 12 μl containing substrates and enzyme in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 20 mm MnCl2, and bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). Seven different concentrations of donor and acceptor were employed, and initial rate conditions were linear with no more than 10% of the substrate consumed in the reaction. For the donors, the Km values were determined at 1.0 mm acceptor, and the Km for the acceptor was determined at 1.0 mm donor. The kinetic parameters kcat and Km were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis of the Michaelis-Menten equation with the Graph Pad PRISM 3.0 program (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Two-substrate kinetic analysis was performed for the AABB and ABBB mutants to obtain KA (acceptor Km), KB (donor Km), Kib, and Kia, as described previously (34Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M. Compston C.A. Li H. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14133-14138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Kib is the apparent Michaelis constant for donor that is independent of the concentration of acceptor and thus corresponds to the dissociation constant of the enzyme·UDP-Gal or enzyme·UDP-GalNAc complexes. Kia is the dissociation constant of the enzyme·acceptor complex. Crystallization—All proteins were crystallized using conditions different from those reported previously (10Nguyen H.P. Seto N.O.L.

Whereas the first crystals of GTB were grown from relatively low protein concentrations (∼8-15 mg/ml) and as a mercury derivative, the crystals in this paper were initially generated from higher protein concentrations (∼60-75 mg/ml). The first crystals of the ABBB and AABB mutants grew in stock solutions containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 75 mm NaCl, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% NaN3 and stored at 4 °C for several months. Crystals of ABBB and AABB were washed with mother liquor consisting of 7% PEG-4000, 70 mm Ada buffer (N-(2-acetamindo)iminodiacetic acid), pH 7.5, 30 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6, 40 mm ammonium sulfate, and 5 mm MnCl2. Crystals of BBBB were obtained by the hanging drop method from 30 to 40 mg/ml fresh protein solutions containing 1% PEG, 4.5% methyl-pentanediol (MPD), 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, 0.07 m NaCl, 0.05 m Ada buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2 against a reservoir containing 2.7% PEG-4000, 7% MPD, 0.32 m ammonium sulfate, 0.25 m NaCl, and 0.2 m Ada buffer, pH 7.5. Crystals of BBBB, ABBB, and AABB in complex with UDP, synthetic H antigen disaccharide α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-O(CH2)7CH3 (HA) (8Lowary T.L. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 251: 33-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), or the analogs α-l-2-deoxy-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-3-amino-Galp-O(CH2)7CH3 (ADA) (40Bai Y. Lin S.J. Qi G. Palcic M.M Lowary T.L. Carbohydr.

Res. 1993; 249: 163-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in various combinations were obtained by soaking substrate into the unliganded crystals. Crystals were washed with mother liquor consisting of 7% PEG-4000, 70 mm Ada buffer, pH 7.5, 30 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6, 40 mm ammonium sulfate, and 5 mm MnCl2. The concentration of UDP was usually 25 mm, but as little as 10 mm was often sufficient, and 50 mm was used for BBBB+UDP. The H antigen acceptor analogs HA, DA, and ADA concentrations ranged from 10 to 20 mm. The concentration of UDP-Gal ranged from 35 to 50 mm. The concentration of MnCl2 was 5 mm. All substrates were added incrementally over a period of a few minutes to a few hours so as to prevent crystal fracture. In the case of AABB+UDP-Gal+DA, additional UDP-Gal was added to the crystal minutes before freezing to minimize the extent of UDP-Gal hydrolysis. No UDP was added to AABB+UDP, as the UDP appeared to follow the protein through the purification process. The UDP was removed to generate the AABB+H structure by washing the crystal with 10 mm EDTA to remove the manganese that bound the UDP to the protein. Data Collection and Reduction—X-ray diffraction data were collected at -160 °C for all crystals using a CryoStream 700 crystal cooler. Each crystal was incubated with a cryoprotectant solution that consisted of mother liquor with 30% (v/v) glycerol replacing a corresponding volume of water, except AABB+UDP-Gal+DA where a corresponding volume of MPD was used. Data were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV2+ area detector at distances of 72 mm and exposure times between 4.0 and 7.0 min for 0.5° oscillations. X-rays were produced by an MM-002 generator (Rigaku/MSC, College Station, TX) coupled to Osmic “Blue” confocal x-ray mirrors with power levels of 30 watts (Osmic, Auburn Hills, MI). The data were scaled, averaged, and integrated using d*trek and CrystalView (42Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—Although the structures were nearly isomorphous, for completeness all structures were solved by molecular replacement using the CCP4 module MOLREP (43Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 44Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The details of data collection and refinement for the enzyme complexes are provided in Table 1 for BBBB structures and Table 2 for ABBB and AABB structures. In the 12 structures determined, BBBB, ABBB, and AABB crystals were soaked with combinations of UDP, UDP-Gal, H antigen disaccharide (HA), 3-deoxy-Gal-H antigen disaccharide (deoxy-acceptor, DA), and 2-deoxy-Fuc-3-amino-Gal-H antigen disaccharide (aminodeoxy-acceptor, ADA). These 12 structures are labeled as BBBB, BBBB+UDP, BBBB+HA, BBBB+UDP+HA, BBBB+UDP+ADA, ABBB, ABBB+UDP, ABBB+UDP+HA, ABBB+UDP+ADA, AABB+UDP, AABB+HA, and AABB+ UDP-Gal+DA.

https://openalex.org/W1982523668,"Number words that, in principle, allow all kinds of objects to be counted ad infinitum are one basic requirement for complex numerical cognition. Accordingly, short or object-specific counting sequences in a language are often regarded as earlier steps in the evolution from premathematical conceptions to greater abstraction. We present some instances from Melanesia and Polynesia, whose short or object-specific sequences originated from the same extensive and abstract sequence. Furthermore, the object-specific sequences can be shown to be cognitively advantageous for calculations without notation because they use larger counting units, thereby abbreviating higher numbers, enhancing the counting process, and extending the limits of counting. These results expand our knowledge both regarding numerical cognition and regarding the evolution of numeration systems."
https://openalex.org/W2008588438,"Nerve injury requires the expression of large ensembles of genes. The key molecular mechanism for this gene transcription regulation in injured neurons is poorly understood. Among many nerve injury-inducible genes, the gene encoding damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase (DINE) showed most marked expression response to various kinds of nerve injuries in central and peripheral nervous system neurons. This unique feature led us to examine the promoter region of the DINE gene and clarify both the injury-responsive element within the promoter and its related transcriptional machinery. This study showed that DINE promoter was activated by leukemia inhibitory factor and nerve growth factor withdrawal, which were pivotal for the up-regulation of DINE mRNA after nerve injury. The injury-inducible transcription factors such as activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), c-Jun, and STAT3, which were located at the downstream of leukemia inhibitory factor and nerve growth factor withdrawal, seemed to be involved in the activation of the DINE promoter. Surprisingly, these transcription factors did not bind to the DINE promoter directly. Instead, the general transcription factor, Sp1, bound to a GC box within the promoter. ATF3, c-Jun, and STAT3 interacted with Sp1 and are associated with the GC box region of the DINE gene in injured neurons. These findings suggested that Sp1 recruit ATF3, c-Jun, and STAT3 to obtain the requisite synergistic effect. Of these transcription factors, ATF3 may be the most critical, because ATF3 is specifically expressed after nerve injury. Nerve injury requires the expression of large ensembles of genes.

Nerve injury induces the expression of large ensembles of genes, required to elicit the intrinsic regeneration responses in the injured neurons (1Makwana M. Raivich G. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2628-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It was previously established that the 5′-flanking sequences of some nerve injury-associated genes such as GAP43, peripherin, and tubulin-α, have injury-responsive characteristics (2Vanselow J. Grabczyk E. Ping J. Baetscher M. Teng S. Fishman M.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 499-510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gloster A. Wu W. Speelman A. Weiss S. Causing C. Pozniak C. Reynolds B. Chang E.

However, both the detailed transcriptional machinery and the injury-responsive element within those promoters, which are pivotal for the appropriate gene responses to neuronal injury, have not been clarified. Damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase (DINE 2The abbreviations used are:DINEdamage-induced neuronal endopeptidaseATF3activating transcription factor 3DRGdorsal root ganglionLIFleukemia inhibitory factorNGFnerve growth factorJNKJun N-terminal kinaseSTAT3signal transducers and activators of transcription 3HAhemagglutininPBSphosphate-buffered salineEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayWTwild type. in rats or ECEL1 in humans) is a neuron-specific membrane-bound metalloprotease, which we originally identified as a nerve injury-associated gene (6Kiryu-Seo S. Sasaki M. Yokohama H. Nakagomi S. Hirayama T. Aoki S. Wada K. Kiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4345-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of DINE is its remarkable induction of the transcript in response to various types of nerve damage in both central and peripheral nervous system neurons (6Kiryu-Seo S. Sasaki M. Yokohama H. Nakagomi S. Hirayama T. Aoki S. Wada K. Kiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4345-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This feature seemed to be useful for understanding transcriptional mechanism in damaged neurons. Therefore, we have attempted to clarify the gene regulation of DINE after nerve injury. Although the precise functions of DINE/ECEL1, including the substrates, have not been identified (6Kiryu-Seo S. Sasaki M. Yokohama H. Nakagomi S. Hirayama T. Aoki S. Wada K. Kiyama H. Proc. Natl.

Our previous study showed that, in ischemic insult, DINE mRNA was expressed in neurons projecting their axons to or through the core region of the infarction (8Ohba N. Kiryu-Seo S. Maeda M. Muraoka M. Ishii M. Kiyama H. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 956-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The DINE mRNA inductions were always accompanied by the simultaneous induction of the injury-inducible transcription factor, Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). In addition, both in vitro and in vivo study showed that the expression of DINE mRNA in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after sciatic nerve injury was significantly induced by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) treatment and withdrawal of nerve growth factor (NGF) (9Kato R. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9410-9418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In sympathetic injury system, where it has been also established that LIF and NGF withdrawal are important for injury-induced change in gene expression (10Shadiack A.M. Sun Y. Zigmond R.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 363-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shadiack A.M. Vaccariello S.A. Sun Y. Zigmond R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Zigmond R.E. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 59: 216-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the transcription factors downstream of the LIF-gp130 pathway and the Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) pathway are involved in the gene regulation of DINE. Taken together, injury-induced expression of DINE is assumed to be regulated by ATF3, c-Jun, and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), which are located downstream of the LIF-gp130 and the JNK signaling pathways. damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase activating transcription factor 3 dorsal root ganglion leukemia inhibitory factor nerve growth factor Jun N-terminal kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline electrophoretic mobility shift assay wild type.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, ATF3, a member of the ATF/cAMP-response element-binding protein family of transcription factors, is regarded as a marker for nerve injury because of its specific expression in response to nerve injury (17Tsujino H.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7911-7920Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported that ATF3 expression promotes neurite elongation and cell survival by combination with an AP1 transcription factor, c-Jun, following the activation of JNK pathways or the activation of p38 (18Nakagomi S. Suzuki Y. Namikawa K. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pearson A.G. Gray C.W. Pearson J.F. Greenwood J.M. During M.J. Dragunow M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 120: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Concurrent with ATF3 up-regulation, c-Jun is also activated after axotomy. The interaction of ATF3 and c-Jun has not been reported in physiological conditions to date. However, it has been suggested that the heterodimer of ATF3/c-Jun functions as an activator of specific promoters for various nerve regeneration-associated genes following nerve injury. Apart from ATF3/c-Jun, several cytokines, such as the ciliary neurotrophic factor, interleukin-6, and LIF, which are released from surrounding glial cells after nerve injury, activate STAT3. This activation is elicited by their specific receptor complexes, including gp130, as a common receptor sub-chain and Janus kinase family members (23Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has established that the gp130-STAT3 signaling pathway has an important role in regenerating neurons (24Hirota H. Kiyama H. Kishimoto T. Taga T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2627-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 25Qiu J. Cafferty W.B. McMahon S.B. Thompson S.W. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Taken together, these injury-inducible transcription factors, ATF3, c-Jun, and STAT3, might be associated with the up-regulation of various kinds of genes to promote regeneration. However, the detailed transcriptional machinery in injured neurons has not been clarified. In this study, general transcription factor, Sp1, is involved in the expression of the DINE gene as well. Sp1 has been classically assumed to regulate the constitutive expression of numerous housekeeping genes. However, recent reports have demonstrated that Sp1 has multifunctional transcriptional activities through its interaction with other transcription factors and is required for adaptive responses to differentiation, proliferation, and oxidative stress (27Dunah A.W.

This study has demonstrated that the injury-inducible transcription factors (ATF3, c-Jun, and STAT3) are actually responsible for the expression of DINE gene regulation by existing at the Sp1 binding site after axotomy. It suggested that Sp1 function as a scaffolding protein that recruits ATF3, c-Jun, and STAT3 to elicit their synergistic transactivation activity. This possible mechanism may be important not only for DINE but also potentially for other nerve injury-associated genes to be induced simultaneously in damaged neurons. Isolation of Mouse DINE Gene—A mouse genomic library (λFIXII mouse 129 Library, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened to obtain the DINE mouse genome. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) employing a multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Approximately 1 × 106 plaques were plated at a density of 1 × 104 plaque forming units/150-mm dish and screened by using the following conditions for hybridization: 1 × 106 cpm/ml in 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, and 0.5% SDS for hybridization at 65 °C, and then washed at 65 °C in 2 × SSC containing 0.5% SDS and in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.5% SDS. Five positive plaques were obtained, purified, and partially sequenced. Plasmids—Various lengths of the DINE promoter fragments were generated by restriction enzyme digestion or PCR amplification of genomic DNA isolated from the 129 strain of mice. The fragments were then cloned into a luciferase reporter pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutations were generated by using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids encoding ATF3, c-Jun and ATF tethered to ATF3 (ATF3:ATF3) and ATF3 tethered to c-Jun (ATF3:c-Jun), were cloned into a pME18S expression vector. ATF3 and ATF3 cDNAs or ATF3 and c-Jun cDNAs were fused in-frame via a glycine-rich polypeptide tether of 18 amino acids. HA-STAT3delN-(162–770) and HA-STAT3delC-(1–605) were inserted into pcDNA3. HA-STAT3, HA-STAT3D, HA-STAT3Y705F, and STAT3β cloned in pCAGGS were kindly provided by K. Nakajima (Osaka City University, Japan). FLAG-STAT3 and FLAG-STAT3Y705F in pEF-BOS were gifts from T. Taga (Kumamoto University, Japan). STAT3C subcloned in pME18S was a gift from A. Miyajima (Tokyo University, Japan). Sp1 in pcDNA3 was a gift from W. C. Wang (National Cheng King University, Taiwan). DINE (accession number AB026293, 1287–1761) in pBluescript was used for in situ hybridization as previously described (6Kiryu-Seo S. Sasaki M. Yokohama H. Nakagomi S. Hirayama T. Aoki S. Wada K. Kiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4345-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Adenovirus Preparation—The fragment containing the DINE promoter region (-2765/+1) followed by firefly luciferase gene was cloned into the expression cassette pAx cosmid vector. STAT3, ATF3, c-Jun, and ATF3:c-Jun were cloned into the Cre-inducible expression cassette pAxCALNLw, which usually is not expressed because of the neomycin resistance gene. The recombinant viruses were generated according to a previously described method (30Namikawa K. Honma M. Abe K. Takeda M. Mansur K. Obata T. Miwa A. Okado H. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2875-2886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture—SK-N-SH cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing penicillin and streptomycin, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacture's protocol. Sp1 and control small interference RNAs were purchased from Invitrogen and transfected according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 36 h of transfection, the cells were harvested into reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and the luciferase intensity was measured using the Promega luciferase assay system, according to the manufacturer's instructions in a TD luminometer. For the preparation of neuron-glia mixed culture, DRGs were isolated from 1-day-old Wistar rats and collected into ice-cold L15 medium (Invitrogen). DRGs were dissociated with 2 mg/ml collagenase at 37 °C for 1 h and then seeded onto 24-well polyethyleneimine-precoated plates. The feeding medium was a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Invitrogen), to which 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma), 5 μm uridine (Sigma), 5 μm fluorodeoxyuridine (Sigma), and 50 ng/ml NGF (Promega) were added. DRGs were cultured in the presence of NGF at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The treatment of ligands and the gp130 antibody (R&D Systems) was performed as described previously (9Kato R. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9410-9418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gp130 antibody treatment was performed at 5 days after plating, and the adenoviruses were added. At 24 h after infection, ligands were applied to each well. At 36 h after ligand treatments, cells were lysed and luciferase intensity was measured. For immunostaining, cells on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-luciferase (Promega), anti-MAP-2 (Chemicon) antibodies followed by a secondary antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor Green or Red (Molecular Probes). Animal Surgery—Adult male C57BL/6 mice (7 weeks old) were obtained from SLC (SLC, Japan). Mice were anesthetized with 45 mg/kg pentobarbital and placed in the supine position. The right hypoglossal nerve was carefully exposed under the digastric muscle. The nerve was transected at the central side of the hypoglossal nerve bifurcation with a pair of scissors, and the nerve edges were separated so that they were not in contact with one each other. Studies were performed in compliance with institutional guidelines for animal experiments. In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry—Mice were decapitated after the surgery, and the brain was removed and rapidly frozen in powdered dry ice. Then, 18-μm-thick sections were cut on a cryostat, thaw-mounted onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated slides, and stored at -80 °C until use. All procedures for in situ hybridization were performed as previously described (31Kiryu S. Yao G.L. Morita N. Kato H. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7872-7878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For ATF3 immunohistochemistry, animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.21% picric acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. The sections were air-dried, rinsed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation with anti-ATF3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C. For c-Jun immunostaining, the freshly frozen sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with anti-c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For STAT3 and Sp1 immunostaining, the freshly frozen sections were fixed with methanol for 20 min at -20 °C, incubated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min at room temperature, and incubated with anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-STAT3 (Upstate) antibodies. These sections were subsequently incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Electromobility Supershift Assays—SK-N-SH cells from the 10-cm dish were re-suspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, incubated on ice for 5 min and scraped off. The nuclear fraction was incubated on ice for 10 min and then pelleted at 2000 rpm for 5 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared by incubation in a buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 20% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors, for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the nuclear extracts were retained for EMSA. To perform EMSA, the sense and antisense nucleotides of the mouse DINE promoter ((-1181) 5′-CCTTCGGGGCTGGCGGGCGGCGCG-3′ (-1158), upper strand) were synthesized (Sigma Genosys). Mutant sense and antisense oligonucleotides (5′-CCTTCGGaaaTGGCGGaaGGCGCG-3′, upper strand), in which the Sp1 binding sites were mutated (lowercase letters) were also synthesized. Both were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. For reaction of DNA binding to proteins, 3 μg of the nuclear extracts of SK-N-SH cells was incubated with the 32P-labeled probe in binding buffer composed of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For competition assays, a 100- or 200-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides or mutant oligonucleotides was incubated for 15 min before the addition of the labeled probe. Anti-Sp1 antibody (1.5 μg) was also added to the reaction mixture to examine the supershift of the DNA probe. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5% TBE (89 mm Tris-borate, 2 mm EDTA) and 1% glycerol. Immunoprecipitation—SK-N-SH cells were infected by ATF3, c-Jun, ATF3:c-Jun, and STAT3 adenoviruses with Cre recombinase. After 36 h the cells were washed with PBS twice and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. After centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 rpm, the supernatant was incubated with anti-Sp1 (Upstate) antibodies with constant agitation at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The pellet was washed four times and prepared for immunoblotting using primary antibodies for ATF3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), c-Jun (Upstate), and STAT3 (BD Transduction Laboratories). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Control and injured hypoglossal nuclei were collected from 20 mice 5 days after axotomy. Tissues were fixed with freshly prepared 1% formaldehyde in PBS at 37 °C for 10 min, rinsed in ice-cold PBS, and homogenized in SDS lysis buffer composed of 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) containing protease inhibitors. Samples were sonicated and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Collected supernatants were diluted with a chromatin immunoprecipitation dilution buffer containing 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors, and precleared by incubating with a salmon sperm DNA-Protein A-agarose slurry for 1 h at 4 °C (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C using anti-ATF-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-STAT3 (Upstate), anti-Sp1 (Upstate) antibodies followed by additional incubation with a protein A-agarose slurry for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed with low salt wash buffer composed of 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl and a high salt wash buffer composed of 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 500 mm NaCl, and a LiCl buffer composed of 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) and a TE buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA. Immune complexes were eluted twice with an elution buffer containing 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cross-links were reversed by incubation with 0.3 m NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h. DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR. The primer sequences for PCR were as follows: forward, 5′-GGTGGCTCCAAGTGGCTCATCAGAAGG-3′, and backward, 5′-AGCTGGGCTGGCTGCGGCTCTCTTCGTG-3′. Characteristics of the DINE Promoter—Genomic clones were isolated from a mouse (129 strain) genome library to examine injury-responsive expression of the DINE gene. The nucleotide sequence of 2.8 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the DINE gene was determined. Similar to many neuronal genes, the upstream portion of the mouse DINE gene is GC-rich and lacks a consensus TATA box (supplemental Fig. S1A). Although endogenous DINE mRNA is specifically expressed in neurons, there was no apparent neuron-restrictive silencer element sequence in this promoter region. However, the 5′-flanking region of the DINE gene promoter induced gene expression preferentially in neuronal cell lines rather than in non-neuronal cell lines (supplemental Fig. S1B). DINE Promoter Is Activated in DRG Neurons in Response to LIF Stimulus and NGF Deprivation—To determine if the 5′-flanking region of DINE gene contains the injury-responsive element, a promoter assay was carried out using DRG cultures. It has been shown that the injury responsiveness of the endogenous DINE mRNA of DRG neurons both in vivo and in vitro was partially regulated by signaling pathways after LIF treatment and NGF withdrawal (9Kato R. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9410-9418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we attempted to learn if the promoter region of the DINE gene was activated by LIF treatment and NGF withdrawal in a similar manner to the endogenous DINE gene. DRGs were infected with an adenovirus containing the firefly luciferase regulated by a 2.8-kb fragment of DINE promoter. At 24 h after infection, DRGs were treated with various trophic factors and cytokines such as NGF, NT-3, GDNF, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and LIF, which are typically released from surrounding glial cells after nerve injury. The results of the promoter assay showed that neurotrophic factors such as NT-3, BDNF, GDNF, and IGF, did not significantly affect the activity of the promoter, but LIF and NGF withdrawal additively increased the promoter activity by 4- to 5-fold (Fig. 1A). The luciferase activity induced by LIF was antagonized by anti-gp130 antibody (Fig. 1B). In addition, immunostaining showed that the expression of luciferase was up-regulated in neurons after LIF treatment and NGF withdrawal, because it was observed only in cells displaying the characteristic neuronal cell marker MAP-2 (Fig. 1B). Other Hoechst-stained cells were luciferase-negative, including the Schwann cells and fibroblasts. These results were consistent with the response of endogenous DINE mRNA after treatment with these factors. This region of the DINE promoter is sufficient to reflect the expression of endogenous DINE gene in response to LIF treatment and NGF withdrawal, suggesting that it might contain an injury-responsive element. The Combination of ATF3:c-Jun Heterodimer and STAT3 Synergistically Enhanced DINE Promoter Activity—Considering that both the Janus kinase-STAT signaling pathway and the JNK signaling pathway are activated by NGF deprivation and the LIF stimulus, STAT3, c-Jun, and ATF3, which are located downstream in the signaling pathways, seemed to be the most potent transcription factors for DINE gene regulation. To confirm this possibility, the co-expression of these transcription factors was investigated to determine if they would mutually up- or down-regulate their separate effects on the transcription from the DINE promoter. The plasmids carrying the transcription factors were transfected into SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells together with the DINE promoter (nucleotides -2765 to +1) driven luciferase reporter vector (Fig. 2A). Overexpression of individual STAT3, ATF3, or c-Jun did not change the luciferase activity. Co-expression of ATF3 and c-Jun or co-expression of ATF3, c-Jun, and STAT3 increased the luciferase activity by 4- to 5-fold, suggesting that the dimerization of ATF3 and c-Jun may be important for stimulating DINE promoter activity. Although previous studies (18Nakagomi S. Suzuki Y. Namikawa K. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Chen B.P. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) demonstrated in vitro that ATF3 and c-Jun interacted each other, ATF3 and c-Jun interaction has not been reported in any physiological settings to date. Because it is still unclear about the mechanism for effective dimerization of ATF3 and c-Jun, a forced dimmer construct of ATF3:c-Jun was designed in which ATF3 and c-Jun cDNAs were fused in-frame through a glycine-rich polypeptide tether of 18 amino acids. As expected, transfection of t"

HVEM-BTLA interactions are blocked by herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoprotein D (gD) through binding of its N-terminal domain to the BTLA binding site of HVEM. In this study, we inserted viral antigens into the C-terminal domain of gD and expressed these antigens with plasmid or E1-deleted (replication-defective) adenovirus vectors. Viral antigens fused to gD induced T and B cell responses to the antigen that were far more potent than those elicited by the same antigen expressed without gD. The immunopotentiating effect required binding of the gD chimeric protein to HVEM. Overall, the studies demonstrate that targeting of antigen to the BTLA binding site of HVEM augments the immunogenicity of vaccines."

We investigated the effects of IFN-γ on VSMCs and arteries through interactions involving signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. In addition to STAT1 activation, IFN-γ consistently phosphorylated STAT3 in human VSMCs but weakly or not at all in human endothelial cells or mouse VSMCs. STAT3 activation resulted in nuclear translocation of this transcription factor. By selectively inhibiting STAT3 and not STAT1 signaling, we identified a number of candidate IFN-γ-inducible, STAT3-dependent gene products by microarray analysis.

IFN-γ-induced STAT3 and STAT1 signaling in VSMCs demonstrated reciprocal inhibition. STAT3 activation by IFN-γ sensitized VSMCs to apoptosis triggered by both death receptor- and mitochondrial-mediated pathways. Knock down of XAF1 and Noxa expression inhibited the priming of VSMCs to apoptotic stimuli by IFN-γ. Finally, we confirmed the in vivo relevance of our observations using a chimeric animal model of immunodeficient mice bearing human coronary artery grafts in which the expression of XAF1 and Noxa as well as the pro-apoptotic effects induced by IFN-γ were dependent on STAT3.

IFN-γ may cause both proliferation and apoptosis of VSMCs with a net effect of an accumulation of neointimal VSMCs (1Tellides G. Pober J.S. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Apoptosis of VSMCs are of particular relevance in vascular remodeling and plaque rupture. Apoptosis is a mode of programmed cell death characterized by morphological changes due to caspase activation. There are two fundamental ways by which caspases are activated during apoptosis; an intrinsic pathway of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which releases cytochrome c, and an extrinsic pathway involving the stimulation of death receptors (18Kroemer G. Martin S.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In the former case Bcl-2 homology 3-only-containing proteins, e.g. Puma and Noxa, act as mediators for cell stress and DNA damage by initiating mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which results in assembly of the apoptosome and caspase 9 activation (19Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Science. 2000; 288: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). Activated caspase 9, in turn, proteolytically activates caspase 3, leading to apoptosis. On the other hand, ligation of death receptors, e.g. Fas and receptors for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), can activate apoptosis in healthy cells by ligand-induced formation of the death-inducing signaling complex which mediates autocatalytic activation of caspase 8. Active caspase 8 propagates death signals in two ways; that is, by cleavage of the Bcl-2 homology 3-only protein Bid, which leads to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, and by direct proteolytic activation of caspase 3. Counteracting cellular apoptotic processes are factors involved in preventing unregulated cell suicide, the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). IAPs bind directly to caspases and inhibit their function. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein is the best characterized and the most potent member of this family. IAPs are themselves regulated by cellular proteins, including Smac/Diablo and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor-1 (XAF1), which inhibit IAP function and allow caspase-dependent cleavage of substrates (20Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Inflammation may cause and/or potentiate cellular apoptosis, and it has been reported that XAF1 and Noxa are also IFN-β-stimulated genes that contribute to viral-induced cell death and type I IFN-dependent sensitization of human malignant cells to pro-apoptotic stimuli (21Leaman D.W.

Here, we report that the IFN-γ induces expression of XAF1 and Noxa in human VSMCs through STAT3 activation and that these proteins sensitize VSMCs in vitro and in vivo to apoptosis triggered via death receptor or mitochondrial mechanisms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell and Organ Culture—Human cells and tissues were obtained under protocols approved by the Yale Human Investigations Committee and the New England Organ Bank. Human VSMCs were isolated by explant outgrowth from the minced media of coronary arteries or aortae of cadaver organ donors or cardiac transplant recipients after removal of the adventitia and endothelium. The cells were serially cultured on 0.2% gelatin-coated, tissue culture-grade plastic in M199 media supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Porcine VSMCs were isolated from coronary arteries using the same protocol. Human endothelial cells were isolated by enzymatic harvesting from umbilical cord veins and serially cultured in supplemented M199 media also containing 50 μg/ml fibroblast growth factor-1 (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA), and 100 μg/ml porcine intestinal heparin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cultured cells were used at passage 3 to 4, and a low concentration (0.5%) of fetal bovine serum-supplemented media was substituted for 48 h before treating with cytokine. Murine aorta from either wild type or STAT1–/–-deficient 129S6/SvEv mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were cut into uniform size rings after removing the endothelium and incubated in 0.5% fetal bovine serum-supplemented M199 media. The cells or tissues were treated with human (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid NY), pig (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA), or mouse (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) IFN-γ, oncostatin M (R&D Systems), soluble homotrimeric TRAIL (R&D Systems), and staurosporine (Sigma-Aldrich).Oligonucleotide Transfection—Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to human STAT3 and 5-base mismatch (MIS) control oligonucleotides (oligos) were a gift from ISIS Pharmaceuticals (Carlsbad, CA). The sequence for STAT3 ASO, 5′-GCT CCA GCA TCT GCT GCT TC-3′, and for the MIS control oligos, 5′-GCT CCA ATA CCC GTT GCT TC-3′, were synthesized using phosphorothioate chemistry. The oligos were synthesized with 2′-O-methoxyethyl modification of the five terminal nucleotides to provide higher hybridization affinity as well as improved nuclease protection. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) for XAF1, Noxa, and a validated negative control without homology to known mammalian genes were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The sequence for XAF1 siRNA was: sense, CGG UGU GCA GGA ACU GUA A dTdT; antisense, UUA CAG UUC CUG CAC ACC G dAdG. The sequence for Noxa siRNA was: sense, CGG UCA CUA CAC AAC GUA A dTdT; antisense, UUA CGU UGU GUA GUG ACC G dAdA. Human VSMCs were transfected with ASO or MIS oligos at 1 μm in 1 ml of serum-free media containing 10 μl of FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics) or with siRNA at 0.02–2 μm in 1 ml of serum-free media containing 5 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) for 6 h and then quenched with serum-supplemented media. Transfection was repeated twice 48 h apart, and knockdown efficacy, cytokine signaling, or pro-apoptotic stimuli were assessed 48 h after the second transfection.Viral Transduction—A 2.4-kilobase cDNA insert for STAT1β (16Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Schreiber R.D. Darnell Jr., J .E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7673-7678Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) was isolated by PCR from the expression plasmid pRcCMV (provided by Dr. Jacqueline F. Bromberg, Rockefeller University, New York, NY) and subcloned using a zero blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). An EcoRI-excisable STAT1β DNA insert was then subcloned into the pBMN-Z-I-Neo retroviral vector (provided by Dr. Garry P. Nolan, Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Retrovirus DNA containing either EGFP or STAT1β was directly transduced into the PA317-packaging cell line using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). G418-resistant cells were selected and served as the source of retroviral stocks. VSMCs were transduced with retroviral vectors in the presence of Polybrene at 8 μg/ml for 6 h and then cultured in 20% fetal bovine serum-supplemented media. At 48 h after transduction, the cells were cultured in media containing G418 at 0.8 mg/ml for 2 weeks. In some experiments, additional transductions were required to increase the efficacy of transgene expression.Immunoblotting Analysis—Protein was extracted from cells or homogenized frozen artery tissue in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (23Mahboubi K. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein per sample were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and blotted with mouse monoclonal antibodies to STAT1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), STAT3 (BD Biosciences), Noxa (Oncogene Research Product, San Diego, CA and Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) with rabbit antibodies to STAT1, phosphotyrosine STAT1, phosphotyrosine STAT3, phosphoserine STAT3 (Cell Signaling Technology), JAK2 (Upstate Biotechnology and Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), SOCS3 (Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Gunma, Japan), and XAF1 (Abcam) or with goat antibody to XAF1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Detection of bound antibody was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—Supernatant levels of IFN-γ-inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10) and plasma levels of IFN-γ were measured using enzyme-Linked immunosorbent assay kits from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) Analysis—qRT-PCR was performed as previously described (24Burns W.R. Wang Y. Tang P.C. Ranjbaran H. Iakimov A. Kim J. Cuffy M. Bai Y. Pober J.S. Tellides G. Am. J. Transplant. 2005; 5: 1226-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was isolated from VSMCs using RNeasy mini kits with on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen). Real time qRT-PCR reactions were prepared with Taqman reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for XAF1, Noxa, JAK2, SOCS3, IP-10, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). An iCycler and its system interface software (Bio-Rad) were used to run samples and analyze data. All samples were analyzed in triplicate and normalized to GAPDH levels, and the results are expressed as -fold induction compared with untreated controls.Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cultured VSMCs under various conditions using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen) with on-column DNase treatment. Preparation of cRNA and hybridization to the human genechip set (U133A) was performed as described by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The stained chips were read with a GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix) and analyzed using Microarray Suite 5.0 image analysis software (Affymetrix). RNA levels were quantified, and gene-specific probe sets categorized as present or marginal were further analyzed, whereas those categorized as absent were excluded. GeneSpring 5.0 data analysis software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood, CA) was used for normalization and -fold change calculations. The microarray analyses were performed three times independently for each experimental condition. For the purposes of this study, genes that were regulated by IFN-γ more than 3-fold relative to untreated controls were also analyzed for the effects of STAT3 knockdown on IFN-γ-induced changes in transcript expression.Fluorescence Microscopy and FACS Analysis—VSMC nuclear morphology was assessed by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cell surface labeling of VSMCs was performed using a buffer solution and phycoerythrin-conjugated annexin V from BD Pharmingen according to the manufacturer's instructions. For intracellular staining, VSMCs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin, and then labeled with rabbit antibody to human cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology) or control IgG followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Analysis was performed with a FACSort (BD Biosciences).Artery Grafting—Segments of human epicardial coronary arteries were interposed into the infra-renal aortae of female, 8–12-week-old, “non-leaky” (serum IgG <1 μg/ml) C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficient/beige mice (Taconic) using an end-to-end microsurgical anastomotic technique as previously described (25Wang Y. Burns W.R. Tang P.C. Yi Y. Schechner J.S. Zerwes H.G. Sessa W.C. Lorber M.I. Pober J.S. Tellides G. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Animal procedure protocols were approved by the Yale Animal Care and Use Committee. At 1 week post-operative, certain recipients were inoculated intravenously with replication-deficient (ΔE1/E3) adenovirus encoding transgenes for human IFN-γ (Ad-IFN-γ) or LacZ (Ad-LacZ) driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) at 1 × 109 plaque forming units. Plasma human IFN-γ levels were around 200 ng/ml at 1 and 4 weeks after Ad-IFN-γ transduction and undetectable after Ad-LacZ transduction. Certain recipients were also treated with oligos at 20 mg/kg subcutaneously 3× per week from post-operative week 1 to 5.Graft Analysis—Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (25Wang Y. Burns W.R. Tang P.C. Yi Y. Schechner J.S. Zerwes H.G. Sessa W.C. Lorber M.I. Pober J.S. Tellides G. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using primary antibodies to human major histocompatibility complex class I antigens (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), STAT3 (BD Biosciences), Noxa (Oncogene Research Product), and XAF1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as well as the 2E1 antibody (26Butler M. Stecker K. Bennett C.F. Lab. Investig. 1997; 77: 379-388PubMed Google Scholar) developed against ASO 13920 (ISIS Pharmaceuticals). Binding of secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was detected with peroxidase/3-amino ethyl carbazole kits (Vector Laboratories). Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) was performed using a kit from Chemicon International according to the manufacturer's instructions.Statistical Analysis—Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance were performed using the Prism software program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Differences with p < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.RESULTSIFN-γ-activated STAT3 in VSMCs—To determine whether STAT1-independent signaling by IFN-γ occurred in VSMCs, we first analyzed IFN-γ-treated cultured human VSMCs for activation of other STAT proteins. We found that IFN-γ induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in addition to STAT1 in human coronary artery VSMCs cultured in media containing a low concentration (0.5%) of serum in a time- and dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1, A and B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 showed similar kinetics to that of STAT1. IFN-γ-mediated STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was also seen in serumdeprived cultured VSMCs derived from human aortas and umbilical arteries and in human coronary artery and aorta segments maintained in organ culture in the complete absence of serum since procurement from donors (data not shown). These results demonstrated the general applicability of IFN-γ-induced STAT3 activation in human VSMCs and that it was not an artifact of withdrawal from growth factors contained in serum. There was minimal and transient serine phosphorylation of STAT3 in response to IFN-γ treatment of VSMCs (Fig. 1, A and B). STAT3 activation was confirmed by nuclear translocation of this transcription factor as compared with treatment of VSMCs with the cytokine, oncostatin M, which is known to signal via both STAT3 and STAT1 (Fig. 1C).STAT3 phosphorylation by IFN-γ was cell type-specific and was either not seen or occasionally weakly detected in human endothelial cells (Fig. 1D), whereas STAT1 was consistently activated in the same experiments (data not shown). There was no intrinsic defect in STAT3 activation in human endothelial cells, as we have previously shown robust STAT3 phosphorylation in response to oncostatin M in this cell type (23Mahboubi K. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). IFN-γ-mediated STAT3 activation in VSMCs was also species-specific as there was robust signaling in porcine VCMCs (Fig. 1E), and although there was basal phosphorylation of STAT3 in STAT1-deficient mice, we could not detect further activation by IFN-γ in wild type or STAT-1-deficient mouse aortae (Fig. 1F).STAT-3-dependent, IFN-γ-inducible Molecules in Human VSMCs—To investigate if STAT3 activation by IFN-γ resulted in transcription, we selectively inhibited STAT3 responses. Transduction of VSMCs with retroviral vectors encoding dominant negative constructs of STAT3Y705-F and STAT3β (27Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell.

We used an alternative approach to knock down STAT3 expression by ASO, which inhibited STAT3, but not STAT1, phosphorylation in response to IFN-γ (Fig. 2A). This strategy was not completely effective, as further exposure of the immunoblots revealed low levels of STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 (data not shown).FIGURE 2STAT-3 mediates some IFN-γ-dependent responses of human VSMCs. Human coronary artery VSMCs transfected with MIS control oligos (open bars) or ASO to STAT3 (filled bars) were treated with IFN-γ under the following conditions: at 40 ng/ml for 30 min and analyzed for phospho- and total STAT3, STAT1, and β-actin loading control by immunoblotting (A), at different doses for 6 h, and IP-10/GAPDH mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR and normalized to untreated control cells (B); at different doses for 72 h, and IP-10 supernatant levels were measured by enzyme-Linked immunosorbent assay (C); at different doses for 6 h, and XAF1, Noxa, JAK2, or SOCS3 transcripts/GAPDH mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR and normalized to untreated control cells (D); at 100 ng/ml for various times or at different doses for 72 h in the absence of oligos (E) or at 100 ng/ml for 72 h in the presence of oligos (F), and the expression of XAF1 (34 kDa, arrowhead), Noxa (6 kDa, arrowhead), JAK2, SOCS3, and β-actin loading control was assessed by immunoblotting. Data represent the mean ± S.E., n = 2. Similar results were obtained using VSMCs from three independent donors for transcript analyses and six independent donors for protein analyses. pY, phosphotyrosine; pS, phosphoserine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We initially examined for transcriptional effects of STAT3 signaling by IFN-γ in human coronary artery VSMCs using microarray analysis. We identified 15 of 73 transcripts with >3-fold up-regulation or down-regulation by IFN-γ whose expression was partially repressed by ASO to STAT3 as compared with MIS control oligos (supplemental Table 1). These included the pro-apoptotic molecules XAF1 and Noxa and the signaling molecules JAK2 and SOCS3. In contrast, the great majority of IFN-γ-inducible transcripts, including the known STAT1-dependent molecule, IP-10, showed enhanced expression in the presence of STAT3 ASO versus MIS control oligos, suggesting competitive interactions between STAT3 and canonical STAT1 signaling by IFN-γ in VSMCs.We verified selected microarray results of STAT3-dependent signaling by IFN-γ through further mRNA and protein analysis.

In solution, and during contact activation in plasma, conversion of factor XI to factor XIa proceeds through an intermediate with one active site (1/2-FXIa). Factor XIa and 1/2-FXIa activate the substrate factor IX, with similar kinetic parameters in purified and plasma systems. During hemostasis, factor IX is activated by factors XIa or VIIa, by cleavage of the peptide bonds after Arg145 and Arg180. Factor VIIa cleaves these bonds sequentially, with accumulation of factor IXα, an intermediate cleaved after Arg145. Factor XIa also cleaves factor IX preferentially after Arg145, but little intermediate is detected. It has been postulated that the two factor XIa active sites cleave both factor IX peptide bonds prior to releasing factor IXaβ. To test this, we examined cleavage of factor IX by four single active site factor XIa proteases. Little intermediate formation was detected with 1/2-FXIa, factor XIa with one inhibited active site, or a recombinant factor XIa monomer. However, factor IXα accumulated during activation by the factor XIa catalytic domain, demonstrating the importance of the factor XIa heavy chain. Fluorescence titration of active site-labeled factor XIa revealed a binding stoichiometry of 1.9 ± 0.4 mol of factor IX/mol of factor XIa (Kd = 70 ± 40 nm). The results indicate that two forms of activated factor XI are generated during coagulation, and that each half of a factor XIa dimer behaves as an independent enzyme with respect to factor IX.

We purified and characterized the intermediate and used it, along with other forms of FXIa with one active site per molecule, to address the importance of the dimeric structure of FXIa to FIX activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—FXIIa, FIXaα, high molecular weight kininogen (HK) and corn trypsin inhibitor were from Enzyme Research Labs (South Bend, IN). Human α-thrombin, FVIIa, FXIa, FIX, FIXaβ, and fluorescein-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl were from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Hirudin (Lepirudin) was from Berlex (Wayne, NJ), soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose from Sigma, and benzamidine-Sepharose from Amersham Biosciences. l-Pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (S-2366) was from DiaPharma (West Chester, OH), 1,5-Dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-CH2Cl was from Calbiochem (La Jolla), and methyl-sulfonyl-d-cyclo-hexyl-glycyl-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide (S-299) from American Diagnostics (Greenwich, CT).Purification of Plasma FXI—Frozen plasma (2 liters) collected in acid-citrate-dextrose was thawed at 4 °C, and supplemented with benzamidine (20 mm). FXI was purified from the cryosupernatant by affinity chromatography using the anti-human FXI antibody 1G5.12 (17Sun M.-F. Zhao M. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36373-36378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After loading, the column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm benzamidine and eluted with 2 m NaSCN in the same buffer. The eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 20 mm benzamidine. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and concentration by colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad).Western Blots of FXI Activation in Plasma—Human plasmas with 0.38% sodium citrate (George King, Overland Park, KS) were mixed with equal volumes of PTT A reagent (Diagnostica Stago, Asnières-sur-Seine, France) at 37 °C. At various times, 9 μl of reactions were mixed with 6 μl of non-reducing sample buffer (233 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 138 mm SDS, 19% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue), fractionated on 6% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The primary antibody was goat anti-human FXI IgG (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG. Detection was by chemiluminescence.Preparation of FXI with a Single Catalytic Active Site (1/2-FXIa)—As will be shown, FXI activation proceeds through an intermediate with one activated subunit (1/2-FXIa). Plasma FXI (0.6–12 μm) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, underwent limited digestion by incubating with FXIIa (625 nm) or thrombin (860 nm) for 1 h at 24°C. Reactions were terminated by addition of corn trypsin inhibitor (8.6 μm) or hirudin (20 μm), respectively. The mixture was chromatographed on benzamidine-Sepharose. Elution was with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 50 mm benzamidine. FXI was found in the flow through and 1/2-FXIa in the eluate. 1/2-FXIa was also prepared by chromatography on soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose. Elution was with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 1 m benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA. The active site concentration for 1/2-FXIa was determined by complete inhibition with fluorescein-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl, followed by dialysis to remove free inhibitor. The protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (corrected for absorbance of the fluorophore) with ϵ of 214,400 m–1 cm–1, and the fluorescein concentration was determined by absorbance at 491 nm with ϵ of 79,000 m–1 cm–1.Preparation of FXIa with One Inhibited Active Site (FXIa-1/2i)—1/2-FXIa (2 μm) in 50 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, was incubated with 20 μmd-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl at 23 °C to irreversibly inhibit active sites. Residual inhibitor was removed by dialysis against the same buffer. The unactivated subunit of inhibited 1/2-FXIa was activated by incubation with FXIIa (500 nm) for 7 h at 23°C. Complete conversion to FXIa was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE. FXIa-1/2i was separated from residual inhibited FXIa by chromatography on benzamidine-Sepharose.Preparation of FXIa Bound to Polyacrylamide Beads—FXIa bound to UltraLink Iodoacetyl Resin (Pierce) was prepared by a modification of the method of Dharmawardana and Bock (18Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13143-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 1/2-FXIa (1 μm) in 50 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4 (coupling buffer), was incubated with 20 μm ATA-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (18Dharmawardana K.R.

Chem. 1992; 167: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) to inhibit active sites. After dialysis to remove free inhibitor, dialysate (500 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of packed UltraLink Resin, previously washed with coupling buffer. Protein coupling was initiated by addition of NH2OH to 0.1 m, and incubation at 24 °C for 4 h with rocking. Beads with bound protein showed no activity in a chromogenic assay using S-2366, indicating the active sites of bound 1/2-FXIa were blocked. To generate an active site on the uncleaved 1/2-FXIa subunit, the beads were incubated with FXIIa (600 nm) at 37 °C for 6 h with frequent mixing. Unreacted sites were blocked by rocking with monomeric bovine serum albumin (18Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13143-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (20 mg/ml) for 12 h at 24 °C. Specific activity of the reacted beads was determined by cleavage of S-2366 using FXIa as a standard (Table 1). The activity of the packed resin was 370 nm FXIa active sites.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for cleavage of S-2366 and activation of FIX by FXIa, 1/2-FXIa, and FXIa-1/2iSubstrateEnzymeKmkcatKimin-1nmS2366FXIa400 ± 20 μm16.1 ± 0.3NDaND, not determined.1/2-FXIa300 ± 20 μm12.4 ± 0.3NDFXIa-1/2i340 ± 7 μm21.6 ± 0.2NDFIXFXIa53 ± 8 nm33 ± 123 ± 461/2-FXIa90 ± 40 nm28 ± 323 ± 26FXIa-1/2i90 ± 30 nm23 ± 218 ± 23a ND, not determined.

Protein from stably transfected clones was purified from conditioned media (Cellgro Complete, Mediatech, Herndon, VA) by chromatography using anti-human factor XI-IgG 1G5.12 (17Sun M.-F. Zhao M. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36373-36378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The column was eluted with 2 m sodium thiocyanate in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl (Tris/NaCl). Protein containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration, dialyzed against Tris/NaCl, and stored at –80 °C. FXI/PKA4 and FXI-Ser362,482 (100–300 μg/ml) were activated by incubation with 2 μg/ml FXIIa at 37 °C. Complete activation was confirmed by reducing SDS-PAGE. FXI-Ser362,482, which lacks the disulfide bond that connects the FXIa heavy chain to the catalytic domain, was reapplied to the 1G5.12 column. The catalytic domain (FXIaCD) binds to the column, whereas the heavy chain is found in the flow through. FXIaCD was eluted as described above and dialyzed against Tris/NaCl.Preparation of Recombinant FIX Cleavage Site Mutants—The nucleotides coding for Arg145 or Arg180 in the human FIX cDNA were changed to Ala (GCG) using a Chameleon kit (Stratagene, La Jolla). The constructs encode proteins designated FIX-Ala145 and FIX-Ala180. cDNAs were ligated into vector pJVCMV, and stably expressing HEK293 cell lines (ATCC CRL 1573) were prepared as described (23Aktimur A. Gabriel M.A. Gailani D. Toomey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7981-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified from conditioned media (Cellgro Complete supplemented with 10 μg/ml vitamin K1) by chromatography using a calcium-dependent monoclonal IgG (SB 249417) that recognizes the properly γ-carboxylated FIX Gla domain, as previously described (23Aktimur A. Gabriel M.A. Gailani D. Toomey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7981-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).FXIa Hydrolysis of S-2366—FXIa (6 nm active sites, 3 nm protein), 1/2-FXIa (6 nm active sites, 6 nm protein), or FXIa-1/2i (6 nm active sites 6 nm protein) were diluted in assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing S-2366 (15.6–2000 μm). Initial rates of generation of free p-nitroaniline in 100-μl reaction volumes were measured by continuous monitoring of absorbance at 405 nm (3 mm path length) in a SpectraMax 340 microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA).FIX Activation by FXIa Followed by Chromogenic Substrate Cleavage (22Ogawa T. Verhamme I.M. Sun M. Bock P.E. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23523-23530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)—FIX (25–2000 nm) in assay buffer was activated by FXIa (1–6 nm active sites), 1/2-FXIa (1–4 nm active sites), or FXIa-1/2i (2.5–10 nm active sites) at 24 °C. At various time points between 0 and 120 min, 60-μl aliquots were removed and mixed with 6 μl of assay buffer containing 150 μm aprotinin. Aprotinin completely inhibited FXIa without affecting FIXaβ activity. Sixty-six microliters of 1 mm S299 in assay buffer with 66% ethylene glycol was added to the quenched sample, and substrate hydrolysis was followed by measuring the change in absorbance at 405 nm. Generation of FIXaβ as a function of time was determined by interpolation of the linear dependence of the initial rate of S299 hydrolysis on known concentrations of FIXaβ.Initial rates for progress curves of FIXaβ generation were obtained by analyzing the first 5 min of each curve with a second order polynomial equation. Resulting vo values were fit by the Michaelis-Menten equation, and values for Km and kcat were obtained from direct non-linear least squares analysis. The initial 5 min of FIX activation are minimally influenced by product inhibition, and defined the Km and kcat values adequately. The values for Km and kcat were used to analyze complete progress curves by the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation. With values for Km and kcat fixed, full progress curves were fitted simultaneously by the integrated rate equation with product inhibition to obtain estimates of Ki for FIXaβ.Activity of FXIa in Plasma Clotting Assays—FXIa enzymes were diluted to 5 μg/ml in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, and serial 1:2 dilutions were prepared in the same buffer. Sixty μl of each dilution was mixed with an equal volume of FXI-deficient plasma, and rabbit brain cephalin, followed by incubation for 30 s at 37 °C. Sixty μl of 25 mm CaCl2 was added and the time to clot formation was determined on a Dataclot 2 fibrometer (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). Clotting times were plotted against enzyme concentration on a log-log plot, and FXIa activity was determined as a percent of control by comparison to a control curve constructed with plasma FXIa.FIX Activation Followed by Western Blot—Plasma or recombinant FIX (100 nm) were incubated in assay buffer at 24 °C with various FXIa species, or with FVIIa in the presence of saturating human TF (Innovin, Dade-Behring, Miami, FL). In some reactions, FXIa inhibited by a tripeptide chloromethyl ketone (FXIai) was included. At various times, 7-μl samples were mixed with 7 μl of reducing sample buffer (233 mm Tris-Cl, 138 mm SDS, 19% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8), fractionated on 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The primary antibody was goat anti-human FIX polyclonal IgG (Enzyme Research Laboratories), and the secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG. Detection was by chemiluminescence. The relative positions of bands representing FIX, FIXα, FIXaα, and FIXaβ were determined by Western blots of standards for each protein.Titration of Active Site-labeled FXIa with FIX and FIXaβ—FXIa (6.25 μm) was diluted in titration buffer (50 mm Hepes, 125 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4) and inhibited with a 10-fold molar excess of 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-CH2Cl at 24 °C. Residual FXIa activity was determined by diluting aliquots to 20 nm FXIa in 120 μl of titration buffer with 500 μm S-2366, and monitoring changes in absorbance at 405 nm until FXIa activity was reduced ≥99.9%. The concentration of inhibited active sites per mol of FXIa was determined by measuring dansyl concentration by absorbance at 335 nm with ϵ of 8,000 m–1 cm–1, and FXIa concentration by absorbance at 280 nm (corrected for absorbance of the fluorophore) with ϵ of 214,400 m–1 cm–1. Probe incorporation was 1.98 moles per mole of FXIa. Fluorescence titrations were performed with an SLM 8100 fluorometer, using acrylic cuvettes coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000. Fluorescence intensity titrations of dansyl-labeled FXIa were performed with 335 nm excitation (16-nm band pass) and 552 nm emission (16-nm band pass) in titration buffer supplemented with 2 μm d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl at 24 °C. The quadratic binding equation was fit to fluorescence changes ((Fobs–Fo)/Fo =ΔF/Fo) as a function of total FIX concentration, to determine the maximum change in fluorescence (ΔFmax/Fo), dissociation constant (Kd), and stoichiometry (n) using SCIENTIST software (MicroMath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT). Parameter errors represent 95% confidence intervals.RESULTSActivation of FXI by Factor XIIa and Thrombin—The conversion of the 80-kDa subunits of FXI to the 50-kDa heavy chains and 30-kDa catalytic domains of FXIa is evident on reducing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1A). On non-reducing gels, the 160-kDa FXI dimer migrates slightly more rapidly than FXIa (Fig. 1B). During time course experiments, a species migrating in an intermediate position between FXI and FXIa was observed on non-reducing gels (Fig. 1B). The PTT assay is used in clinical laboratories to assess plasma coagulation initiated by surface-dependent activation of FXII (contact activation). Western blots of human plasma exposed to a silica-containing PTT reagent (Fig. 2) demonstrated a band migrating between FXI and FXIa in normal plasma (Fig. 2A). Generation of FXIa and the intermediate were dependent on FXIIa (Fig. 2B) and the plasma protein HK (Fig. 2C), which is required for FXI binding to the contact surface.FIGURE 2Time course of FXI activation in plasma by contact activation monitored by Western blotting. A, normal human plasma, and human plasmas lacking Factor XII (B) or HK(C) were mixed with equal volumes of PTT reagent at 37 °C. At various times, samples were removed into non-reducing sample buffer and fractionated on 6% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, followed by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Migration of protein standards for FXI and FXIa are shown, and migration of the reaction intermediate is indicated by INT. Note that the time course is longer for factor XII-deficient plasma than for normal or HK-deficient plasma.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An intermediate was also observed during FXI activation by α-thrombin (Fig. 3A). When a mixture of FXI and the intermediate was chromatographed on benzamidine-Sepharose, the intermediate bound (Fig. 3B), whereas FXI eluted in the flowthrough, indicating the intermediate was an active protease. Unlike FXIa, the intermediate contains uncleaved subunits (Fig. 3B) and is, therefore, a species with only one subunit of the dimer cleaved at the Arg369–Ile370 bond (1/2-FXIa). The number of moles of active sites per mol of 1/2-FXIa protein was 0.93, compared with 1.98 for FXIa. 1/2-FXIa cleaves a tripeptide substrate at about half of the rate (58%) of an equimolar concentration of FXIa (Fig. 3C). Whereas FXIa is not seen in the sample in Fig. 3B, we observed traces of FXIa in some 1/2-FXIa preparations.FIGURE 3Time course of FXI activation byα-thrombin monitored by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and a schematic diagram of the generation and purification of 1/2-FXIa and FXIa-1/2i from plasma FXI. A, FXI (625 nm) in assay buffer was incubated at 37 °C with α-thrombin (625 nm). At various times, aliquots were removed into non-reducing sample buffer and fractionated on SDS-6% polyacrylamide gels. Migration of protein standards for FXI and FXIa are shown, and migration of the reaction intermediate is indicated by 1/2-FXIa. Below the 1-h time point on the gel are schematic diagrams of FXI/FXIa dimers, with ellipses representing heavy chains, and circles representing catalytic domains. A filled circle represents unactivated FXI polypeptide, an open circle represents activated polypeptide, and a circle with an X represents activated polypeptide in which the active site is inhibited with a chloromethyl ketone (CMK). To prepare 1/2-FXIa, FXI undergoes limited activation by thrombin, followed by separation of the active species from residual FXI by chromatography on benzamidine-Sepharose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” FXIa with one inhibited active site per dimer (FXIa-1/2i) was prepared by treating 1/2-FXIa with CMK to inhibit all active sites. After dialysis, the unactivated chain of inhibited 1/2-FXIa was activated by incubation with FXIIa. The final product, FXIa-1/2i, was separated from traces of inhibited FXIa by chromatography on benzamidine-Sepharose. B, samples of purified FXI, 1/2-FXIa, and FXIa were fractionated under nonreducing conditions on a SDS-6% polyacrylamide (top) or reducing conditions on a SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel (bottom), and stained with GelCode blue. C, FXIa (○) or 1/2-FXIa (•) (6 nm) in assay buffer containing 500 mm S-2366 was incubated at 24 °C and changes in absorbance at 405 nm were followed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FXIa with One Inhibited Active Site (FXIa-1/2i)—We prepared an additional single active site FXIa species, FXIa-1/2i, using the procedure shown in Fig. 3A. 1/2-FXIa was incubated with a tripeptide chloromethyl ketone to irreversibly inhibit the active sites. After dialysis, the uncleaved subunit of 1/2-FXIa was activated with FXIIa. The only new active sites formed in this step are due to cleavage of this subunit. No new fully active FXIa was generated because zymogen FXI was removed during preparation of 1/2-FXIa, and any FXIa in the 1/2-FXIa preparation was inactivated by the chloromethyl ketone. The product, FXIa-1/2i, has two active sites per molecule, one of which is blocked by the inhibitor, and was separated from traces of inhibited FXIa, by benzamidine-Sepharose chromatography, as shown (Fig. 3A).Activities of Single Active Site FXIa Species in Chromogenic Substrate Assays—The kinetic parameters for cleavage of the tripeptide substrate S-2366 by FXIa, 1/2-FXIa, and FXIa-1/2i were determined, and the Michaelis-Menten equation was fit to the data (Table 1), treating each active FXIa subunit as an independent enzyme. Substrate affinity (Km) and catalytic efficiency (kcat) were similar for the three proteases. Activation of FIX was studied by progress curve analysis and from the FIX dependence of the initial rate of FIXaβ formation, using a chromogenic assay (Fig. 4) (22Ogawa T. Verhamme I.M. Sun M. Bock P.E. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23523-23530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The results, summarized in Table 1, indicate that FXIa and its singly active derivatives have similar apparent affinities (Km) and turnover numbers (kcat) for FIX. The results for 1/2-FXIa are unlikely to be due to contaminating FXIa. If 1/2-FXIa (the vast majority of protease in the preparation) did not cleave FIX, and all FIX activation was due to traces of FXIa, the turnover number (kcat) would be very low relative to the FXIa control. Previously, we demonstrated that FIX and FIXaβ bind to FXIa in a mutually exclusive manner, and that the Ki for product inhibition and the Km for FIX activation were similar (22Ogawa T. Verhamme I.M. Sun M. Bock P.E. Gailani D."
https://openalex.org/W2005071039,"Pre-term birth is the leading cause of perinatal and neonatal mortality, 40% of which are attributed to the pre-term premature rupture of amnion. Rupture of amnion is thought to be associated with a corresponding decrease in the extracellular collagen content and/or increase in collagenase activity. However, there is very little information concerning the detailed organisation of fibrillar collagen in amnion and how this might influence rupture. Here we identify a loss of lattice like arrangement in collagen organisation from areas near to the rupture site, and present a 9% increase in fibril spacing and a 50% decrease in fibrillar organisation using quantitative measurements gained by transmission electron microscopy and the novel application of synchrotron X-ray diffraction. These data provide an accurate insight into the biomechanical process of amnion rupture and highlight X-ray diffraction as a new and powerful tool in our understanding of this process."
https://openalex.org/W2041393104,"N-myc has proapoptotic functions, yet it acts as an oncogene in neuroblastoma. Thus, antiapoptotic mechanisms have to be operative in neuroblastoma cells that antagonize the proapoptotic effects of N-myc. We conditionally activated N-myc in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells subjected to the trophic stress of serum or nutrient deprivation while changing the expression of Bcl-2, survivin and FLIPL, antiapoptotic molecules often overexpressed in poor prognosis neuroblastomas. Bcl-2 protected SH-EP cells from death during nutritional deprivation by activating energetically advantageous oxidative phosphorylation. N-myc overrode the metabolic protection provided by Bcl-2-induced oxidative phosphorylation by reestablishing the glycolytic phenotype and attenuated the antiapoptotic effect of Bcl-2 during metabolic stress. Survivin partially antagonized the growth suppressive function of N-myc in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells during serum deprivation whereas FLIPL did not. These findings advance our understanding of the functions of N-myc in neuroblastoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2013344680,"C→U plant organellar RNA editing is required for the translation of evolutionarily conserved and functional proteins. 28 different C targets of RNA editing have been identified in maize chloroplasts, and hundreds of Cs are edited in mitochondria. Mutant analysis in Arabidopsis has indicated that absence of a single site-specific recognition protein can result in loss of editing of a single C target, raising the possibility that each C target requires a recognition protein. Here we show that transcripts encompassing two editing sites, ZMrpoB C467 and ZMrps14 C80, can compete editing activity from each other in vitro despite limited sequence similarity. The signal causing competition overlaps a 5′-cis element required for editing efficiency. A single five-nucleotide mutation spanning the region from –20 to –16 relative to the edited C of rpoB C467 is sufficient to eliminate its substrate editing as well as its ability to compete editing activity from rps14 C80 substrates. A corresponding mutation in an rps14 C80 competitor likewise eliminated its ability to compete editing activity from rpoB C467 substrates. Taken together, our results indicate that the RNA sequences mediating both editing efficiency and cross-competition are highly similar and that a common protein is involved in their editing. Sharing of trans-factors can facilitate editing of the large number of different C targets in plant organelles so that a different protein factor would not be required for every editing site.

To date, 28 cytidine-to-uridine editing sites have been identified in 15 chloroplast transcripts in maize (12Tsudzuki T. Wakasugi T. Sugiura M. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 53: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Tillich M. Schmitz-Linneweber C. Herrmann R.G. Maier R.M. Maize Genetics Cooperation Newsletter. 2001; 75: 42-44Google Scholar), all of which alter the encoded amino acid, except one site in the 5′-untranslated region of ndhG. It is currently believed that the plant organellar RNA editing machinery consists of two distinct components: the cis-element, which uniquely identifies a given editing site by its sequence and structure within the transcript itself, and the trans-acting factors, which are likely to be proteins that recognize the cis-element and catalyze the editing reaction (14Shikanai T. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The sequences surrounding all editing sites in a given organism do not show obvious similarity to each other either by direct sequence alignment or by secondary structure prediction. However, transplastomic tobacco that overexpress a fragment of maize rpoB or tobacco ndhF transcripts spanning the rpoB C467 or ndhF C290 editing sites, respectively, showed reduced editing at the cognate tobacco sites, as well as at additional sites (15Chateigner-Boutin A.L. Hanson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8448-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), indicating that at least some cis-elements are related. These three editing sites therefore form a “cluster” affected by overexpression of transcripts carrying only one C target (Fig. 11 ). Furthermore, three 2–3-nt 2The abbreviations used are: ntnucleotideRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCRWTwild-type. 2The abbreviations used are: ntnucleotideRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCRWTwild-type. regions of sequence identity exist between the sites of the rpoB C473 cluster within 20 nt 5′ of the edited C, when gaps are introduced in the sequences (15Chateigner-Boutin A.L. Hanson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8448-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). nucleotide reverse transcription-PCR wild-type. nucleotide reverse transcription-PCR wild-type. Two nuclear-encoded protein factors have been identified that are believed to be responsible for sequence recognition of editing sites in the ndhD transcript of Arabidopsis: CRR4, which is critical for ATndhD C2 editing, and CRR21, which is required for ATndhD C383 editing (16Kotera E. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2005; 433: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 17Okuda K. Myouga F. Motohashi R. Shinozaki K. Shikanai T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8178-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins are members of the pentatricopeptide repeat class of proteins, which consists of >450 members in Arabidopsis that are largely targeted to chloroplasts and/or mitochondria (18Lurin C. Andres C. Aubourg S. Bellaoui M. Bitton F. Bruyere C. Caboche M. Debast C. Gualberto J. Hoffmann B. Lecharny A. Le Ret M. Martin-Magniette M.L. Mireau H. Peeters N. Renou J.P. Szurek B. Taconnat L. Small I. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2089-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Pentatricopeptide repeat motif-containing proteins have been implicated in additional organellar RNA processing or maturation events as well as RNA editing (19Barkan A. Walker M. Nolasco M. Johnson D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3170-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20Hashimoto M. Endo T. Peltier G. Tasaka M. Shikanai T.

Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1480-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As crr4 or crr21 knockouts specifically affect editing at one C target only, they are believed to be sequence recognition factors for the sites they affect. Although CRR4 and CRR21 evidently do not affect editing of multiple C targets, in vivo competition data regarding other editing sites as well as our data from in vitro analysis presented here suggest that trans-factors required for editing of multiple C targets will be described in the future. Possibly genes encoding such trans-factors rarely emerge in mutant screens because their loss of function would often have lethal consequences. An in vitro editing assay has been developed to study cis-elements near C targets of editing. Editing of RNA substrates, transcribed in vitro, occurs in extracts prepared from isolated chloroplasts (22Miyamoto T. Obokata J. Sugiura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6726-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Hegeman C.E. Hayes M.L. Hanson M.R. Plant J. 2005; 42: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A major benefit of this strategy for studying the editing machinery is that many mutant substrates can be studied for editing efficiency at the same time, under controlled conditions. Alternatively, cis-elements can be studied in vivo in transgenic plants; however, this technique is very limited in terms of the number of substrates that can be tested by the amount of time and expense required to generate such transgenic plants, as well as variability due to transformation and regeneration. The in vitro strategy has previously been used in our laboratory to identify cis-elements of the tobacco rpoB C473 and psbE C214 editing sites (23Hegeman C.E. Hayes M.L. Hanson M.R. Plant J. 2005; 42: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Hayes M.L. Reed M.L. Hegeman C.E. Hanson M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3742-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Hayes M.L. Hanson M.R. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2007; 13: 281-288Google Scholar). We have previously studied the tobacco rpoB C473 site extensively both in vivo and in vitro. A transgene containing the sequence from 20 nt 5′ to 6 nt 3′ (–20/+6) of the NTrpoB C473 site is sufficient for tobacco editing in vivo (26Reed M.L. Peeters N.M. Hanson M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and a –31/+22 transgene is edited more efficiently in vivo (24Hayes M.L. Reed M.L. Hegeman C.E. Hanson M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3742-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a synthetic substrate containing the –31/+22 region of rpoB C473 was shown to be sufficient for in vitro editing in both tobacco and maize extracts (24Hayes M.L. Reed M.L. Hegeman C.E. Hanson M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3742-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we report our findings on the relationship of the cis-element of maize rpoB C467 to that of its cluster member, rps14 C80. The existence of a five-member rpoB C473 cluster has been functionally proven in tobacco using an in vivo approach (15Chateigner-Boutin A.L. Hanson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8448-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); however, in the putative orthologous maize cluster, editing occurs only at rpoB C467 and rps14 C80 because the remaining three members of the maize cluster have a genomically encoded U at the position of the C target in tobacco (Fig. 1). We have found that synthetic maize rpoB C467 and rps14 C80 RNAs can both be edited by maize chloroplast extracts and that both are capable of reducing the editing extent of transcripts carrying either the rpoB C467 or the rps14 C80 sites. We have taken advantage of our competition assay to localize the cis-elements of each editing site that are responsible for the competition effect. Previously, sequences responsible for cross-competition in vivo could not be studied by in vitro editing assays because substrates representing two or more cluster members could not be edited in vitro. We observe that the cis-elements causing the competition effect co-localize with those that determine editing efficiency, indicating that the same trans-factor is likely to mediate both responses. Synthesis of Editing Substrates in Vitro—DNA templates for RNA substrates were made by PCR amplification (Taq MasterMix kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) from maize genomic DNA using gene-specific primers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) containing overhanging bacterial fragments SK and KS (supplemental Table S1). The T7 promoter sequence was then added by a subsequent PCR step to the 5′ end of the templates. Mutant templates were made by incorporation of mismatches in primers used for PCR. RNA substrates were then transcribed in vitro from their DNA templates and purified as described previously (25Hayes M.L. Hanson M.R. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2007; 13: 281-288Google Scholar). Preparation of Editing Competent Maize Extracts—Maize chloroplast extracts were prepared from leaves of 7–10-day-old plants as described previously (24Hayes M.L. Reed M.L. Hegeman C.E. Hanson M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3742-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Leaf tissue was homogenized, and intact chloroplasts were isolated by gradient sedimentation using Percoll (Amersham Biosciences). Buffers and conditions for chloroplast isolation, extraction, and dialysis were as described previously (23Hegeman C.E. Hayes M.L. Hanson M.R. Plant J. 2005; 42: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Extracts contained 2–4 μg/μl protein. In Vitro Editing Reaction—Editing reactions for substrate editing without competitor RNAs were as described previously (23Hegeman C.E. Hayes M.L. Hanson M.R. Plant J. 2005; 42: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using 0.1 fmol of RNA and 4 μl of extract. For competition experiments, competitor RNAs were added to the editing reaction mixture prior to the addition of 10 fmol of RNA substrate. Following incubation to allow editing, 1 μl of the editing reaction mixture was used for cDNA synthesis and subsequent PCR amplification as in Ref. 23Hegeman C.E. Hayes M.L. Hanson M.R. Plant J. 2005; 42: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. All substrates, with the exception of the two competition substrates, used the KS primer for RT and SK and KS primers for PCR. For competition experiments, RT of the substrate RNA used the SK(-s) primer, and the subsequent PCR used KS(-s) and SK(-s) primers. The pTri competitor is a 128-nt control transcript containing a fragment of conserved human 18 S rRNA sequence unrelated to any known editing site and is transcribed from a template included with the T7MEGAshortscript kit (Ambion). Poisoned Primer Extension—To determine the editing efficiency in a given reaction, poisoned primer extension was performed as described previously (23Hegeman C.E. Hayes M.L. Hanson M.R. Plant J. 2005; 42: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Different oligonucleotides were used for extension of substrates from each site, depending on the presence of mutations either 5′ or 3′ of the edited C, and are listed in supplemental Table S1. A 54-nt ZMrpoB C467 3ZMrpoB C467, C at nt 467 from A of ATG of the Zea mays rpoB gene, nomenclature for editing sites as proposed by Hayes et al. (24Hayes M.L. Reed M.L. Hegeman C.E. Hanson M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3742-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). substrate, containing 31 nt upstream and 22 nt downstream of the target C and flanked by SK and KS sequences on the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, was found to edit 60 ± 4% in replicate experiments. Substrates were made with blocks of 5 or 6 nts at a time mutated to the complementary nucleotides along the length of the sequence (Fig. 2A) to evaluate the significance of each sequence block for C467 editing (Fig. 2B). Six of the mutant substrates had reduced editing efficiency relative to the wild-type substrate, and three of these six were virtually unedited using standard assay conditions. The three 5-nt blocks that contain these critical sequences were m20–, m15–, and m10–, which collectively span the region from –20 to –6 (Fig. 2). A 131-nt ZMrps14 C80 substrate (100 nt upstream and 30 nt downstream) was edited in vitro to 28 ± 5%. Substrates containing 5′ and 3′ truncations of the 131-nt substrate were assayed for editing efficiency to determine the minimal sequence required for editing to proceed (Fig. 3). Truncation substrates containing at least 20-nt 5′ and at least 5-nts 3′ retained editing efficiency, but substrates with less than 20-nt 5′ had a marked decrease in editing efficiency. As determined above, the critical cis-elements directing editing of both rpoB C467 and rps14 C80 lie within 20-nt 5′ of the target C, and some sequence further 5′ or on the 3′ side of the target may also be involved in recognition. To further explore the sequence requirements for editing of each substrate, we made single nucleotide mutations at each position within the –20/+6 windows for each site by altering the wild-type sequence to the complementary nucleotide, and each was assayed for editability (Fig. 4). The relative editing efficiency for each substrate was calculated. For rpoB C467, 35% of the mutated substrates had reduced editing efficiency, 35% had enhanced editing efficiency, and 30% had no effect. Of the rps14 C80 mutated substrates, 58% had reduced editing efficiency, 8% had enhanced editing efficiency, and 35% had no effect. The raw (unaligned) comparison between the two critical windows reveals six common positions that negatively affect editing when mutated, and only three of these are the same nucleotide in both sequences. Using gaps to align the rpoB C467 and rps14 C80 editing sites, as reported by Ref. 15Chateigner-Boutin A.L. Hanson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8448-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, reveals six positions in common that negatively affect editing when mutated, and five of these six are the same nucleotide in both sequences (Fig. 4C). To further investigate cis-elements affecting editing and the similarity between the rpoB C467 and rps14 C80 sites, we performed in vitro competition experiments. First, we established that 100-fold self-competitor was sufficient to reduce editing of rpoB C467 substrate to virtually undetectable levels, whereas inclusion of pTri 18 S RNA, the 128-nt control transcript of unrelated sequence, did not reduce editing of C467. Cross-competition was observed; a 100-fold amount of rpoB C467 substrate reduced rps14 C80 substrate editing to a similarly low level as self-competitor, and rps14 C80 reciprocally reduced rpoB C467 editing. Fig. 5A shows the results of self-competition experiments using rpoB C467 substrate and rpoB C467 wild-type and multiple-nt mutated competitors. Three 5-nt mutated competitors had reduced competition relative to wild-type, and in the case of competition with the m20– sequence, editing efficiency of the substrate was >80% relative to the no-competitor and pTri controls. In the case of rpoB cross-competition of rps14 C80 substrate editing, four of the 5-nt mutated competitors exhibited reduced competition relative to wild-type competitors (Fig. 5B). Three of these also showed reduced competition of the rpoB C467 substrate (Fig. 5A). The same 5-nt mutation had the largest effect on competition and completely eliminated the ability of the rpoB C467 competitor to reduce editing of rps14 C80. Furthermore, when the –20 to –16 region of the rps14 C80 competitor was mutated, cross-competition was likewise eliminated (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Effect of rps14 competitor mutations on in vitro cross-competition with rpoB C467 substrate.

The nucleotide at the editing site in the maize psbL transcript is a genomically encoded U, and thus drift could have occurred in a cis-element that might have been present in a progenitor of maize in which psbL C2 was edited. However, we noted that some of the nucleotides found to be critical for editing of maize rpoB C467 and rps14 C80 are present at comparable positions in maize upstream of psbL U2. We therefore wondered whether a maize psbL RNA might reduce editing of rpoB C467 and rps14 C80. Indeed, we found that maize psbL RNA was able to reduce editing of rpoB C467 and rsp14 C80 substrates if a higher competitor-to-substrate ratio was used. Although rpoB C467 and rps14 C80 could compete editing activity at 100-fold competitor-to-substrate, maize psbL U2 competitor or an artificial psbL C2 competitor did not cause an appreciable decrease in substrate editing efficiency unless a 1000-fold competitor-to-substrate ratio was used (Fig. 7). Comparison of the psbL transcripts from maize and tobacco reveals several sequence differences upstream of the editing site in addition to the C/U editing site difference itself (Fig. 7A). At the 1000-fold competitor-to-substrate ratio needed to observe competition by psbL substrates, a competitor containing the tobacco sequence was able to reduce editing of rpoB C467 and rps14 C80 substrates more efficiently than one containing the maize sequence (Fig. 7C). Two of the differences between the tobacco and maize psbL sequences, at the –16 and –11 positions of the maize transcript, relative to the editing site, are changes in the conserved sequence elements identified in the tobacco editing site cluster. Restoration of these conserved positions in maize psbL C2 competitors (Fig. 7B) enhanced rpoB C467 competition slightly but not to the level of competition exerted by the tobacco psbL C2 competitor (Fig. 7C). The improvement in competition of by the mutated maize competitors was higher for rpoB C467 substrate than for rps14 C80 substrate. Mutating the tobacco psbL competitor in the region corresponding to the rpoB m20– mutant competitor likewise eliminated its ability to compete editing activity from either rpoB C467 or rps14 C80 substrates (Fig. 7C). Competitors carrying the genomically encoded U at the editing site of maize psbL RNAs did not compete differently from those with a C at this position. When these maize psbL U2 and psbL C2 competitors were added to reactions containing rpoB C467 substrate, the editing efficiencies were reduced to 9%. There also was no significant difference between the psbL U2 and psbL C2 competitors on rps14 C80 substrate editing; with either competitor, the editing efficiencies were reduced to 10%. Self-competition of editing of endogenous psbL transcript with psbL transgene transcripts was first observed in vivo by Chaudhuri et al. (27Chaudhuri S. Carrer H. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2951-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and provided the initial indirect evidence for the existence of site-specific recognition factors for chloroplast RNA editing. Subsequently, when Hirose and Sugiura (28Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) developed editing-competent tobacco chloroplast extracts, they observed that oligoribonucleotides carrying sequences 5′ to psbL C2 or a ndhB C target of editing were effective self-competitors for editing but that no cross-competition occurred when either psbL or ndhB RNAs were added to radiolabeled oligoribonucleotide substrates specified by the other gene. Likewise, Miyamoto et al. (22Miyamoto T. Obokata J. Sugiura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6726-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) showed that psbE and petB editing substrates will undergo self-competition but not cross-competition in vitro. Mutations in either psbE or petB RNAs between –5 and –1 upstream of the C target of editing did not affect self-competition extent (29Miyamoto T. Obokata J. Sugiura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These prior reports utilized a thin-layer chromatography separation of radiolabeled C and U to assay editing and competition extent, which is not easily quantified. We have used a sensitive and precise poisoned primer extension assay (25Hayes M.L. Hanson M.R. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2007; 13: 281-288Google Scholar) to quantify the effect of mutation of substrates and competitors on the extent of editing in maize chloroplast extracts. We show that swapping the SK/KS flanking sequences of substrate and competitor RNAs is a convenient method to assay self-competition in vitro. Our report is the first to demonstrate cross-competition between transcripts of two different editing sites in vitro. The cross-competition of maize rpoB C467 and rps14 C80 substrates in vitro is consistent with our prior finding of cross-competition of the orthologous editing sites in vivo by overexpression of rpoB transgene transcripts in tobacco transplastomic plants (15Chateigner-Boutin A.L. Hanson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8448-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that psbL competitors carrying either a C or a U at the location of the edited nucleotide are equally effective in reducing editing of rpoB C467 and rps14 C 80 in maize extracts in vitro. The effectiveness of either C-containing or U-containing competitors was not unexpected given that ndhF transgene transcripts carrying either C or U at the editing site were effective competitors of endogenous ndhF transcript editing in transplastomic tobacco plants in vivo (30Reed M.L. Lyi S.M. Hanson M.R. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Evidently, both unedited and edited transcripts can be recognized by trans-factors. Cross-competition between editing sites in vivo and in vitro reveals similarities in cis-elements between sequences surrounding different C targets of editing. The simplest explanation for cross-competition would be the existence of a single trans-factor that recognizes these similar editing sites. This hypothesis is an attractive explanation for the capability of the plant to recognize hundreds of different Cs with a high degree of specificity. Imperfect selectivity of a trans-factor in recognition of C targets could explain how a new T → C mutation could be corrected at the transcript level in the plant in which it first arises, leading to evolutionary improvement of editing efficiency at new targets through modification of trans-factors to recognize multiple targets. Alternatively, there could be different factors, perhaps evolutionarily related, that recognize each editing site, perhaps with different efficiencies. Transcripts carrying one editing site could possibly bind both factors, resulting in reduced editing extent of two different C targets when the competitor transcript is in great excess. A study of an Arabidopsis editing mutant has shown that the lack of a single trans-factor, CRR4, can prevent editing of the ATndhD C2 target (16Kotera E. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2005; 433: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and that CRR4 specifically binds to an RNA fragment containing ndhD C2 (17Okuda K. Myouga F. Motohashi R. Shinozaki K. Shikanai T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8178-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In tobacco, editing of ndhD C2 is affected by overexpression of an ndhF transgene, and sequences 5′ to both C targets exhibit some similarity, suggesting that the two sites may share the same or related trans-factors. The Arabidopsis ndhF C290 and ndhD C2 editing sites also exhibit 5′ sequence similarity, but no effect on ndhF C290 editing in the ndhD C2 editing-deficient mutant was detected (16Kotera E. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Nature. 2005; 433: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses can be created to explain these apparently contradictory findings. First, possibly an ortholog of CRR4 in tobacco can bind both to ndhD C2 and to the ndhF C290 site, and thus ndhF C290 editing would be reduced in the presence of excess ndhF transcript. Second, there may be a trans-factor that is shared between ndhF C290 and ndhF C290 editing sites that is not an ortholog of CRR4 but is a factor that remains to be discovered. If such a factor is in limiting quantities and is bound by ndhF transcript, editing of ndhD C2 could be reduced even if a CRR4 ortholog only binds to ndhD transcript. Future identification of all of the components of editing complexes that act on C targets with related 5′ sequence should reveal the nature of the relationships between the editing complexes responsible for converting different plant organelle Cs to Us.

https://openalex.org/W2071455115,"The use of phages is an attractive option to battle antibiotic resistant bacteria in certain bacterial infections, but the role of phage ecology in bacterial infections is obscure. Here we surveyed the phage ecology in septicemia, the most severe type of bacterial infection. We observed that the majority of the bacterial isolates from septicemia patients spontaneously secreted phages active against other isolates of the same bacterial strain, but not to the strain causing the disease. Such phages were also detected in the initial blood cultures, indicating that phages are circulating in the blood at the onset of sepsis. The fact that most of the septicemic bacterial isolates carry functional prophages suggests an active role of phages in bacterial infections. Apparently, prophages present in sepsis-causing bacterial clones play a role in clonal selection during bacterial invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1973807036,"Aberrant beta-adrenergic signaling and depressed calcium homeostasis, associated with an imbalance of protein kinase A and phosphatase-1 activities, are hallmarks of heart failure. Phosphatase-1 is restrained by its endogenous inhibitor, protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (PPI-1). We assessed 352 normal subjects, along with 959 patients with heart failure and identified a polymorphism in PPI-1 (G147D) exclusively in black subjects. To determine whether the G147D variant could affect cardiac function, we infected adult cardiomyocytes with adenoviruses expressing D147 or wild-type (G147) PPI-1. Under basal conditions, there were no significant differences in fractional shortening or contraction or relaxation rates. However, the enhancement of contractile parameters after isoproterenol stimulation was significantly blunted in D147 compared with G147 and control myocytes. Similar findings were observed in calcium kinetics. The attenuated beta-agonist response was associated with decreased (50%) phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at serine 16, whereas phosphorylation of troponin I and ryanodine receptor was unaltered. These findings suggest that the human G147D PPI-1 can attenuate responses of cardiomyocytes to beta-adrenergic agonists by decreasing PLN phosphorylation and therefore may contribute to deteriorated function in heart failure."
