https://openalex.org/W1988969017,"Apoptosis is orchestrated by a family of cysteine proteases known as the caspases. Fourteen mammalian caspases have been identified, three of which (caspase-3, -6, and -7) are thought to coordinate the execution phase of apoptosis by cleaving multiple structural and repair proteins. However, the relative contributions that the “executioner” caspases make to the demolition of the cell remains speculative. Here we have used cell-free extracts immuno-depleted of either caspase-3, -6, or -7 to examine the caspase requirements for apoptosis-associated proteolysis of 14 caspase substrates as well as nuclear condensation, chromatin margination, and DNA fragmentation. We show that caspase-3 is the primary executioner caspase in this system, necessary for cytochromec/dATP-inducible cleavage of fodrin, gelsolin, U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, DNA fragmentation factor 45 (DFF45)/inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD), receptor-interacting protein (RIP), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (X-IAP), signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1), topoisomerase I, vimentin, Rb, and lamin B but not for cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) or lamin A. In addition, caspase-3 was also essential for apoptosis-associated chromatin margination, DNA fragmentation, and nuclear collapse in this system. Surprisingly, although caspase-6 and -7 are considered to be important downstream effector caspases, depletion of either caspase had minimal impact on any of the parameters investigated, calling into question their precise role during the execution phase of apoptosis.

Fourteen caspases have been identified in mammals, a subset of which are thought to be directly involved in the regulation of cell death, with the remainder involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (3Thornberry N.A.

Caspases are synthesized as relatively inactive precursors (zymogens) that require proteolytic processing for activation (3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar, 4Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 6Earnshaw W.C.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Caspase zymogens are typically activated at the onset of apoptosis in two basic ways; those at the apex of signaling cascades are aggregated by caspase adaptor molecules, such as Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) or Apaf-1,1 which promote caspase autoactivation, whereas those further downstream are directly activated by apical caspases (6Earnshaw W.C.

A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Active caspases promote apoptosis in several ways: by activating other destructive enzymes such as DNases, by promoting mitochondrial cytochrome c release via Bcl-2 family proteins such as BID, and by degrading key structural and regulatory proteins within the cell (3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar, 4Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 7Slee E.A.

Thus far, numerous caspase substrates have been identified, and work is still ongoing to link the caspase-mediated proteolysis of particular substrates with phenotypical changes that take place during apoptosis. Caspases implicated in apoptosis have been divided into two functional sub-groups based upon their perceived roles in this process. Upstream or apical caspases are those that are responsible for initiating the caspase cascade by becoming aggregated upon receipt of a pro-apoptotic stimulus. The latter caspases (caspase-2, -8, -9, -10) tend to have long N-terminal regions (prodomains) with motifs (caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), death effector domains (DEDs)) that are also present in molecules such as Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), Apaf-1, and RIP-associated Ich-1/CED homologous protein with death domain (RAIDD), which promote their aggregation (6Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar, 7Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J.

A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The second group are downstream, or executioner, caspases (caspase-3, -6, -7) that are thought to be responsible for the actual destruction of the cell and tend to have short or absent prodomains. Much progress has been made in dissecting the routes to activation of the apical caspases, particularly in the context of apoptosis triggered by ligands of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily (13Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5125) Google Scholar). However, in sharp contrast, the contribution that each executioner caspase makes to the execution phase of apoptosis remains speculative. In particular, although caspase-6 and -7 are widely regarded to act as executioner caspases, their role during the execution phase of apoptosis is obscure. Studies using cells from CASP-3 null mice as well as transformed cell lines devoid of caspase-3 have shown that caspase-3 is important for events such as DNA degradation, nuclear condensation, plasma membrane blebbing, and proteolysis of certain caspase substrates (14Jänicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, 15Jänicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol.

However, some or all of the observed defects in caspase-3-deficient cells could be due to a failure to activate downstream caspases in the absence of caspase-3. In general, studies that have linked cleavage of a caspase substrate to a specific caspase have used arbitrary amounts of purified recombinant caspases to demonstrate this. Thus, it remains unclear whether a caspase that is the most efficient at targeting a substrate in vitro is necessarily the caspase responsible for this proteolytic event in the cellular context. As a step toward dissecting the execution phase of apoptosis, we have generated cell-free extracts devoid of individual executioner caspases to explore the impact of their removal on events that take place during the demolition phase of apoptosis. We used a cell-free system based on post-nuclear extracts, prepared from viable Jurkat cells, in which apoptosis can be triggered by the addition of cytochrome cand dATP. It is well established that cytochrome c/dATP promote caspase activation via the CED-4 homologue Apaf-1 (18Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Upon activation by Apaf-1, caspase-9 then propagates a caspase cascade, which results in the stepwise activation of caspase-3, -7, -2, -6, -8, and -10 (Refs. 7Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar and 22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W.

Using Jurkat extracts immuno-depleted of either caspase-3, -6, or -7, we have assessed the impact of depletion of the latter caspases on events that typically occur during the terminal phase of apoptosis. We show that caspase-3 is the primary executioner caspase, necessary for cleavage of the majority of the substrates examined (with the exception of PARP and lamin A), as well as DNA fragmentation and nuclear collapse. Surprisingly, depletion of caspase-6 or -7 from cell extracts had minimal impact on any of the parameters investigated, calling into question their role during the execution phase of apoptosis. Anti-caspase-3, caspase-7, RIP, X-IAP, STAT1, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV, and gelsolin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-caspase-6 and anti-DFF45 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY); anti-α-fodrin monoclonal antibodies were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA); anti-α-actin antibody was purchased from ICN; anti-Rb pAb was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-vimentin and anti-PARP antibodies were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Pharmingen, anti-lamin B, anti-PARP, anti-topoisomerase I, and anti-U1snRNP human polyclonal autoantibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Eng Tan (Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, CA). Jurkat extracts were prepared as described previously (22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J.

Briefly, cells were lysed by homogenization with ∼40 strokes of a B-type pestle after incubation in ice-cold cell extract buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Crude extracts were then centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g to remove nuclei, unbroken cells, and other debris. Post-nuclear extracts were then used for immuno-depletions as described below. MCF-7 extract was prepared in the same manner except that the MCF-7 cells were lysed by three rounds of freeze-thaw on liquid nitrogen before centrifugation at 15 000 × g for 15 min. Jurkat extracts were immuno-depleted of specific caspases as described previously (22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W.

Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were coated with 5 μg of anti-caspase antibody by continual rotation for 3 h at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (final volume, 200 μl). Purified rabbit or mouse IgG (Sigma) was used as a control. Antibody-coated beads were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, before adding to cell extracts. Cell extracts (100 μl) were immuno-depleted overnight at 4 °C under constant rotation, followed by removal of antibody-coated beads by centrifugation. Depleted extracts were used immediately and were not refrozen. Reactions were set up in a final volume of 10 μl or multiples thereof. A typical 10-μl reaction contained 5 μl of cell extract (∼10 μg of protein) and 2 μl of purified CEM nuclei (∼4 × 105) and were brought up to their final volume with cell extract buffer or cytochrome c and dATP dissolved in the same buffer. To initiate apoptosis, extracts were incubated for 2 h in the presence of bovine heart cytochrome c (50 μg/ml final concentration; Sigma) and dATP (1 mm; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). CEM and 293T nuclei were prepared as described previously (24Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Cell-free reactions were analyzed for substrate proteolysis by Western blotting, as described previously (22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J.

Greenberg A.H. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2407-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Reactions were analyzed for DNA fragmentation using agarose gel electrophoresis, as described previously (24Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In some experiments, nuclei within the extracts were visually scored for apoptotic features by staining with ethidium bromide (2.5 μg/ml final concentration) in 15 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 200 mm sucrose, 3.7% formaldehyde followed by examination under UV microscopy. [35S]Methionine-labeled enhanced green fluorescent protein lamin A was prepared by coupledin vitro transcription/translation of pcDNA3. Enhanced green fluorescent protein green fluorescent protein (GFP)-lamin A (a gift from Dr. Bill Earnshaw, University of Edinburgh) using the TNT kit (Promega) and translation grade [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled enhanced green fluorescent protein lamin A was then included in the cell-free reactions as described above. [35S]Methionine-labeled enhanced green fluorescent protein lamin A breakdown was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. To explore the contributions of individual executioner caspases (caspases-3, -6, and -7) to the execution phase of apoptosis, we used a cell-free system based on post-nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells in which apoptosis can be triggered by addition of cytochrome cand dATP. We have previously shown that these cell extracts support a whole variety of apoptosis-associated changes including caspase activation, proteolysis of multiple caspase substrates, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and internucleosomal DNA cleavage (22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J.

Greenberg A.H. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2407-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Using cytochrome c/dATP as a pro-apoptotic stimulus, we previously defined the order of caspase activation events that occur in the cytochrome c/Apaf-1 pathway in these extracts (22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Thus, the impact of removal of specific caspases on downstream caspase activation events can be readily appreciated in this context (Fig. 1). Caspase-3, -6, or -7 were immuno-depleted from Jurkat cell extracts using specific antibodies coupled to protein A/G-agarose beads. As a control, we also mock-depleted the extracts with total mouse or rabbit IgG using similar procedures. Removal of specific caspases from the extracts was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 A). In some experiments, we also used extracts generated from human MCF-7 cells that are devoid of caspase-3 (Fig. 1 B) due to a frameshift in exon 3 that results in the introduction of a premature stop codon into the caspase-3 transcript (14Jänicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). As previously reported (22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar), depletion of caspase-3 abolished cytochrome c/dATP-inducible activation of caspase-2 and -6 in the extracts and also partially attenuated activation of caspase-7 (via a feedback loop involving caspase-9; Fig. 1 C). Depletion of caspase-7 failed to inhibit cytochrome c/dATP-inducible activation of any other caspase (Fig. 1 C). Depletion of caspase-6 also failed to inhibit activation of any other executioner caspase but did inhibit the late activation of caspase-8 and -10 in the extracts (Ref. 22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar; data not shown). Thus, caspase-3 plays an important role in propagating the caspase cascade in the cytochrome c/Apaf-1 pathway in addition to its proposed role as an effector caspase (Fig.1 D). We then explored the impact of caspase-3, -6, or -7 depletion on proteolysis of the caspase substrate proteins α-fodrin, PARP, gelsolin, and U1snRNP in this pathway (26Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 27Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol.

As illustrated in Fig.2, removal of caspase-6 and -7 from the extracts had no effect on cytochrome c/dATP-initiated breakdown of α-fodrin, PARP, gelsolin, or U1snRNP. In contrast, extracts depleted of caspase-3 were incapable of supporting proteolysis of the latter substrates, with the notable exception of PARP (Fig. 2). Proteolysis of α-fodrin to a 150-kDa breakdown product was detected in the absence of caspase-3; however, this cleavage product has previously been shown to be produced by calpain (30Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D. Hajimohammadreza I. Posner A. Allen H. Talanian R.V. Yuen P. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K. Biochem.

In contrast, the appearance of the 120-kDa cleavage product of α-fodrin was completely blocked in the absence of caspase-3 but not in the absence of either caspase-6, or -7. The observation that PARP cleavage was unaffected by the removal of either caspase-3, -6, or -7 was surprising and suggested either that there is redundancy between the caspases with respect to PARP cleavage or that the most apical caspase in the cytochrome c/Apaf-1 caspase cascade (caspase-9) is responsible for this cleavage event. Clearly, redundancy was not detected with respect to cleavage of α-fodrin, gelsolin, or U1snRNP, despite the fact that caspase-2, -3, and -7 have apparently overlapping substrate specificities (32Thornberry N.A.

To explore the possibility of redundancy, we generated extracts devoid of all three caspases (-3, -6, -7) and compared these with extracts depleted of single caspases. Fig. 2 B shows that whereas extracts depleted of single caspases exhibited complete proteolysis of PARP as before, extracts depleted of all three caspases (-3, -6, and -7) failed to support proteolysis of this substrate. Because caspase-6 is not activated in the absence of caspase-3 (Fig. 1 C; Ref.22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S.

Thus, redundancy exists between the caspase-3 and -7 at the level of PARP proteolysis but not with respect to proteolysis of α-fodrin, gelsolin, or U1snRNP. To explore further the contributions of caspase-3, -6, and -7 to the execution phase of apoptosis, we extended our analysis to several more caspase substrates (34Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Fig. 3 shows that removal of caspase-6 or -7 failed to have any impact on cytochromec-initiated proteolysis of DFF45 (the inhibitory subunit of the caspase-activated DNase DFF40), retinoblastoma protein, vimentin, topoisomerase I, RIP, STAT1 or X-IAP. In contrast, removal of caspase-3 completely attenuated proteolysis of all of the latter substrates. The cleavage of X-IAP in this situation is interesting and suggests that this IAP may be cleaved to allow the caspase cascade to progress to completion. Interestingly, although calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV has been described as a caspase substrate (43McGinnis K.M. Whitton M.M Gnegy M.E. Wang K.K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19993-20000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), this protein was not cleaved in the extracts under any conditions. This suggests that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV may not be a true caspase substrate or may be targeted by caspases only in particular contexts (43McGinnis K.M. Whitton M.M Gnegy M.E. Wang K.K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19993-20000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As further confirmation of these data, cytochromec/dATP-initiated proteolysis of multiple caspase substrates was also completely inhibited in extracts generated from MCF-7 cells that are devoid of caspase-3 due to a mutation at the CASP-3locus (Fig. 3 B), despite the fact that caspase-7 is activated in these extracts under the same conditions (Refs. 22Slee E.A.

These proteins are more highly homologous within the amino-terminal half, which encompasses 5–6 degenerate KTKEGV repeats. Of these proteins, α-syn has the greatest sequence homology to β-syn. Furthermore, the expression and intracellular localization of α- and β-syn are very similar in that both proteins are predominantly expressed in neurons of the central nervous system and are concentrated at the presynaptic terminal (19Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 20Shibayama-Imazu T. Okahashi I. Omata K. Nakajo S. Ochiai H. Nakai Y. Hama T. Nakamura Y.

In contrast, γ-syn is predominantly expressed in neurons of the peripheral nervous system, although it is also found at low levels in brain but diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (23Buchman V.L.

To determine the reason for this difference, we compared the primary sequences of human α- and β-syn, and we recognized that a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids within the middle hydrophobic region of α-syn is lacking in β-syn and that there is a significant sequence divergence within the carboxyl-terminal region of these two proteins (Fig. 1). Deletion of amino acids 71–82 within the hydrophobic region abrogated the ability of human α-syn to polymerize, whereas the introduction of charged residues within the region significantly reduced the rate of filament formation. Conversely, substituting the carboxyl-terminal region of β-syn for that of α-syn did not affect polymerization. Proteolytic digestion of assembled α-syn as well as coassembly experiments with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the hydrophobic region further confirmed the key role of this region in fibrillogenesis. All synuclein cDNAs were subcloned into the NdeI andHindIII restriction sites of the bacterial expression vector pRK172, and the respective proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Bacterial pellets were resuspended in high-salt buffer (0.75 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors, heated to 100 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 70,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatants were applied onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and separated by size exclusion using high-salt buffer. The fractions were assayed for the presence of the synuclein proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. The proteins were concentrated using Centriprep-10 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, applied to a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were resolved on slab gels by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) in buffer containing 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, and 10% methanol. Membranes were blocked with a 1% solution of powdered skimmed milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with antibodies to α-syn and β-syn, followed by either goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, developed with Renaissance Enhanced Luminol Reagents (NEN Life Science Products, Inc.) and exposure onto X-Omat Blue XB-1 films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Native and hybrid synuclein proteins were assembled into filaments by incubation at 37 °C in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, with continuous shaking. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 20 min, and SDS sample buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 10% sucrose) was added to pellets and supernatants, which were heated to 100 °C for 15 min. Synuclein proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and quantified by densitometry. Assembled synuclein filaments were absorbed to 300-mesh carbon-coated copper grids, stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and visualized with a Joel (Peabody, MA) 1010 transmission electron microscope. Images were captured with a Hamamatsu (Bridgewater, MA) digital camera using AMT (Danvers, MA) software. For diameter determination, the width of 100–120 filaments was measured using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Del Mar, CA). Sixty μg of synuclein proteins in 30 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, were digested with 4.2 μg of proteinase K at 37 °C. At different time points, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer and heating to 100 °C for 10 min. Samples from each time point were resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Synuclein proteins prepared at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were analyzed by circular dichroism either immediately or after incubation at 37 °C for 2 days with constant shaking. Proteins were diluted 1:20 in distilled water and transferred to a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette, and the spectra between 190 and 260 nm were collected with a Aviv (Lakewood, NJ) 62DS spectrophotometer. The production and epitope mapping of anti-α-syn antibodies LB509, SNL-4, SNL-1, and Syn 208 and anti-β-syn antibody Syn 207 were reported previously (26Giasson B.I. Jakes R. Goedert M. Duda J.E.

The rabbit anti-α-syn antibody NAC-1 was raised to a synthetic polypeptide (amino acids 75–91 in human α-syn) conjugated to maleimide activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). The peptide VTGVTAVAQKTA corresponding to amino acids 71–82 in human α-syn (Fig.1) was synthesized and purified on reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography by the Biotechnology Resource Center at Yale University (New Haven, CT). The A76R and A76E α-syn DNAs were engineered by creating the respective nucleotide substitutions in the wild-type cDNA using complimentary sets of synthetic single-stranded DNA containing the mutant sequence (i.e. A76R primers, forward/reverse, ACGGGTGTGACAAGAGTAGCCCAGAAGACAGTG/CACTGTCTTCTGGGCTACTCTTGTCACACCCGT; and A76E primers, forward/reverse, ACGGGTGTGACAGAAGTAGCCCAGAAGACAGTG/CACTGTCTTCTGGGCTACTTCTGTCACACCCGT) and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The deletion of the nucleotide sequence coding for residues 71–82 in α-syn cDNA (Fig. 1) was created using the ExSite polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and oligonucleotides that specifically bind to the DNA sequence adjacent to the targeted deleted sequence (GAGGGAGCAGGGAGCATTGCAGC and CACTGCTCCTCCAACATTTGTCACTTG). The cDNA encoding the hybrid protein α/β-syn, which consist of amino acid residues 1–97 of α-syn and 87–134 of β-syn (Fig. 1), was created by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides that amplified the two separate cDNA fragments of α- and β-syn, respectively (α-syn, primer 1, CATATGGATGTATTCATGAAAGGAC; and primer 2, GAATTCCTCCTTTTTGACAAAGCCAGTGGCTG; β-syn, primer 3, TGTCAAAAAGGAGGAATTCCCTACTGATC; and primer 4, AGGGACAGAAGCTTGCTGCTGGTG). The inner oligonucleotides (primers 2 and 3) contain extended complimentary sequences that were used to unite both initial polymerase chain reaction products by subsequent polymerase chain reaction reactions with primers 1 and 4. The sequences of the constructs were verified using T7 primer and an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as a service provided by the Nucleic Acid/Protein Research Core Facility at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. To assess whether human β-syn is capable of self-assembly into filaments, we compared the ability of α- and β-syn to form filaments using previously established conditions for the assembly of α-syn (12Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Centrifugal sedimentation analysis and electron microscopy (EM) were used to determine the assembly of human α- and β-syn. Both proteins were found in the soluble fraction before incubation for assembly (Fig.2 A), but the majority of α-syn was present in the pelletable fraction after 2 days of incubation, whereas β-syn remained largely soluble (Figs. 2,B and C, and 3). EM analysis showed that human α-syn filaments were abundant within 2 days (Fig. 4 A), but no fibrils could be detected with β-syn after incubation to induce fibrilization (data not shown). β-Syn failed to assemble even after 9 days in vitro, as demonstrated by quantitative sedimentation analysis of β-syn (Fig. 3). Further extensive EM inspection of grids coated with β-syn incubated under assembly conditions for up to 6 weeks did not reveal the presence of filaments. Finally, circular dichroism studies demonstrated that both proteins had random coiled conformations before assembly, but only α-syn acquired a β-pleated sheet conformation during assembly conditions (Fig. 5,A and C).Figure 3Quantification of synuclein filament assembly as analyzed by centrifugal sedimentation.

A stretch of hydrophobic amino acids in the middle of α-syn is absent in β-syn (Fig. 1). Also, the carboxyl termini of the two proteins are relatively divergent compared with the amino termini. To ascertain the importance of the hydrophobic region and the carboxyl-terminal region in driving filament assembly, two types of recombinant synuclein protein were generated. First, amino acid residues 71–82 in human α-syn were deleted to generate a protein termed Δ71–82 (see Fig.1). Second, a hybrid comprising the first 97 amino acids of human α-syn and the last 48 amino acids of human β-syn was generated, termed α/β-syn (Fig. 1). Before assembly, both recombinant proteins were recovered mainly in the supernatant after centrifugal sedimentation (Fig. 2 A) and had a predominantly random coil conformation (Fig. 5, A and B). On incubation, the assembly rate of α/β-syn paralleled that of α-syn (Fig. 3), and it formed filaments of similar diameter and appearance (Fig. 4, compare A with B). The fibrillization of α/β-syn also was associated with a change into a β-pleated sheet conformation (Fig. 5 D). On the other hand, Δ71–82 did not assemble under similar assembly conditions, as monitored by sedimentation analysis (Figs. 2, B and C, and 3), and transmission EM did not reveal the presence of filaments even after prolonged incubation for up to 6 weeks (data not shown). Finally, the lack of assembly was paralleled by a lack of conformational change, as detected by circular dichroism (Fig. 5 D). The possibility that β-syn or Δ71–82 could either coassemble with α-syn or inhibit the assembly of α-syn was determined by coassembly experiments. Neither β-syn nor Δ71–82 had any impact on the assembly of α-syn, as assayed by sedimentation (Fig. 2, Dand E) and by EM (data not shown). Furthermore, neither protein coassembled with α-syn. Although α-syn can be separated from β-syn by SDS-PAGE because of its greater mobility, the identity of the bands was also confirmed by Western blotting with an antibody specific to human α-syn (LB509) and an antibody specific to β-syn (Syn 207). To further confirm the importance of this hydrophobic region in fibrillogenesis, a single residue in the middle of this region, Ala-76, was substituted with either a positive (arginine) or a negative (glutamic acid) charge residue. Before assembly, the A76R and A76E mutations in recombinant α-syn proteins did not alter the normal random coil conformation of human α-syn in solution (Fig.5 B), and both recombinant proteins were in the soluble fraction when analyzed by centrifugal sedimentation (data not shown). The A76R mutation reduced the rate of filament formation when compared with wild-type α-syn at 2 days after assembly, but by 4 days the majority of the A76R protein was assembled (Figs. 2 F and 3). Fibrils comprising A76R α-syn (Fig. 4 C) were similar to those assembled of the wild-type protein (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, the A76E mutation had a much greater impact on the rate of filament assembly. Even after 4 days of incubation, the mutant protein was predominantly found in the soluble fraction after sedimentation analysis (Figs. 2 F and 3), and only very rare and short fibrils were observed by EM (data not shown). However, after 9 days of assembly, the A76E α-syn protein eventually polymerized into fibrils that were morphologically indistinguishable from those generated from the wild-type protein (Fig. 4, compare A with D). The presence of either the A76R or A76E mutant in coassembly experiments did not seem to inhibit the assembly of wild-type protein, as assayed by sedimentation (Fig. 2 F), and observation by EM of grids coated with samples of both proteins coincubated for assembly (data not shown). Digestion of α-syn fibrils with proteinase K was used to identify regions that are probably buried within and therefore are core elements of these filaments. Digestion of unassembled human α-syn resulted in the rapid proteolysis of the protein within 30 min (Fig.6 A). Conversely, several lowerM r fragments, resistant to proteolysis, were detected when assembled α-syn filaments were treated with proteinase K for 0.5 h (Fig. 6 B). The acquired resistance to proteinase K was specific to assembled α-syn filaments, because two other proteins that are assembly incompetent, β-syn and Δ 71–82, were completely digested even after assembly incubation (Fig.6 C). To identify the proteolytic resistant polypeptides, Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies with defined epitopes throughout the α-syn molecule (Fig. 6, D andE), and the approximate sequences of the three major polypeptides, designated F1–F3, were deduced on the basis of their immunoreactivity with the different antibodies and their apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 6, D andE). All three peptides contain amino acid residues 71–82 within the middle hydrophobic region of α-syn. To further assess the importance of amino acids 71–82 in human α-syn for fibrillization, we asked whether synthetic peptides corresponding to this sequence self-assemble into fibrils. Fig. 4 E shows that peptide 71–82 polymerizes into filaments, but these filaments are much straighter than those assembled from the full-length α-syn (Fig. 4, compare A with E). However, when full-length α-syn was assembled in the presence of peptide 71–82, only the more serginous fibrils, typical of full-length α-syn, were observed, suggesting that this peptide was incorporated into the same fibrils as full-length α-syn (Fig. 4 F). On a molar basis, peptide 71–82 is less efficiently assembled than full-length α-syn; nevertheless, its ability to self-assemble can also be observed by light scattering (Fig. 7 A). Finally, the addition of peptide 71–82 was found to enhance the assembly of full-length α-syn. After a 48-h incubation period, with less vigorous agitation to reduce the rate of assembly, the majority of α-syn when assembled alone was recovered in the supernatant, whereas in the presence of peptide 71–82, α-syn was found primarily in the pellet after sedimentation analysis (Fig. 7). Our study used a number of different assays to show that amino acid residues 71–82 within the middle of the hydrophobic domain of α-syn are necessary and sufficient for α-syn to polymerize into filaments. The importance of residues 71–82 for filament formation was realized when we found that human α-syn demonstrates an intrinsic ability to assemble into filaments, whereas human β-syn cannot polymerize into filaments even after prolonged (6 weeks) exposure to assembly conditions. These results are consistent with a recent report (28Biere, A. L., Wood, S. J., Wypych, J., Steavenson, S., Jiang, Y., Anafi, D., Jacobsen, F. W., Jarosinski, M. A., Wu, G. M., Louis, J.-C., Martin, F., Narhi, L. O., and Citron, M.J. Biol. Chem. 275,34574–34579Google Scholar). However, it cannot be completely excluded that β-syn would never form filaments under any circumstances, because another study suggested that a small number of β-syn filaments were observed after 5 weeks of incubation (29Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Although we did observe a slight increase in the amount of pelletable β-syn after prolonged incubation (Fig.3), we attributed this to nonspecific aggregation because of the lack of visible filaments by EM. Taken together, these findings indicate that β-syn is far less prone to polymerize into fibrils relative to α-syn. We sought to explain the dramatic difference in assembly properties of human α- and β-syn by comparing their sequences, which revealed two major differences: 1) β-syn lacks a hydrophobic amino acid stretch found near the middle region of α-syn; and 2) the carboxyl termini of α- and β-syn are significantly divergent. The ability of a hybrid protein containing the amino terminus of α-syn and the carboxyl terminus of β-syn to assemble into filaments demonstrates that differences within the carboxyl-terminal region of α- and β-syn do not account for the paucity of filament formation by β-syn. Conversely, a 12-amino acid deletion of the middle hydrophobic region within α-syn (Δ71–82) obliterated polymerization. The importance of the hydrophobic region is further supported by the inhibitory influences of the substitution of a single uncharged amino acid to a charged residue (either Glu or Arg). The introduction of either of these single substitutions did not completely inhibit assembly, but it did slow down the rate of filament assembly, especially the A76E mutation. Thus, these results demonstrate that the introduction of a single charged residue is not sufficient to disrupt the hydrophobic intermolecular interactions driving filament formation. Protection of unassembled and assembled α-syn from proteinase K digestion was used to screen for segments of the protein buried in the core, because they are likely to be involved in filament assembly. Three predominant proteolytic resistant fragments (F1–F3) were observed. These fragments mapped to the middle hydrophobic region and contained amino acids 61–95, which has also been termed the nonamyloid component (NAC) of Aβ amyloid plaques (30Uéda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A.C. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). The NAC peptide was initially purified from SDS-insoluble fractions enriched in amyloid cores from Alzheimer's disease brains, and it was thought to be the second most abundant component of plaques after β-amyloid. Whether this peptide is actually an intrinsic component of amyloid plaques is still a matter of contention (30Uéda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A.C. Kondo J.

Beyreuther K. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 266: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It may have been purified as a contaminant of amyloid cores, since almost all brains from Alzheimer's disease patients contain variable amounts of aggregated α-syn in LBs and in Lewy neurites. The proteolytic resistance of this region within fibrillar α-syn shown in our study may explain why the NAC peptide was selectively recovered with amyloid cores, since both NAC and Aβ may be resilient to proteolysis by endogenous proteases during purification or to the protease that was used in the final stage of purification. To further confirm the role of the hydrophobic region in the polymerization of α-syn, a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 71–82 in human α-syn was assayed for its ability to generate filaments and to coassemble with full-length α-syn. Peptide 71–82 readily self-assembled under the same conditions used for α-syn, and it further promoted the assembly of α-syn. Consistent with these results and the notion that the hydrophobic region is essential for assembly, it was reported that a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1–18 in NAC (i.e. 61–78 in α-syn) can also form filaments, but not a peptide corresponding to amino acids 19–35 in NAC (i.e. 79–95 in α-syn; Ref. 34El-Agnaf O.M.A. Jakes R. Curran M.D. Middleton D. Ingenito R. Bianchi E. Pessi A. Neill D. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a carboxyl-terminal α-syn truncation mutant (1–89) not only formed filaments, it actually assembled faster than full-length α-syn (29Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies raise the possibility that aberrant proteolysis of α-syn and the accumulation of a polypeptide constituting the hydrophobic region may act together as a nidus for the formation of large inclusions. Indeed, LBs isolated from dementia with LB brains contain truncated α-syn fragments (1Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar). The inefficiency of β-syn to form filaments likely explains the paucity of β-syn within pathological lesions defined by α-syn immunoreactivity. The only exception is a recent study (35Galvin J.E. Uryu K. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13450-13455Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) in which an accumulation of both α- and β-syn was observed in mossy fibers terminals that synapse on hilar neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease or dementia with LB. However, this pathology is different from other α-syn lesions, because it is not defined by the presence of abundant fibrils as seen in LBs and glial cytoplasmic inclusions. The accumulation of α- and β-syn in synaptic terminals is likely attributable to the degeneration of presynaptic terminals independent of α-syn fibrillogenesis, a notion that is consistent with the accumulation of other synaptic proteins such as synaptophysin, synapsin, and synaptobrevin (35Galvin J.E. Uryu K. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13450-13455Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of the protein motifs required in the fibrillogenesis and subsequent formation of pathological inclusions is critical to plan potentially effective therapeutic strategies targeted at reducing the formation of pathological α-syn aggregation. Candidates for such therapy may include small molecules that could interfere with the assembly process by binding to the hydrophobic region. However, as demonstrated by the peptide corresponding to amino acids 71–82 in human α-syn, such treatments could produce an effect opposite to that desired by increasing aggregation. Pharmacological agents that could prevent α-syn from converting into a β-pleated sheet conformation may be effective. Indeed, this structural alteration is associated with filament formation in vitro, and pathologically aggregated α-syn is also likely to be in a β-sheet conformation, as suggested by the staining of pathological lesions with thioflavin S (36Duda J.E. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Further refinement of in vitro assembly systems and the development of in vivo models are key to developing and testing putative therapies for diseases characterized by filamentous α-syn inclusions.

Mammalian TLRs have multiple leucine-rich repeats in the ectodomain and an intracellular Toll-IL1 receptor domain that mediates a signaling cascade to the nucleus (1Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J.

An important class of these molecules is termed disease-resistant (R) proteins, and members include both membrane-bound and cytosolic proteins. These are essential for the defense against multiple pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and viruses (8Dixon M.S. Golstein C. Thomas C.M. van Der Biezen E.A. Jones J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cytosolic type of R proteins, which include the tobacco N gene product and up to 200 gene products inArabinopsis thaliana, are comprised of an N-terminal Toll-IL1 receptor or leucine zipper effector domain, a centrally located nucleotide binding domain (NBD), and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). The LRRs of cytosolic R proteins are highly diverse and appear to be involved in the recognition of a wide array of microbial components (8Dixon M.S. Golstein C. Thomas C.M. van Der Biezen E.A.

To construct the expression plasmid producing C-terminally HA-tagged mature IL1β, pcDNA3-mIL1β-HA, the mature region of mouse IL1β, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pcDNA3-HA-pro, which contains the signal sequence of protrypsin and the HA tag. HEK293T cells were transfected, and NF-κB activation assays were performed as described (15Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Nuñez G. J. Biol.

For Fig. 3 A, S100 lysate containing 5 mg of protein was incubated with 300 ng of [3H]LPS (1 × 105 Bq, 347 Bq/ng; List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) from Escherichia coli K12 LCD25, 6 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose, and 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. Proteins bound to the matrix were washed 5 times with 1 ml of Buffer A. The bound radioactivity was measured using a Beckman LS5000LD liquid scintillation counter. For Fig. 3 B, proteins were immunopurified first from 20 mg of S100 lysate as described above and then incubated with 300 ng of [3H]LPS in the presence of 10 mg of bovine serum albumin Fraction V (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. After 5 washes with 1 ml of Buffer A, the bound radioactivity was measured. To monitor protein expression, proteins in 50 μg of S100 lysate were detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG Ab. To study a role of Nod1 in the cellular response to microbial components, HEK293T cells were transiently cotransfected with a Nod1 expression plasmid or control plasmid and an NF-κB reporter construct in the presence of bacterial or fungal products. No significant induction of reporter gene activity was observed when the cells transfected with control plasmid were exposed to LPS, PGN, LTA, sBLP, or mannan (Fig. 1 A). These results are in agreement with previous observations in HEK293 cells (3Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J.

LPS, but not the other microbial products tested, induced significant NF-κB activation (about 12-fold) in cells expressing trace amounts of Nod1 (Fig. 1 A). To demonstrate that NF-κB activation by LPS is specific for cells expressing Nod1, HEK293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids producing IL1R and its ligand IL1β or RIP, a mediator of the TNFα signaling pathway (18Huang J. Gao X. Li S. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12829-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). As expected, stimulation of the IL1R and expression of RIP induced NF-κB activation in the absence of LPS (Fig. 1 B). Significantly, LPS did not enhance NF-κB activation induced by IL1R stimulation or RIP (Fig. 1 B). Plant disease-resistant proteins have C-terminal LRRs that are critical for pathogen-specific responses (8Dixon M.S. Golstein C. Thomas C.M. van Der Biezen E.A. Jones J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8807-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Alterations in their LRRs result in unresponsiveness to particular pathogens (8Dixon M.S. Golstein C. Thomas C.M. van Der Biezen E.A. Jones J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8807-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that the LRRs of Nod1 might be also required for the response to LPS. To test this hypothesis, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing wild-type or truncated Nod1 mutant lacking the LRRs (Nod1ΔLRR) and treated with LPS. Expression of Nod1ΔLRR induced higher NF-κB activation than wild-type Nod1 in the absence of LPS, as previously reported (11Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Significantly, LPS did not enhance NF-κB activation induced by Nod1ΔLRR (Fig.2). Thus, the LRRs are essential for Nod1 to respond to LPS. Several studies have provided conclusive evidence that TLR4 is a cell surface receptor for LPS (1Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 785-787Crossref Scopus (2632) Google Scholar, 4Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B.

Immunity. 1999; 4: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that expression of Nod1 confers LPS responsiveness through TLR4. To test this possibility, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with a TLR4 expression plasmid, and NF-κB activity was measured in the presence and absence of LPS. Expression of TLR4 alone did not induce NF-κB activation in the presence of LPS, which is consistent with recent reports that additional cell surface molecules such as MD2 and CD14 are required for TLR4-mediated LPS responses in cells (6Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar, 21Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 4: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). In accord with the latter, cotransfection of TLR4, CD14, and MD2 expression plasmids induced 8-fold activation of NF-κB (see legend for Fig.1 C). To further verify that Nod1 confers LPS responsiveness independently of TLRs, a dominant negative mutant of MyD88, a common signaling molecule of IL1, and Toll-related receptors including TLR4 were coexpressed with Nod1 or TLR4, CD14, and MD2 as a control, and transfected cells were stimulated with LPS. Coexpression of the MyD88 mutant suppressed NF-κB activation induced by both TLR4 and IL1R stimulation, but it did not affect LPS-mediated NF-κB activation induced by Nod1 (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative mutant of TRAF6, a signaling molecule of TLR signaling pathways (22Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M.J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar), did not block NF-κB activation induced by Nod1 but inhibited TLR4-mediated NF-κB activation (11Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L.

These results indicate that NF-κB activation in Nod1-expressing cells induced by LPS is not mediated by the TLR4 signaling pathway. Consistent with this notion are recent observations showing that the Nod1 signaling pathway leading to NF-κB activation is distinct to that of TLRs. Nod1 activates NF-κB through its association with RICK, a protein kinase that directly interacts with IKKγ/NEMO, the regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase complex (15Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). LPS from different Gram-negative bacteria have diverse structures (23Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Holst O. Brade L. Müller-Loennies S. Mamat U. Zähringer U. Beckmann F. Seydel U. Brandenburg K. Ulmer A.J. Mattern T. Heine H. Schletter S. Hauschildt S. Loppnew H. Schönbeck U. Flad H.-D. Schade U.F. DiPadova F. Kusumoto S. Schumann R.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 216: 39-81Google Scholar). To determine whether Nod1 confers responsiveness to LPS from several bacterial sources, Nod1-expressing cells were stimulated with LPS from six pathogenic bacteria or TNFα as a positive control. All LPS preparations induced NF-κB activation in Nod1-expressing cells, but different sources of LPS differed in their ability to enhance Nod1-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 2). As it was found with LPS from E. coli 055:B5 (Fig. 1 B), none of the LPS preparations induced significant NF-κB activation in cells expressing a Nod1 mutant lacking the LRRs (Fig. 2). Plants have numerous disease-resistant R genes, and mammalian, as well as insect, cells have multiple TLR family members to respond to different pathogens (8Dixon M.S. Golstein C. Thomas C.M. van Der Biezen E.A. Jones J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8807-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Notably, we identified human Nod2, another Nod1-like protein that is homologous to Nod1 (34% amino acid identity) and is comprised of N-terminal caspase recruitment domains, NBD and LRRs.2 The presence of multiple Nod family members suggests that Nod1 and Nod2 may have different specificities for pathogen components. To test this, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing wild-type or mutant Nod2 lacking the LRRs. As it was observed with Nod1, all LPS preparations including those from invasive bacteria such as Salmonella and Shigellastimulated NF-κB activation in cells expressing wild-type Nod2 but not mutant Nod2 (Fig. 2). Notably, LPS from Sarratia marcescens and Salmonella typhimurium was more effective in inducing NF-κB activation in cells expressing Nod2 than Nod1 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, PGN preparation from S. aureusstimulated NF-κB activation in cells expressing Nod2 but not Nod1 (Fig. 2). The molecular basis for the differential response of Nod1 and Nod2 to both LPS and PGN is unclear. Further biochemical analyses and structure determination of the LPS moiety recognized by Nod1 and Nod2 are required to understand the differential response of Nod proteins to bacterial components. Apaf-1, a Nod1-like molecule that plays a central role in apoptosis, mediates responsiveness to cytochrome c leaked from mitochondria (9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 24Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Apaf-1 directly binds to cytochrome c(24Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). To determine whether Nod1 binds to LPS, S100 cell lysates were prepared from HEK293T cells expressing Nod1, and the ability of Nod1 to bind radiolabeled LPS was tested by a modified immunoprecipitation assay. LPS was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Nod1 but not with other FLAG-tagged control proteins (Fig.3 A). Thus, Nod1 is associated with an LPS binding activity present in the cytosolic fraction of HEK293T cells. However, it is possible that Nod1 does not directly bind to LPS and that the association requires other cytosolic factors. For example, dATP or ATP is required for the response of Apaf-1 to cytochrome c (24Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). To begin to test this, we first immunoprecipitated Nod1 or IKKβ, as a control protein, with anti-FLAG antibody, and the ability of the immunoprecipitated proteins to bind LPS was tested in nucleotide-free buffer. Immunopurified Nod1 exhibited LPS binding activity, but control IKKβ did not (Fig. 3). These results suggest that Nod1 directly binds LPS. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Nod1 interacts with LPS through an intrinsic cytosolic factor(s) that is tightly bound to Nod1 and coimmunoprecipitates with Nod1 in the absence of LPS. In plants, theA. thaliana disease-resistant RPS2 gene product that is structurally related to Nod1 and Nod2 can form a protein complexin vivo with the product of the phytopathogenic bacteriumPseudomonas syringae avrRpt2 gene, but the protein complex also contained at least one additional plant protein of ∼75 kDa (16Leister R.T. Katagiri F. Plant J. 2000; 22: 345-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, further studies are needed to determine whether the association of LPS with Nod1 is direct or mediated through a cytosolic Nod1-interacting protein. In this study, we demonstrate that LPS induces NF-κB activation in HEK293T cell expressing Nod1, whereas parental HEK293T cells are insensitive to LPS. In the human system, the TLR4·MD2·CD14 complex has been demonstrated to serve as a surface receptor for LPS (1Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 785-787Crossref Scopus (2632) Google Scholar). In addition to the cell surface TLR4 complex, there is mounting evidence that mammalian cells have an intracellular receptor that detects LPS in the cytoplasm of bacteria-infected cells (2Philpott D.J. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Sansonetti P.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For example, epithelial cells are unresponsive to extracellular LPS either purified or presented in the context of noninvasive Gram-negative strains (2Philpott D.J. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Sansonetti P.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Yet, LPS introduced inside of the epithelial cells activates NF-κB (2Philpott D.J. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Sansonetti P.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, to date, the identification of an intracellular recognition system for LPS and other microbial products remains elusive. Because Nod1 can confer responsiveness to LPS, we propose that Nod1 may act as an intracellular receptor for LPS. Nod1 function might be important in the intracellular response of epithelial cells against invading bacteria, as Nod1 is expressed in intestinal, lung, and nasal epithelial surfaces in the late mouse embryo (11Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The presence of an intracellular detection system for bacterial LPS would be expected in epithelial surfaces such as those of the gut that are highly exposed to bacteria and bacterial products. In such organs, triggering of an inflammatory response to bacterial products through surface receptors such as TLR4 would be detrimental to the organism. We also demonstrated that HEK293T cells expressing Nod2, another member of the Nod family, also responds to LPS, but Nod1 and Nod2 appear to have different preferences for LPS preparations from different bacteria. These observations suggest that in addition to TLRs, Nod family members may represent another innate immune system for the recognition of a wide array of pathogen products. For example, the genome of the plantA. thaliana contains ∼200 disease-resistant genes encoding intracellular NBD-LRR proteins related to Nod1 and Nod2 (8Dixon M.S. Golstein C. Thomas C.M. van Der Biezen E.A. Jones J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8807-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). BLAST searches of public data bases revealed that the human genome contains at least 20 Nod1-like genes. 3N. Inohara and G.

Subsequent characterization has shown that this protein is a potent cytokine that acts to induce proinflammatory responses in a wide variety of peripheral tissues (reviewed in Ref. 4Fossiez F. Banchereau J. Murray R. Van Kooten C. Garrone P. Lebecque S. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Recently, two new proteins were identified termed IL-17B and IL-17C that are clearly related to IL-17, establishing that there exists a family of IL-17-like molecules (5Li H. Chen J. Huang A. Stinson J. Heldens S. Foster J. Dowd P. Gurney A.L. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Initial characterization of these proteins suggests that they also are able to induce production of certain proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting that a proinflammatory response may be a common feature of this family of cytokines. Interestingly, they do not appear to be ligands for the IL-17 receptor, suggesting that there exists other molecules that serve as cognate receptors for these factors. Interest in this family of molecules has increased as it has become apparent that IL-17 may contribute to a number of important medical conditions.

Given the potential of IL-17-related molecules to occupy important roles in the control of immune function, there is interest in the identification of other members of this family and the receptors that direct the actions of these molecules through particular target cell populations. In this report we identify a novel member of this family and its receptor. IL-17E (DNA147531) and IL-17Rh1 (DNA115291) cDNA clones were isolated from a human cDNA library and sequenced in their entirety. Fc fusion proteins (immunoadhesins) were prepared by fusion of the entire open reading frames of IL-17B, -C, and E in frame with the Fc region of human IgG1 in the eukaryotic expression vector pRK5tkNEO and the baculovirus vector pHIF, a derivative of pVL1393 purchased from Pharmingen. Fusion proteins were transiently expressed in human 293 cells or Sf9 insect cells and purified over a protein A column. The extracellular domain of IL-17Rh1 was also expressed as a C-terminal 8×His tag fusion in baculovirus and purified by nickel affinity column. IL-17E was also expressed as a 8×His tag fusion in Escherichia coli and was purified and refolded. The identities of the purified proteins were verified by N-terminal sequence analysis. Western blot analysis of binding of IL-17E to IL-17Rh1 was performed essentially as described previously (17Xie M.H. Holcomb I. Deuel B. Dowd P. Huang A. Vagts A. Foster J. Liang J. Brush J. Gu Q.

For Northern blot analysis, multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed with a32P-labeled probe of random-primed IL-17Rh1 cDNA according to manufacturer's recommendations and exposed to Kodak X-omat (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 72 h. For quantitative PCR analysis (Taqman), total mRNA from human tissues (50 ng) was analyzed as recommended (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with primers based on the coding sequence of IL-17Rh1. Human 293 cells were transiently cotransfected with expression vectors for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and IL-17Rh1 or IL-17R as indicated. After 24 h, cells were incubated with Fc-tagged ligand as indicated, and binding was revealed with PE-conjugated anti-human Fc antibody. FACS curves show PE staining within the cotransfected GFP-positive cell population. Luciferase reporter assays were conducted essentially as described (19Gurney A.L. Marsters S.A. Huang R.M. Pitti R.M. Mark D.T. Baldwin D.T. Gray A.M. Dowd A.D. Brush A.D. Heldens A.D. Schow A.D. Goddard A.D. Wood W.I. Baker K.P. Godowski P.J. Ashkenazi A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 215-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293 or TK-10 cells (2 × 105) were transfected by Effectine (Qiagen) transfection with 0.5 μg of the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-ELAM.tk and 0.05 μg of the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid as internal transfection control as well as IL-17E expression plasmid (0.1 μg) and carrier plasmid pRK5D to maintain constant DNA between transfections. After 24 h cells were harvested and luciferase activity was assayed as recommended (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed according to manufacturer's instruction (R&D Systems). Analysis of human genomic DNA sequence information available in GenBankTM (accession number CNS01DTR) led us to the identification of a putative new member of the IL-17 family. A full-length cDNA was obtained that corresponded to this gene (Fig.1 A). The encoded protein is 177 amino acids and is 16–20% identical to IL-17, IL-17B, and IL-17C. We termed this new member of this expanding family IL-17E. The four members share greatest similarity in the C-terminal portion of the molecule with 20–30% amino acid identity and strict conservation of four cysteines. Additional cysteines that may be functionally conserved are present with differences in position. In contrast, there is little conservation apparent in the N-terminal 80 residues. IL-17E mRNA was not detected by Northern blot analysis. However, IL-17E was detected at very low levels in several tissues including brain, kidney, lung, prostate, testis, spinal cord, adrenal gland, and trachea by reverse transcription-PCR using primers designed to distinguish spliced mRNA from genomic DNA (Fig. 1 B). Previous work demonstrated that IL-17B and IL-17C do not bind IL-17R, suggesting that there likely exist additional receptors that serve as cognate pairs for members of this family of cytokines. To identify candidate receptors, expressed sequence tags were examined for sequences related to IL-17R. On the basis of one such group of expressed sequence tags, a cDNA was isolated that encoded a 502-amino acid single transmembrane protein that shares 26% amino acid identity to IL-17R. This molecule appears to be the same gene recently reported as a receptor for IL-17B (20Shi Y. Ullrich S.J. Zhang J. Connolly K. Grzegorzewski K.J. Barber M.C. Wang W. Wathen K. Hodge V. Fisher C.L. Olsen H. Ruben S.M. Knyazev I. Cho Y.H. Kao V. Wilkinson K.A. Carrell J.A. Ebner R. J. Biol.

In light of our data described below that this is also a receptor for IL-17E, we propose that this new receptor be termed IL-17Rh1, a flexible nomenclature to reflect the possibility of additional ligand-receptor relationships within this expanding receptor ligand family. Our cDNAs encoded a protein with a substantially longer C-terminal intracellular domain than that reported by Shi et al. (20Shi Y. Ullrich S.J. Zhang J. Connolly K. Grzegorzewski K.J. Barber M.C. Wang W. Wathen K. Hodge V. Fisher C.L. Olsen H. Ruben S.M. Knyazev I. Cho Y.H. Kao V. Wilkinson K.A. Carrell J.A. Ebner R. J. Biol.

Our sequence agrees with the sequence reported by Tian et al. (21Tian E. Sawyer J.R. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2098-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with one amino difference (a leucine versusphenylalanine polymorphism at position 468) and shows close homology across full-length of the encoded protein with the murine ortholog, suggesting that this is likely the bona fidesequence. IL-17Rh1 mRNA expression was examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 A) and quantitative PCR (Fig. 2 B). Highest levels of expression were observed in kidney with significant expression also observed in liver and other peripheral organs. To determine whether this new molecule serves as a receptor for members of the IL-17 family, binding studies were conducted. Human 293 kidney cells transfected with an expression vector for IL-17Rh1 bind IL-17E-fc fusion protein (immunoadhesin) but do not show significant binding of IL-17 (Fig. 3 A). IL-17E immunoadhesin binding to IL-17Rh1 expressing cells could be completely inhibited by competition with His epitope-tagged IL-17E (not shown). In comparison, cells transfected with expression vector for IL-17R bind IL-17 immunoadhesin but not IL-17E. To examine whether there was direct interaction with members of the IL-17 family, ligand binding studies were conducted with epitope-tagged extracellular domain of IL-17Rh1. We find that this new molecule exhibits robust binding of IL-17E-fc and weak binding to IL-17B-fc but does not bind IL-17-fc or IL-17C-fc (Fig.3 B). Reasoning that IL-17E may induce NF-κB activity as has been observed with IL-17, we examined whether IL-17E induced activation of a NF-κB-responsive luciferase reporter gene in two human renal cell carcinoma cell lines, 293 and TK-10. (Fig.4 A). Both of these cell lines were found to express endogenous IL-17Rh1 mRNA (not shown). Transfection of the expression vector for IL-17E markedly induced increased luciferase activity. The luciferase activity was induced in a dose-dependent manner and was of similar magnitude to that observed by overexpression of the TNF receptor superfamily member GITR previously shown to be a potent inducer of NF-κB activity (Fig.4 B) (19Gurney A.L. Marsters S.A. Huang R.M. Pitti R.M. Mark D.T. Baldwin D.T. Gray A.M. Dowd A.D. Brush A.D. Heldens A.D. Schow A.D. Goddard A.D. Wood W.I. Baker K.P. Godowski P.J. Ashkenazi A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 215-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). NF-κB is thought to mediate a proinflammatory signal suggesting that IL-17E may have proinflammatory action. To examine this possibility we examined production of IL-8, a proinflammatory chemokine previously found to be induced by IL-17. IL-17E induced activation of IL-8 production in TK-10 cells (Fig.5).Figure 5Effect of IL-17E on IL-8 production.Human TK-10 kidney-derived cell lines were incubated with the indicated concentrations of His-tagged IL-17E, and IL-8 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Shown is the level of IL-8 measured minus the level of IL-8 production observed in the absence of cytokine addition. The experiments were repeated several times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) IL-17Rh1 is the second receptor identified that binds to members of the IL-17 family. The IL-17 receptor family is quite unrelated to other known proteins. The proteins do not possess any recognizable protein structural domains. However, comparison of the two receptors does reveal conservation of many cysteines within the extracellular domain, suggesting that they share similar structure. There are conserved elements within the intracellular domain as well, suggesting that these receptors likely engage similar intracellular machinery. This is supported by the observation that like IL-17 IL-17E signals activation of NF-κB. The regions of conservation within the intracellular domain do not bear obvious similarity to two other receptor families known to activate NF-κB, the IL-1/Toll and TNF receptor families. Details of IL-17 signaling pathways have not yet been well established although numerous intracellular events have been reported including activation of STATs (22Subramaniam S.V. Cooper R.S. Adunyah S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), Raf-1 kinase (23Subramaniam S.V. Pearson L.L. Adunyah S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and several mitogen-activated protein kinases (9Shalom-Barak T. Quach J. Lotz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27467-27473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that IL-17 signaling is deficient in TRAF6-deficient cells strongly suggests that members of the TRAF family, known to be involved in both IL-1/Toll and TNF receptor signaling, are also involved in IL-17 receptor signaling (24Schwandner R. Yamaguchi K. Cao Z. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). IL-17E induces production of IL-8, a proinflammatory molecule that has also been observed to be induced by IL-17, suggesting that the biological activities of these two cytokines may be similar. The IL-17 receptor has a very broad expression pattern in contrast to the somewhat more restricted mRNA expression pattern of IL-17Rh1. If these molecules mediate generally analogous proinflammatory responses, a key consideration in understanding the function of the different members of the expanding IL-17 cytokine family will be the expression patterns and regulation of the cognate receptors. The observation that IL-17Rh1 may bind two distinct ligands has parallels in other receptor systems that activate NF-κB. Both the IL-1 family and the TNF receptor superfamily have numerous examples of promiscuous interactions between ligands and receptors (reviewed in Refs.25Idriss H.T. Naismith J.H. Microsc. Res.

The murine ortholog of this new receptor was identified at Evi27, a common site for retroviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid leukemias. The human IL-17Rh1 maps to 3p21, a region that has been noted to undergo deletion in a variety of cancers, notably renal cell carcinoma (29Alimov A. Kost-Alimova M. Liu J. Li C. Bergerheim U.

Seeger D. Hossfeld D.K. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 74: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A number of other cytokine and growth factor receptors have been implicated as oncogenes, reflecting the important roles these proteins play in control of cell growth and regulation of immune function. Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, an early onset progressive encephalopathy that may present with raised white cell counts or raised levels of interferon-α in the cerebrospinal fluid, also maps to this region (34Crow Y.J.

Although several scavenger receptor molecules, including class A scavenger receptors and CD36, have been identified as OxLDL receptors on macrophages, additional molecules on macrophages may also be involved in the recognition of OxLDL. From a cDNA library of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated THP-1 cells, we isolated a cDNA encoding a novel protein designated SR-PSOX (scavenger receptor that bindsphosphatidylserine and oxidized lipoprotein), which acts as a receptor for OxLDL. SR-PSOX was a type I membrane protein consisting of 254 amino acids, expression of which was shown on human and murine macrophages with a molecular mass of 30 kDa. SR-PSOX could specifically bind with high affinity, internalize, and degrade OxLDL. The recognition of OxLDL was blocked by polyinosinic acid and dextran sulfate but not by acetylated low density lipoprotein. Taken together, SR-PSOX is a novel class of molecule belonging to the scavenger receptor family, which may play important roles in pathophysiology including atherogenesis.

Studies with SR-A or CD36 knockout mice showed that disruption of SR-A or CD36 partially inhibits OxLDL uptake in macrophages and prevents atherosclerotic progression in hypercholesterolemic mice (6Suzuki H.

Furthermore, an additional scavenger receptor(s) may also be involved in OxLDL uptake by macrophages. In the current study, by expression cloning from a cDNA library of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated THP-1 cells, we isolated a cDNA encoding a novel class of scavenger receptor designated SR-PSOX (scavenger receptor that binds phosphatidylserine andoxidized lipoprotein) that can act as a receptor for OxLDL. THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages by treatment with 160 nm PMA for 3 days. Human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) were prepared from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by cultivation as adherent cells for 2 h or 10 days. A cDNA library was constructed in pME18S (10Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) by use of a Time Saver cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from poly(A)+ RNA of THP-1 cells treated with PMA and was transfected into COS-7 cells. Binding of the transfected COS-7 cells to phosphatidylserine (PS)-coated plates was performed as follows. PS (bovine brain sodium salt; Avanti Polar Lipids) in 1 ml/dish ice-cold methanol (8 μg/ml) was added to 60-mm nontreated dishes. The dishes (1 ml/dish) were kept at room temperature for 5 h to evaporate the methanol. Nonspecific binding was minimized by pre-blocking the plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% gelatin for 30 min at 37 °C, and the plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and 0.5% gelatin (Buffer A). Transfected COS cells (1 × 106 cells in 2 ml of Buffer A) were loaded on a PS-coated plate for 30 min to allow cells to adhere. The plates were washed three times with Buffer A. Episomal DNA was recovered from COS-7 cells adherent to PS-coated plates and was subjected to another round of transfection into COS-7 cells. After 5 rounds of transfection and selection, single clones of the plasmid DNA were isolated. We searched the EST data base for mouse and porcine homologues of human SR-PSOX and found EST clones encoding fragment cDNA of the mouse homologue (GenBankTM accession numbers AI019535 and AW261653) and the porcine homologue (GenBankTM accession numbersF23105 and AW347794). A mouse full-length cDNA of SR-PSOX was cloned by RT-PCR with total RNA isolated from mouse spleen and thymus using the forward primer, 5′-TCAGAATTCCCAACAAGCTCCGCAGAA-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-TCAGGATCCTGTAGGCGCTAGGGTCTTG-3′. A porcine homologue of SR-PSOX was cloned by PCR with a porcine fetal cDNA library using the forward primer, 5′-TCAGAATTCGAGGCCGCCGGGAGAAGATG-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-TCACTCGAGCTTTCATCCTTAGCTCAGGTG-3′. Human LDL, OxLDL, and acetylated LDL (AcLDL) were prepared as described previously (11Kume N. Arai H. Kawai C. Kita T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Labeling of OxLDL by 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′3′-tetra-metyllindocarbocyanin perchlorate (DiI) (Molecular Probes) (12Stephan Z.F. Yurachek E.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 325-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 125I was performed as described previously (13Sparrow C.P. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2599-2604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with DiI-labeled lipoproteins (5 μg/ml), with or without competitors for 2 h, and washed three times with the culture medium. DiI-labeled lipoproteins internalized into the cells were detected using fluorescence microscopy. Binding of125I-labeled lipoproteins to cells was measured as described previously (14Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Proteolytic degradation of125I-labeled lipoproteins by cells was carried out as described previously (15Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The amount of the degraded lipoprotein was shown as the difference in radioactivity obtained from125I-labeled lipoprotein-containing medium incubated with and without cells. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acid residues 181–200 and 235–254 of human SR-PSOX and the amino acid residues 171–190 and 227–246 of murine SR-PSOX were conjugated to imject maleimide-activated mcKLH (Pierce). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against human or murine SR-PSOX was raised by immunization with each of the conjugates according to the manufacturer's instructions. We observed that PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells, but not unstimulated THP-1 cells, were bound to PS-coated plastic plates, and the binding was completely inhibited by OxLDL but not significantly by AcLDL (data not shown), suggesting that OxLDL and PS may share the same epitopes of macrophage OxLDL receptors. Therefore, to isolate cDNA for the receptor(s) on PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells, a cDNA library of the PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells was transfected into COS-7 cells, and episomal DNA was recovered from the cells bound to PS-coated plates. Finally, COS-7 cells transfected with a single clone, pSR-PS, showed prominent binding activity to PS-coated plates. Because the propagation of plasmid DNA in COS cells may cause the mutation or rearrangement of cDNA (16Calos M.P. Lebkowski J.S. Botchan M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3015-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we searched the EST data base and found that an EST clone (GenBankTMaccession number AA290712) encoded an essentially similar cDNA to SR-PS. We designated the EST clone in the expression vector as phSR-PSOX. Comparison of SR-PS and hSR-PSOX showed that Ala181 of hSR-PSOX was replaced by Val. hSR-PSOX encodes a novel type I membrane protein of 254 amino acids, without any structural homology to other established proteins including approved receptors for PS and/or OxLDL (Fig. 1). We further isolated the cDNA clones encoding murine and porcine homologues of SR-PSOX. Murine and porcine SR-PSOX consisted of 246 and 250 amino acids with 44 and 51% identical amino acids to human SR-PSOX, respectively (Fig. 1). As expected, binding of human SR-PSOX-transfected COS cells to PS-coated plates was significantly inhibited by OxLDL (data not shown). Then, the uptake of DiI-OxLDL into SR-PSOX-introduced COS-7 cells was examined by fluorescence microscopy. COS-7 cells transfected human, murine, and porcine SR-PSOX (COS-hSR-PSOX, COS-mSR-PSOX, and COS-pSR-PSOX cells, respectively), but not control COS-7 cells, took up DiI-OxLDL, and the uptake was completely suppressed by polyinosinic acid (poly I), dextran sulfate, and excess amounts of unlabeled OxLDL but not by AcLDL, native LDL, polycytidylic acid, or chondroitin sulfate (Fig. 2 and data not shown). We also examined the binding and proteolytic degradation of 125I-OxLDL in COS-hSR-PSOX cells. COS-hSR-PSOX cells were shown to bind125I-OxLDL, which was inhibited by excess amounts of unlabeled OxLDL but not by AcLDL or native LDL (Fig. 3 A). Thus, SR-PSOX was shown to be an OxLDL-specific receptor.Figure 3Binding and proteolytic degradation of125I-labeled OxLDL in COS-7 cells expressing human SR-PSOX. A, COS-hSR-PSOX cells were incubated with125I-OxLDL (5 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of unlabeled OxLDL, native LDL, or AcLDL (500 μg/ml), and the cell-bound radioactivities were measured. Values represent the means of duplicate experiments. B, COS-hSR-PSOX cells were incubated with indicated amounts of125I-OxLDL (1–16 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. Values of specifically bound radioactivities to COS-hSR-PSOX cells or control COS-7 cells were obtained by subtraction of the cell-bound radioactivities in the presence of 20-fold excess of unlabeled OxLDL from those in the absence of unlabeled OxLDL. Mean values of triplicate experiments are shown, and the standard deviations were less than 5% of the mean values. Inset shows the Scatchard analysis of the hSR-PSOX-specific binding calculated by subtracting the values for125I-OxLDL binding to control COS-7 cells from those to COS-hSR-PSOX cells (r = −0.902). C, COS-hSR-PSOX cells were incubated with 125I-OxLDL (5 μg/ml) for 6 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of unlabeled OxLDL, native LDL, or AcLDL (500 μg/ml), and the radioactivities of OxLDL degraded and accumulated in cell-conditioned medium were measured.

Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). COS-hSR-PSOX cells were shown to proteolytically degrade125I-OxLDL, which was blocked by excess amounts of unlabeled OxLDL but not by unlabeled AcLDL or native LDL (Fig. 3 C). The amounts of bound and degraded125I-OxLDL in COS-hSR-PSOX cells appeared to be comparable with those in CHO cells stably transfected with SR-A (CHO-SR-A cells; data not shown). In addition, the AcLDL used in the present study was shown to similarly inhibit uptake of DiI-OxLDL in CHO-SR-A (data not shown) as described previously (17Moriwaki H. Kume N. Sawamura T. Aoyama T. Hoshikawa H. Ochi H. Nishi E. Masaki T. Kita T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that SR-PSOX is a specific receptor for OxLDL, whereas neither AcLDL nor native LDL is a ligand for SR-PSOX with high affinity. To analyze SR-PSOX at the protein level, we developed polyclonal antibodies directed against human and murine SR-PSOX. Immunoblotting with these anti-human and anti-murine SR-PSOX antibodies revealed that SR-PSOX expressed in COS-hSR-PSOX cells, PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells, HMDM, COS-mSR-PSOX cells, and murine thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. The molecular masses of both human and murine SR-PSOX expressed in the cDNA-transfected COS-7 cells were 27 and 30 kDa, whereas we observed only 30-kDa forms in human and mouse macrophages (Fig. 4). The expression level of human SR-PSOX on HMDM pre-cultured for 10 days, which are differentiated macrophages, is higher than that on HMDM pre-cultured for only 2 h, which can be considered to be premature macrophages. Immunoblotting with antibodies against other amino acid residues of human and murine SR-PSOX showed similar findings (data not shown). Northern blot analysis also showed that PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells and the 2 h-cultured HMDM produced only 2.5-kb mRNA for SR-PSOX, and the 10 day-cultured HMDM produced higher amounts of mRNA for SR-PSOX with both 1.8 and 2.5 kb (Fig. 5,A and B). Thus, Western blot analysis and Northern blot analysis suggest that expression of SR-PSOX was induced in monocytes during differentiation into macrophages. To explore SR-PSOX expression in vivo, we carried out Northern blot analysis with mRNA isolated from various human organs. As shown in Fig. 5 C, SR-PSOX was expressed mainly as 2.5-kb mRNA in liver, lung, peripheral blood leukocytes, prostate, heart, kidney, and pancreas and mainly as 1.8-kb mRNA in spleen, thymus, and testis. SR-PSOX was shown to be expressed in various organs except for brain, skeletal muscle, or colon. We have successfully isolated a cDNA clone encoding a novel scavenger receptor on macrophages designated SR-PSOX, which specifically bind to OxLDL. We also identified murine and porcine homologues of SR-PSOX, which specifically bind and internalize OxLDL, suggesting SR-PSOX plays a significant role in not only humans but also other mammals. Uptake of OxLDL by macrophages accumulated in the arterial intima appears to play a key role in foam cell transformation and subsequent atherosclerotic progression (1Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J.

Other cell surface molecules belonging to the scavenger receptor family such as SR-A (3Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M.

Macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions have been shown to express SR-A, CD36, and LOX-1 (18Yla-Herttuala S. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Sigal E. Sarkioja T. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin.

Hashimoto N. Kita T. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Double knockout mice of SR-A and apolipoprotein E, and those of CD36 and apolipoprotein E, showed less atherosclerotic lesions when compared with apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, suggesting the involvement of SR-A and CD36 in atherogenesis (6Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Aburatani H. Doi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma S.

Sharma K. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Although the role of other scavenger receptors, including SR-PSOX, in atherogenesis remains to be clarified, it is suggested that uptake of OxLDL by SR-PSOX may be pathophysiologically relevant, because the ability of SR-PSOX-transfected COS cells to bind and take up OxLDL is comparable with that of CHO cells stably expressing SR-A. Further studies are in progress to elucidate the expression of SR-PSOX in atherosclerotic lesions and its pathophysiological relevance in vivo. Northern blot analysis in Fig. 5 C showed that SR-PSOX was expressed as 1.8- and 2.5-kb mRNA with different proportions in various organs. Almost 100 EST clones encoding human SR-PSOX showed essentially the same nucleotide sequence in the coding region, while showing different 3′-noncoding regions with different lengths. Therefore, the differences in the sizes of human SR-PSOX mRNA appears to result from the different lengths of 3′-noncoding regions. The present findings shown in Fig. 5 C suggested that SR-PSOX may be expressed mainly by macrophages, because most of SR-PSOX-positive organs contain significant numbers of macrophages except for peripheral blood leukocytes. Currently, we are examining whether freshly isolated human peripheral blood monocytes or other types of leukocytes express SR-PSOX. Human and murine SR-PSOX showed approximate molecular masses of 30 kDa, although the calculated molecular masses from the deduced amino acid sequences were 27 kDa. In fact, we observed both 27- and 30-kDa forms of human and murine SR-PSOX in the cDNA-transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 4, A and C). These differences may result from the addition of carbohydrate chains at potentialN-linked glycosylation sites and/or other unpredictable glycosylation sites, although we cannot exclude other possibilities such as degradation. In another class of the scavenger receptor LOX-1,N-glycosylation has been shown to affect its intracellular transport and binding affinity for OxLDL (21Kataoka H. Kume N. Miyamoto S. Minami M. Murase T. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Hashimoto N. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6573-6579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Currently, we are investigating whether the 27-kDa form of SR-PSOX in COS cells is in fact a precursor protein with less carbohydrate modification. SR-PSOX could recognize OxLDL but not AcLDL effectively (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Such ligand specificity of SR-PSOX is similar to that of LOX-1 (17Moriwaki H. Kume N. Sawamura T. Aoyama T. Hoshikawa H. Ochi H. Nishi E. Masaki T. Kita T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), although it is different from that of SR-A, which binds AcLDL, as well as OxLDL. Scavenger receptor family molecules have been shown to have a variety of ligands (5Steinbrecher U.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 279-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and it also remains to be determined whether SR-PSOX can act as a receptor for ligands other than OxLDL of scavenger receptor family molecules including PS on aged and apoptotic cells.

A long term overexpression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 waf-1 was observed in SIPS induced by H2O2 (10Chen Q.M. Bartholomew C.J. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem.

A long term hypophosphorylation of Rb over several weeks was indeed observed in SIPS induced by H2O2 or t-BHP, explaining the block of the cell cycle, through Rb-mediated inhibition of the E2F transcription factor (9Dumont P.

In different experimental models, an overexpression of either SM22 (11Owens G.K. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), apolipoprotein J (12Wegrowski Y. Perreau C. Martiny L. Haye B. Maquart F.X. Bellon G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), osteonectin (13Shiba H. Fujita T. Doi N. Nakamura S. Nakanishi K.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is induced by extracellular addition of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Moreover, incubation of HDFs with TGF-β1 triggers the appearance of a senescent-like morphology (15Garbi C. Colletta G. Cirafici A.M. Marchisio P.C. Nitsh L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 53: 281-289PubMed Google Scholar, 16Katakura Y. Nakata E. Miura T. Shirata S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. 1996; 7: 1335-1342Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Two main arguments favor the hypothesis that oxidative stress-induced premature senescence could be triggered by a pRb-mediated TGF-β1 overexpression. First, it has been shown that ATF-2 transcription factor-hypophosphorylated Rb complexes transactivate the TGF-β promoter (18Kim S.-J. Wagner S. Liu F. O'Reilly M.A. Robbins P.D. Green M. Nature. 1992; 358: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Second Rb remains hypophosphorylated at least for several weeks after H2O2-induced SIPS (10Chen Q.M. Bartholomew C.J. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Studies were performed with stable IMR-90 HDF transfectants expressing the E6 or E7 protein of the human papilloma virus 16, which namely, respectively, bind and facilitate the degradation of p53 and Rb. IMR-90 HDFs, whether wild types or expressing the E6 gene, developed a senescent morphology after subcytotoxic treatment under H2O2, while the cells expressing E7 gene did not. Furthermore, deletion of amino acids 21–24 as well as mutations at positions 24–26, which eliminated the binding of E7 to Rb (19Demers G.W. Espling E. Harry J.B. Etscheid B.G. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6862-6869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), brought back the senescent morphology after H2O2 stress (10Chen Q.M. Bartholomew C.J. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Taken together, these first experiments suggested that Rb is necessary in the induction of SIPS. These arguments led to the hypothesis that the E7-mediated disappearance of Rb makes impossible the formation of the ATF-2·Rb complexes, which in turn does not allow the stress-induced transcription of TGF-β1 and the subsequent overexpression of apolipoprotein J, osteonectin, fibronectin, and SM22 mRNA. The aim of this work was first to test the involvement of TGF-β1 in the appearance of SIPS as far as changes in morphology, SA β-gal, and mRNA level of these four genes are concerned. We tested whether these biomarkers appear after incubations of IMR-90 HDFs with TGF-β1. Then we tested whether TGF-β1 mediates the appearance of these biomarkers in SIPS. Furthermore, we tested whether stable IMR-90 HDF transfectants expressing the E7 or E6 viral protein would overexpress TGF-β1 after stress. Last, if the E7- or E6-mediated inhibition of the stress-induced overexpression of TGF-β1 took place, we wished to test whether E7 or E6 would inhibit the stress-induced overexpression of fibronectin, osteonectin, apolipoprotein J, and SM22. Fetal lung IMR-90 HDFs (European Cell Culture Collection, Strasbourg, France) were grown in MEM + 10% (v/v) of fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human skin FS AG04437B HDFs (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Basal Medium of Eagle + 10% (v/v) of fetal bovine serum. Confluent IMR-90 HDFs under 45–50% of in vitro proliferative lifespan were exposed for 2 h to 150 μm H2O2 diluted in MEM + 10% FBS. FS AG04437B HDFs were exposed to several concentrations of H2O2 diluted in Basal Medium of Eagle + 10% FBS. The cells were, respectively, rinsed with MEM or Basal Medium of Eagle and given respective fresh medium + 10% FBS. TGF-β1 (R & D Systems) was diluted in culture medium plus serum to stimulate IMR-90 HDFs for 72 h. TGF-β RII receptor of IMR-90 HDFs was neutralized using a specific antibody from R & D Systems (AF-241NA) diluted at 10 μg/ml of MEM + 10% FBS. The antibody against TGF-β1 (R & D Systems, MAB-240) was diluted at 3 μg/ml of MEM + 10% FBS. The medium containing the neutralization antibody was replaced every day for 3 days. The human papillomavirus type 16 E6 or E7 retrovirus producing cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Exponentially growing IMR-90 HDFs (CPD 16.8) were infected for 4 h with retroviruses carrying PLXSN vector without insert (termed control PLXSN vector) or carrying human papillomavirus E6 or E7 in 6 ml of MEM containing 10% FBS and 4 μg/ml polybrene. The volume of medium was doubled for overnight incubation followed by medium change. The HDFs expressing the E6 or E7 gene were selected by exposure to 500 μg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested and pelleted. Total RNA was extracted using a total RNA isolation kit (PharMingen). Semiquantitative RT-PCRs were achieved in the exponential linear zone of amplification for each gene studied in one step with the Access RT-PCR kit (Promega) in presence of [α-32P]dideoxycytosine (0.025 μCI per reaction). RT-PCRs were performed in the common exponential range of the PCR amplification using 50 and 100 ng of total RNA in 50 μl containing 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcripts and 5 units of Pfu polymerase. We used GAPDH mRNA level as reference. GAPDH mRNA level was checked to be stable in all experimental conditions tested (specific primers for GAPDH and each gene tested in TableI). RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and analyzed (Instant Imager, Packard Instrument Co.). The dried gels were exposed to β-max films (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Anvers, Belgium). Negative controls were performed without RNA. A PCR without reverse transcription was always performed on RNA, prior to reverse transcription, to check for DNA contamination. The sequences of the RT-PCR products were checked for amplification specificity. The results were expressed as mean value ± S.D. on three independent experiments.Table IPrimers used for RT-PCRGenesPositionsSequencesbpOsteonectin181–1995′-ctg tgg gag cta atc ctg-3′765–7835′-ggg tgc tgg tcc agc tgg-3′Fibronectin360–3785′-gat tgc ctg ttc tgc ttc-3′502–5205′-ttg ggt gac ttt cct act-3′Apolipoprotein J69–875′-cgg ggt gaa aca gat aaa g-3′373–3915′-tgc ggt cac cat tca tcc a-3′SM22249–2675′-tgg cgt gat tct gag caa-3′470–4885′-ctg cca agc tgc cca agg-3′GAPDH333–3535′-cgt ctt cac cat gga ga-3′612–6225′-cgg cca tca cgc cca cag ttt-3′TGF-β1Catalog number 01923–42 (Biognostik, Götingen, Germany) Open table in a new tab RNase protection assays were performed following the instruction of the multi-probe hCK-3 (catalog number 45033P, PharMingen). The antisense probes were synthesized with bacteriophages T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. The probe set was hybridized in excess to specific target mRNAs in solution. Free probes and single-stranded RNA were digested by RNases. The remaining protected RNA/probes were resolved in denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantified by Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). The results were expressed as percentages of the corresponding values found in the nonstressed IMR-90 HDFs transfected with the control PLXSN without insert. The results of RNase protection assays are given as mean value ± S.D. on three independent experiments. The proportion of HDFs positive for the SA β-gal activity was determined as described by Dimri et al. (20Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelly C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubeli I.

The cells were plated at a low density and fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. The presence of the SA β-gal activity was determined by incubation with 1 mg/ml of solution of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside in 0.04 m citric acid/sodium, 0.005 m K3FeCN6, 0.005m K4FeCN6, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.002 m MgCl2 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6). The cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and washed with methanol. The results were expressed as mean value ± S.D. on three independent experiments. The active TGF-β1 present in the culture medium was quantified using the TGF-β1 Emax ImmunoAssay System of Promega (Madison, WI). For each sample the quantification was made twice. The results were expressed as mean value ± S.D. on three independent experiments. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice with 700 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, 100 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After lysis, the material was homogenized several times through a 21-gauge needle and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Samples of 20 μg of protein were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred overnight on Immobilone-P membrane (Millipore). Rb was detected with anti-Rb (c-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody and thereafter with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. The bands were visualized after incubation with chemoluminescent substrates using ECL detection kit (RPN 2106, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Anvers, Belgium). IMR-90 HDFs were stimulated for 3 days with 1–10 ng/ml of human TGF-β1 diluted in culture medium + 10% FBS. The proportion of HDFs positive for the SA β-gal activity was determined in three independent experiments. A significant dose-dependent increase in the proportion of SA β-gal-positive HDFs was obtained, ranging from a 103 to a 160% increase, when the absolute value of 15% of SA β-gal-positive cells in controls cells was considered as 100%. In comparison, the proportion of SA β-gal-positive cells at 72 h after treatment with 150 μm H2O2 for 2 h reached an absolute value of 55% (Fig.1). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the mRNA level of four genes that undergo a senescence-related overexpression: fibronectin, apolipoprotein J, SM22, and osteonectin. After 72 h of stimulation with 1–10 ng/ml TGF-β1, the steady-state level of mRNA of the four genes was found to be increased when compared with nontreated cells. A dose-dependent overexpression was obtained for fibronectin, osteonectin, and SM22. Two transcripts of fibronectin were detected and displayed a dose-dependent overexpression, reaching a 2.15-fold increase at 10 ng/ml TGF-β1. SM22 overexpression was maximum at 10 ng/ml TGF-β1, with a 2.30-fold increase in mRNA level. Osteonectin was similarly overexpressed at the three TGF-β1 concentrations with an increase ranging from 1.48- to 1.70-fold. Apolipoprotein J was maximally overexpressed at 1 ng/ml TGF-β1, with a 1.90-fold increase and minimally overexpressed at 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Fig. 2). These data suggest that TGF-β1 triggers the appearance of SA β-gal in IMR-90 HDFs as well as the overexpression of at least four genes that show a senescence-related overexpression. The next step was to know whether TGF-β1 is overexpressed during the establishment of H2O2-induced premature senescence. At first, semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed on mRNA extracted at 72 h after 2-h exposures of IMR-90 HDFs to 150 μm H2O2. When compared with nontreated cells, a 1.8-fold increase in the mRNA level of TGF-β1 was obtained (Fig. 3). RNase protection assay showed that TGF-β2 was not overexpressed at 72 h after stress. TGF-β3 mRNA was not detected by RNase protection assay in any condition. RNase protection assay also confirmed TGF-β1 overexpression (not shown). Similar experiments were performed on FS AG04437B HDFs exposed to four H2O2 concentrations ranging from 150 to 300 μm. Higher H2O2 concentrations were used, since cytotoxicity curves showed that FS AG04437B HDFs are much more resistant to H2O2 (not shown). The amount of TGF-β1 mRNA at 72 h after stress raised from 130% at 150 μm H2O2 to 190% at 300 μm in H2O2 when compared with the 100% control values (not shown). A second set of semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed on IMR-90 HDFs mRNA extracted from independent cultures at various times after exposures to H2O2. The mRNA steady-state level of TGF-β1 decreased during the first 4 h after stress and increased up to 140% at 24 h. The level of mRNA returned to the basal level at 36 h after stress and increased again to 150% at 48 h. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect active TGF-β1 protein released in the culture medium during the 48 h following the stress. The level of TGF-β1 protein was also measured in non-H2O2-exposed control cells. At each time after the stress, the amount of active TGF-β1 released by the stressed cells was expressed as percentage of the amount released by the control cells. Surprisingly, the level of released TGF-β1 underwent a 7.5-fold increase from 24 to 36 h after the stress (Fig. 4). This increase disappeared from 36 to 48 h after the stress. Given these spectacular results, we wished to neutralized the TGF-β receptor II (TGF-β RII) and TGF-β1 to know whether this would influence the appearance of the biomarkers of stress-induced premature senescence. IMR-90 HDFs were stressed with 150 μm H2O2 for 2 h. They were incubated with culture medium + 10% FBS + antibodies against either TGF-β1 (TGF-β1-Ab) or TGF-β R II (TGF-β RII-Ab). New culture medium + 10% FBS + 10 μg/ml TGF-β RII-Ab or 3 μg/ml TGF-β1 Ab was provided to the cells for three successive days after the stress. The non-H2O2-exposed HDFs incubated with TGF-β1 RII-Ab or TGF-β1-Ab had a normal morphology. Senescent-like morphology was obtained at 72 h after H2O2treatment as shown previously (4Chen Q. Ames B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4130-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). No senescent-like morphology was obtained in the stressed HDFs incubated with anti-TGF-β II or TGF-β1-Abs for 3 days after the stress (Fig.5). We determined the percentage of HDFs positive for the SA β-gal activity in these different conditions. After incubation with TGF-β1- or TGF-β RII-Abs for 72 h, no significant modification of the percentage of SA β-gal-positive cells was observed in normal conditions when compared with control cells (no stress, no antibody). The cells incubated with anti-TGF-β1- or -TGF-β RII-Abs for 3 days after stress displayed a significantly decreased proportion of SA β-gal-positive cells in comparison with the H2O2-treated cells. Indeed, only a 2.40-fold and a 1.70-fold increase in the percentage of SA β-gal-positive cells was observed, respectively, in the HDFs incubated with anti-TGF-β RII- or anti-TGF-β1-Abs after stress, while a 4.40-fold increase was observed in the H2O2-treated HDFs, which were not incubated with one of these Abs (Fig. 6). Last, we compared the steady-state levels of mRNA of fibronectin, osteonectin, SM22, and apolipoprotein J. First, we confirmed that these steady-state levels were increased in replicative senescence and H2O2-induced premature senescence (not shown) as shown by Dumont et al. (9Dumont P. Burton M. Chen Q.M. Gonos E.S. Frippiat C. Mazarati J.-B. Eliaers F. Remacle J. Toussaint O. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). For all the genes tested, a much lower overexpression was observed when the H2O2-treated cells were incubated with TGF-β RII- or TGF-β1-Abs (Fig. 7,a and b). Since TGF-β1 mediates the appearance of several biomarkers of stress-induced premature senescence, we wished to have clues on the regulation of the stress-induced TGF-β1 overexpression. We exposed IMR-90 HDFs transfected with a retroviral PLXSN control vector, PLXSN + E6 cDNA or PLXSN + E7 cDNA, to 150 μm H2O2 for 2 h in three independent experiments. Total RNA was extracted at 72 h after the stress. At first, we have shown by Western blots (10Chen Q.M. Bartholomew C.J. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) that IMR-90 HDFs transfected with E6 or E7 cDNA have a very low respective level in p53 and Rb proteins. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed using GAPDH as reference gene, whose transcription level was checked to be stable in IMR-90 HDFs transfected by E6, E7, exposed to H2O2 or not (not shown). A 1.55-fold increase in TGF-β1 mRNA level was shown at 72 h after the stress in HDFs transfected with a retroviral PLXSN control vector, as shown herein in nontransfected HDFs exposed to H2O2. In normal conditions (no H2O2 treatment), the level of TGF-β1 mRNA raised by about 50% in IMR-90 HDFs transfected with E6 or E7. More interestingly, the TGF-β1 mRNA level of IMR-90 HDFs + E6 was much higher in H2O2-stressed cells when compared with nonstressed cells, while this level was not further increased in H2O2-stressed IMR-90 + E7 HDFs when compared with nonstressed IMR-90 + E7 HDFs (Fig.8). Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we measured the release of active TGF-β1 at increasing times after treatment of IMR-90 + E7 HDFs with H2O2. No increased release of TGF-β1 level was observed in IMR-90 + E7 HDFs and in IMR-90 + E6 HDFs treated with H2O2 (data not shown). These results suggest that p53 and Rb are necessary for the stress-induced increase in the release of TGF-β1. Moreover, Western blotting was carried out to analyze the phosphorylation status of Rb at 72 h after stress. Rb were found to be hypophosphorylated (Fig. 9), confirming the results obtained by Chen et al. (10Chen Q.M. Bartholomew C.J. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) after H2O2 and by Dumont et al. (2000) after tert-butylhydroperoxide stress (9Dumont P. Burton M. Chen Q.M. Gonos E.S. Frippiat C. Mazarati J.-B. Eliaers F. Remacle J. Toussaint O. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Rb must be hypophosphorylated to interact with ATF-2 and transactivate the TGF-β promoter. Therefore our results suggest that hypophosphorylated Rb protein mediates the stress-induced overexpression of TGF-β1. Further experiments are being performed to confirm the role of Rb in this overexpression. According to the hypothesis mentioned in the introduction, an E7-mediated inhibition of the stress-induced overexpression of TGF-β1 should lead to an inhibition of the stress-induced overexpression of fibronectin, osteonectin, apolipoprotein J, and SM22. We performed semiquantitative RT-PCR to evaluate the mRNA level of these four genes. We exposed normal IMR-90 HDFs, IMR-90 + control PLXSN vector, IMR-90 + E6 HDFs, and IMR-90 + E7 HDFs to 150 μmH2O2 for 2 h and extracted total RNA at 72 h after the stress. The results of the quantifications were expressed as percentages of the value recorded for the nonstressed IMR-90 HDFs + control PLXSN vector. Similar results were obtained for normal IMR-90 HDFs transfected or not with control PLXSN vector. We confirmed that all four genes were overexpressed at 72 h after H2O2 stress in IMR-90 cells as shown previously (9Dumont P. Burton M. Chen Q.M. Gonos E.S. Frippiat C. Mazarati J.-B. Eliaers F. Remacle J. Toussaint O. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The stress-induced overexpression of osteonectin and apolipoprotein J observed in the normal HDFs disappeared in IMR-90 + E7 HDFs. The stress-induced overexpression of SM22 was highly decreased, by more than 60%, in H2O2-treated IMR-90 + E7 HDFs when compared with the H2O2-treated IMR-90 HDFs transfected or not with control PLXSN vector. In IMR-90 + E7 HDFs, a 2-fold reduction in fibronectin mRNA level was found in the nontreated cells. No stress-induced overexpression of fibronectin was found in these cells (Fig. 10 a and b). When IMR-90 + E6 cells were stressed with H2O2, the overexpression of osteonectin disappeared. E6 caused a marked down-regulation of the mRNA of fibronectin in nonstressful conditions. These data show that E7 regulates the stress-induced expression of all four genes studied. These results suggest that Rb is involved in the regulation of the stress-induced and TGF-β1-mediated overexpression of these genes. As explained in the introduction, Rb is also necessary for the morphological changes observed in H2O2-induced SIPS (10Chen Q.M. Bartholomew C.J. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Work in progress is aimed at confirming this involvement of Rb. The concept of SIPS is widely accepted (1Brack C. Lithgow G. Osiewacz H. Toussaint O. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1929-1934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms responsible for its occurrence remain poorly understood. Many biomarkers of replicative senescence have been shown to be induced in SIPS (9Dumont P. Burton M. Chen Q.M. Gonos E.S. Frippiat C. Mazarati J.-B. Eliaers F. Remacle J. Toussaint O. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A typical morphology, senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and overexpression of fibronectin, osteonectin, SM22, and apolipoprotein J are among these biomarkers. Several observations were in favor of the involvement of TGF-β1 in SIPS. First, Rb becomes hypophosphorylated in normal senescence, in SIPS, and also after stimulation of human monocytic JOSK-1 leukemia cells line (21Furukawa Y. Uenoyama S. Tsunoda A. Griffin J.D. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17121-17127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or mesengial cells (22Schoecklmann H.O. Rupprecht H.D. Zauner I. Sterzel R.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1228-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with TGF-β1. Second, interactions between ATF-2 and hypophosphorylated Rb have been shown to trigger the transactivation of the promoter of TGF-β (18Kim S.-J. Wagner S. Liu F. O'Reilly M.A. Robbins P.D. Green M. Nature. 1992; 358: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Third, the overexpression of each of the four senescence-associated genes studied herein has been shown to be controlled by TGF-β, in four respective models (11Owens G.K. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Wegrowski Y. Perreau C. Martiny L. Haye B. Maquart F.X. Bellon G. Exp.

Abrass I.B. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that TGF-β1 induces a senescence-like morphology, senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, and overexpression of these four senescence-associated genes. Then we have shown that TGF-β1 mRNA is increased at 72 h after subcytotoxic H2O2 stress in conditions where SIPS is triggered. Further experiments have shown that this increase in mRNA level starts at 24 h after the stress. In this study, a peak of release of active TGF-β1 protein in the culture medium was observed at 36 h after stress, suggesting a complex regulation taking place either at the level of RNA stability or post-transcriptionally. Since other peaks of TGF-β1 protein release might exist during the 72 h necessary for SIPS to take place, we incubated the cells with TGF-β RII- or TGF-β1-Abs for 72 h after the stress. Our results strongly suggest that TGF-β1 mediates the induction of the senescence-like morphology, senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, and the overexpression of the four senescence-associated genes (fibronectin, osteonectin, SM22, and apolipoprotein J) studied. Previous work (24Rodemann H.P. Binder A. Güven N. Löffler H. Bamberg M. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: S32-S36Google Scholar) suggested a possible involvement of TGF-β1 in the morphological changes taking place in the γ-radiation-induced growth arrest. Here, we give evidence that TGF-β1 controls the appearance of several biomarkers of cellular senescence in conditions leading to SIPS. We also provide clues for the mechanism of stress-induced overexpression of the TGF-β1 gene. We show that the stress-induced protein release of TGF-β1 disappeared in IMR-90 + E6 HDFs and IMR-90 + E7 HDFs, suggesting that p53, Rb, or other partners of Rb signaling pathway regulate TGF-β1 expression in stressful conditions. Moreover, the results show also that E7 inhibits the stress-induced overexpression of fibronectin, osteonectin, SM22, and apolipoprotein J and therefore reinforce the notion that Rb might control the overexpression of these senescence-associated genes through TGF-β1 overexpression. Further experiments are necessary to confirm this likely role of Rb in the overexpression of TGF-β1 in conditions leading to SIPS. Nevertheless, it has been shown, in the same experimental system, that deletion of amino acids 21–24 of E7 cDNA, as well as mutations at positions 24–26, which eliminate the binding of E7 to Rb, allow the appearance of SIPS, while wild type E7 does not (10Chen Q.M. Bartholomew C.J. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This result reinforces the potential role of Rb in the appearance of various biomarkers of SIPS. Further experiments are needed to know whether TGF-β1 controls the appearance of other biomarkers of SIPS. It would also be interesting to know whether HDFs, which are unable to express TGF-β1, also undergo SIPS after subcytotoxic stresses and/or postpone their replicative senescence in normal conditions. Last, other studies could be aimed at finding out whether the stress-induced overexpression of TGF-β1 found in SIPS is triggered by DNA damage generated by H2O2, which is likely to be the case."
https://openalex.org/W2059425291,"The 92-kDa type IV collagenase (MMP-9) plays a critical role in tissue remodeling. We undertook a study to determine whether the KiSS-1 gene, previously shown to suppress cancer spread (metastases), negatively regulates MMP-9 expression. Six cell lines positive for MMP-9 mRNA were deficient in KiSS-1 mRNA. One of these cell lines, HT-1080, stably transfected with a KiSS-1 expression construct, demonstrated substantially lower MMP-9 enzyme activity/protein and in vitro invasiveness. The lower MMP-9 enzyme activity reflected reduced steady-state mRNA levels which, in turn, was due to attenuated transcription. Activation of ERKs and JNKs by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and tumor necrosis factor α, respectively, leading to increased MMP-9 amounts was not antagonized by KiSS-1 expression, suggesting that MAPK pathways modulating MMP-9 synthesis are not the target of KiSS-1. Although MMP-9 expression is regulated by AP-1, Sp1, and Ets transcription factors, KiSS-1 did not alter the binding of these factors to the MMP-9 promoter. However, NF-κB binding to the MMP-9 promoter required for expression of this collagenase was reduced by KiSS-1 expression. Diminished NF-κB binding reflected less p50/p65 in the nucleus secondary to increased IκBα levels in the cytosols of the KiSS-1transfectants.

The activity of the enzyme is controlled by the levels of physiological inhibitors including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and 2, which form noncovalent bonds with the enzyme (19Goldberg G.

Regulation of MMP-9 protein levels has been ascribed to transcriptional activation of the gene (21Sato H. Kita M. Seiki M. J. Biol.

The 5′ flanking sequence contains putative binding sites for AP-1, NF-κB, Sp1, and Ets transcription factors within the first 670 base pairs, and these have been implicated in the induction of MMP-9 gene expression by TNF-α,1 v-Src, c-Ha-Ras, Tat, and contact inhibition using transient transfection of cultured cells (15Sato H.

Although MMP-9 has been implicated in the invasive/metastatic phentoype of many cancers, how its expression is regulated is still poorly understood. In the last 5 years, a great deal of interest has been focused on a group of genes collectively referred to as metastases-associated genes, which modulate cancer metastases but not tumorigenesis (29Dong J.T. Lamb P.W. Rinker-Schaeffer C.W. Vukanovic J. Ichikawa T. Isaacs J.T. Barrett J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 884-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 30Christensen C.R.L. Klingelhofer J. Tarabykina S. Hulgaard E.F. Kramerov D. Lukanidin E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1238-1244PubMed Google Scholar). One of these is the KiSS-1 gene, which was discovered by subtractive hybridization and is reduced in its expression in metastatic cancer (31Lee J.-H. Miele M.E. Hicks D.J. Phillips K.K. Trent J.M. Weissman B.E. Welch D.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Further, its enforced expression in MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells and melanoma suppressed the metastatic potential of these cells by 95% without affecting their tumorigenicity (31Lee J.-H. Miele M.E. Hicks D.J. Phillips K.K. Trent J.M. Weissman B.E. Welch D.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 32Lee J.-H. Welch D.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2384-2387PubMed Google Scholar). The KiSS-1 gene is comprised of 4 exons, the first two of which are not translated. The third exon contains 38 noncoding base pairs at the 5′ end followed by 100 base pairs of translated sequence. The terminal exon contains 332 base pairs of translated sequence. The gene maps to chromosome 1q32 (33West A. Vojta P.J. Welch D.R. Weissmann B.E. Genomics. 1998; 54: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and its sequence predicts a unique hydrophilic 145-amino acid protein with a leader sequence and a predicted molecular mass of 15.4 kDa (34Welch D.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89 (1549): 1549Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which KiSS-1 represses the metastatic phenotype is unknown. Because MMP-9 has a well established role in tumor cell invasion and metastases, we undertook the present study to determine whether the expression of this collagenase is regulated by KiSS-1. HT-1080 cells were maintained in McCoys 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For stable transfections, cells were transfected at ∼60% confluence using poly-l-ornithine as described previously (35Nead M.A. McCance D.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 668-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Essentially, the cells were incubated with 20 μg of DNA and 9.3 μg of poly-l-ornithine (Sigma) for 6 h and then shocked for 4 min with 25% glycerol. Cells were incubated for 2 days and then selected with 600 μg/ml of G418 (active concentration). Clones were isolated, expanded, and screened for KiSS-1cDNA integration by PCR. These were carried out as described previously but with minor modifications (36Schlechte W. Brattain M. Boyd D. Cancer Commun. 1990; 2: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, Matrigel® was diluted in cold serum-free medium, and 25 μg of the preparation was added to the porous filters (pore size, 8 μm) and allowed to gel at 37 °C. Cells are dispersed with Ca2+/Mg2+-free medium containing 3 mm EDTA, and 250,000 cells dispensed into the Transwell®. The Transwell® was subsequently inserted into a well, with the latter also containing culture medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. After this time, cells on both the upper and lower aspects of the membrane were stained with Diff-Quik (Baxter Scientific Products, McGaw Park, IL) and enumerated. The level of steady state mRNAs was determined by Northern blot analysis (37Boyd D. Ziober B. Chakrabarty S. Brattain M.G. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 816-820PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted from 90% confluent cultures using 5.0 mguanidinium isothiocyanate and purified on a cesium chloride cushion (5.7 m) by centrifugation at 150,000 × gfor 20 h. Purified RNA was electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to Nytran-modified nylon by capillary action using 10× SSC. The Northern blot was probed at 42 °C with random-primed radiolabeled cDNAs (38Juarez C. Clayman G. Nakajima M. Tanabe K. Saya H. Nicolson G.L. Boyd D. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The KiSS-1 cDNA coding sequence was generated by restriction digestion of the KiSS-1 expression plasmid with XhoI/BamHI, yielding a 0.7-kilobase fragment. The blots were then washed at 65 °C using 0.25× SSC in the presence of 0.75% SDS. Loading efficiencies were checked by reprobing the blot with a radioactive GAPDH cDNA. Nuclear run-on experiments were as described previously (39Allgayer H. Wang H. Gallick G.E. Crabtree A. Mazar A. Jones T. Kraker A.J. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18428-18445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Nuclei from ∼6 × 107cells were isolated and incubated in the presence of [α32P]-labeled UTP in transcription buffer (150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT). Nuclei were then treated with DNase I and proteinase K, and the RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated. Radioactive RNA (6.6 × 107 cpm) was hybridized to nylon-immobilized cDNAs corresponding to MMP-9 (38Juarez C. Clayman G. Nakajima M. Tanabe K. Saya H. Nicolson G.L. Boyd D. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), MMP-2 (40Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G. Seltzer J.L. Kronberger A. He D. Bauer E.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6579-6587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GAPDH. Quantitation of the data was accomplished using QuantityOne® software (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extract was prepared essentially as described elsewhere (41Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6420Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and suspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF. After 15 min on ice, the cells were vortexed in the presence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The nuclear pellet was then collected by centrifugation and extracted in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mmPMSF for 15 min at 4 °C. Nuclear extract (10–20 μg) was preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 1 μg of the indicated antibody or a 100-fold excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide spanning the MMP-9 cis element of interest. The sequences were as follows: AP-1, CTGACCCCTGAGTCAGCACTT; NF-κB, CAGTGGAATTCCCCAGCC; Ets, GGAGAGGAAGCT; and Sp-1, TCCTTCCGCCCCCA. After this time, the reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min in a buffer (25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.05 mNaCl, and 2.5% glycerol) with 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) and 5 fmol (2 × 104 cpm) of a Klenow end-labeled ([32P]ATP) oligonucleotide that spans the DNA binding site in the MMP-9 promoter. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed at 4 °C in a 6% polyacrylamide gel using TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) running buffer. The gel was rinsed with water, dried, and exposed to x-ray film overnight. Zymography was performed as described previously (24Gum R. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Chen J.-H. Sato H. Seiki M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10672-10682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Culture supernatants were denatured in the absence of reducing agent and were electrophoresed in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin. The gel was incubated at room temperature for 2 h in the presence of 2.5% Triton X-100 and subsequently at 37 °C overnight in a buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The gel was then stained for protein with 0.25% Coomassie and photographed on a light box. Proteolysis was detected as a white zone in a dark field. For analysis of p65 and p50 NF-κB proteins and IκB (42Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), 2–3 × 106 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and were suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and proteinase inhibitors). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min, after which 20 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. The samples were then vortexed and centrifuged for 30 s at 12,000 × g. Supernatants were saved as cytosol extract, whereas the pellets were resuspended in ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm PMSF, and proteinase inhibitors). The nuclear pellets were incubated on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were retained as nuclear extract. For the ERK and JNK1 immunoblotting, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) on ice for 30 min. The cell lysates were then cleared by centrifugation, and the protein contents were determined by BCA assay. Proteins (60 μg) or conditioned medium were resolved in polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked in 5% milk solution and incubated in primary antibody solution at 4 °C overnight. The antibodies to phosphorylated JNKs and ERKs was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverley, MA) (catalog number 9251S) and Promega (Madison, WI) (catalog number V8031), respectively. A mouse monoclonal antibody (catalog number 1M10L) (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) was used for the detection of MMP-9. All the other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. After being washed with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) buffer, the blot was incubated with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and proteins were visualized with ECL reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. To verify the insertion of KiSS-1 cDNA into the genome, PCR was performed using genomic DNA as the template. To prepare the genomic DNA, the cells were lysed in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20 μg/ml RNase A, and 0.5% SDS at 37 °C for 1 h. The cell lysates were then treated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K at 50 °C overnight and extracted twice with phenol/chloroform (1:1). DNA was precipitated with ammonium acetate/ethanol. The PCR reaction mixture contained 50 ng of genomic DNA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 0.5 μm of each of the primers, and 1× Q solution (Qiagen). The upstream primer (5′-CCACTGCTTACTGGCTTATCG-3′) was complementary to the cytomegalovirus promoter sequence in the plasmid pcDNA3, whereas the downstream primer (5′-CAGTAGCAGCAGGCTTCCTC-3′) was complementary to the KiSS-1 cDNA sequence (nucleotides 376 to 395). After the template genomic DNA was denatured at 95 °C, the PCR reaction was initiated by adding 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen). The template was amplified for 32 cycles. Each PCR cycle consisted of denaturation at 95 °C, annealing at 65 °C, and extension at 72 °C (1 min, 1 min, and 40 s, respectively). The PCR cycles were terminated by extending at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products were resolved in a 2% agarose gel. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After denaturation at 65 °C for 5 min, RNA (2 μg) was added to 20 μl of RT mixture (10 μg/ml oligo(dT), 1× RT buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.5 mm each of four deoxynucleosides, 1 unit/μl RNasein (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI)). The RNA was reverse transcribed at 42 °C for 60 min, and 2 μl of the products were used as the template for multiplex PCR, which contains both the target KiSS-1, MMP-9 or MMP-2 primers, and β-actin primers for normalization. The primers used were MMP-9 (PCR product size, 120 bp), 5′-GAGGTTCGACGTGAAGGCGCAGATG-3′ and 5′-CATAGGT-CACGTAGCCCACTTGGTC-3′; MMP-2 (PCR product size, 447 bp), 5′-ACCTGGATGCCGTCGTGGAC-3′ and 5′-TGTGGCAGCACCAGGGCAGC-3′; KiSS-1 (PCR product size, 389 bp), 5′-AATTCTAGACCCACAGGCCA-3′ and 5′-GCATGCTCTGACTCCTTTGGG-3′; and β-actin (product size, 621 bp), 5′-ACACTGTGCCCATCTACGAGG-3′ and 5′-AGGGGCCGGACTCGTCATACT-3′. The PCR conditions were identical to those described above, with the exception that the annealing temperature was 62 and 68 °C for MMP-9 and KiSS-1, respectively. The concentration ratio of target cDNA primers to β-actin primers and the PCR cycle number was optimized for each reaction. For amplification of KiSS-1 cDNA, the reaction mixture contained 0.5 μm KiSS-1 primers and 0.05 μm β-actin primer, whereas the cycle number was 30. For MMP-9 amplification, the concentration of β-actin primers was 0.025 μm, and the cycle number was 34. For MMP-2 amplification, the concentration of β-actin primers was 0.05 μm, and the cycle number was 32. The PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gel. Cells (2–3 × 106) were treated with 1% formaldehyde in fresh medium at 37 °C for 10 min followed by the addition of 0.125 mglycine. After rinsing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The cell lysates were then sonicated with a Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher) at 30% maximum power for six 20-s pulses on ice. After removing cell debris by centrifugation, the cell lysates were diluted 10-fold in IP buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). At this step, 1% of the diluted chromatin solutions was saved to control (input DNA) for the total DNA amounts of each sample. The diluted chromatin solutions were then precleared with 80 μl of a 50% protein A-agarose slurry containing 20 μg of ssDNA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation to reduce nonspecific background. Anti-p65 antibody (2 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was then added to 1 ml of chromatin solution and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were then mixed with 80 μl of a 50% protein A-agarose slurry containing 20 μg of ssDNA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation, the agarose beads were washed once in 1 ml of Solution 1 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl) followed by two additional washes in 1 ml of Solution 2 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl) and 1 ml of Solution 3 (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), respectively. The beads were finally washed twice in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The immune complexes were eluted by adding 250 μl of 1% SDS in 0.1 m NaHCO3 to the pelleted beads and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. NaCl (20 μl of a 5 m solution) was then added to the eluted solution and incubated at 65 °C for 4 h. After being treated with proteinase K, the DNAs in the samples were recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation using 20 μg of glycogen as carrier. The precipitated DNAs were then dissolved in 20 μl of TE and blotted into nylon membrane. The slot blot was hybridized with [32P]-labeled MMP-9 promoter (+52 to −670) fragments. Although KiSS-1 has been shown to dramatically attenuate the metastatic capacity of cancer cells, the mechanism as to how this is achieved is not known. We hypothesized that this may be due, at least in part, to a suppression of the expression of MMP-9, which degrades the extracellular matrix. To test this hypothesis, MMP-9-producing HT-1080 cells, which demonstrate an invasive phenotype (43Tanaka K. Iwamoto Y. Ito Y. Ishibashi T. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Sugioka Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2927-2935PubMed Google Scholar) and which have undetectable KiSS-1expression, were stably transfected with an expression construct encoding the KiSS-1 coding sequence. G418-resistant colonies were cloned and expanded, and genomic DNA was screened by PCR for the integration of the KiSS-1 sequence into the DNA of the recipient cells. Several clones (numbers 4, 5, 7, and 10) positive for the exogenous KiSS-1 sequence were detected (Fig.1 A). The 470-base pair amplified sequence was not due to the detection of the endogenous KiSS-1 gene, because the 5′ PCR primer employed is unique to the cytomegalovirus promoter of the pcDNA3 expression plasmid. To verify the expression of the integrated KiSS-1 cDNA, we performed RT-PCR. RNA from HT-1080 cells transfected with the empty vector or the KiSS-1 expression construct was purified and subjected to RT-PCR. HT-1080 cells transfected with the empty vector (clones 1 and 3) showed no amplified product using primers corresponding to the KiSS-1 coding sequence (Fig.1 B). These data indicate that the expression of KiSS-1 mRNA (endogenous) in HT-1080 cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector is below the detection limit of RT-PCR. In contrast, an amplified product (of the predicted size, 389 base pairs) corresponding to the KiSS-1 mRNA was readily detected in HT-1080 clones 4, 5, 7, and 10, which were positive for genomic integration of the exogenous KiSS-1 plasmid. To corroborate the earlier findings (31Lee J.-H. Miele M.E. Hicks D.J. Phillips K.K. Trent J.M. Weissman B.E. Welch D.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 32Lee J.-H. Welch D.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2384-2387PubMed Google Scholar) that KiSS-1functions as a metastases suppressor gene, in vitro invasion assays were performed. In these assays, cells are plated on an extracellular matrix-coated porous filter, and invasion is defined as the percent of cells penetrating this impervious barrier. Expectedly, HT-1080 cells bearing the vector alone (clone 3-V3) (Fig.1 C) penetrated the extracellular matrix-coated porous filter (32 ± 3% invaded). In contrast, a representative KiSS-1-expressing clone (clone 7-K7) showed over a 65% reduction in invasiveness (Fig. 1 C). This reduced invasiveness was not due to diminished adhesion. Thus,KiSS-1 clone 7 demonstrated an adhesion rate (percent of cells attached 1 h post-plating) of 44 ± 2 compared with 46 ± 4% for the vector clone 3. Thus, these data illustrate that in HT-1080 cells, KiSS-1 represses invasion, which is a crucial component of the metastatic phenotype. Because the ability of cells to demonstrate an invasive/metastatic phenotype requires proteolysis, we hypothesized that KiSS-1negatively regulates MMP-9 expression. To answer this question, conditioned medium from clones positive for KiSS-1expression or the vector only were assayed for MMP-9 enzyme activity by zymography (Fig. 2 A). Conditioned medium from HT-1080 cells harboring the empty vector (pcDNA3) contained a collagenase activity that was indistinguishable in size (92 kDa) from MMP-9. The amount of this en"

Among the four known nitrilases ofArabidopsis thaliana, the isoform NIT4 is the most divergent one, and homologs of NIT4 are also known from species not belonging to the Brassicaceae like Nicotiana tabacum andOryza sativa. We expressed A. thaliana NIT4 as hexahistidine tag fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme showed a strong substrate specificity for β-cyano-l-alanine (Ala(CN)), an intermediate product of cyanide detoxification in higher plants. Interestingly, not only aspartic acid but also asparagine were identified as products of NIT4-catalyzed Ala(CN) hydrolysis. Asn itself was no substrate for NIT4, indicating that it is not an intermediate but one of two reaction products. NIT4 therefore has both nitrilase and nitrile hydratase activity. Several lines of evidence indicate that the catalytic center for both reactions is the same. The NIT4 homologs of N. tabacum were found to catalyze the same reactions and protein extracts of A. thaliana, N. tabacum andLupinus angustifolius also converted Ala(CN) to Asp and Asnin vitro. NIT4 may play a role in cyanide detoxification during ethylene biosynthesis because extracts from senescent leaves ofA. thaliana showed higher Ala(CN) hydratase/nitrilase activities than extracts from nonsenescent tissue.

The members of the NIT1 group (NIT1, NIT2, and NIT3) are highly similar and share a minimum of 82% identical amino acids. In A. thaliana, they occur clustered on chromosome 3, and although the patterns of expression are distinctly different for each isoform (2Bartling D. Seedorf M. Schmidt R.C. Weiler E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6021-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Bartel B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Planta. 1998; 206: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), their enzymatic characteristics are very similar, albeit not identical (4Vorwerk, S., Biernacki, S., Hillebrand, H., Janzik, I., Müller, A., Weiler, E. W., and Piotrowski, M. (2000) Planta, in pressGoogle Scholar). As shown previously (4Vorwerk, S., Biernacki, S., Hillebrand, H., Janzik, I., Müller, A., Weiler, E. W., and Piotrowski, M. (2000) Planta, in pressGoogle Scholar), a major role for these nitrilases appears to be in the metabolism of nitriles released by breakdown of glucosinolates. A further common feature is that all three isoenzymes can convert indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN)1 to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the plant growth hormone (1Bartling D. Seedorf M. Mithöfer A. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 417-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Bartling D. Seedorf M. Schmidt R.C. Weiler E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A nitrilase (which isoform, is at present unknown) may be part of the IAA synthase enzyme complex of A. thaliana, a soluble 160-kDa complex catalyzing the conversion of l-tryptophan to IAA in vitro(6Müller A. Weiler E.W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2000; 381: 679-686PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrilase 4 is peculiar in that it occurs as a single gene at a different chromosomal location (chromosome 5) (3Bartel B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6649-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), does not accept IAN as a substrate (Ref. 7Schmidt R.C. Müller A. Hain R. Bartling D. Weiler E.W. Plant J. 1996; 9: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and this paper), and occurs in plants of different taxonomic position, such as tobacco (8Tsunoda H. Yamaguchi K. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 339Google Scholar) and rice (GenBankTM accession number AB027054). Nitrilases belonging to the NIT4 family thus may have a different and more general function and will likely not be associated with auxin production. A nitrile of widespread occurrence in higher plants is β-cyano-l-alanine (Ala(CN)), which is enzymatically produced by cyanoalanine synthase from cyanide and cysteine as substrates (9Blumenthal S.G. Hendrickson H.R. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5302-5307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the plant species observed, Ala(CN) is subsequently converted to asparagine or to the dipeptide γ-Glu-(Ala(CN)). An enzyme converting Ala(CN) to Asp (cyanoalanine hydratase, EC 4.2.1.65) was characterized biochemically from lupine (Lupinus angustifolius) (10Castric P.A. Farnden K.J.F. Conn E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 152: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Galoyan S.M. Tolosa E.A. Goryachenkova E.V. Biokhimiya. 1982; 47: 1949-1953PubMed Google Scholar), but the gene encoding this enzyme has not yet been cloned. In a previous study we reported about the enzymatic characterization of the A. thaliana nitrilase subfamily encoded by theNIT2/NIT1/NIT3 gene cluster (4Vorwerk, S., Biernacki, S., Hillebrand, H., Janzik, I., Müller, A., Weiler, E. W., and Piotrowski, M. (2000) Planta, in pressGoogle Scholar). During this work, we notified that Arabidopsis NIT4 has a quite different substrate specificity compared with the NIT1/NIT2/NIT3 group. Here, we report about the elucidation of the enzymatic function of the NIT4 enzyme family. A. thaliana ecotype C24 andNicotiana tabacum W38 were grown in a greenhouse in standard soil at 20 °C, 70% relative humidity, and 210 μmol photons m−2 s−1 for a 16-h photoperiod. Seeds of L. angustifolius were sown on Vermiculite and grown in a growth chamber under the following climatic conditions: 16-h photoperiod, 120 μmol photons m−2 s−1, 24 °C during photoperiod, 20 °C during night, 70% relative humidity. The following general procedures have been described elsewhere (4Vorwerk, S., Biernacki, S., Hillebrand, H., Janzik, I., Müller, A., Weiler, E. W., and Piotrowski, M. (2000) Planta, in pressGoogle Scholar): sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and protein determination. All basic molecular techniques were adapted from Ausubel et al. (12Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar) or Sambrook et al. (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequences of polymerase chain reaction-amplified or mutated cDNAs were verified by sequencing. Cloning of NIT4 cDNA was described previously (4Vorwerk, S., Biernacki, S., Hillebrand, H., Janzik, I., Müller, A., Weiler, E. W., and Piotrowski, M. (2000) Planta, in pressGoogle Scholar). The cDNAs for the N. tabacum nitrilases TNIT4A and TNIT4B were kindly provided by Dr. Kazuo Yamaguchi (Institute for Gene Research, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan), and cloning into pET-21b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) was done as described for A. thaliana NIT4 (4Vorwerk, S., Biernacki, S., Hillebrand, H., Janzik, I., Müller, A., Weiler, E. W., and Piotrowski, M. (2000) Planta, in pressGoogle Scholar). Mutations were introduced using the GeneEditor in vitro Site-directed Mutagenesis System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). TheEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was used for expression of plant nitrilases. Bacteria grown overnight (600 ml) were collected by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 60 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme). Lysis was carried out on ice for 30 min and was completed with six bursts of ultrasound (1 min, 40 watts) using an ultrasound tip (Sonifier B-17, Branson). The 10,000 × g supernatant (10 min, 4 °C), containing soluble nitrilase protein, was used for (NH4)2SO4 precipitation (40% saturation), and the precipitate was resuspended in 12 ml of lysis buffer omitting lysozyme. This fraction was used for purification of the hexahistidine-tagged nitrilases using a 0.5-ml column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Nitrilase bound to the column was eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. One ml of the peak fraction was collected and desalted using a NAP-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which was equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT. The resulting nitrilase fraction was purified at least to 95% homogeneity as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels. Protein concentration varied between 80 and 120 μg ml−1, and total volume was 1.5 ml. The protein was shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for a maximum duration of 8 weeks. One gram of plant material was ground to a fine powder in a mortar with liquid nitrogen and thawed with continuing grinding in 3 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. The homogenate was centrifuged (15 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), and the supernatant was again centrifuged (20 min, 100,000 × g, 4 °C). The resulting supernatant (soluble proteins) was brought to 40% saturation of (NH4)2SO4 by adding a 100% saturated (NH4)2SO4 solution dropwise. After stirring on ice for 20 min, precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation (15 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C) and resuspended in a small volume (0.5–2 ml, depending on the size of the pellet) of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. Because extracts of blue lupine seedling have a high Asn content, they were desalted in the same buffer using PD-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before and after the (NH4)2SO4precipitation. Nitrilase activity was determined by analyzing the released ammonia using the Bertholet reaction as described previously (4Vorwerk, S., Biernacki, S., Hillebrand, H., Janzik, I., Müller, A., Weiler, E. W., and Piotrowski, M. (2000) Planta, in pressGoogle Scholar). In brief, the substrate (3 mm) was incubated with 400–600 ng of purified protein or 50–100 μg of protein (crude extracts) in 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 30 °C in a total volume of 1 ml. For background control, heat-denatured enzyme (10 min, 100 °C) was used. After the indicated times (10 min to 4 h) aliquots of 0.1 ml were taken, and the reaction was stopped by adding 0.1 ml each of 0.33 m sodium phenolate, 0.02 m sodium hypochlorite, and 0.01% (w/v) sodium pentacyanonitrosyl ferrate(III) (sodium nitroprusside). After heating for 2 min at 95 °C, the sample was diluted with 0.6 ml of water, and the absorbance was read at 640 nm. Each experiment was calibrated with NH4Cl solutions of known concentrations. For parallel determination of both nitrilase and nitrile hydratase (NHase) activity, two 0.1-ml samples were taken and boiled for 10 min to stop the reaction. Both aliquots were diluted to 1 ml with water, and 0.1 ml of the first sample was used for determination of ammonia (resulting from nitrilase activity). To the second sample, 0.25 units of asparaginase (from Erwinia chrysanthemi, Sigma) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, ammonia was determined using a 0.1-ml aliquot as described above (representing both nitrilase and NHase activity). NHase activity was then calculated from the difference of both samples. The 1:10 dilution was necessary for two reasons. (i) The concentration of nitrilase- and asparaginase-released ammonia was usually outside the linear range of the calibration curve (which was between 0.01 and 0.5 mm). (ii) The asparaginase used showed Ala(CN) hydratase activity when incubated at Ala(CN) concentrations higher 1 mm resulting in overestimated background values because Ala(CN) does not decrease below 1 mm in the background samples. By diluting the sample (and therefore the Ala(CN)) before asparaginase was added, this effect was negligible. For some experiments, nitrilase and NHase activity were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). After the indicated times, 0.1-ml aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction vessels, and 100% (v/v) ethanol was added to reach a final concentration of 80% (v/v) ethanol. The samples were boiled for 10 min and subsequently centrifuged (15 min at 13,000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge) to collect insoluble material. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness and subsequently resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.5 mm pentadecafluorooctanoic acid (PDFOA). After a second centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh reaction tube. Reverse phase liquid chromatography of the underivatized amino acids was carried out according to Chaimbaultet al. (14Chaimbault P. Petritis K. Elfakir C. Dreux M. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 855: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) using a Luna C18(2) column (0.5 μm, 1 × 150 mm, Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) on a Waters Cap-LC (Waters, Milford, MA). The injection volume was 5 μl, and the chromatography proceeded isocratically in 0.5 mm PDFOA at a flow rate of 40 μl min−1. The identification of eluting Ala(CN), aspartic acid, and asparagine was achieved by ESI-MS on a Q-TOF2 (Micromass, Manchester, UK) operated in positive ion mode with the following settings: capillary, 3000 V; cone voltage, 16 V; collision energy, 5 eV; collision gas off; MS profile, 113, 113, 113. Expected m/z values were 115 [Ala(CN) + H]+, 133 [Asn + H]+, and 134 [Asp + H]+. Quantification was done using external standards and was assisted by the Masslynx software (version 3.4, Micromass, Manchester, UK). To obtain collision-induced decomposition spectra of the amino acids, the automatic MS/MS switching option of the Masslynx software was used with collision gas on and collision energy raised to 15 eV in the MS/MS mode. Signals for the spectra were recorded from m/z values of 30–140. Partial or complete cDNA or genomic sequences of nitrilases are known from several plant species like A. thaliana (1Bartling D.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 339Google Scholar), and Oryza sativa (rice) (GenBankTM accession number AB027054). By comparing the homologies between these nitrilases (Fig. 1), they can be divided into two groups. The first group, referred to as NIT1 group, seemed to be specific for nitrilases from Brassicaceae. Because many species of the Brassicaceae are characterized by their high glucosinolate content and glucosinolate-derived nitriles are among the best substrates for NIT1-NIT3, a function of these enzymes in glucosinolate metabolism has been proposed (4Vorwerk, S., Biernacki, S., Hillebrand, H., Janzik, I., Müller, A., Weiler, E. W., and Piotrowski, M. (2000) Planta, in pressGoogle Scholar). Arabidopsis NIT4 belongs to the second group, further referred to as NIT4 group to which, in addition to the NIT4s of the Brassicaceae, all known nitrilases of other plants belong. This clustering of the NIT4 sequences could also be observed by phylogenetic analysis using the PHYLIP software package (Dr. J. Felsenstein, Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (data not shown). The NIT4 homologs therefore have to be considered as orthologs which means that the present NIT4genes share a common ancestor. It therefore seems likely that members of the NIT4 group may also have a conserved function. By using exactly the same strategy as described previously for NIT1, NIT2, and NIT3 (4Vorwerk, S., Biernacki, S., Hillebrand, H., Janzik, I., Müller, A., Weiler, E. W., and Piotrowski, M. (2000) Planta, in pressGoogle Scholar), NIT4 could be expressed in E. coli from its genuine start codon as a fusion protein with a hexahistidine tag joined to the C-terminal amino acid of the enzyme via a Val-Glu dipeptide spacer. Although, as in the case of the other three nitrilases from A. thaliana, most of the bacterially expressed protein was found in the 10,000 × gsediment, a fraction of the recombinant nitrilase could be purified from the soluble protein lysate by metal-chelate affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetate columns. The resulting fraction was purified at least to 95% homogeneity as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels. We tested more than 25 selected substrates using the purified enzyme because in preliminary experiments we observed striking and qualitatively different results when the purified enzyme or a crude extract of NIT4-expressing E. coli was used. The results show that NIT4 is highly specific for β-cyano-l-alanine (Ala(CN)) (TableI). The activity of NIT4 against 3-phenylpropionitrile (PPN) or allylcyanide, which are the best substrates for NIT1-NIT3 (4Vorwerk, S., Biernacki, S., Hillebrand, H., Janzik, I., Müller, A., Weiler, E. W., and Piotrowski, M. (2000) Planta, in pressGoogle Scholar), was very low, and indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN), a precursor of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), was not detectably converted by NIT4. This is in agreement with in planta data of Schmidt et al. (7Schmidt R.C. Müller A. Hain R. Bartling D. Weiler E.W. Plant J. 1996; 9: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Dohmotoet al. (17Dohmoto M. Sano J. Tsunoda H. Yamaguchi K. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) who were unable to elicit an auxin response with IAN in wild type tobacco (which expresses at least two NIT4 homologs) as well as in NIT4-overexpressing tobacco (17Dohmoto M. Sano J. Tsunoda H. Yamaguchi K. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Transgenic tobacco plants expressing either NIT2 (7Schmidt R.C. Müller A. Hain R. Bartling D.

Since the enzymatic assay used so far was based on the analysis of released ammonia, it was necessary to show that this ammonia represented the nitrile nitrogen and not the amino nitrogen. Thus, we analyzed the reaction products by thin layer chromatography (data not shown) and liquid chromatography coupled to nanospray-ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) (Fig. 2). The production of aspartic acid (Asp) could unequivocally be shown by co-chromatography with authentic Asp during TLC (data not shown) as well as by LC-ESI-MS (Fig. 2 A) and by its collision-induced decomposition spectrum (Fig. 2 B). Unexpectedly, Asn could also be detected and occurred in amounts about 1.5 times higher than Asp. Therefore, NIT4 not only has a nitrilase activity (converting Ala(CN) to Asp) but also a nitrile hydratase (NHase) activity (converting Ala(CN) to Asn). Nitrilases hydrolyze nitriles by the successive addition of two molecules of water, whereas the substrate remains covalently bound to the enzyme's catalytic-site cysteine (18Mahadevan S. Thimann K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 107: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our results suggested that Asn may occur as a free intermediate of the nitrilase reaction rather than enzyme-bound. However, this could be ruled out by the observation that Asn is only marginally converted to Asp by NIT4 (Table I). This negligible asparaginase activity of NIT4 (∼6 nkat (mg protein)−1) cannot account for the observed levels of Asp that is formed at a rate of ∼500 nkat (mg protein)−1. Furthermore, asparaginase activity was not observed in every preparation and results therefore most likely from small contaminations of the preparations with E. coliasparaginase. In addition, time course studies showed that Asp and Asn are formed at the same time with a constant ratio with no detectable turnover of Asn (Fig. 3). If Asn would indeed be an intermediate of the reaction, we would expect it to accumulate before Asp synthesis starts, whereas with the onset of Asp formation its level should decrease. Taken together, these results prove that NIT4 converts Ala(CN) to either Asp or Asn. Asn is no substrate of the enzyme, and thus, Asn is no free intermediate of the nitrilase reaction of this bifunctional enzyme.Figure 3Time course of Ala(CN) hydrolysis by NIT4 ofA. thaliana. Arabidopsis NIT4 (400 ng) was incubated with 3 mm Ala(CN) at 30 °C for 1 h. For determination of the amino acid concentrations, aliquots of 100 μl were withdrawn and subjected to LC-ESI-MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data shown are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The known reaction mechanisms of nitrilases and NHases are quite different (for review see Ref. 19Bunch A.W. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1998; 74: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the first bind their substrate covalently to a cysteine residue, the latter use a nonheme iron for their activity. The formation of Asn from Ala(CN) by NIT4 may be the result of a “premature” release of Asn during the nitrilase reaction or it may occur at a second active site with NHase activity. The substrate concentration dependence of the two reactions (Fig. 4 and TableII) revealed that theK m of Ala(CN) for both reactions is very similar if not identical, whereas the maximum velocity (V max) is higher for the Asn formation. This result suggests that the catalytic center for both reactions might be the same. Both reactions showed the same temperature and pH dependence (Table II), and they were both inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (100% inhibition at 2 mm). The involvement of a cysteine residue in both reactions was further indicated by their inhibition at higher concentrations of DTT (∼50% inhibition at 10 mm). To pinpoint this residue(s), the proposed catalytically active cysteine of NIT4 for the nitrilase reaction (Cys-197) was mutated to alanine. The mutant protein (NIT4C197A) showed no nitrilase activity, and a strongly inhibited NHase activity (∼5% of the wild type protein) (Fig. 2) demonstrating (i) the importance of Cys-197 for both activities but also (ii) that the NHase activity does not completely depend on this residue.Table IIParameters of nitrilase and NHase activity of NIT4 from A. thalianaNitrilaseNHaseK m (mM)0.74 ± 0.250.70 ± 0.25V max (μkatal (mg protein)−1)1.84 ± 0.162.55 ± 0.43pH optimum7–97–9Temperature optimum∼40 °C∼40 °CNIT4 was purified as His tag fusion protein from E. coli.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16382-16388Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that a single amino acid substitution (Gln to Glu) in the cysteine protease papain resulted in a novel NHase activity of the mutated protein. The observed NHase activity ofA. thaliana NIT4 could therefore be the result of an artificial mutation. Sequence errors could be ruled out because the reported genomic and cDNA sequences of NIT4 from A. thaliana encode the same polypeptide. Additionally, NHase activity was seen with three different NIT4 homologs (see below). A critical factor may be the intentional “mutation” of the C terminus of the enzyme introduced with the His tag (EVHHHHHH) that was used in all tested recombinant NIT4 proteins. To study the influence of the His tag, we expressed NIT4 using its genuine stop codon in E. coli and enriched the protein by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and gel filtration. NIT4 activity was found in the void volume of a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) indicating that the native molecular mass is greater than 600 kDa.

https://openalex.org/W1975669691,"The human aldo-keto reductase AKR1C1 (20alpha(3alpha)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) is induced by electrophilic Michael acceptors and reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a presumptive antioxidant response element (Burczynski, M. E., Lin, H. K., and Penning, T. M. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 607-614). Physiologically, AKR1C1 regulates progesterone action by converting the hormone into its inactive metabolite 20alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and toxicologically this enzyme activates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trans-dihydrodiols to redox-cycling o-quinones. However, the significance of its potent induction by Michael acceptors and oxidative stress is unknown. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and other alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes produced during lipid peroxidation were reduced by AKR1C1 with high catalytic efficiency. Kinetic studies revealed that AKR1C1 reduced HNE (K(m) = 34 microm, k(cat) = 8.8 min(-1)) with a k(cat)/K(m) similar to that for 20alpha-hydroxysteroids. Six other homogeneous recombinant AKRs were examined for their ability to reduce HNE. Of these, AKR1C1 possessed one of the highest specific activities and was the only isoform induced by oxidative stress and by agents that deplete glutathione (ethacrynic acid). Several hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases of the AKR1C subfamily catalyzed the reduction of HNE with higher activity than aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1). NMR spectroscopy identified the product of the NADPH-dependent reduction of HNE as 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nonene. The K(m) of recombinant AKR1C1 for nicotinamide cofactors (K(m) NADPH approximately 6 microm, K(m)(app) NADH >6 mm) suggested that it is primed for reductive metabolism of HNE. Isoform-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that exposure of HepG2 cells to HNE resulted in elevated levels of AKR1C1 mRNA. Thus, HNE induces its own metabolism via AKR1C1, and this enzyme may play a hitherto unrecognized role in a response mounted to counter oxidative stress. AKRs represent alternative GSH-independent/NADPH-dependent routes for the reductive elimination of HNE. Of these, AKR1C1 provides an inducible cytosolic barrier to HNE following ROS exposure."

The extracellular loop is thought to participate in dimerization of subunits, which in some 2P K+ channels may involve disulfide bond formation (16Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the 2P K+channels is usually very short, whereas the C-terminal domain is much larger and determines many functional properties. Relatively little is known about the function of 2P K+channels in vivo. Recently, endogenous currents with properties similar to those of TASK channels have been found in the heart (17Kim Y. Bang H. Kim D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1669-H1678PubMed Google Scholar), in arterial chemoreceptor cells (18Buckler K.J. Williams B.A. Honoré E. J. Physiol.

Both channels may contribute to setting the resting membrane potential, but their specific function in various tissues is not yet clear. In this paper we describe the cloning of the first two members of a novel subfamily of 2P K+ channels. One of these channels, rTHIK-1, was found to be expressed in all tissues tested. Heterologous expression of rTHIK-1 in Xenopus oocytes induced a current that could be activated by arachidonic acid and inhibited by the volatile anesthetic halothane. The second novel 2P K+channel, THIK-2, is closely related to THIK-1 (58% identity at the amino acid level) but could not be functionally expressed. THIK-2 was strongly expressed in several tissues including stomach, liver, and kidney and was particularly abundant in the brain. BLAST searches of the expressed sequence tag data base (dbEST), the genomic survey sequence data base (dbGSS), and the human genomic data base (htgs) identified several human and rat EST clones, one human GSS clone, and three human genomic data base entries of novel 2P K+ channel subunits. One rat EST clone (GenBankTM accession number AI070460) and one human GSS clone (GenBankTM accession number AQ898820) were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) and completely sequenced. About 1 × 106 clones of a λ-ZAPII rat brain or a λ-ZAPII rat heart cDNA library (Stratagene) plated with XL1-Blue MRF′ cells were screened with Digoxigenin-labeled THIK-2 andTHIK-1 fragments derived from the EST or GSS clones, respectively, and positive clones were detected using CSPD (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as chemoluminescence substrate. After purification of isolated plaques by two further screenings, pBSK+ plasmids containing the cDNAs were excised from λ-clones and sequenced. For sequence analysis, the GCG program package implemented at the Heidelberg Unix Sequence Analysis Resources (HUSAR) was used. The program PROSITE was used for identification of sequence consensus sites, the program GAP for pairwise sequence alignments, the program CLUSTAL W for creation of multiple alignments, and the program CLUSTREE for computation of the phylogenetic tree. Standard default parameters were used for the calculations. RNA from different rat tissues was prepared using the TRIZOL method (Life Technologies, Inc.) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR with rTHIK-2-specific primers (5′-CCTTCCTCCGGCACTACGAG-3′; 5′-ATGAAGGCCAGCAGCGAGAT-3′) amplifying a 250-bp intron-spanning DNA fragment or rTHIK-1-specific primers (5′-CGTGGGCACAGTGGTAACTA-3′; 5′-GCTCCACAGGAGATGGCTAC-3′) amplifying a 326-bp intron-spanning DNA fragment was performed with AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 52 °C, and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles each (with initial enzyme activation for 6 min at 94 °C and final additional elongation for 5 min at 72 °C). PCR fragments were analyzed on a 4% Nusieve-agarose gel (Biozym, Hessisch-Oldendorf, Germany). Physical map positions were determined by segregation analysis of gene markers using gene-specific amplification of clone DNAs from the GeneBridge 4 human radiation hybrid panel (26Gyapay G. Schmitt K. Fizames C. Jones H. Vega-Czarny N. Spillett D. Muselet D. Prud'homme J.F. Dib C. Auffray C. Morissette J. Weissenbach J. Goodfellow P.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The following primers were used for amplification: hTHIK-2/KCNK12(5′-TTCACAAGCTCATCCACAGC-3′; 5′-ATGGCTTCTTTTGGGTTCCT-3′), hTHIK-1/KCNK13 (5′-CAGGGTTTGGGATGACAACT-3′; 5′-CGTAGTACACGGAGGGCTTC-3′), TREK-2/KCNK10(5′-GAGGGTCCATGTCTGCATCT-3′; 5′-CACATACCTGGTGGCCTCTT-3′). PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 55 °C, elongation for 1 min at 72 °C, each for 30 cycles. Data vectors (Table I) based on two independent PCR analyses of the entire panel, with data arranged in the order specified for the Whitehead/Mit on-line Radiation Hybrid Mapper Program, were submitted to two-point maximum-likelihood analysis.Table IGeneBridge four-panel radiation hybrid mapping datacM, centimorgan; cR, centiray; Chrom., chromosome. cM, centimorgan; cR, centiray; Chrom., chromosome. cDNAs encoding rTHIK-2, rTHIK-1, and chimeras between the two were cloned into the expression vector pSGEM (a gift of Dr. M. Hollmann) for expression inXenopus laevis oocytes. Capped run-off poly(A+) cRNA transcripts were synthesized and injected individually or in combination into defolliculated oocytes at constant amounts (∼3 ng each). Oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.4 -7.5), supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamicin and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, and assayed 48 h after injection. Two-electrode voltage-clamp measurements were performed with a Turbo Tec-10 C amplifier (npi, Tamm, Germany), which has a settling time of 100 μs for a 100-mV voltage pulse. Data were recorded via an EPC9 (Heka Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany) interface at sampling rates up to 20 kHz using Pulse/Pulsefit software (Heka). The Oocytes were placed in a small-volume perfusion chamber and bathed with ND96 or “high K+ ” solution (96 mm KCl, 2 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4–7.5). Wistar rats were decapitated under ether anesthesia, and their brains were removed and frozen on powdered dry ice. Tissue was stored at −20 °C until cutting. Sixteen-μm sections were cut on a cryostat, thaw-mounted onto silane-coated slides, and air-dried. After fixation for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS, slides were washed in PBS, dehydrated, and stored in ethanol until hybridization. Synthetic oligonucleotides were chosen from the open reading frame with least homology to other known sequences to minimize cross-hybridization. Antisense oligonucleotides designed for a minimal tendency of forming hairpins and self-dimers were as follows (base position on coding strand indicated). rTHIK-2: (i) (834) 5′-TATGGTCGACACCACGGTGCCCACGAAGTA GAAGGCTCCAGGGAAG3′ and (ii) (1618–1662) 5′-CTCGGAAAGCTGCTTCTGCAGCAGTGCCAGCGACACCTTGTTGGA-3′. rTHIK-1: (i) (1074–1117) 5′-GTCGCCCATCAGTGTCACTTTCCATCACCCCGTCCGTCTCTATG-3′, and (ii) (1280– 1328) 5′-GCTACTTCTGGTCCCTACCTGTCCCCACTGGTCTCTGCCAACCTGTTAT-3′. Oligonucleotides were 3′ end-labeled with 35S-dATP or [33P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 1200/1000 Ci/mmol) by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used for hybridization at concentrations of 2–10 pg/μl (4 × 105 cpm/100 μl of hybridization buffer/slide). Slides were air-dried and hybridized for 20–24 h at 43 °C in 100 μl of buffer containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 50 mm DTT, 0.3 m NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.5 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/ml polyadenylic acid, and the labeled probe. After hybridization, slides were washed 2 × 30 min in 1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate) plus 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 h in 1× SSC at 60 °C, and 10 min in 0.1× SSC at room temperature. Specimens were then dehydrated, air-dried, and exposed to Kodak BIOMAX x-ray film for 14–28 days. For cellular resolution, selected slides were dipped in photographic emulsion Kodak NTB2, incubated for 4–12 weeks, and then developed in Kodak D-19 for 2.5 min. For identification and confirmation of brain structures with bright- and dark-field optics, sections were Nissl-counterstained with cresyl violet. Controls sections were (a) digested with RNase A (50 ng/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C before hybridization or (b) hybridized with a probe containing a 20–50-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides. These control hybridizations resulted in a complete loss of specific hybridization signal. Two cDNA populations coding for novel 2P K+ channels were isolated from two rat cDNA libraries. The first channel was isolated from a rat brain and a rat heart library and was named THIK-1 for tandem pore domain halothaneinhibited K+ channel. The second, closely related channel was found only in the rat brain library and was named THIK-2 despite the fact that it was not functional when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Sequence analysis of the isolated cDNA clones revealed complete open reading frames (Fig.1) for rTHIK-1 (2032 bp) and rTHIK-2 (1900 bp). The nucleotide sequences predict proteins of 405 (rTHIK-1) and 430 (rTHIK-2) amino acids, respectively, which show the typical features of 2P K+ channels: four transmembrane regions, two pore-forming regions, a large extracellular linker between M1 and P1, a short N terminus and a larger C terminus. As indicated in Fig. 1,A and B, several putative intracellular phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and casein kinase were found in both sequences. In the M1-P1 linker region, rTHIK-1 harbors two putative glycosylation sites (N-{P}-[S/T]-{P}), whereas rTHIK-1 possesses only one. The rTHIK-2 protein is significantly longer at the N terminus, including three putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites and several repetitive amino acid elements.Figure 1cDNA and amino acid sequence of rTHIK-1 (A) and rTHIK-2 (B).Transmembrane regions are shown in black, and pore regions are marked gray. In addition, putative glycosylation sites (h), protein kinase A phosphorylation sites (⇑),protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (↑) and casein kinase phosphorylation sites (Δ) are indicated below the amino acid sequence. Consensus sites were identified using the program PROSITE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequence comparison identified the human orthologs of THIK-2 in data base entry AC009600 and of THIK-1 in two overlapping data base entries (AL355074, AL137128). In accordance with the human nomenclature committee (HUGO), the two novel channel genes were namedKCNK12 (THIK-2) and KCNK13 (THIK-1), respectively. The human channel subunits are 98% (hTHIK-2) and 84% (hTHIK-1), identical to their rat orthologs. hTHIK-1 and hTHIK-2 are 61.8% identical and 67.5% similar to each other, whereas only about 25–35% identity was found to other 2P K+ channels (Fig.2 B). Interestingly, the intracellular M2-M3 linker was 16–20 amino acids longer than that of other cloned 2P K+ channels. The cytosolic C-terminal domains of the THIK channels are 57% identical to each other (see supplemental material), whereas no significant homology was found to other C-terminal domains of 2P K+ channel. The pore regions of both THIK channels are nearly identical (no mismatch in a stretch of 13 amino acids in the first pore region and only one mismatch in the second pore), whereas there is considerable difference to other 2P K+ channels (Fig. 2 C). From the homology scores, the unique structural features of THIK channels and the phylogenetic clustering (Fig. 2 A), it is obvious that THIK 1 (KCNK13) and THIK-2 (KCNK12) form a novel subfamily among the 2P K+ channels. Supplemental material (multiple sequence alignment excluding the unrelated C-terminal domains and pairwise alignment of THIK-1 and THIK-2 C-terminal domains) is available in the on-line version. Analysis of the entries of the human genome databases showed that both genes described here have a similar structure, with a single large intron of 48.1 kilobases (KCNK12) and 121.5 kilobases (KCNK13), respectively, splitting the coding region at the first pore GYG motif. This intron is conserved in all mammalian 2P K+ channel genes (KCNK1-10) cloned so far. Chromosomal localization assigned KCNK12 to the human chromosomal region 2p22–2p21 between markers WI-10633 and SGC34238.KCNK13 was assigned to chromosomal region 14q24.1–14q24.3 between markers IB3608 and SGC30527, which is very close to the human TREK-2 (KCNK10) gene. The results of the chromosomal assignments are summarized in Table I. The tissue distribution of the rTHIK-1 and rTHIK-2 was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Intron-spanning primers were used to avoid false positive results due to genomic contamination. rTHIK-1-specific products were amplified from all tissues tested. In contrast, rTHIK-2 expression was found in brain, lung, kidney, liver, stomach, and spleen but not in skeletal muscle, heart, and testis (Fig.3). The mRNA distribution of rTHIK-1 and rTHIK-2 in the adult rat brain as detected by in situ hybridization is highly differential, with little overlap (summarized in Table II). Two different antisense probes were used for either subunit. The resulting labeling profiles were identical for each subunit, indicating that the probes were specific. rTHIK-2 mRNA was found to be widely expressed in most brain regions, with highest levels in the cerebellar granule cell layer, the mitral and granule cell layers of the olfactory bulb (Fig.4 E), and in the anterodorsal and anteroventral nuclei of the thalamus (Fig. 4 F). Strong signals were also found in the thalamic ventral posterior nuclei (Fig.4 G), cortex, hippocampus, the pontine nucleus, the red nucleus (Fig. 4 E), the oculomotor nucleus, and some nuclei of the amygdala. In the brainstem, elevated levels were found in all trigeminal sensory nuclei, in the tegmental and reticular nuclei, and in the ventral cochlear nuclei. rTHIK-2 mRNA was also found in some non-neuronal cells such as the ependymal lining of the ventricles. rTHIK-2 was found to be absent from the substantia nigra, gracile nuclei, inferior olive, and from most parts of the caudate putamen and septal nuclei as well as all white matter pathways.Table IIDistribution of rTHIK-1 and rTHIK-2 mRNA in the adult rat brainBrain regionTHIK-1THIK-2Brain regionTHIK-1THIK-2Olfactory bulb granule cell layer+++++++Superior colliculus superficial layer0++Olfactory tubercle++0Inferior colliculus0+Piriform cortex0+++Central gray0++Neocortex layer II++++Red nucleus++ aStructure is only partly positive.+++Neocortex layer III–VI0+++Oculomotor nucleus0+++Presubiculum, parasubiculum0+++Lateral lemniscus nuclei0++Dorsal endopiriform nucleus0+++Substantia nigra00Hippocampus dentate gyrus++aStructure is only partly positive.+++Cerebellum, deep nuclei0++Hippocampus, CA1 pyramidal cells+aStructure is only partly positive.+++Cerebellum, molecular layer00Hippocampus, CA3 pyramidal cells0++Cerebellum, granule cell layer0++++Lateral septal nucleus dorsal+++0Pontine nucleus0+++Caudate putamen++aStructure is only partly positive.0Reticulotegmental nucleus0+++Nucleus accumbens+++Superior olive (lateral)0++Amygdala, PMCo, AHiPM+++Mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus0+++Amygdala, basolateral nuclei0+++Spinal trigeminal nucleus0+++Ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus++++Principal sensory trigeminal nuclei0+++Suprachiasmatic nucleus0++Dorsal tegmental nuclei++aStructure is only partly positive.+++Lateral mammillary nuclei++++Ventral tegmental nuclei0+++Medial habenula0+Parabrachial nuclei, lateral+++aStructure is only partly positive.+Lateral habenula, medial part+++Lateral reticular nucleus0+++Thalamus, reticular nuclei++++Motor nuclei (Mo5, -7, -12)0++Thalamus, geniculate nuclei++Cochlear nuclei, dorsal0+Thalamus, reunions nuclei++++Cochlear nuclei, ventral anterior+++++Thalamus, anterodorsal/ventral nuclei+++++Cochlear nuclei, ventral posterior0++Thalamus, ventral posterior nuclei0+++Solitary nucleus+0Thalamus, ventromedial nuclei+++Inferior olive00In situ hybridization signals obtained for33P-labeled oligonucleotide probes on adult rat brain sections were rated according to the relative grain density: ++++, very abundant; +++, abundant; ++, moderate; +, low; ±, just above background; 0, no expression.

In contrast, rTHIK-1 mRNA expression was found to be rather weak and restricted to only a few brain regions and nuclei (Fig. 4,A–D). Substantial expression levels were detected only in the granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb, in the olfactory tubercle, the lateral septum (Fig. 4 A), and in distinct hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei (ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, lateral mamillary nucleus, reticular nucleus, reunions nuclei (Fig. 4,B and C)). Other rTHIK-1-positive structures were only partially labeled. The cortex, for example, was positive only in layer II, the striatum was labeled only in the caudal part, and the dentate gyrus granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus exhibited particularly high mRNA levels in the caudal-ventral part (Fig.4 D). Similarly, within a nuclear group, only specific subnuclei were positive, e.g. the dorsal subnucleus of the lateral septum (Fig. 4 A), the magnocellular part of the red nucleus (Fig. 4 D), a subnucleus of the lateral habenula (Fig. 4, A and C), one lateral parabrachial subnucleus, and the ventral nucleus of the cochlear nuclei. At day 2 after injection of rTHIK-1 cRNA into Xenopus oocytes, large currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage clamp (Fig.5 A), which were not seen under control conditions. The steady-state amplitude of the currents measured at +60 mV was 21.85 ± 4.45 μA (n = 7) in the presence of 2 mm external K+. Current activation in response to depolarizing voltage steps was not instantaneous but, when fitted to a single exponential, showed an activation time constant of 0.97 ± 0.25 ms at +60 mV. During a 500-ms voltage pulse, currents did not inactivate. The steady-state current-voltage relationship of rTHIK-1 showed only weak voltage dependence. With low external K+, moderate outward rectification was observed, whereas with nearly symmetrical K+, weak inward rectification was found (Fig.5 B). When external K+ was altered to examine the ion selectivity of rTHIK-1, the measured reversal potentials were very close to the K+ equilibrium potential (calculated on the assumption of an intracellular K+ concentration of 100 mm). The linear regression fit to the data gave a slope of −53 mV/decade (Fig. 5 C), as would be expected for highly selective K+ channels. THIK-1 could be partially blocked by Ba2+ ions; application of 1 mm Ba2+inhibited the instantaneous outward current measured at +60 mV (in the prese"

In the present study we provide evidence that the p38 MAP kinase pathway is activated in a RA-dependent manner in the NB-4, acute pro-myelocytic leukemia, and the MCF-7, breast carcinoma, cell lines. RA treatment of cells induces a time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of p38, and such phosphorylation results in activation of its catalytic domain. p38 activation is not inducible by RA in a variant NB-4 cell line, NB-4.007/6, which is resistant to the effects of RA, suggesting a role for this pathway in the induction of RA responses. Our data also demonstrate that the small G-protein Rac1 is activated by RA and functions as an upstream regulator of p38 activation, whereas the MAPKAPK-2 serine kinase is a downstream effector for the RA-activated p38. To obtain information on the functional role of the Rac1/p38/MAPKAPK-2 pathway in RA signaling, the effects of pharmacological inhibition of p38 on RA-induced gene transcription and cell differentiation were determined. Our results indicate that treatment of cells with the SB203580 inhibitor does not inhibit RA-dependent gene transcription via retinoic acid response elements or induction of Stat1 protein expression. However, treatment with SB203580 or SB202190 strongly enhances RA-dependent induction of cell differentiation and RA-regulated growth inhibitory responses.

The important biological effects of RA have led to intense efforts to understand the mechanisms by which it generates its biological effects on malignant cells. It is well established that RA binds to the RAR and RXR nuclear receptors, resulting in the formation of RAR-RXR heterodimers or RXR homodimers (reviewed in Refs. 13Chambon P. Semin.

In the present study we determined if treatment of cells with RA induces activation of the p38 pathway in the NB-4, acute promyelocytic leukemia, and the MCF-7, breast carcinoma, cell lines. Our data demonstrate that p38 is phosphorylated and activated in an RA-dependent manner and that such activation is regulated by the small G-protein Rac1. We also demonstrate that the MAPKAPK-2 kinase is activated by RA, and its activation is inhibited by pretreatment of cells with the p38 inhibitor SB203580, indicating that it is a part of a signaling cascade downstream of p38. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of p38 activation using specific inhibitors has no significant effects on RA-dependent transcriptional regulation, but it strongly enhances RA-induced cell differentiation, suggesting a negative regulatory effect of this pathway on the induction of RA-dependent differentiation. The NB-4 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. A polyclonal antibody against p38 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A polyclonal antibody against the phosphorylated/activated form of p38 was obtained from New England Biolabs and was used for immunoblotting. A polyclonal antibody against MAPKAP-2 kinase was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and was used for immunoprecipitations. A monoclonal antibody against Stat1 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). An antibody against the phosphorylated form of Stat1 on serine 727 (anti-Ser-727Stat1) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. A polyclonal antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated/activated form of ATF-2 was obtained from New England Biolabs. The SB203580 and SB202190 inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem. Cells were treated with 1 μm RA for 48 h, unless otherwise indicated. The vehicle control was cells treated with Me2SO (diluent for RA). The cells were subsequently lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer as described previously (42Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J.

The immunocomplexes were subsequently washed 3 times with PLB containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 times with kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 20 μm ATP) and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of GST ATF-2 fusion protein. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of ATF-2 was detected by immunoblotting with an antiphospho-ATF-2 antibody. Cells were treated with RA for the indicated times in the presence or absence of 10 μm SB203580. The cells were then lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer (PLB), and lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against MAPKAP kinase-2. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times in PLB and two times in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μmATP). The immune complex kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of Hsp-25 protein (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.) as a substrate, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of Hsp-25 was detected by autoradiography. Cell proliferation assays using the MTT method were performed as in previous studies (45Ahmad S. Alsayed Y. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (22994): 29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector and an RARE-luciferase plasmid (46Minnucci S. Zand D.J. Dey A. Marks M.S. Nagata T. Grippo J.F. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 360-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the superfect transfection reagent as per the manufacturer's recommended procedure (Qiagen). Forty eight hours after transfection, triplicate cultures were either left untreated or treated with RA for 16 h in the presence or absence of 10 μmSB203580. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and after cell lysis, luciferase activities were measured using the protocol of the manufacturer (Promega). The measured luciferase activities were normalized for β-galactosidase activity for each sample. Flow cytometric studies were performed as in previous studies (47Wickrema A. Uddin S. Sharma A. Chen F. Alsayed Y. Ahmad S. Sawyer S.T. Krystal G. Yi T. Nishada K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24469-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). NB-4 cells were treated with Me2SO or RA in the presence or absence of SB203580 (10 μm) or SB202190 (10 μm) or PD98059 (2 μm) for 5 days, and cell differentiation was determined by staining with the anti-CD11b monoclonal antibody. The anti-CD11b monoclonal antibody and a matched isotype control were purchased from Coulter Immunotech. The activation of Rac1 by RA was determined using a recently described methodology (48Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, the pGEX-4T3 construct encoding for the GTPase binding domain of human PAK1 (48Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) was expressed inEscherichia coli as a GST fusion protein (GST-PBD). After treatment of cells with RA, cells were lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer and were incubated with 5 μg of GST-PBD. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody against Rac1 (Transduction Laboratories) to detect GTP-bound Rac1. We determined whether treatment of cells with all-trans-retinoic acid induces activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway in NB-4 and MCF-7 cells. Cells were incubated with RA for different times (24–48 h), and after cell lysis, total lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated/activated form of p38. RA treatment induced strong phosphorylation of p38 (Fig.1 A). Stripping and reprobing the same blot demonstrated that equal amounts of the p38 protein were detectable prior to and after RA treatment (Fig. 1 B). To determine directly whether the phosphorylation of p38 results in induction of its kinase activity, cells were treated with RA; cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-p38 antibody, and in vitro kinase assays were performed using ATF-2 as an exogenous substrate. p38 from lysates of cells treated with RA induced strong phosphorylation of ATF-2 (Fig. 1 C), indicating that the catalytic activity of the kinase is induced in a RA-dependent manner. Treatment with RA also induced phosphorylation/activation of the ERK2 kinase (Fig. 1, D andE), indicating that the ERK pathway is also activated by RA in these cells, consistent with previous reports using HL-60 cells (20Yen A. Roberson M.S. Varvayanis S. Lee A.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3163-3172PubMed Google Scholar). We subsequently determined whether RA-dependent phosphorylation/activation of p38 occurs in an NB-4 variant cell line, NB-4.007/6, which is refractory to RA-induced differentiation and inhibition of cell growth, due to constitutive degradation of PML-RAR (49Fanelli M. Minucci S. Gelmetti V. Nervi C. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Pelicci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 93: 1477-1481Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, when NB-4 and NB-4.007/6 cells were analyzed in parallel, the phosphorylation of p38 was only inducible in NB-4 but not in NB-4.007/6 cells, despite the fact that similar amounts of the p38 protein were expressed in both cell lines. Thus, functional activation of a signaling cascade that requires PML-RAR expression is essential for downstream phosphorylation/activation of the p38 kinase in cells of acute promyelocytic leukemia origin. We also determined whether RA-dependent activation of p38 occurs in the MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line, which is sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of RA (50Van der Leede B.M. van den Brink C.E.

Cancer. 1998; 77: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RA treatment of these cells resulted in a time-dependent phosphorylation of p38, with the signal reaching a maximum at ∼24 h and diminishing by 120 h (Fig. 3, A andB), indicating that the RA-inducible activation of p38 is not restricted to cells of promyelocytic origin, but it also occurs in other RA-sensitive neoplastic cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that the small G-protein Rac1 is an upstream regulator of the p38 MAP kinase in response to stress (53Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 54Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell.

We therefore determined if Rac1 is activated in RA-responsive manner and whether it regulates RA-inducible p38 activation. NB-4 or NB-4.007/6 cells were treated for different times with RA, and cell lysates were bound to a GST fusion protein for the binding domain of the Pak1 kinase, which is the downstream effector for Rac1. The bound proteins were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-Rac1 antibody to identify the activated/GTP-bound form of Rac1. RA treatment induced strong activation of Rac1 in NB-4 but not in NB-4.007/6 cells (Fig. 4 A). Such activation was dose-dependent, with maximum amounts of GTP-bound Rac1 detectable at RA concentrations of 10−5 to 10−6m (Fig. 4 B). Rac1 activation was also detected in response to RA treatment in the MCF-7 cell line, consistent with the RA-inducible p38 activation in these cells (Fig. 4 C). To determine directly whether Rac1 activation regulates downstream engagement of p38, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with either wild-type Rac1 or a dominant-negative form of Rac1 (Rac1T17N) (53Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation/activation of the p38 MAP kinase was subsequently determined in the transfected cells. Overexpression of wild-type Rac1 slightly increased the RA-dependent activation of p38, as compared with cells transfected with control empty vector (Fig.5 A). On the other hand, overexpression of the dominant-negative form of Rac1 abrogated p38 activation (Fig. 5 A). There were no changes in the amounts of p38 protein in response to overexpression of wild-type Rac1 or the dominant-negative Rac1 mutant (Fig. 5 B). Thus, activation of the Rac1 GTPase by RA ultimately regulates RA-dependent activation of p38. Previous work has demonstrated that MAPKAPK-2 is an in vivo substrate for the kinase activity of p38 in response to stress (41Foltz I.N. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3296-3301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 42Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C.

Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). To determine whether this serine-threonine kinase is also activated downstream of p38 after RA treatment of NB-4 or MCF-7 cells, lysates from RA-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody against MAPKAPK-2, and in vitro kinase assays were carried out on the immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig.6, A and B, MAPKAPK-2 was strongly activated by RA, as evidenced by the strong phosphorylation of heat shock protein 25 (Hsp25) used as an exogenous substrate. Such an activation was blocked by treatment of cells with the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 6 C), indicating that MAPKAK-2 is a downstream effector for the RA-activated p38 kinase. Altogether, these studies demonstrated that a cellular cascade involving Rac1, the p38 MAP kinase, and the MAPKAPK-2 kinase is activated by RA. In subsequent studies we sought to obtain information on the functional relevance of this pathway in the induction of RA responses. Previous studies have demonstrated that, in other systems, the function of the p38 pathway is required for transcriptional regulation (42Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y.

It is also well established that one of the mechanisms of action of RA involves RA-dependent up-regulation of the transcriptional activator Stat1 (58Kolla V. Lindner D."
https://openalex.org/W1983345119,"Relatively limited information is available on the processing and function of the normal cellular prion protein, PrPC. Here it is reported for the first time that PrPC undergoes a site-specific cleavage of the octapeptide repeat region of the amino terminus on exposure to reactive oxygen species. This cleavage was both copper- and pH-dependent and was retarded by the presence of other divalent metal ions. The oxidative state of the cell also decreased detection of full-length PrPC and increased detection of amino-terminally fragmented PrPC within cells. Such a post-translational modification has vast implications for PrPC, in its processing, because such cleavage could alter further proteolysis, and in the formation of the scrapie isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc, because abnormal cleavage of PrPSc occurs into the octapeptide repeat region.

Mol. Aspects Med. 1994; 15: 195-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Such disorders include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia in humans (2Collinge J. Lancet. 1999; 354: 317-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 3Parchi P. Gambetti P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1995; 8: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). TSEs may be of sporadic, genetic, or infectious origin, and the agent believed to be responsible for these disorders is a protein molecule termed PrPSc, which is a conformational variant of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) (4Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. Dearmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). PrPC is a 33–35-kDa glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is expressed by most tissues and in particular at high levels by neuronal cells. Unlike PrPC, PrPSc possesses a high β-sheet content and is partially protease-resistant (5Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). It still remains unclear how PrPC is converted to PrPSc and whether the infectious agent consists solely of PrPSc, because the infectivity of in vitro converted PrPSc remains to be established (6Hill A.F. Antoniou M. Collinge J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, it is becoming increasingly evident that PrPC is essential for disease development on infection (7Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar), although the function of the protein still remains obscure. The amino terminus of PrPC contains a series of octapeptide repeats possessing the following consensus sequence: PHGGGWGQ. This region, which is among the most conserved regions of mammalian PrP (8Milner J. Medcalf E.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 765-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), has been implicated in the binding of divalent metal ions, and in particular copper (9Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whether this binding is of structural or functional significance is not known. However, NMR studies have shown that the recombinant protein possesses a flexible amino terminus lacking any given structure (10Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13452-13457Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), and it is reported that copper binding not only adds structure to this region (11Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Goodin D.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) but may also lend stability to the carboxyl terminus (12Miura T. Hori-i A. Takeuchi H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because of the capacity of PrPC to bind copper, this protein has been implicated in copper transport and metabolism (13Pauly P.C. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and in the defense mechanism of the cell against oxidative insult, possibly through a regulation of the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase activity (14Brown D.R. Besinger A. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, a recent study may lead to a re-evaluation of the link between PrP and copper metabolism (15Waggoner D.J. Drisaldi B. Bartnikas T.B. Casareno R.L. Prohaska J.R. Gitlin J.D. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7455-7458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, although it would appear that the octapeptide repeat region may not be essential for disease development (16Muramoto T. Kitamoto T. Tateishi J. Goto I. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 1411-1420PubMed Google Scholar), the insertion of additional octapeptide repeats, which could increase metal binding, results in a pathogenic mutation (17Owen F. Poulter M. Lofthouse R. Collinge J. Crow T.J. Risby D. Baker H.F. Ridley R.M. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Lancet. 1989; 1: 51-52Abstract PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus the role of copper binding by this highly conserved region of PrPC still remains unclear. Copper is an essential redox transition element and a crucial component of various enzyme systems (18Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and yet under conditions of oxidative stress copper ion-mediated damage to proteins through reactive oxygen species (ROS) is very significant. Links between oxidative stress, ROS, and neurological disorders have been reported in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, amylotrophic lateral sclerosis (19Simonian N.A. Coyle J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar), and aging itself. ROS, such as the superoxide radical (O⨪2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which although itself not an ROS is an important mediator of oxidative stress in neurons (20White A.R. Collins S.J. Maher F. Jobling M.F. Stewart L.R. Thyer J.M. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Cappai R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1723-1730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), can oxidatively modify biomolecules (21Chao C.C. Ma Y.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2969-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The generation of such ROS is promoted by the presence of copper and iron through the Fenton reaction (22Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4450) Google Scholar). In addition, when the metal ion involved is protein bound, the oxidative-reductive reaction can locally generate oxygen species that may react at specific sites in the protein itself, impairing activity or resulting in cleavage (23Kim K. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15394-15397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because oxidative stress may play a role in TSEs (24Lee D.W. Sohn H.O. Lim H.B. Lee Y.G. Kim Y.S. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 30: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it is possible that metal-catalyzed oxidation of PrPC, at its octapeptide repeat region, may be an important factor in TSEs. In fact in Alzheimer's disease, the β-amyloid precursor protein, which is another copper-binding protein, reduces Cu2+ on binding, and it is believed that its processing occurs under conditions of oxidative stress (25Multhaup G. Ruppert T. Schlicksupp A. Hesse L. Bill E. Pipkorn R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7224-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Considering this, and that PrPC may also possess the capacity to reduce Cu2+ (26Ruiz F.H. Silva E. Inestrosa N.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of ROS on the processing of PrPC. The cleavage of PrPC in the conserved middle region of the molecule, as well as the cleavage of PrPSc close to the octapeptide region, has been well documented both in cultured cells and in the brain (27Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 28Jimenez-Huete A.

Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the regulation and the physiological and pathological significance of these cleavages remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate, in the presence of ROS, that the octapeptide repeat region of PrPC undergoes a copper-dependent cleavage. This cleavage can be inhibited by the presence of additional alternative divalent metal ions. It is possible that such ROS cleavage may be involved in PrPCprocessing, a post-translational modification that could also result in the activation of the protein. Additionally, because abnormal cleavage of PrPSc occurs into the repeats, such cleavage of PrPC may be important in TSE disease development. Opti-MEM and trypsin were from Life Technologies, Inc.; MEM-alpha was from ICN; and fetal calf serum was from BioWhittaker. Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). All other reagents were from Sigma. The antibody against actin (1–19) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibody P45–66 raised against a synthetic peptide encompassing mouse PrP (MoPrP) residues 45–66 has been described earlier (30Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

Scrapie-associated fibril (SAF) 32, 60, 69, and 70 are four monoclonal antibodies produced by the group of J. Grassi (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (Saclay, France)). They were obtained using as immunogens SAFs that were prepared from infected hamster brains. In enzyme immunometric assays, SAF 60, 69, and 70 were characterized as recognizing the peptide epitope 142–160 of hamster PrP, and SAF 32 was characterized as recognizing the epitope 78–91. A mixture consisting of an equal volume of ascitis of SAF 60, 69, and 70 antibodies, namely SAF mix, was used to improve PrPC detection. MAB 8G8 recognizes epitope 94–109 of MoPrP (31Krasemann S. Groschup M.H. Harmeyer S. Hunsmann G. Bodemer W. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of cDNA encoding the wild-type PrP that is derived from the Prn-pa allele and the generation and cultures of stably transfected lines of CHO cells expressing wild-type MoPrP have been described previously (30Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Subconfluent MoPrP CHO cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and were then overlaid with opti-MEM and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Medium was then removed and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm and 4 °C; the supernatant was then recovered (conditioned medium) and used immediately, after the addition of the protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), for assay purposes. Conditioned medium was incubated with the reagents tested under the conditions indicated under “Results”. Proteins were then methanol-precipitated, resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sample buffer and boiled for 5 min before 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The latter was then followed by electroblotting onto Immobilon membranes, and PrPC was detected by using the antibodies (see above) indicated under “Results” and a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse, or as appropriate anti-rabbit, secondary antibody. The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Films were analyzed using Images Analysis software. The metal ions when used were CuSO4, MnSO4, CoCl2, ZnSO4, and CaCl2. To analyze the direct effect of H2O2 on cells, confluent MoPrP CHO cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and overlaid with opti-MEM containing H2O2 at the concentrations indicated under “Results”. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mmEDTA) for 20 min at 4 °C. The lysates were then spun at 14,000 rpm for 4 min, and the protein level in the supernatant was determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). After the addition of 2× SDS-sample buffer, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. PrPC and the epitopes that are recognized by the antibodies used in this study are diagrammatically presented in Fig.1 A. Subconfluent stably transfected MoPrP CHO cells, which were incubated for 24 h in Opti-MEM, released into the medium (conditioned medium) a large quantity of soluble full-length glycosylated PrPC lacking its glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor (data not shown). Western blots of conditioned medium showed a major band at 33 kDa that reacted with P45–66, SAF 32, 8G8, and SAF mix antibodies (Fig. 1,B, C, D, and E, lane 1, respectively). In addition, a set of bands corresponding to amino-terminal fragments of PrPC around 6.5 kDa was detected using the antibodies P45–66, SAF 32, and 8G8 (Fig. 1,B, C, and D, respectively). The size of the amino-terminal fragments and the fact that they were recognized by both P45–66 and 8G8 could indicate that a mixture of amino-terminal fragments are released into the medium (this was confirmed using 15% Tricine gel; data not shown). Such fragments could arise from multiple cleavage of the amino terminus of PrPC, from cleavage into the octapeptide repeat region and the conserved region. A band around 14 kDa, corresponding most likely to carboxyl-terminally truncated PrP, was also detected by using SAF mix (Fig.1 E). To examine the effect of H2O2 on PrPC, conditioned medium (in the presence of protease inhibitors) was incubated with 5 mmH2O2 at pH 7.0 and 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm Cu2+ over varying time periods (0–2 h). Exposure to H2O2 induced a slight increase in the molecular mass of PrPC (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 1 and 2) (this observation will be discussed later). Within 5 min a dramatic reduction in the full-length PrPC P45–66 signal was detected (Fig. 1 B) concomitant with the appearance of a P45–66-negative but SAF 32-, 8G8-, and SAF mix-positive truncated PrPC at 28.5 kDa (Fig.1, B, C, D, and E, respectively). This latter fragment remained relatively unaffected by further exposure, indicating a H2O2 cleavage that was not random, but one that occurred in the repeat region. In addition, within 5 min of exposure the intensity of the signal for the amino-terminal band (as detected by P45–66) increased by 18% (Fig.1 B, compare lanes 1 and 2). This latter increase occurred in conjunction with the loss of full-length P45–66-positive PrPC and could consequently represent an increase in detection of a cleavage product. After a further 25 min this amino-terminal band was no longer detected (Fig. 1 B,lane 4); this may be a consequence of additional cleavage of the fragment by H2O2. To further examine PrPC cleavage by H2O2, the effect of varying concentrations of this oxidant (0–5 mmH2O2) on the loss of full-length PrPC (P45–66 signal) was determined (Fig.2 A). To observe an effect with lower concentrations of H2O2, an incubation period of 24 h at 37 °C was chosen. H2O2 induced a concentration-dependent loss of the P45–66 signal, with a complete loss at a concentration of 2.5 mm (Fig.2 B). To facilitate an elucidation of the mechanism and dependence of the reaction, the effect of chelators, Me2SO, and metal ions on the cleavage was investigated (Fig. 2, C and D). In the presence of 10 μm Cu2+ and 2.5 mm H2O2 (the concentration of H2O2 allowing for a complete disappearance of the P45–66 signal in 24 h at 37 °C (Fig. 2 A)), the P45–66 signal was lost (Fig. 2 C, lane 12). Incubation of PrPC with 10 μmCu2+ alone at 37 °C did not result in cleavage (Fig.2 C, lane 2), indicating that the cleavage with H2O2 was most probably a non-enzymatic event. In addition, in the absence of added copper, H2O2 induced a slight increase in PrPC molecular mass without inducing cleavage (Fig.2 C, lane 3). The chelator (at a 1 mmconcentration) EDTA; a broad range metal chelator, bathocuproine disulfonate; a Cu1+ chelator, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA); a Cu2+ chelator; and the reagent Me2SO (10% v/v), a hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) scavenger, had no effect on their own on the migration pattern (Fig.2 C, lanes 4–7) or on the shift-up observed with H2O2 in the absence of added copper (Fig.2 C, lanes 8–11). This would indicate that the increase in molecular mass induced by H2O2 was metal ion-independent. It is possible that the increase may have been due to amino acid oxidation, a phenomenon observed with H2O2 (21Chao C.C. Ma Y.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2969-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar); this is currently under investigation. Recently it was reported that storage of PrPC under oxidative conditions induced amino acid modifications that resulted in a similar increase in theM r of PrPC (32Qin K. Yang D.S. Yang Y. Chishti M.A. Meng L.J. Kretzschmar H.A. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Westaway D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19121-19131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); this is consistent with the idea that the increased M r observed on H2O2 exposure may also be due to amino acid modification. Importantly, both EDTA and DTPA protected PrPC from cleavage induced by H2O2(Fig. 2C, lanes 13 and 15); in contrast bathocuproine disulfonate and Me2SO were without effect (Fig. 2 B, lanes 14 and 16). In addition, because it has been reported that PrPC may interact with metal ions other than copper (33Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), Cu2+ was replaced by 10 μm Co2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+ (Fig. 2 D, lanes 3–6). Cleavage by H2O2 was only detectable with Cu2+ (Fig. 2 D, lane 2); interestingly, when the other ions were added in combination with Cu2+, all but Co2+ had a significant protective effect on H2O2 cleavage (Fig.2 D, lanes 7–10). It has been shown that binding of copper by PrPC is highly pH-dependent (34Whittal R.M. Ball H.L. Cohen F.E. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Baldwin M.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Therefore, because cleavage of the amino terminus by H2O2 appeared to be dependent on Cu2+, the effect of pH on PrPC cleavage by H2O2, in the presence of 10 μmCu2+, was determined by following the P45–66 signal of full-length PrPC (Fig.3 A). Although H2O2 can induce significant cleavage of PrPC at low concentrations (Fig. 2 A), a concentration of 5 mm H2O2 was selected for this experiment to increase the rate of cleavage. Loss of signal by H2O2 was highly pH-dependent, with the rate of cleavage decreasing with decreasing pH (Fig. 3 B). It has been reported (35Brown D.R. Wong B.S. Hafiz F. Clive C. Haswell S.J. Jones I.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) that recombinant PrPC has a copper-dependent superoxide dismutase activity. Superoxide dismutases are involved in the dismutation of O⨪2 to H2O2; therefore, because H2O2 effects a cleavage of the amino terminus of the prion protein, the effect of O⨪2 on the processing of PrPC was investigated. Conditioned medium was incubated in the presence of xanthine (1 × 10−4m) and xanthine oxidase (0.02 units/ml) (O⨪2 producers) for 1 and 24 h in the presence and absence of 10 μm Cu2+ (Fig.4). After 1 and 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, in the presence and absence of Cu2+, the P45–66 signal was lost by 90, 40, 42, and 26%, respectively (Fig. 4,A and B), whereas the SAF 32 signal was lost by 99, 65, 90, and 40%, respectively (Fig. 4, C andD). Similar to H2O2, O⨪2induced a loss of the P45–66 signal, and this loss of signal was augmented by the presence of Cu2+. In addition, the loss of the P45–66 signal was more rapid than that of SAF 32, which is similar to the cleavage of PrPC by H2O2 in Fig. 1. To confirm the physiological relevance of the finding that PrPC can be cleaved by H2O2into the repeat region, confluent MoPrP CHO cells were exposed for 24 h to a range of H2O2 concentrations (0, 10, and 100 μm, which is within the range reported to be reached in rat brain under oxidative stress (25–160 μm) (36Hyslop P.A. Zhang Z. Pearson D.V. Phebus L.A. Brain Res. 1995; 671: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 5). Because the concentration of H2O2 used on the cells was lower than that used in previous experiments, it was possible to observe a concentration-dependent increase in the detection of an amino-terminal fragment within cells (Fig. 5, A andB). For the latter observation a long film exposure was employed, but with a reduced exposure a decrease in full-length PrPC was also observed (Fig. 5 C, comparelane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). This would indicate an increased cleavage of full-length PrPC under conditions of oxidative stress within the cell. In addition, because the protein level of another protein, actin, was unaffected by this treatment (Fig. 5 D), it can be inferred that exposure to H2O2 did not result in an increase of all protein cleavage. The cell surface glycosylated protein, PrPC, has been recognized as a metal-binding protein since 1992 (5Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Although the role of copper binding by PrPC remains obscure, it may be structural, because copper binding appears to induce structure to the otherwise flexible amino terminus of the protein (11Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Goodin D.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that copper binding by PrPC allows for the processing of the protein to occur under conditions of oxidative stress. In the presence of H2O2 and copper, PrPC was observed to be cleaved into the octapeptide repeat region, yielding a protein of 28.5 kDa. H2O2 cleavage was most efficient in inducing a loss of the full-length P45–66 signal; exposure also affected the SAF 32 signal (albeit at a lower rate) and resulted in further cleavage of the amino-terminal P45–66-positive fragment that was formed during the reaction. This would indicate that oxidative processing of PrPC most likely occurred within each of the metal-binding repeats, but that highest affinity was toward the repeat region after amino acid residue 66. This H2O2 cleavage of PrPC was Cu2+-dependent, because EDTA (a broad range metal ion chelator) and DTPA (a Cu2+ chelator) inhibited cleavage, whereas bathocuproine disulfonate (a Cu1+chelator) was without effect. Under oxidative stress ⋅OH is one of the most destructive biological molecules, and it is primarily generated through the breakdown of H2O2 in the presence of copper or iron in the Fenton reaction (22Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4450) Google Scholar). Although copper ions are invariably protein bound in vivo, binding does not prevent copper from participating in oxygen radical reactions but limits radical formation to the site of copper binding (23Kim K. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15394-15397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, Me2SO, a known trapping agent for ⋅OH, did not inhibit cleavage. Therefore, it can be assumed that in the case of PrPC⋅OH radical formation does not occur in solution; rather oxidation of PrP-copper by H2O2 occurs at the site of copper binding. Additionally, because binding of Cu2+ by PrPCis highly pH-dependent (34Whittal R.M. Ball H.L. Cohen F.E. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Baldwin M.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 37Miura T. Hori-i A. Mototani H. Takeuchi H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11560-11569Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), the pH dependence of the H2O2 cleavage of PrPC (Fig. 3) would further emphasize the participation of protein-bound copper in the reaction. Thus, similar to Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase in amylotrophic lateral sclerosis (23Kim K. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15394-15397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and β-amyloid precursor protein in Alzheimer's disease (25Multhaup G. Ruppert T. Schlicksupp A. Hesse L. Bill E. Pipkorn R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7224-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the results presented here would suggest that PrPC is also subject to a copper-dependent cleavage in the presence of H2O2 with the following proposed reactions.PrP­Cu2++H2O2↔PrP­Cu++O⨪2+2H+REACTION1PrP­Cu++H2O2→PrP­OH⋅+OH−→PrP cleavageREACTION2Because cleavage of PrPC, in the presence of Cu2+, was antagonized by additional divalent metals (Zn2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+, but not Co2+), it is possible that PrPC can interact with more than one metal ion at a time or that the presence of additional metal ions could interfere with Cu2+ binding. Either way the other metal ions are not known to participate in the Fenton reaction. In fact Mn2+ has the capacity to inhibit it (38Nakamura K. Oliver C. Stadtman E.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); therefore, the binding of these other metal ions could inhibit ROS cleavage by preventing the site-specific generation of⋅OH radicals. Like H2O2, O⨪2 also has the capacity to interact with bound metal ions. Recently, it was reported that PrPC may have a copper-dependent superoxide dismutase-like activity (35Brown D.R. Wong B.S. Hafiz F. Clive C. Haswell S.J. Jones I.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase has the capacity to dismutate O⨪2 to H2O2, and under normal circumstances the enzyme is believed to possess protective amino acids at its active site that protect the protein from cleavage by its dismutation product, H2O2. The results presented here would indicate that PrPC does interact with O⨪2 in a copper-dependent manner, but unlike for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, this interaction leads to cleavage of the protein. Both O⨪2 and H2O2 are available within the cell, and their levels are regulated by interdependent oxidative enzymes (39Amstad P. Moret R. Cerutti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1606-1609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With age ROS levels are known to increase (40Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar), and under conditions of oxidative stress it is reported that H2O2 can reach 26–160 μm in the brain (36Hyslop P.A. Zhang Z. Pearson D.V. Phebus L.A. Brain Res. 1995; 671: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Substantial cleavage of PrPC was observed at 100 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2 A), and exposure of cells to H2O2 at a concentration as low as 10 μm induced a significant increase in PrPC cleavage. Consequently, it is most likely that PrPC could be susceptible in vivo to ROS-mediated cleavage of its amino-terminal octapeptide repeat region. In the brain normal PrPC cleavage is believed to occur within the conserved region, yielding a fragment called C1, whereas PrPSc is thought to be cleaved outside this region, yielding a 27–30-kDa species (27Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Jimenez-Huete et al. (28Jimenez-Huete A. Lievens P.M. Vidal R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Tagliavini F. Frangione B. Prelli F. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1561-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), on studying PrPC proteolytic cleavage using deglycosylated PrPC, were able to detect a 21–22-kDa fragment. Although amino-terminal sequencing is not available for this fragment, its size would indicate that cleavage of PrPC can occur physiologically into the repeats without cleavage of the conserved region (such cleaved PrP has also been observed in our cell models (data not shown)). However, it was not known if the 21–22-kDa species could be an obligatory intermediate for C1 generation. One possibility is that the 21–22 kDa fragment may have been generated through oxidative cleavage. Such cleavage could then initiate or facilitate further proteolysis of the molecule. In fact, it has been reported that such modified proteins are more susceptible to proteolysis than their native counterparts (21Chao C.C. Ma Y.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2969-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Jimenez-Hueteet al. (28Jimenez-Huete A. Lievens P.M. Vidal R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Tagliavini F. Frangione B. Prelli F. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1561-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that PrP cleavage producing amino-truncated peptides could be stopped by EDTA and EGTA. Interestingly, a return of cleavage could only be achieved by adding the metal ions Cu2+ and Fe3+ but not by adding Mg2+, Zn2+, or Ca2+. Hence because both Cu1+ and Fe2+ can participate in the Fenton reaction, it is possible that the chelators may not have inhibited an enzymatic event but rather a reactive oxygen species event. Under normal conditions, amino-terminally truncated PrPC, resulting from ROS cleavage, could be rapidly degraded within the cell or on the cell surface. However, because PrPSc proteinase K digestion results in cleavage into the octapeptide repeats and because additional repeats in PrPC lead to abnormal properties in cells (41Lehmann S. Harris D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and CJD in familial TSEs, it is possible that oxidative cleavage of the octapeptide repeat region may be a key factor in TSEs. This theory is further emphasized because ROS, oxidatively modified proteins, and CJD phenotypic expression increase with age. Additionally, amino-terminal sequence data available for PrPSc, without proteinase K digestion, would indicate that a quantitative cleavage in the repeat region of PrPSc does occur in vivo (29Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Hope J. Multhaup G. Reekie L.J. Kimberlin R.H. Beyreuther K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The cleavage patterns that have been reported for size variants of mouse scrapie-associated fibrils are far from random, occurring three to four amino acid residues away from the copper-binding histidine in each of the octapeptide repeat regions. Because increasing evidence indicates that oxidative stress is involved in TSEs (43Guentchev M. Voigtlander T. Haberler C. Groschup M.H. Budka H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 44Choi S.I. Ju W.K. Choi E.K. Kim J. Lea H.Z. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Kim Y.S. Acta Neuropathol. 1998; 96: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and because H2O2 at a concentration as low as 10 μm altered PrPCprocessing, it is likely that PrPSc is susceptible to ROS cleavage, and it is possible that such cleavage may account forin vivo amino-terminal truncation. In addition, because a number of reports have now separated PrPSc proteinase K resistance from infectivity and neurodegeneration (45Wille H. Zhang G.F. Baldwin M.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 608-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 46Lasmezas C.I. Deslys J.P. Robain O. Jaegly A. Beringue V. Peyrin J.M. Fournier J.G. Hauw J.J. Rossier J. Dormont D. Science. 1997; 275: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), it is possible that ROS modification of the molecule could modulate its toxicity and/or its effect on PrP-mediated signal transduction, for example (47Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 48Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Fischer M. Blattler T.

Shmerling et al. (48Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Fischer M. Blattler T. Brandner S. Gotz J. Rulicke T. Flechsig E. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Hangartner C. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. Cell. 1998; 93: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) observed that expression of amino-terminally truncated PrP in Zurich Prnp o/omice led to abnormalities that were reversed by the introduction of a single PrP allele. They proposed that the carboxyl terminus of PrPC may interact with a ligand and that the full-length amino terminus, through an attachment to a secondary site on the same ligand, may induce a cell survival signal. It was also proposed that in Zurich Prnp o/o mice an additional PrP-like molecule named π could carry out the same function but that the presence of truncated PrP could also interact with the ligand, at a higher affinity than π, preventing cell survival signaling. Additionally, it was recently suggested (49Weissmann C. Aguzzi A. Science. 1999; 286: 914-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that expression of Doppel, a PrP-like molecule, except that it resembles truncated PrPC lacking the repeat region (50Moore R.C. Lee I.Y. Silverman G.L. Harrison P.M. Strome R. Heinrich C. Karunaratne A. Pasternak S.H. Chishti M.A. Liang Y. Mastrangelo P. Wang K. Smit A.F. Katamine S. Carlson G.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Melton D.W. Tremblay P. Hood L.E. Westaway D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 797-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), could also result in disease through a mechanism similar to that proposed for truncated PrPC. From the data presented here, we proposed that an increase in ROS-truncated PrPC may be pathogenic and lead to an alteration in cellular signaling. Additional repeats within PrPC, as is associated with CJD in familial TSEs, could increase copper binding and as a result susceptibility to ROS. Consequently, in CJD cases disease may present with age through a mechanism similar to that proposed by Shmerling et al.(48Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Fischer M. Blattler T. Brandner S. Gotz J. Rulicke T. Flechsig E. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Hangartner C. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. Cell. 1998; 93: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Whether ROS cleavage is fundamental to the function of PrPCor to the production of PrPSc remains to be elucidated. However, it may be proposed that such ROS processing, at a rate allowing for the formation of a low level of amino-terminally cleaved PrPC, may be important for the function of the protein, because a number of proteins require ROS post-translational modification for activation. It has been suggested that PrPC may be involved in synaptic transmission, and it was reported recently that synaptic activity can be stimulated by H2O2 in a PrPC-dependent manner (51Herms J. Tings T. Gall S. Madlung A. Giese A. Siebert H. Schurmann P. Windl O. Brose N. Kretzschmar H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8866-8875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The H2O2 effect was believed to be due to the higher synaptosomal copper content of PrPC mice over PrP−/− mice. In light of the results reported here, it is possible that the activation may have been due to a direct interaction between PrPC and H2O2, leading to PrPC cleavage and possibly increased copper release. The results presented here show for the first time that PrPC processing occurs under conditions of oxidative stress. Because cleavage of PrPC by ROS occurs into a region similar to that in PrPSc, it is possible that such cleavage may be relevant in TSEs. Consequently, the findings presented here may lead to further approaches in the prevention and treatment of such diseases. We are grateful to David Harris for providing us with the antibody P45–66."
https://openalex.org/W2166898182,We report the discovery of a transient equivalent hydrogen column density with an absorption edge at ∼3.8 kiloelectron volts in the spectrum of the prompt x-ray emission of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 990705. This feature can be satisfactorily modeled with a photoelectric absorption by a medium located at a redshift of ∼0.86 and with an iron abundance of ∼75 times the solar one. The transient behavior is attributed to the strong ionization produced in the circumburst medium by the GRB photons. The high iron abundance points to the existence of a burst environment enriched by a supernova along the line of sight. The supernova explosion is estimated to have occurred about 10 years before the burst. Our results agree with models in which GRBs originate from the collapse of very massive stars and are preceded by a supernova event.
https://openalex.org/W1975607775,"A novel Bax-associating protein, named MAP-1 (Modulator of Apoptosis), has been identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen.

They are characterized by the presence of several conserved motifs, known as the Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 domains, designated BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 (1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4751) Google Scholar). Although the N-terminal BH4 domain is restricted to some prosurvival members, BH1, BH2, and BH3 can generally be found among members of both the prosurvival and proapoptotic subfamilies (1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4751) Google Scholar, 2Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis and structural studies revealed that the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains are important for dimerization function (1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4751) Google Scholar, 2Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Association of the prosurvival member Bcl-XL with the proapoptotic member Bax requires the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains of the former but only the BH3 domain of the latter (3Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 4Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B.

Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as a protein-protein interaction domain, the BH3 domain of proapoptotic members appears to be important for mediating their proapoptotic function (3Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 4Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This notion is further supported by the recent discovery of a new group of cell death agonists containing only the BH3 domain (6Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Similar to other proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, the BH3 domain in these molecules plays an important role in mediating proapoptotic function as well as association with the prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family. The three-dimensional structure of Bcl-XL demonstrates that the BH1, BH2, and BH3 regions form an elongated hydrophobic cleft to which a BH3 amphipathic α helix can bind (5Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 7Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.L. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The other members of the Bcl-2 family that have similar domains are predicted to have a similar tertiary structure. Hence, proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family that contain multiple BH domains such as Bax are proposed to exist in two different conformations: one that is similar to Bcl-XL and the other with the BH3 domain rotated outside to allow its insertion into the hydrophobic cleft of a prosurvival protein (1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4751) Google Scholar). However, there is a lack of evidence to support the existence of a Bcl-XL-like conformation among the proapoptotic molecules that contain the BH1–3 domains. In our effort to gain further understanding of the functions of the BH domains of Bax, we used the yeast two-hybrid screen to identify Bax-associating proteins. A novel protein, termed MAP-1, was identified. MAP-1 contains a putative BH3-like domain and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in mammalian cells when overexpressed. MAP-1 forms homodimers and associates with Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL in vitro and in vivo in mammalian cells. The BH3-like domain in MAP-1 appeared to be required for mediating apoptosis and its binding to Bax, but not Bcl-XL. Interestingly, in contrast to other Bax-associating proteins, the binding of MAP-1 to Bax requires all three BH (BH1, BH2, and BH3) domains of Bax. MAP-1 thus represents a novel Bax-associating protein that may mediate apoptosis through binding to Bax. Mono- and polyclonal antibodies against the Myc epitope (9E10, A14) and HA epitope (F7) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody against PARP (C2–10) was from Dr. G. Poirier, Laval University Medical Research Center, Québec Canada. MCF-7 (gift from Dr. V. Dixit), 293T, and SH-SY5Y cells were grown and maintained as described (8Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L.

HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and the cells were grown and maintained according to the directions provided by the suppliers. The peptide protease inhibitors YVAD-fmk, ZVAD-fmk, and DEVD-fmk were from Enzyme System Products. λ-Zap human and mouse libraries were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Expression plasmids for hMAP-1, hMAP-1 deletion mutants, mBax, hBcl-XL, hBcl-2, mBimL, and mBid were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of cDNA clones using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany), with primers incorporating appropriate restriction sites, and subcloned into pXJ40HA or pXJ40Myc mammalian expression vectors (10Yee K.S. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5366-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) driven by the CMV promoter. Full-length MAP-1 cDNA was subsequently released from pXJHA-MAP-1 and cloned in-frame into GST fusion protein vector pGEX-TK4E (8Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A coding region of each construct was sequenced to ensure that no error was introduced. All epitope tags were positioned at the N terminus. Substitution mutants of MAP-1 and Bax were created using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). Deletion mutants of MAP-1 were generated by PCR with appropriate primers. Yeast two-hybrid screening was done essentially as described previously (11Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, mBaxΔC21 was cloned in-frame with Gal-4 DNA binding domain in pAS2(HA) vector and used to screen a yeast two-hybrid library derived from adult human brain (CLONTECH). Screening and subsequent protein-protein interaction studies were carried out in yeast Y190 reporter strain. cDNA fragment of B26 was used to screen human brain (cerebellum) and mouse brain λ-ZAP cDNA libraries (Stratagene) using standard techniques as described (10Yee K.S. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5366-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized with a32P-labeled cDNA probe by using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Bacterial GST-MAP-1 fusion protein was prepared as described previously (8Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Tan K.O. Tan K.M. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23687-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the recombinant protein was immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads. A GST binding assay was carried out according to a previously established procedure (8Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, 35S-labeled proteins were prepared byin vitro transcription/translation of pXJ-Myc-cDNA constructs using a TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The integrity of the 35S-labeled proteins was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Equal amounts of total 35S-labeled proteins (7 × 105 cpm of trichloroacetic acid precipitable counts) were diluted into 0.2 ml of GST binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and incubated for 1 h with GST-MAP-1 immobilized on the beads (∼2 μg). Samples were subsequently washed six times with binding buffer and boiled for 3 min in loading buffer before fractionation on 12% SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were visualized by autoradiography. 293T cells seeded on a 100-mm plate were transiently cotransfected with 10 μg each of expression plasmids driven by the CMV promoter (pXJ40) (8Chan S.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23687-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). An aliquot (1%) of the cell lysate was fractionated on SDS-PAGE for determining the expression of the proteins by Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies. The remaining lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using 1 μg of polyclonal anti-Myc antibody for 1 h on ice and then mixed with 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-agarose and incubated for another 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed once in 1 ml of lysis buffer, twice in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and once in 1 ml of lysis buffer before fractionation on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis. Apoptosis assays were carried out as described previously (8Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells seeded on a 35-mm plate at 70% confluency were transiently cotransfected with 1.5 μg each of the expression plasmids or vector and 0.3 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase. Vector plasmid was supplemented to bring the total amount of plasmids for each transfection to 5 μg. Transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE for 6 h followed by change of media, and caspase inhibitors were added to the fresh media at this point where indicated. 18 h later, cells were fixed and incubated in X-gal buffer to mark the β-galactosidase-expressing cells. Data (mean ± S.D.) are plotted as the percentage of apoptotic cells defined by the number of round blue cells over the total blue cells counted (500–800 cells) from five randomly chosen fields. MCF-7 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips at 70% confluency and cotransfected with 1.5 μg of expression plasmids of MAP-1 or vector and 0.3 μg of pEGFP (CLONTECH) using LipofectAMINE. 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 2 min with Hoescht 33342 dye (Molecular Probes Inc.) to enable nuclear staining. The cells were subsequently fixed and visualized using a Ziess Axioplan microscope as described previously (9Chan S.L. Yee K.S. Tan K.M. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17925-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As described previously (13Ronca F. Chan S.L. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4252-4260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and detached from plates by adding 1 ml of detachment buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 40 mmTris, pH 7.6). The cells were centrifuged at 300 × g, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifuging at 2800 × g and resuspended in 50 μl of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmPMSF, 2 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The nuclei were lysed by vigorous vortexing, and the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay, and equal amounts of proteins were used for SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis. Total RNA was prepared from various cell lines using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μg of total RNA from various cell lines was annealed with oligo(dT)12–18 and reversed-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for the synthesis of first strand cDNA. 2 μl of the first strand cDNA was subjected to the following PCR conditions: Initial incubation at 94 °C for 5 min, then 25 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min), ending with a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. For each experiment, PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed to ensure that equal quality and quantity of cDNA were used. Negative controls containing water instead of cDNA were included to ensure that the PCR product obtained was not due to cross-contamination of DNA. The sequence of the primers used are as follows: hMAP-1(+) (5′-TAG AGG CTC TTC AGC CTG CCC TGC-3′), hMAP-1(−) (5′-ACT CGT TGC CAT ATC CCT TCG TGG-3′), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(+) (5′-TGA AGG TCG GTG TGA ACG GAT TTG-3′), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(−) (5′-GCC TAA ATG GCC TCC AAG GAG TAA-3′). A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify Bax-associating proteins. Mouse cDNA encoding amino acids 1–171 of Bax (BaxΔC21), with the hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domain deleted to reduce toxicity in yeast (14Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), was cloned in-frame with the GAL-4 DNA binding domain and used as “bait” to screen a yeast two-hybrid human brain library (CLONTECH). From approximately two million transformants, 12 clones from the primary screen were identified, 2 of which, B26 and B100, were found to interact specifically with BaxΔC21 but not with other unrelated Gal-4 fusion proteins tested. Upon sequencing, these two clones were found to contain two independent partial complementary DNA (cDNAs) derived from the same gene. Using B26 cDNA fragment as probe, we screened a human brain (cerebellum) cDNA library and obtained several cross-hybridizing cDNA clones. The longest clone, B9, contained a 2.2-kb cDNA insert with a 1056-nucleotide open reading frame beginning with a translational initiation consensus sequence and ending with an in-frame stop codon that encoded a protein of 351 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 39 kDa (Fig.1 A). We named this protein MAP-1 for modulator of apoptosis. A corresponding murine cDNA clone was subsequently obtained by screening a mouse brain cDNA library. The amino acid sequence deduced from the murine cDNA clone is 77% identical to the human clone (Fig. 1 A). Data base searches revealed that the predicted human MAP-1 protein shares extensive amino acid sequence similarity with two other human proteins (Fig. 1 A), Ma1 (58%) (15Dalmau J. Gultekin S.H. Voltz R. Hoard R. DesChamps T. Balmaceda C. Batchelor T. Gerstner E. Eichen J. Frennier J. Posner J.B. Rosenfeld M.R. Brain. 1999; 122: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and Ma2 (47%) (16Voltz R. Gultekin S.H. Rosenfeld M.R. Gerstner E. Eichen J. Posner J.B. Dalmau J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1788-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), suggesting that MAP-1 is a member of a gene family. Ma1 and Ma2 were both initially identified as antigens recognized by autoantibodies present in the sera of some patients with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes with underlying malignancy (breast, colon, parotid for Ma1, and testicular cancer for Ma2) (15Dalmau J. Gultekin S.H. Voltz R. Hoard R. DesChamps T. Balmaceda C. Batchelor T. Gerstner E. Eichen J. Frennier J. Posner J.B. Rosenfeld M.R. Brain. 1999; 122: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar,16Voltz R. Gultekin S.H. Rosenfeld M.R. Gerstner E. Eichen J. Posner J.B. Dalmau J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1788-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). At present, no function has been described for the Ma1 and Ma2 proteins. Upon examination of the amino acid sequence of MAP-1, a region of eight amino acids (amino acids 120–127) was found to be highly similar to the BH3 domains present among members of the Bcl-2 family (Fig.1 B). The BH3-like motif identified appears to be most similar to the recently identified BH3-B domain (12Tan K.O. Tan K.M. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23687-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) present in the N-terminal region of Bid (Fig. 1 B). The amino acid sequences in Ma1 and Ma2, corresponding to the region that contains the BH3-like domain, appear to be less similar to BH-3 motif (Fig.1 A). Northern blot analysis revealed a single 2.8-kb transcript of MAP-1 to be ubiquitously expressed but at a higher level in heart and brain (Fig. 1 C). The messages of MAP-1 in total RNA isolated from MCF-7 cells could not be detected in Northern blot analysis. However, MAP-1 messages were readily detectable in MCF-7 and other human cell lines, including HeLa and SH-SY5Y with reverse transcription-linked PCR. Interestingly, Ma1 and Ma2 have a highly restricted expression patterns. Ma1 protein is detected only in brain and testis (15Dalmau J. Gultekin S.H. Voltz R. Hoard R. DesChamps T. Balmaceda C. Batchelor T. Gerstner E. Eichen J. Frennier J. Posner J.B. Rosenfeld M.R. Brain. 1999; 122: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), whereas Ma2 protein is found exclusively in brain (16Voltz R. Gultekin S.H. Rosenfeld M.R. Gerstner E. Eichen J. Posner J.B. Dalmau J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1788-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The ability of MAP-1 to associate with Bax was further demonstratedin vivo in transient cotransfection experiments. HA-tagged MAP-1, Bax, Bid, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL were transiently coexpressed with Myc-tagged MAP-1 into 293T cells, and lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation. MAP-1 immunoprecipitated specifically with Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL but not Bid (Fig.2 A). Other members of the Bcl-2 family, including BimL, Bak, Bad, and Bcl-w, also failed to interact with MAP-1 in the immunoprecipitation assay under the same experimental conditions (data not shown), suggesting that MAP-1 does not bind universally to all members of the Bcl-2 family. In addition, MAP-1 was able to homodimerize in vivo (Fig.2 A). It has been shown recently that the conformation of Bax can be affected by certain detergents such as Nonidet P-40 present in the lysis buffer, resulting in nonspecific interaction of it with some members of the Bcl-2 family (17Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Because CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid) was shown not to affect the N-terminal conformation of Bax (17Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), we performed the coimmunoprecipitation experiment as described in Fig.2 A in transient transfection analysis by lysing the 293T cells in buffer containing 0.2% CHAPS instead of Nonidet P-40. Similar to the results obtained with Nonidet P-40, MAP-1 self-associated and interacted with Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL, but not Bid under this condition (data not shown). These interactions observed in the immunoprecipitation assays were further demonstrated in vitro by using the GST-pulldown assay. The in vitro translation of MAP-1 from the pXJ-Myc-MAP-1 plasmid in rabbit reticulocyte lysates generates MAP-1 products, which always appear as two bands when fractionated on SDS-PAGE. The upper band corresponds to the predicted molecular mass (39 kDa) of MAP-1 and appears to have the same mobility as the Myc-tagged MAP-1 expressed in 293T cells (data not shown). Furthermore, anti-Myc antibody was only able to immunoprecipitate efficiently the in vitro translation product of MAP-1 represented by the upper band (data not shown), suggesting that the protein represented by the lower band does not contain the Myc epitope, and it is likely to be generated from alternate usage of initiation codon. In agreement with the in vivo results, GST-MAP-1 was able to pulldown in vitro translated 35S-labeled MAP-1, Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL but not the35S-labeled Bid (Fig. 2 B). We next examined the possible role of MAP-1 in modulating cell death by transient transfection experiments. MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with MAP-1 expression or control vector together with pCMV-β-galactosidase or pEGFP as a marker for transfected cells. At 24 h post-transfection, a significant percentage of total β-galactosidase-positive (blue) cells cotransfected with MAP-1 displayed apoptotic morphology as evidenced by the appearance of shrunken and rounded cells (Fig.3 A). Nuclear condensation, another hallmark of apoptosis, was also observed in a significant percentage of total green fluorescence-positive (green) cells cotransfected with MAP-1 (Fig. 3 B). Proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which serves as a marker for the activation of caspases in cells undergoing apoptosis (8Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,18Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar), was also detected in cells transfected with MAP-1 (Fig.3 C). Furthermore, the cleavage of PARP to the signature 85-kDa apoptotic fragment in MCF-7 cells transfected with MAP-1 was completely blocked by treatment with ZVAD-fmk (10 μm) (Fig. 3 C). A series of caspase inhibitors were tested for their ability to inhibit apoptosis triggered by MAP-1 overexpression. YVAD-fmk (50 μm), a specific inhibitor of caspase-1-like caspases, and DEVD-fmk (50 μm), an inhibitor of caspase-3-like caspases, conferred no and partial protection, respectively, against MAP-1-mediated killing (Fig. 3 D). However, ZVAD-fmk (10 μm), a wide-spectrum caspase inhibitor, was able to abrogate the apoptotic activity of MAP-1 (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that MAP-1 mediates apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway. Similar to Bax-mediated apoptosis, overexpression of Bcl-XL effectively blocked the apoptotic effect of MAP-1 (Fig. 3 E). The effect of MAP-1 in mediating apoptosis is not restricted to MCF-7 cells, because overexpression of MAP-1 was able to induce apoptosis (judged by round cell and nuclear condensation assays) in both HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). Similar to human MAP-1, mouse MAP-1 induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells and associated with Bax and Bcl-XL in immunoprecipitation assay in transient cotransfection experiments (data not shown). We next proceeded to evaluate the requirement of the BH3-like domain in MAP-1 for mediating protein-protein interaction and proapoptotic functions. A series of Myc-tagged MAP-1 mutants was created (Fig.4 A). Deletion of the entire BH3-like domain (M1) or substitution mutations of several conserved amino acids (GHE/VLA) in the putative BH3-like domain (M2) of MAP-1 abrogated its interaction with Bax (Fig. 4 B). The conserved leucine residue in the BH3 domains of Bax and Bad was reported to be critical for mediating interaction with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL(19Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24101-24104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 20Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) as well as for the N-terminal BH3-B domain of Bid to interact with its C terminus (12Tan K.O. Tan K.M. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23687-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Substitution of this conserved leucine of the BH3 domain, but not the nonconserved histidine, to glutamic acid (M3, M4), in MAP-1 was found to substantially weaken its interaction with Bax (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, in contrast to most proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, the BH3-like domain in MAP-1 did not appear to be required for interaction with Bcl-XLas deletion of the entire BH3-like domain (M1) of MAP-1 did not affect its binding to Bcl-XL (Fig. 4 C). In addition, deletion mutant containing the BH3-like domain (M6) failed to interact with Bcl-XL, whereas the N-(M5) and C-(M7) terminal regions of MAP-1 were able to independently associate with Bcl-XL(Fig. 4 C). Similar to many BH3-domain containing molecules (1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4751) Google Scholar, 2Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), the BH3-like domain in MAP-1 appeared to be required for its cell death function as deletion of this domain (M1) or mutations of the highly conserved amino acids in this domain (M2, M3) resulted in nonapoptotic protein (Fig.4 D). The H126E (M4) mutant of MAP-1 that maintained binding to Bax also retained proapoptotic activity at a level similar to the wild-type MAP-1. Despite the presence of the BH3-like domain, the M6 mutant failed to induce apoptosis (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that the BH3-like domain alone is not sufficient for mediating apoptosis. Although it has been reported that peptides encompassing essentially the BH3 domain are capable of inducing apoptosis (21Cosulich S.C. Worrall V. Hedge P.J. Green S. Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 913-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22Holinger E.P. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13298-13304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), the BH3 domain alone has also been shown to be insufficient for inducing apoptosis (23Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24494-24498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Ray R. Chen G. Vande V.C. Cizeau J. Park J.H. Reed J.C. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1439-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). On the other hand, because no functional activity such as protein-protein interaction or apoptosis induction has been demonstrated with the M6 mutant, we cannot rule out the possibility that M6 mutant may not fold properly at all, which could result in a totally inactive protein. Additional experiments involving other BH3 domain-containing protein fragments or peptides of MAP-1 are clearly needed to resolve the issue whether the BH3-like region in MAP-1 is sufficient for mediating protein-protein interaction and/or inducing apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest that the BH3-like domain in MAP-1 is required for interaction with Bax and mediating apoptosis. Although both the N- and C-terminal fragments of MAP-1 were able to associate with Bcl-XL, none of these mutants (M5 and M7) were found to be proapoptotic (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that interaction with Bcl-XL is insufficient to render the molecule proapoptotic. Several highly conserved amino acid residues of the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains among Bcl-2 family members have been demonstrated to be critical for heterodimerization functions (20Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 26Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). To evaluate the requirement of the BH domains of Bax in mediating interaction with MAP-1, substitution point mutations of these critical amino acid residues in the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains were made. In agreement with previous data, mutation of the BH3 (L63E), but not the BH1 (G108A) or BH2 (W151A) domains of Bax, abolished its binding to Bcl-XL(Fig. 5 A). However, none of the point mutants were able to bind MAP-1 (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that the three BH domains (BH1, BH2, and BH3) of Bax are all required for mediating protein-protein interaction with MAP-1. Yeast two-hybrid experiments, performed with these Bax mutations in the BaxΔC21 context to examine their interaction with the B26 clone, yielded similar results (data not shown). In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of a Bax-associating protein, MAP-1. Several proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family have been identified by using prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system (27Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, 28Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 29Hsu S.Y. Kaipia A. McGee E. Lomeli M. Hsueh A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12401-12406Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, there has been no report in the literature for the identification of protein partners of proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bax using this system. This in part may be due to the toxicity exhibited by some proapoptotic members of Bcl-2 family in yeast which limits its utility in this system (14Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 30Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the observation that, by eliminating the hydrophobic C-terminal tail of Bax, the toxicity of Bax was substantially reduced in yeast, although it was still capable of mediating apoptosis in mammalian cells (14Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Using BaxΔC21 as bait, we managed to screen for protein partners of Bax. Interestingly, we failed to identify any prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-XL in our screen. Two possible reasons may account for this observation. First, cDNAs encoding prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family may be in extremely low abundance in the library. Second, Bax may associate only weakly with the prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family in this system. Indeed, we noted that interaction of Bax with Bcl-XL was relatively weak in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown). MAP-1 contains a putative BH3 domain and associates with Bax, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-2 in vitro and in vivo in mammalian cells. It mediates caspase-dependent apoptosis when overexpressed. The BH3-like domain in MAP-1 is required for binding to Bax, but not Bcl-XL, and for mediating apoptosis. Interestingly, in contrast to other known Bax-associating proteins, the binding of Bax to MAP-1 requires all of the BH (BH1, BH2, and BH3) domains of Bax, because point mutations affecting any one of the BH domains abolished its binding to MAP-1. MAP-1 thus represents the first protein partner of Bax identified that requires all the BH domains of Bax for association. Why do some proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family contain BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains resembling those of the prosurvival members of Bcl-2 family? The crystal structure of Bcl-XL suggested that it shares similarity to the pore-forming domains of bacterial toxins such as colicins A1 and E1 and diphtheria toxin (7Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.L. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). It has been reported that regions encompassing part of the BH1 and BH2 domains may have pore-forming function (2Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). In addition, Bax was shown to form an ion channel in vitro (2Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). However, it still remains to be determined whether the Bcl-2 family of proteins actually forms channelsin vivo and whether these proteins regulate apoptosis via the creation of ion channels (31Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Instead of the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains forming a receptor structure, as in the case of Bcl-XL (6Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), the BH domains in Bax have been suggested to serve independent functions. The BH3 domain of Bax has been proposed to be involved in binding the permeability transition pore and inducing permeability transition and cytochromec release from the mitochondria (31Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 32Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed that the BH3 domain of Bax mediates its proapoptotic effect by binding to the prosurvival molecule Bcl-XL and, hence, displacing the binding of Apaf-1 from Bcl-XL leading to caspase-9 activation (33Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 34Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Wu D. Inohara N. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). However, the validity of this model was recently challenged, because a physiologically relevant level of stable interaction between Apaf-1 and Bcl-XL cannot be demonstrated (35Moriishi K. Huang D.C. Cory S. Adams J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9683-9688Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 36Newmeyer D.D. Bossy-Wetzel E. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Beere H.M. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, the BH3-domain-only molecule Bid was found to associate with Bax through its BH1 domain (26Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Thus, Bid is the only proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family known to associate with Bax prior to MAP-1. This association appears to alter the conformation of Bax and lead to the release of cytochrome cfrom the mitochondria (37Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Hence, multiple mechanisms are likely to be responsible for the apoptotic effects mediated by Bax. Identification of MAP-1 as a novel Bax-associating protein may thus provide further opportunities for investigating the complex mechanisms operated by Bax. We are grateful to Drs. Suzanne Cory and David Huang for providing us with many of the cDNA clones employed in this study."

To study the functional consequences of this mutation, we examined a wild type and two I79N-transgenic mouse lines of human cardiac TnT driven by a murine α-myosin heavy chain promoter. Extensive characterization of the transgenic I79N lines compared with wild type and/or nontransgenic mice demonstrated: 1) normal survival and no cardiac hypertrophy even with chronic exercise; 2) large increases in Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase activity and force in skinned fibers; 3) a substantial increase in the rate of force activation and an increase in the rate of force relaxation; 4) lower maximal force/cross-sectional area and ATPase activity; 5) loss of sensitivity to pH-induced shifts in the Ca2+ dependence of force; and 6) computer simulations that reproduced experimental observations and suggested that the I79N mutation decreases the apparent off rate of Ca2+ from troponin C and increases cross-bridge detachment rateg. Simulations for intact living fibers predict a higher basal contractility, a faster rate of force development, slower relaxation, and increased resting tension in transgenic I79N myocardium compared with transgenic wild type. These mechanisms may contribute to mortality in humans, especially in stimulated contractile states.

FHC is an autosomal dominant disease, characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, myofibril disarray, and sudden death. Numerous studies have shown that FHC is caused by missense mutations in various genes that encode for β-myosin heavy chain (11Watkins H. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Hum. Mol.

Whereas individuals with β-myosin heavy chain mutations, in general, have a higher level of cardiac hypertrophy, those with TnT mutations have less hypertrophy, but a higher incidence of sudden cardiac death in young adults (10Watkins H. McKenna W.J. Thierfelder L. Suk H.J. Anan R. O'Donoghue A. Spirito P. Matsumori A. Moravec C.S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J.

To date, 15 human cardiac TnT mutations have been associated with FHC: I79N, R92Q/W/L, R94L, A104V, F110I, R130C, ΔE160, E163K, E163K/R, E244D, R278C, and a mutation that arises from abnormal splicing of Intron 16 (G1 → A) (23Watkins H. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Feng H.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2456-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Among these mutations, the I79N mutation is of special interest because it has been found to cause the highest risk of sudden cardiac death in young adults (10Watkins H. McKenna W.J. Thierfelder L. Suk H.J. Anan R. O'Donoghue A. Spirito P. Matsumori A. Moravec C.S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). At present, there is no clear understanding of why this TnT-I79N mutation is associated with increased sudden cardiac death. Several investigators have demonstrated an in vitro effect of the TnT-I79N mutation on the contractile properties of cardiac and skeletal muscle with conflicting results. Lin et al. (24Lin D. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), using rat cardiac TnT containing a mutation in an equivalent position to the TnT-I79N mutation in humans, showed that this mutant TnT had a normal affinity for actin-tropomyosin and conferred normal Ca2+sensitivity to acto-S1 ATPase activity. The regulated thin filaments, however, moved 50% faster over heavy meromyosin than control filaments in an in vitro motility assay. Additional measurements utilizing the same system carried out by Homsher et al. (25Homsher E. Lee D.M. Morris C. Pavlov D. Tobacman L.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 233-243Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) revealed that heavy meromyosin exerted reduced isometric force on single thin filaments reconstituted with the TnT-I79N mutant. Sweeney et al. (26Sweeney H.L. Feng H.S. Yang Z. Watkins H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14406-14410Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) reported that TnT-I79N-transfected quail skeletal muscle myotubes had decreased Ca2+ sensitivity of force production, whereas the unloaded shortening velocity was increased about 2-fold. An embryonic isoform of rat TnT-I79N expressed in adult rat cardiac myocytes causes a decreased Ca2+sensitivity of isometric force (27Rust E.M. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our results on TnT-I79N-reconstituted porcine fibers (28Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) are in accord with those of Morimoto et al. (29Morimoto S. Yanaga F. Minakami R. Ohtsuki I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C200-C207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who demonstrated that TnT-I79N reconstituted skinned rabbit trabeculae increased the Ca2+sensitivity of contraction. A very recent study of Yanaga et al. (30Yanaga F. Morimoto S. Ohtsuki I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8806-8812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) confirmed increased Ca2+ sensitivity of myofibrillar ATPase activity of TnT-I79N- reconstituted rabbit cardiac myofibrils. Part of the disparity is likely due to the differentin vitro assays used by these investigators, which illustrates the need to study the effect of the mutations in anin vivo system.Until now, a transgenic model for the TnT-I79N has not been reported, although other TnT transgenic mice have been described. A truncated CTnT in transgenic mice studied by Tardiff et al. (31Tardiff J.C. Factor S.M. Tompkins B.D. Hewett T.E. Palmer B.M. Moore R.L. Schwartz S. Robbins J. Leinwand L.A. J. Clin.

Animals with higher levels of transgene expression died within 24 h of birth. Another TnT transgenic animal model reported by Marian's lab was generated for the human cardiac TnT-R92Q mutation using a murine CTnT promoter (32Oberst L. Zhao G. Park J.T. Brugada R. Michael L.H.

The level of expression in transgenic lines (wild type and R92Q) varied from 1 to 10% of the total CTnT pool. The authors observed diastolic dysfunction and myocyte disarray in the mutant mice as compared with wild type mice (32Oberst L. Zhao G. Park J.T. Brugada R. Michael L.H. Entman M.L. Roberts R. Marian A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The same TnT-R92Q mutant was expressed in transgenic mice in Leinwand's laboratory where the level of R92Q expression varied from 30 to 92% (33Tardiff J.C. Hewett T.E. Palmer B.M. Olsson C. Factor S.M. Moore R.L. Robbins J. Leinwand L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A murine CTnT cDNA and a rat α-myosin heavy chain promoter were used in their study. The R92Q hearts demonstrated significant induction of atrial natriuretic factor and β-myosin heavy chain transcripts, interstitial fibrosis, and mitochondrial pathology. Moreover, a basal sarcomeric activation and impaired relaxation were observed in the mutant mouse (33Tardiff J.C. Hewett T.E. Palmer B.M. Olsson C. Factor S.M. Moore R.L. Robbins J. Leinwand L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In a very recent paper of Lim et al. (34Lim D.S. Oberst L. McCluggage M. Youker K. Lacy J. DeMayo F. Entman M.L. Roberts R. Michael L.H. Marian A.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 365-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a murine α-myosin heavy chain promoter was used to produce a transgenic mouse expressing human cardiac TnT-R92Q (34Lim D.S. Oberst L. McCluggage M. Youker K. Lacy J. DeMayo F. Entman M.L. Roberts R. Michael L.H. Marian A.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 365-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The level of protein expression was relatively low, and the mutant mice demonstrated myocyte disarray and excess interstitial collagen. Interestingly, none of these transgenic mice demonstrated significant cardiac hypertrophy.To have an in vivo model of the TnT-I79N mutation and to possibly clarify some of the conflicting in vitro results, we have developed a transgenic model of this mutation. We examined a wild type (Tg-WT) and two I79N-transgenic mouse lines (Tg-I79N) of HCTnT driven by a murine α-myosin heavy chain promoter. The levels of expression of either Tg-WT or Tg-I79N, relative to mouse CTnT, were 71% (WT) or 35 and 52% in the two I79N lines. Extensive characterization of the Tg-I79N lines compared with Tg-WT and/or non-Tg mice demonstrated: 1) normal survival and no cardiac hypertrophy even with chronic exercise in all groups; 2) large increases in the Ca2+ sensitivity of the ATPase activity and force development in skinned fibers; 3) a substantial increase in the rate of force activation and an increase in the rate of force relaxation in flash photolysis experiments; 4) significantly lower maximal force/cross-sectional area and ATPase activity; 5) loss of sensitivity to pH-induced shifts in the Ca2+ dependence of force correlated with HCTnT-I79N expression levels; and 6) computer simulations of force-pCa relations and of flash photolysis experiments that reproduced the experimental observations and suggested that the HCTnT-I79N mutation decreases the apparent off rate of Ca2+from the Ca2+ specific site of TnC and increases the cross-bridge apparent detachment rate g. Simulations for intact living fibers predict a higher basal contractility, a faster rate of force development, a slower isometric relaxation, and increased resting tension in Tg-I79N myocardium compared with Tg-WT. A higher basal contractility and residual resting tension limit the contractile reserve and make the ventricle vulnerable to further diastolic dysfunction. It is likely that these mechanisms contribute to the mortality observed in patients with a TnT-I79N-induced FHC especially in stimulated states of contractility such as seen during vigorous exercise or during inotropic therapy.MATERIALS AND METHODSClone ConstructionThe cDNA for wild type human cardiac troponin T (adult isoform) was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR using primers based on the published cDNA sequence (35Townsend P.J. Farza H. MacGeoch C. Spurr N.K. Wade R. Gahlmann R. Yacoub M.H. Barton P.J. Genomics. 1994; 21: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and standard methods (36Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapter 8. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar): HCTnT, 5′-GACCATGGCTGACATAGAAGAGGT; HCTnT, 3′-GAGGATCCTATTTCCAGCGCCCGGTGACTT. The I79N mutant was made using overlapping sequential PCR (36Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapter 8. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant cDNAs were constructed to have an Nco I site at the amino-terminal ATG, and a Bam HI site following the stop codon to facilitate cloning into pET-3d (Novagen), which was used for bacterial expression of the proteins.Transgene ConstructThe wild type and mutant cDNAs were cloned into the uniqueSal I site of the plasmid, α-myosin heavy chain clone 26 (a generous gift from Dr. Jeffrey Robbins), by filling in thisSal I site along with the Nco I andBam HI sites of the cDNAs and ligating the blunt fragments. The resulting construct contains about 5.5 kilobases of the mouse α-myosin heavy chain promoter, including the first 2 exons and part of the third, followed by the HCTnT cDNA (876 base pairs), and a 630-base pair 3′-untranslated region from the human growth hormone transcript.Generation of Tg MiceThe transgene vector described above was purified on a cesium chloride gradient and restricted with Not I to release a 7-kilobase fragment that was used for microinjection. This fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by electroelution onto DEAE paper (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory Laboratory, Cold Spring Habor, NY1989Google Scholar) and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Pronuclei were injected, and the surviving embryos were implanted using standard methods (38Brinster R.L. Chen H.Y. Trumbauer M.E. Yagle M.K. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Founder mice were identified by preparing tail clip DNA and analyzing its hybridization to a probe corresponding to the human growth hormone 3′-untranslated region (a 630-base pairHin dIII/Eco RI fragment from the transgenic construct). The PCR was also used to identify Tg mice. A forward/sense primer (5′-TTCGACCTGCAGGAGAAGTT-3′) was derived from HCTnT cDNA sequence, and a reverse/antisense primer (5′-AGCAACTCAAATGTCCCACC-3′) was derived from human growth hormone sequence; these produced a 713-base pair fragment in mice harboring the transgene. Stable transgenic lines were generated by breeding founder Tg mice to non-Tg B6/SJL mice.DNA and RNA Analysis of Tg MiceGenomic Southern BlotsLarge molecular weight genomic DNA was prepared from liver according to Sambrook et al. (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory Laboratory, Cold Spring Habor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the concentration was determined by measuring the fluorescence of the Hoechst 33258 (bisbenzimide) dye (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Copy number was estimated by quantitative densitometry (Molecular Dynamics Densitometer) of Southern blots that had known amounts of the transgene as standards.Northern BlotsNorthern blots were performed on RNA extracted from tissues from non-Tg and Tg mice. All Tg mice hearts had an appropriately sized transcript that hybridized to the human growth hormone 3′-untranslated probe, suggesting that the transgene was being transcribed correctly. This probe was not predicted to hybridize with RNA from nontransgenic hearts or transgenic liver.Primer ExtensionTo quantify the relative levels of RNA from the transgene and the endogenous mouse cardiac TnT gene, a primer extension experiment was designed (39Treisman R. Proudfoot N.J. Shander M. Maniatis T. Cell. 1982; 29: 903-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A radiolabeled oligonucleotide was used to prime reverse transcriptase toward the 5′ end of the RNA transcripts, resulting in radioactive products whose size reflects the length of the primer from the 5′ terminus of the RNA. The oligonucleotide primer (5′-TCCTCCTCGTACTCYTCCACCACCT-3′) was complementary to a conserved region of both transcripts that extended from nucleotide +17 to +41 relative to the ATG (i.e. the region coding for amino acids 6–14 of both human and mouse CTnT). The template for the primer extension experiment was total RNA isolated from 8–10-week-old Tg and non-Tg animals.Reverse Transcription-PCRRNA was prepared from hearts of transgenic and nontransgenic mice using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (40Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). Total cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.Protein Analysis of Tg Mice (Western Blotting)Mouse hearts and pieces of human hearts were homogenized in a solution of 20% SDS and 10% β-mercaptoethanol. Small amounts of each homogenate were diluted, and their respective protein content was determined by the Coomassie Plus Bio-Rad protein assay. Homogenates were boiled in an equivalent volume of Laemmli loading buffer, mixed together in defined ratios based on protein content, electrophoresed on SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide (61:1 ratio) gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Idea Scientific, Minneapolis, MN). Human cardiac TnT was detected using a human CTnT-specific monoclonal antibody (clone 7G7, Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ) at a 1:2000 dilution in BLOTTO (5% nonfat dry milk, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl). Total CTnT (i.e. mouse and human CTnT) was detected using a polyclonal CTnT antibody (at a 1:3000 dilution in BLOTTO) produced in our lab. The relative reactivity of the polyclonal antibody to the human and mouse CTnTs were the same based on Western blot analysis using the same protein amount of human and mouse heart tissue. HCTnT in Tg-WT and two Tg-l79N lines were determined by comparison of the immunoreactive products of the electrophoresed samples with the standard curve. The standard curve was generated from the signal intensity obtained from different ratios of human and mouse tissues (by protein content) reacted with both the monoclonal (clone 7G7) and polyclonal CTnT antibodies. Nearly identical results were obtained for the relative levels of HCTnT protein in the non-Tg and Tg mice from either a standard curve of the ratio of polyclonal antibody band intensity to monoclonal band intensityversus the percentage of HCTnT or the monoclonal band intensity versus the percentage of HCTnT (see Fig. 2). Immunoreactivity was detected using goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase or rabbit anti-goat IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase (both used at 1:3000 dilution; Sigma). Color was developed using diaminobenzidine/H2O2 (Sigma). Quantitative densitometry of Western blots were done using a Molecular Dynamics Densitometer. Two hearts from each transgenic line were independently analyzed on three different blots to assess the relative levels of HCTnT protein in non-Tg, Tg-WT, and Tg-I79N mutant lines. Human heart samples, obtained from a transplant patient at Jackson Memorial Hospital adjacent to the University of Miami School of Medicine, were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −150 °C until use. These heart samples showed little or no sign of degradation as based on Western blotting analysis.Mice Exercise ProtocolA swimming protocol mainly described by Geisterfer-Lowranceet al. (41Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Christe M. Conner D.A. Ingwall J.S. Schoen F.J. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Science. 1996; 272: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) was utilized. Groups of four 2-month-old animals representing the different lines were exercised by swimming. Mice were adapted to the swimming program by beginning with 10-min sessions two times a day separated by 4 h. These were incremented by 10 min/day until reaching 90 min/session. The program was completed in 4 weeks. Animals were weighed weekly. During each session, they were monitored for inability to sustain the exercise and/or sudden death. During weekly intervals and at the conclusion of the program, mice were sacrificed and heart to body weight ratio was determined.Skinned Fibers StudiesGlycerinated FibersSteady State Force DevelopmentA bundle of 3–5 fibers isolated from a batch of glycerinated fibers (stored for 1–2 weeks in −20 °C) were attached by tweezer clips to a force transducer, placed in a 1-ml cuvette and bathed in the pCa 8 solution (10−8m [Ca2+], 1 mm[Mg2+], 7 mm EGTA, 5 mm[MgATP2+], 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 20 mm creatinine phosphate, and 15 units/ml of creatinine phosphokinase; ionic strength = 150 mm), containing 1% Triton X-100. The length and diameter of each fiber were immediately measured after mounting the fiber to the transducer. The average length and diameter of the fibers selected for the experiment were ∼1.3–1.7 mm and 150–250 μm, respectively. The fibers were tested for steady state force development in the pCa 4 solution (composition is the same as pCa 8 buffer except the [Ca2+] was 10−4m) and relaxed in the pCa 8 solution. Steady state force developed by non-Tg, the wild type Tg-WT and its mutant, Tg-I79N fibers were compared.Ca2+ Dependence of Force DevelopmentAfter measurements of the initial steady state force of the fibers, they were relaxed in the pCa 8 buffer and then exposed to the solutions of increasing Ca2+ concentrations (from pCa 8 to pCa 4). The maximal force was measured in each “pCa” solution followed by the short relaxation of the fibers in the pCa 8 solution. Data were analyzed using the following equations: % Force Restored = 100 × (Force Restored − Residual Force)/Initial Force; % Change in Force = 100 × [Ca2+]n/([Ca2+]n + [Ca2+50] n) where [Ca2+50] is the free Ca2+concentration that produces 50% force and n is the Hill coefficient (n H).Rates of Force ActivationFor the kinetic measurements the bundle of 3–5 fibers was attached by tweezer clips to a force transducer, placed in a 1-ml cuvette, and bathed in the pCa 8 solution. The fibers were tested for steady state force development in the pCa 4 solution and relaxed in the pCa 8 solution. Then they were exposed to 2.5 mm DM-nitrophen, 1.002 mmCaCl2, 100 mm, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 1.4 mm ATP, 10 mmglutathione, 29.4 mm(1,6-hexamethylenediamine-N,N,N′,N′,-tetraacetic acid), and 20 mm creatine phosphate, pH 7.1. Subsequent to irridation by a 1-ms UV light pulse from Xenon lamp (model XFL-35S-30171), the Ca2+ chelator was cleaved, releasing free Ca2+. Its high affinity for Ca2+before photolysis, K d decreased from 5.0 × 10−9 to 3.0 × 10−3m, following the UV flash. As a result of the rapid Ca2+release, the fibers developed isometric tension, characterized by a two exponential time course. The rate constants of activation, was calculated according to the equation: y =A(1 − e −k1t) +B(1 − e −k2t) + C, where k 1 and k 2 are the rate constants and A and B are the amplitudes of the force transient. We believe that the major fast component is due to the rapid activation of contraction and that the minor slow component is due to a diffusion process related to re-equilibration of the fiber with the bulk solution after the flash.Rates of Force RelaxationThe initial step of the fiber preparation was the same as for the measurement of the activation rates. To monitor the relaxation rates, a photolabile derivative of O,O′-bis(2-aminophenyl)ethyleneglycol-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrapotassium, Diazo-2, was used. Diazo-2 is able to rapidly chelate Ca2+ upon photolysis converting from a low affinity (K d = 2.2 μm) to high affinity (K d = 0.073 μm) for Ca2+. After testing steady state force, the fibers were immersed in the solution of 2 mm Diazo-2, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 60 mm TES, pH 7.0, 5 mmMgATP, 1 mm [Mg2+], and 10 mmcreatine phosphate along with 15 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (ionic strength = 200 mm) adjusted with potassium propionate. At the ratio of total added Ca2+ to Diazo-2 given above, the resulting average initial force will be around 80% of the maximal force measured in the pCa 4 solution. The ratio provides the greatest extent of relaxation after photolysis of the Di"

We showed previously that cell-free NADPH oxidase activation by these lipids involves both protein kinase-dependent and -independent pathways. Here we demonstrate that only the protein kinase-independent pathway is operative in a cell-free system of purified and recombinant NADPH oxidase components. Activation by PA + DG was ATP-independent and unaffected by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, indicating the lack of protein kinase involvement. Both PA and DG were required for optimal activation to occur. The drug R59949 reduced activation of NADPH oxidase by either arachidonic acid or PA + DG, with IC50 values of 46 and 25 μm, respectively. The optimal concentration of arachidonic acid or PA + DG for oxidase activation was shifted to the right with R59949, indicating interference of the drug with the interaction of lipid activators and enzyme components. R59949 inhibited the lipid-induced aggregation/sedimentation of oxidase components p47phox and p67phox, suggesting a disruption of the lipid-mediated assembly process. The direct effects of R59949 on NADPH oxidase activation complicate its use as a “specific” inhibitor of DG kinase.

They found that the DG kinase inhibitor R59949 blocked the formation of PA from DG as well as the activation of NADPH oxidase by DG.R59949 inhibits DG kinase with an IC50 value of 1.25 × 10−7m in isolated platelet membranes and in intact platelets (27De Chaffoy de Courcelles D.

However, at concentrations above 10−5m, the drug has nonspecific effects on overall lipid and protein metabolism (28De Chaffoy de Courcelles D. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1990; 24: 491-496PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, R59949 has been widely used (29Jones D.R. Pettitt T.R. Sanjuan M.A. Merida I. Wakelam M.J. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that R59949 is selective for Ca2+-activated DG kinases and that the drug interacts with the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. These observations raise the possibility that the effect ofR59949 on cell-free NADPH oxidase activation (17Erickson R.W. Langel-Peveri P., A.E. Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22243-22250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) is unrelated to inhibition of DG kinase, since high concentrations were used, and Ca2+ was not present in the activation system.Here, we further analyzed the individual roles of PA and DG on NADPH oxidase activation using purified and recombinant NADPH oxidase components. Optimal activation still required both PA and DG, and activation was independent of ATP and protein kinase activity. We used this system to further study the mechanism of activation of NADPH oxidase. We found that R59949 acts in a DG kinase-independent manner on this process through competition between R59949 and lipids during the activation process. This characteristic of R59949 should be considered before it is used at higher concentrations (>10 μm) in either in vivo or in vitro assays. These results strongly suggest that both PA and DG interact directly with NADPH oxidase components and that this interaction is responsible for the protein kinase-independent mechanism of oxidase activation by these lipid second messengers.DISCUSSIONHere, we provide evidence that the second messenger lipids PA and DG interact directly with components of NADPH oxidase to induce assembly and activation of the enzyme. This evidence includes the following. 1) NADPH oxidase activation by PA plus DG in the semi-recombinant cell-free system was ATP-independent and insensitive to the nonselective protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, indicating a phosphorylation-independent mechanism; 2) PA + DG induced NADPH oxidase activation when only oxidase components were present (the purified-recombinant system); 3) PA and DG were both required for optimal activation, suggesting that each lipid may have one or more oxidase protein targets; and 4) the drug R59949 competitively inhibited the interaction of PA and DG with oxidase components and prevented the assembly of p47phox and p67phox with flavocytochrome b 558.Previously (16Qualliotine-Mann D.

A. 1995; 92: 7931-7935Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), using mixtures of membrane and cytosolic fractions from human neutrophils, we found that NADPH oxidase activation by PA + DG involved both protein kinase-dependent and -independent pathways. A novel cytosolic PA-activated protein kinase capable of phosphorylating two NADPH oxidase components (p47phox and p22phox) was implicated as responsible for the phosphorylation-dependent pathway (10McPhail L.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22243-22250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) suggested that DG kinase contributes to a phosphorylation-dependent pathway in mixtures of membrane and cytosolic fractions. These pathways are clearly not operative in the semi-recombinant cell-free system, where recombinant cytosolic oxidase components replace neutrophil cytosol.Based on the results reported here, it is evident that the phosphorylation-independent mechanism of NADPH oxidase activation by PA + DG involves direct interaction between the lipids and oxidase components. This direct mechanism is likely analogous to that used by AA, since the drug R59949 caused a similar shift to the right in the concentration curves of either AA or PA + DG. AA has been shown to directly induce conformational changes in both flavocytochromeb 558 and p47phox (20Swain S.D. Helgerson S.L. Davis A.R. Nelson L.K. Quinn M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29502-29510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Park H.S. Park J.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13400-13410Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), resulting in the SH3 domain-mediated binding of p47phox with the p22phox subunit of the flavocytochrome (49Shiose A. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13793-13801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). PA has been shown to induce partial activation of purified flavocytochromeb 558 in the absence of cytosolic components (23Koshkin V. Pick E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the aggregation/sedimentation of p47phox and p67phox by R59949 implies that the lipids bind to one or both of these components. A likely target for lipid binding is p47phox, since a change in conformation of p47phox appears to initiate the translocation/assembly process (49Shiose A. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13793-13801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 50Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have shown in a separate study 2W.-X. Zhang, J. B. Nixon, T. L. Leto, and L. C. McPhail, manuscript in preparation. that PA selectively binds to p47phox. DG can enhance the binding of PA to the enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase through a proposed mechanism involving effects of DG on the clustering of PA molecules in the lipid bilayer (52Cornell R.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The synergy between PA and DG for NADPH oxidase activation could involve a similar mechanism. Studies to address these issues are under way.Our results also clearly show that the DG kinase inhibitor R59949directly interferes with the ability of lipids to activate NADPH oxidase. Because of its lipophilic nature, R59949 may exert its effect by interaction with the lipids, preventing their binding to NADPH oxidase components. Alternatively, R59949 may compete for the lipid binding site(s) on oxidase proteins. Binding sites on DG kinase or other proteins for R59949 have not been identified. It is possible thatR59949 competes with DG for binding to the active site of certain DG kinase isoforms; however, the catalytic binding site for DG is not known (53Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 54Van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and kinetic studies to address this possibility have not been published. Our results show that increasing the concentration of DG was more effective than increasing the concentration of PA at overcoming the inhibition by the drug. Increasing the concentration of AA could also overcome the effect of the drug. This suggests that, in the oxidase system, R59949 is primarily competitive with DG or AA.The direct inhibitory effect on NADPH oxidase activation by R59949complicates interpretation of previous results (17Erickson R.W. Langel-Peveri P., A.E. Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22243-22250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using this inhibitor to implicate DG kinase in cell-free NADPH oxidase activation. Erickson et al. (17Erickson R.W. Langel-Peveri P., A.E. Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22243-22250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that R59949 inhibited the conversion of DG to PA and also blocked the ability of DG alone to activate NADPH oxidase. Our results suggest that the inhibition of NADPH oxidase by R59949 in those studies could be due to competition with lipids for oxidase activation. However, since in our hands DG alone cannot activate NADPH oxidase, it is likely that the conversion of some of the added DG to PA by DG kinase was involved in the activation observed by Erickson et al. (17Erickson R.W. Langel-Peveri P., A.E. Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22243-22250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). DG kinase may play a regulatory role in intact neutrophils, since a number of studies (55Gomez-Cambronero J. Molski T.F.P. Becker E.L. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 56Nasmith P. Grinstein S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 57Arnhold J. Benard S. Kilian U. Reichl S. Schiller J. Arnold K. Luminescence. 1999; 14: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) show that DG kinase inhibitors enhance O⨪2 release during agonist stimulation. These studies used drug concentrations too low to have direct effects on lipid-mediated oxidase activation. However, caution should be used when interpreting the effects of R59949on intact cell functions when concentrations above 10–20 μm are used. NADPH oxidase-like enzymes are now being found in a variety of cell types, where the resulting O⨪2 and H2O2 may be involved in signaling pathways (5Sanders K.A. Huecksteadt T. Xu P. Sturrock A.B. Hoidal J.R. Chest. 1999; 116: 565-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar,6Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar). Thus, the direct inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase activation also may confound the use of R59949 to implicate a role for DG kinase in functional responses in cell types other than neutrophils.Activation of NADPH oxidase in intact neutrophils is complexly regulated and incompletely understood. A wealth of data (reviewed in Refs. 2Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 10McPhail L.C. Waite K.A. Regier D.S. Nixon J.B. Qualliotine-Mann D. Zhang W.-X. Wallin R. Sergeant S. Biochim. Biophys.

The phospholipase-generated lipid messengers could activate protein kinase C or other protein kinases (58Limatola C. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H. Van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem.

Phosphorylation of at least one oxidase component, p47phox, is required for oxidase activation by the nonphysiological agonist phorbol myristate acetate, which activates protein kinase C isoforms (2Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lopes L.R. Hoyal C.R. Knaus U.G. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15533-15537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p47phox by protein kinase C can disrupt the “closed conformation” of the protein, allowing it to initiate NADPH oxidase assembly (50Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33644-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 51Huang J. Kleinberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms used by physiological agonists have not been elucidated with any certainty. Shiose and Sumimoto (49Shiose A. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13793-13801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that AA can synergize with phosphorylation of p47phox to activate NADPH oxidase. This is an attractive model that may help to explain the complex regulation of oxidase activation in intact cells by physiological agonists. In addition, we recently showed (63Regier D.S. Greene D.G. Sergeant S. Jesaitis A.J. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28406-28412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that phospholipase D-dependent pathways are involved in the phosphorylation of p22phox in intact cells induced by physiological agonists. The use of the semi-recombinant and purified-recombinant cell-free activation systems described here should allow careful dissection of the functional effects of phosphorylation (by added protein kinases) and lipids on NADPH oxidase components during the activation of the enzyme by PA and DG. Mechanisms identified in cell-free systems would then need to be studied in intact cells to determine their physiological relevance.In conclusion, we have identified a protein kinase-independent pathway for NADPH oxidase activation by the lipid second messengers PA and DG. The pathway clearly involves direct interaction of the lipids with NADPH oxidase components. Thus, PA and DG have multiple potential protein targets in human neutrophils, including a novel PA-activated protein kinase (10McPhail L.C. Waite K.A. Regier D.S. Nixon J.B. Qualliotine-Mann D.

Interaction of PA and DG with all of these proteins may contribute to the regulation of NADPH oxidase in neutrophils and other cell types. The NADPH oxidase (the respiratory burst enzyme) in phagocytic cells produces superoxide (O⨪2)1 by catalyzing electron transfer from NADPH to molecular oxygen upon cell stimulation (1Hampton M.B.

Expression of SM-20 is up-regulated in NGF-deprived sympathetic neurons, and ectopic SM-20 is sufficient to promote neuronal death in the presence of NGF. We now report that SM-20 is a mitochondrial protein that promotes cell death through a caspase-dependent mechanism. SM-20 immunofluorescence was present in the cytoplasm in a punctate pattern that colocalized with cytochrome oxidase I and with mitochondria-selective dyes. Analysis of SM-20/dihydrofolate reductase fusion proteins revealed that the first 25 amino acids of SM-20 contain a functional mitochondrial targeting sequence. An amino-terminal truncated form of SM-20 was not restricted to mitochondria but instead localized throughout the cytosol and nucleus. Nevertheless, the truncated SM-20 retained the ability to induce neuronal death, similar to the wild type protein. SM-20-induced death was accompanied by caspase-3 activation and was blocked by a general caspase inhibitor. Additionally, overexpression of SM-20, under conditions where cell death is blocked by a general caspase inhibitor, did not result in widespread release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. These results indicate that SM-20 is a novel mitochondrial protein that may be an important mediator of neurotrophin-withdrawal-mediated cell death."

Biol. 1997; 48: 355-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar, 4Ziegler J. Stenzel I. Hause B. Maucher H. Hamberg M. Grimm R. Ganal M. Wasternack C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19132-19138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 5Schaller F. Biesgen C. Mussig C. Altmann T. Weiler E.W. Planta. 2000; 210: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the biological function of other members of the plant family of oxylipins, which includes hydroxy, epoxyalcohol, keto, and divinyl ether derivatives (6Blée E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 33-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 7Grechkin A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 317-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8Farmer E.E. Weber H. Vollenweider S. Planta. 1998; 206: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and few of the genes encoding the key biosynthetic enzymes have been identified. The biosynthesis of most plant oxylipins is initiated by lipoxygenases (LOXs)1 that add molecular oxygen to either the 9 or 13 position of linolenic or linoleic acid (see Fig. 1). Hydroperoxide products of LOX are then committed to various branches of oxylipin metabolism. For example, allene oxide synthase (AOS) transforms 13-hydroperoxy linolenic acid (13-HPOT) to an unstable allene oxide that either converts spontaneously to α- and γ-ketols or serves as the precursor for enzymatic synthesis of jasmonic acid and related cyclopentenones (9Vick B.A. Zimmerman D.C. Plant Physiol. 1979; 79: 490-494Crossref Google Scholar, 10Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3382-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A second well studied enzyme, hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), cleaves 13-HPOT into short chain aldehydes that contribute to the characteristic odor of fruits, vegetables, and green leaves (11Hatanaka A. Phytochemistry. 1993; 34: 1201-1218Crossref Scopus (559) Google Scholar). HPL-derived oxylipins are also implicated as anti-microbial toxins (12Croft K.P.C. Juttner F. Slusarenko A.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and as signals for the regulation of growth properties and gene expression (13Zimmerman D. Coudron C.A. Plant Physiol. 1979; 63: 536-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bate N.J. Rothstein S.J. Plant J. 1998; 16: 561-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AOS and HPL are members of a family (CYP74) of cytochrome P-450s that are specialized for the metabolism of fatty acid hydroperoxides (15Song W.-C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,16Matsui K. Shibutani M. Hase T. Kajiwara T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast to P-450 monooxygenases that require molecular oxygen and NADPH-dependent cytochrome P-450 reductase for activity, AOS (CYP74A) and HPL (CYP74B and C) utilize an acyl hydroperoxide both as the oxygen donor and as the substrate in which the new carbon-oxygen bonds are formed. Consistent with this, AOS and HPL do not require O2 or NADPH for activity and have reduced affinity for CO (17Song W.-C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 252: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 18Lau S.-M.C. Harder P.A. O'Keefe D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1945-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Shibata Y. Matsui K. Kajiwara T. Hatanaka A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Shibata Y. Matsui K. Kajiwara T. Hatanaka A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 147-156Google Scholar). These catalytic features are shared by prostacyclin synthase and thromboxane synthase, two other P-450s that catalyze the rearrangement of C20 acyl peroxides in the arachidonic acid cascade (21Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A better understanding of the CYP74 family of enzymes may thus provide general insight into the synthesis and function of fatty acid-derived signals in both plants and animals. In addition to the AOS and HPL pathways, fatty acid hydroperoxides are converted by divinyl ether synthase (DES) to conjugated ether fatty acids that contain an oxygen within the hydrocarbon chain (Fig.1). In potato, divinyl ethers called colneleic acid (CA) and colnelenic acid (CnA) are produced from linoleic and linolenic acids, respectively, by the sequential action of 9-LOX and a DES that is specific for 9-hydroperoxides (22Galliard T. Phillips D.R. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Galliard T. Phillips D.R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1973; 11: 173-180Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Divinyl ethers derived from 13-hydroperoxides are synthesized by a similar two-step pathway in garlic bulbs and in green leaves of meadow buttercup (24Grechkin A.N. Fazliev F.N. Mukhtarova L.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Hamberg M. Lipids. 1998; 33: 1061-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The structure of divinyl ether fatty acids in the marine alga Laminaria sinclairii suggests the involvement of a DES that metabolizes 13- and 15-hydroperoxides of C18 and C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids (26Proteau P.J. Gerwick W.H. Lipids. 1993; 28: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Polyneura latissima, a red alga, accumulates an eicosanoid divinyl ether whose structure and coexistence with 9-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid suggest a biosynthetic route from 9-LOX (27Jaing Z.-D. Gerwick W.H. Lipids. 1997; 32: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The function of divinyl ether oxylipins in biological systems remains largely unknown. However, a recent report provided evidence that CA and CnA play a role in plant defense against the pathogenic fungus Phytophthora infestans (28Weber H. Chételat A. Caldelari D. Farmer E. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 485-493PubMed Google Scholar). Although much is known about the biosynthesis of divinyl ether fatty acids in various plant tissues, purification of DES or cloning of a DES-encoding gene has not been reported. In the present study, we used expressed sequence tag (EST) information to identify a cDNA from tomato that defines a new subfamily of CYP74 P-450s. We show that the protein product of the cDNA, when expressed in Escherichia coli, catalyzes the formation of CA and CnA from 9-hydroperoxides. Second, we show that this DES has spectral properties of a P-450. Finally, we demonstrate that the developmental expression of the DES-encoding gene in tomato is an important determinant of the tissue specificity of divinyl ether synthesis. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Castlemart) plants were grown in Jiffy peat pots (Hummert International) in a growth chamber maintained under 17 h of light (300 (micro Einstein) m−2 s−1) at 28 °C and 7 h of dark at 18 °C. Flowers and fruits were harvested from plants maintained in a greenhouse. Seeds of Lycopersicon pennellii (LA716) and the introgression lines used for RFLP mapping were obtained from the Tomato Genetics Resource Center (Davis, CA). Basic molecular techniques were performed as described in Sambrook et al. (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The clone (cLEC38I7) for tomato EST277670 (GenBankTMAW034008) was obtained from the Clemson University Genomics Institute. The cDNA insert was sequenced in its entirety on both strands. The cDNA was 1631 base pairs (bp) in length and included 18 bp upstream of the initiator AUG codon and 145 bp in the 3′-untranslated region (excluding 31 poly(A) residues). Thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to obtain additional sequence information at the 5′ end of the gene as described previously (30Liu Y.-G. Whittier R.F. Genomics. 1995; 25: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 31Liu Y.-G. Mitsukawa N. Oosumi T. Whittier R.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 ng of tomato genomic DNA was used as a template for an initial PCR reaction using a gene-specific primer (GSP1: 5′-ACG GAT TTT TCT GAT CAC AAA GCA-3′) and a shorter arbitrary degenerate primer (AD3: 5′-(A/T)GTGNAG(A/T)ANCANAGA)-3′). The resulting PCR product was used as a template for a second PCR reaction using the same AD3 primer and a second nested gene-specific primer (GSP2: 5′-CGT CAT AGT CGG AAG CAA AGC ATT-3′). The PCR product obtained from this reaction was used as template for a final PCR reaction using the AD3 primer and a third nested gene-specific primer (GSP3, 5′-TGT ACC ACC AAG AGT GTC AGT TTT-A-3′). Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR products of ∼1 kilobase were obtained from two independent reactions. DNA sequencing using the GSP3 primer revealed an in-frame stop codon (UAA) 27 nucleotides upstream of the first initiation AUG. Reverse transcription PCR was used to exclude the possibility that the in-frame stop codon was located in an intron that was amplified by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR. Reverse transcription was performed with oligo(dT) primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was performed using a primer (5′-CAT CAC CTA CAA TGT TAA TA-3′) located upstream of the in-frame stop codon and the GSP3 primer. Direct sequencing of the reverse transcriptase PCR product confirmed the position of the stop codon relative to the initiator AUG codon. Data base searches were performed using the BLAST program (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69594) Google Scholar) available at the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology. Amino acid sequence alignments were performed using the Clustal method in the Megalign program (DNAStar, Madison, WI). A PCR-based approach was used to construct the expression vector for CYP74D1 containing an N-terminal His6 tag. Forward and reverse primers that amplify the cDNA were designed to containBam HI and Hin dIII restriction sites, respectively. The sequence of the forward primer was 5′-CGG GAT CCC TTC CGA TTC GTG AAA TTC CA-3′ and that of the reverse primer 5′-CCC AAG CTT GCA ACG TGA GCG GGC ACA CA-3′. PCR amplification of clone cLEC38I7 yielded a 1.45-kilobase product that was subsequently cut withBam HI and Hin dIII and subcloned into the same sites of expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen Corp., Santa Clarita, CA). The resulting construct, which replaced the first nine amino acids of CYP74D1 with the sequence MRGSHHHHHHGS, was transformed into E. coli host strain M15 for expression. A similar strategy was used for construction of the C-terminal His-tagged protein. Forward and reverse primers were designed to contain Nde I andXho I restriction sites, respectively. The sequence of the forward primer was 5′-GGA ATT CCA TAT GTC TTC TTA TTC AGA GCT-3′ and that of the reverse primer 5′-CCG CTC GAG TTT ACT TGC TTT AGT TAA TG-3′. PCR amplification of cLEC38I7 yielded a 1.45-kilobase product that was cut with Nde I and Xho I prior to subcloning into the same sites of the expression vector pET-23b (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting construct, which placed an additional eight amino acids (LEHHHHHH) on the C terminus of CYP74D1, was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). His-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed in the appropriate host strains as follows. An overnight culture (5 ml) was inoculated into 100 ml of Terrific Broth medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in a shaker at 250 rpm until theA 600 was 0.6–0.8. Cultures were cooled to 25 °C, and isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and δ-aminolevulinic acid were added to final concentrations of 0.05 and 0.5 mm, respectively. Induced cultures were incubated for ∼40 h at 25 °C with gentle shaking (130 rpm). Cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C until further use. Crude extracts from E. coli(M15) cells expressing CYP74D1 (N-terminal His tag form) were used as enzyme source. Extracts from cells expressing the pQE-30 vector were used as a mock control. Frozen cell paste was thawed, sonicated as described below, and centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A portion of the supernatant corresponding to 10 mg of protein was incubated with 300 μg of hydroperoxide substrate (9-HPOD or 9-HPOT) dissolved in 30 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Reactions proceeded for 10 min at 25 °C and then were stopped by acidification to pH 4.0 with 1 m citrate. Products were extracted twice with diethyl ether, dried under N2 gas, and taken up in 0.25 ml of methanol. Extracted compounds were methylated by treatment with ethereal diazomethane at 0 °C for 10 min, dried under N2 gas, and taken up in 50 μl of hexane. Derivatized compounds (5 μl) were analyzed by GC-MS at the MSU-NIH Mass Spectrometry Facility as described previously (33Howe G.A. Lee G.I. Itoh A. Li L. DeRocher A.E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). UV spectra of divinyl ether products were obtained as follows. 10 μg substrate (9-HPOT or 9-HPOD) was reacted with 50 μg of purified CYP74D1 in 0.2 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer for 3 min at 4 °C. Ethanol (0.8 ml at −20 °C) was added to the completed reaction, and precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. A UV spectrum of the resulting supernatant was recorded with a Uvikon 933 UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Research Instruments, San Diego, CA). Purification of the C-terminal His-tagged form of CYP74D1 was performed at 4 °C except where noted. Bacterial cells expressing the construct were harvested from 200 ml of culture medium, followed by resuspension in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). Cells were lysed using three 30-s pulses from a probe-type sonicator (Branson Sonifier Model 450). Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet fraction containing CYP74D1 was solubilized in 2 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 1.5% Triton X-100R, pH 7.0) on ice for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was diluted to 10 ml with buffer A. Following the addition of 1 ml of TALON metal affinity resin (cobalt-based IMAC, CLONTECH) pre-equilibrated with buffer A, the suspension was gently agitated at 25 °C for 40 min to allow binding of CYP74D1. The resin was collected by centrifugation and washed three times at 25 °C with 10 ml of buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100R and 5 mmimidazole (pH 7.0). The resin was applied to a column (0.7 × 2.5 cm, Bio-Rad) and CYP74D1 was eluted with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100R and 150 mm imidazole (pH 7.0). The reddish brown-colored fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated in a Millipore Biomax centrifugal filter (10,000 molecular weight cut off) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Imidazole was removed by diluting the preparation ∼10-fold with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% Triton X-100R and 5% glycerol, followed by concentration on a centrifugal filter as described above. Protein measurements were performed by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The relative purity of recombinant CYP74D1 was judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining of samples analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% polyacrylamide). The hydroperoxide-metabolizing activity of recombinant CYP74D1 was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the rate of decrease inA 234 that results from disruption of the conjugated diene bond of the substrate (34Zimmerman D.C. Vick B.A. Plant Physiol. 1970; 46: 445-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic assays were performed at 25 °C in 1 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 30 ng of purified CYP74D1 (C-terminal His-tagged form) and varying amounts of substrate. Activity slopes obtained during the first 0.5 min of the reaction were used for calculation of kinetic parameters. Specific activity measurements were performed in a similar fashion using a substrate concentration of 50 μm. Fatty acid hydroperoxide substrates were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Extinction coefficients provided by the manufacturer were used for calculations. Absorbance spectra were obtained using affinity purified CYP74D1 in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. CO treatments were performed by bubbling CO gas through the sample for 1 min, and reduction of the protein was achieved by adding a few grains of sodium dithionite. [1-14C]9-HPOD was prepared using ripened tomato fruits as a source of 9-LOX activity, using a modification of a described previously procedure (35Smith J.J. Linforth R. Tucker G.A. Phytochemistry. 1997; 45: 453-458Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Diced fruit pericarp was homogenized in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100R, filtered through three layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem), and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g. 9-LOX activity in the supernatant was precipitated by (NH4)2SO4 in the 30–60% saturated fraction. Following centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 ×g, the pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and stored at −80 °C until use. [1-14C]Linoleic acid (51 Ci mol−1) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Radiolabeled fatty acid was diluted with unlabeled linoleic acid (NuChek-Prep, Elysian, MN) to achieve a final specific activity of 1.9 Ci mol−1. This preparation was converted to the ammonium salt and then diluted with 1% Triton X-100R to achieve a final fatty acid concentration of 10 mm. One-half ml of this solution was added to 4.5 ml of an oxygen-saturated solution containing 0.1m sodium phosphate (pH 6.0). To this substrate was added 0.5 ml of the tomato fruit lipoxygenase fraction (12 mg of protein) described above. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 45 min at 0 °C in the presence of bubbling oxygen and then stopped by acidification to pH 4.0 with 1 m citrate. Lipid products were extracted with chloroform, dried under N2, and dissolved in a small amount of chloroform. The mixture was fractionated by TLC using a high performance silica gel plate (HP-TLC 60 F254, Merck) developed with diethyl ether:hexane:formic acid (70:30:1). The major radiolabeled product, [1-14C]9-HPOD, was scraped from the TLC plate and stored in ETOH at −80 °C until use. A modification of a TLC assay (36Caldelari D. Farmer E.E. Phytochemistry. 1998; 47: 599-604Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was used to monitor the transformation of [1-14C]9-HPOD to [1-14C]CA in cell-free extracts obtained from various tomato tissues. Briefly, extract from freshly ground roots, stems, or leaves of 18-day-old tomato seedlings was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. A volume of supernatant containing 60 μg of protein was immediately added to 0.4 ml of 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol (v/v). Reactions were initiated by addition of 5 μg of [1-14C]9-HPOT prepared as described above. After an incubation period of 10 min at 25 °C, reactions were acidified to pH 4 and extracted with 0.4 ml of chloroform:MeOH (2:1). Lipid products obtained after evaporation of the solvent were dissolved in chloroform and separated on HP-TLC plates as described above. Labeled metabolites were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak XAR-5 film. The identity of CA among the chromatographed products was determined by GC-MS analysis of bands scraped from the TLC plate. RNA extraction and blot hybridization analysis of mRNA levels was performed as described previously (33Howe G.A. Lee G.I. Itoh A. Li L. DeRocher A.E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Full-length LeDES and LeAOS (33Howe G.A. Lee G.I. Itoh A. Li L. DeRocher A.E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) cDNAs were PCR-amplified from the plasmid vector (pBlueScript) using T3 and T7 primers. Tomato genomic DNA preparations and Southern blot analysis were as described previously (33Howe G.A. Lee G.I. Itoh A. Li L. DeRocher A.E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We conducted a BLAST search (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69594) Google Scholar) of the tomato EST data base for potential novel CYP74 sequences. A tentative consensus sequence, constructed from multiple overlapping ESTs (37Quackenbush J. Liang F. Holt I. Pertea G. Upton J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), was identified that was similar to but clearly distinct from known CYP74 sequences in tomato and other plants. DNA sequencing of a clone (cLEC38I7) corresponding to one such EST (EST277670) revealed a 1,631-bp cDNA insert containing an open reading frame predicted to encode a 478-amino acid protein. Thermal asymmetric interlaced and reverse transcriptase PCR experiments provided additional sequence information at the 5′ end of the transcript. DNA sequencing of this region revealed an in-frame stop codon 27 bp upstream of the first AUG, indicating that the cDNA encodes a full-length protein. A BLAST search of sequences in GenBank showed that the novel CYP74 was most similar (45% identity) to a HPL from Cucumis sativus that prefers 9-hydroperoxides to 13-hydroperoxides and is classified as CYP74C1 (38Matsui K. Ujita C. Fujimoto S. Wilkinson J. Hiatt B. Knauf V. Kajiwara T. Feussner I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The next strongest match (∼42% identity) was to members of the CYP74A subfamily (AOS). The third and final significant match (∼30% identity) was to HPL sequences that make up the CYP74B subfamily. According to guidelines for cytochrome P-450 nomenclature, the novel tomato CYP74 is classified as the first member (CYP74D1) of a new CYP74 subfamily designated CYP74D. 2D. Nelson, personal communication. A comparison of the deduced CYP74D1 sequence to other known CYP74 sequences from tomato (33Howe G.A. Lee G.I. Itoh A. Li L. DeRocher A.E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 39Sivasankar S. Sheldrick B. Rothstein S.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 2. The sequence of CYP74D1 displayed many of the features that differentiate CYP74 enzymes from O2- and NADPH-requiring P-450 monooxygenases. However, some differences between CYP74D1 and other CYP74 subfamilies were noted. P-450 monooxygenases have a consensus sequence of (A/G)GX(D/E)T(T/S) within the I-helix that forms part of the oxygen-binding pocket (40Chapple C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 311-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In both bacterial and mammalian microsomal P-450, the invariant threonine residue (underlined) is thought to play a critical role in the binding and activation of oxygen (41Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 42Williams P.A. Cosme J. Sridhar V. Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). All reported CYP74 sequences have an isoleucine or valine in place of the conserved threonine, and conform to the consensus sequence GGXX(I/V)(L/F). The corresponding region of CYP74D1 has the sequenceAGLN A F, which differs from all other CYP74 sequences in two positions (residues in bold type) within the consensus (Fig. 2). The heme-binding domain of CYP74D1 is characteristic of other CYP74 enzymes. The CYP74 consensus sequence for residues surrounding the cysteinyl heme ligand near the C terminus is NKQC(A/P)(G/A)K(D/N)X V and is conserved in CYP74D1. When variant positions within this consensus are considered, CYP74D1 most closely resembles cucumber HPL (CYP74C1) and two barley AOS (CYP74A) that utilize 9- and 13-hydroperoxides (38Matsui K. Ujita C. Fujimoto S. Wilkinson J. Hiatt B. Knauf V. Kajiwara T. Feussner I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 43Maucher H. Hause B. Feussner I. Ziegler J. Wasternack C. Plant J. 2000; 21: 199-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted sequence of CYP74D1 lacks a hydrophobic N terminus that assists in anchoring many eukaryotic P-450s to the endoplasmic reticulum (40Chapple C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 311-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). CYP74D1 also lacks a typical N-terminal targeting sequence that directs many CYP74 proteins, including tomato AOS (44Froehlich, J. E., Itoh, A., and Howe, G. A. (2001)Plant Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar), to the chloroplast. To investigate the catalytic function of CYP74D1, the cDNA was subcloned into vector pQE-30 for expression in E. coli. Bacterial cultures expressing the construct accumulated low levels of the recombinant protein as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of bacterial extracts (data not shown). A spectrophotometric assay was used to test extracts for their ability to metabolize fatty acid hydroperoxides (Table I). Extracts containing CYP74D1, but not those derived from c"
https://openalex.org/W2009691812,"Animal thioredoxin reductases (TRs) are selenocysteine-containing flavoenzymes that utilize NADPH for reduction of thioredoxins and other protein and nonprotein substrates. Three types of mammalian TRs are known, with TR1 being a cytosolic enzyme, and TR3, a mitochondrial enzyme. Previously characterized TR1 and TR3 occurred as homodimers of 55–57-kDa subunits. We report here that TR1 isolated from mouse liver, mouse liver tumor, and a human T-cell line exhibited extensive heterogeneity as detected by electrophoretic, immunoblot, and mass spectrometry analyses. In particular, a 67-kDa band of TR1 was detected. Furthermore, a novel form of mouse TR1 cDNA encoding a 67-kDa selenoprotein subunit with an additional N-terminal sequence was identified. Subsequent homology analyses revealed three distinct isoforms of mouse and rat TR1 mRNA. These forms differed in 5′ sequences that resulted from the alternative use of the first three exons but had common downstream sequences. Similarly, expression of multiple mRNA forms was observed for human TR3 and Drosophila TR. In these genes, alternative first exon splicing resulted in the formation of predicted mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins. In addition, a human TR3 gene overlapped with the gene for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) on a complementary DNA strand, such that mitochondrial TR3 and membrane-bound COMT mRNAs had common first exon sequences; however, transcription start sites for predicted cytosolic TR3 and soluble COMT forms were separated by ∼30 kilobases. Thus, this study demonstrates a remarkable heterogeneity within TRs, which, at least in part, results from evolutionary conserved genetic mechanisms employing alternative first exon splicing. Multiple transcription start sites within TR genes may be relevant to complex regulation of expression and/or organelle- and cell type-specific location of animal thioredoxin reductases. Animal thioredoxin reductases (TRs) are selenocysteine-containing flavoenzymes that utilize NADPH for reduction of thioredoxins and other protein and nonprotein substrates.

The cytosolic thioredoxin reductase (TR1), the most characterized of the three enzymes, was known for decades, but only recently it was found to be a selenium-containing protein (11Tamura T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). TR1 contains a C-terminal penultimate selenocysteine residue encoded by TGA (12Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One of the first indications that multiple TR forms occur in mammalian cells was immunoblot analyses of various human TR preparations. An enzyme possessing TR activity that was isolated from a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line NCI-H441 failed to react with antibodies specific for rat liver TR1 (11Tamura T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), whereas TR isolated from a human T-cell line JPX9 reacted with these antibodies (12Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Determination of internal peptide sequences of the T-cell TR demonstrated that this protein was TR1 (12Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the NCI-H441 enzyme was not sequenced, and in retrospect it seems possible, that this TR could have been encoded by a different gene. In addition to a TR form not reacting with anti-TR1 antibodies, subsequent studies identified two forms of TR1 isolated from either NCI-H441 or HeLa cells that showed a positive immunoblot signal with these antibodies (16Liu S.Y. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6138-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Gorlatov S.N. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yet, these forms differed in catalytic activity, selenium content, and affinity for column matrices. In particular, forms that differed in the ability to bind to a heparin column were extensively characterized (16Liu S.Y. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, differences in either protein or gene sequences, or in post-translational modifications that were responsible for the observed changes in catalytic and chromatographic properties, were not reported. Recently, two additional thioredoxin reductases, TR2 and TR3, were identified that contained the conserved selenocysteine residue (5Gasdaska P.Y. Berggren M.M. Berry M.J. Powis G.

In the present report, we describe the occurrence of multiple forms of TR1 and TR3 and utilize genetic and biochemical techniques to characterize the basis for heterogeneity within animal TR preparations. We find differences in 5′-end cDNA sequences for mammalian TR1, mammalian TR3, and Drosophila TR that resulted from the alternative use of first exons. Male wild type and transforming growth factor α (TGFα)/c-myc double transgenic mice (6–15 months old) were maintained and labeled with 75Se, and their livers and liver tumors were dissected as described previously (19Gladyshev V.N. Factor V.M. Housseau F. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The coexpression of TGFα and c-Myc results in multiple liver tumor formation by 6 months of age. Three unlabeled wild type mouse livers (4 g) and a single 75Se-labeled wild type liver (0.5 g) were mixed and homogenized in 10 ml of 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin (buffer A). The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was loaded directly onto a 3-ml ADP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. The column was washed extensively with 150 mm NaCl and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and proteins were eluted with 1m NaCl in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Protein fractions were tested by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses with antibodies specific for TR1 and TR3 (10Sun Q.-A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.-T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), pooled, and further analyzed by a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. TR1 was also isolated from TGFα/c-myc tumors using the same procedure except that 5 unlabeled liver tumors (11.5 g) and one 75Se-labeled liver tumor (3.5 g) were homogenized in 15 ml of buffer A. TR1 was isolated from mouse liver, rat prostate, and a human T-cell line JPX9 according to a three-step procedure that involved DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), ADP-Sepharose, and phenyl-HPLC columns (TosoHaas) as described previously (12Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To obtain 75Se-labeled TR1, unlabeled mouse livers were mixed with a single 75Se-labeled wild type liver. Isolated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot assays with antibodies specific for TR1, TR2, and TR3 (10Sun Q.-A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.-T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol.

To further fractionate the enzyme, TR1 preparation was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and applied onto a heparin-HPLC column (TosoHaas). The proteins were eluted with a gradient of 20–500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0.75Se was detected in fractions with a γ-counter. JPX9 cells were grown on an RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and metabolically labeled with 75Se as described previously (12Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Human A431 cell line was grown as described (10Sun Q.-A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.-T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and TRs were purified from sonicated crude extracts on an ADP-Sepharose column as described for mouse enzymes. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of 75Se-contining polypeptides was performed as described previously (20Appella E. Arnott D. Sakaguchi K. Wirth P.J. EXS (Exper. Suppl.). 2000; 88: 1-27PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μl of each TR preparation (500 μg of total protein), which was partially purified on an ADP-Sepharose column, were resolved in the first dimension on an isoelectric focusing (IEF) gel, followed by separation in the second dimension on a 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The separated polypeptides were electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the blots stained with Ponceau S, and the75Se-containing proteins detected on the dried membranes by the PhosphorImager analysis. TR samples purified by one-dimensional or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and stained with either Ponceau S or Sulforodamine B. Bands were excised and digested with trypsin as described (21Sutton C.W. Pemberton K.S. Cottrell J.S. Corbett J.M. Wheeler C.H. Dunn M.J. Pappin D.J. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After digestion, peptides were extracted from the membrane with the addition of 10 μl of formic acid:ethanol (1:1) for 1 h at room temperature. 0.5 μl were sampled directly from the supernatant to the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) plate, mixed with 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid matrix (10 mg/ml in acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid, 0.1%) and allowed to air-dry before data collection. Spectra were acquired on a Voyager RP mass spectrometer using oxidized bovine insulin β chain as internal standard for calibration (21Sutton C.W. Pemberton K.S. Cottrell J.S. Corbett J.M.

Mass spectrometric analysis of native or alkylated human TR proteins was performed on a API300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Micro-IonSpray source. Prior to MS analysis proteins were purified by RP-HPLC on a narrow-bore Vydac C4 column (150 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) using a linear gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and a flow rate of 250 μl/min. Samples were manually collected and directly injected into the mass spectrometer ion source by infusion at 1 μl/min. Reduction and alkylation of TRs was conducted in denaturing conditions (6 m guanidine HCl, pH 8.0) using iodoacetamide as an alkylating agent. Mouse cDNA clones (clone ID 607552, accession number AI662374, Stratagene mouse skin cDNA library; and clone ID 2064717, accession number AI789478, Sugano mouse kidney-mkia cDNA library) were purchased from Research Genetics and their insert sequences experimentally determined. The two clones overlapped for 510 nucleotides and the combined cDNA sequence was 3626 nucleotides long. SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, and isoelectrofocusing analyses were performed with electrophoretic supplies and gels from Novex. Immunoblot membranes were developed with a SuperSignal detection kit (Pierce) or an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using previously developed antibodies specific for TR1, TR2, and TR3 (10Sun Q.-A.

We have previously demonstrated strict isozyme specificity of these antibodies (10Sun Q.-A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.-T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were analyzed with BLAST programs (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). Exons were predicted with a NetGene2 program. Mitochondrial signal peptides were predicted with the PSORT II or SignalP programs. To determine whether mouse TR1 occurs in multiple forms and if the distribution of these forms differs between normal and malignant cells, we partially isolated TRs from a pool of75Se-labeled wild type mouse livers and from a pool of75Se-labeled liver tumors developed in TGFα/c-myc double transgenic mice. To minimize potential losses of certain TR forms due to different elution profiles of these forms on columns commonly used in TR isolation procedures, we utilized only a single step, an affinity ADP-Sepharose chromatography, to purify TRs. When 75Se-labeled protein extracts obtained from either normal livers or liver tumors were fractionated on an ADP-Sepharose column, TR1, seen as a 75Se-labeled band (Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and 6), and TR3, which is masked by TR1 due to its lower abundance (6Lee S.R.

Two other major 75Se-labeled proteins that did not bind to the column were glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) (19Gladyshev V.N. Factor V.M. Housseau F. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Since we used identical procedures for fractionation of normal and tumor samples, comparison of GPx1 and other selenoprotein bands in normal (Fig. 1 A, lane 1) and tumor (Fig. 1 A, lane 4) samples suggested that the levels of GPx1 were decreased in tumors. A similar decrease was previously observed when normal livers from TGFα/c-myc mice were compared with liver tumors from the same mice (19Gladyshev V.N. Factor V.M. Housseau F. Hatfield D.L. Biochem.

On the other hand, the latter studies found that expression of TR1 was slightly increased in liver tumors relative to surrounding normal livers in TGFα/c-myc mice (19Gladyshev V.N. Factor V.M. Housseau F. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows immunoblot analyses of mouse TR1 and TR3 enriched from normal wild type and transgenic malignant livers on an ADP-Sepharose column. Proteins isolated from these two sources migrated similarly on SDS-PAGE. TR1 had a molecular mass of ∼57 kDa, whereas TR3 migrated as an ∼55-kDa protein. Although TR1 is more abundant than TR3 in liver (16Liu S.Y. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6138-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the ratio of these enzymes was approximately the same in wild type and tumor samples (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that expression of TR3, like that of TR1 (but in contrast to GPx1), was unchanged or perhaps somewhat elevated during malignant transformation in TGFα/c-myc mice.Figure 2Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of mouse TR preparations. Wild type liver and TGFα/c-myc liver tumor TR preparations were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis, followed by detection of 75Se by PhosphorImager analysis (A-D) and staining of proteins with Ponceau S (E and F). Panels A andB show full two-dimensional gels, whereas panels C-F show enlarged areas that correspond to 75Se signals on panels A and B. Panels A, C, andE show TR1 isolated from wild type livers, and panels B, D, and F, from liver tumors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to the mouse samples, we analyzed TR1 isolated from rat prostate by a standard three-column procedure (Fig. 1 B, lane 3), and a TR preparation isolated from a human epidermoid A431 cell line using a single ADP-Sepharose column (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). Interestingly, although the major form of human TR1 migrated as a 57-kDa band, human TR3 was present as a mixture of 55–57-kDa species. While mouse TR preparations isolated from normal and tumor samples migrated as single species and exhibited similar electrophoretic properties on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1 B), this electrophoretic technique is often insufficient to resolve minor differences within preparations. Therefore, to further test protein preparations shown in Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2, we separately analyzed normal and tumor TRs by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Comparison of 75Se and protein profiles on two-dimensional gels for normal and tumor samples suggested that all signals shown in Fig. 2corresponded to TR1. TR3 was not detected on two-dimensional gels because it was present in lower levels than TR1 and exhibited a different isoelectric point. The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 2) revealed dramatic heterogeneity within TR1 preparations from normal and tumor samples. TR1 bands were separated on two-dimensional gels according to both charge and mass. Nine representative bands from two-dimensional gels for normal and tumor samples (Fig. 2, E andF) were digested with trypsin. Tryptic digests were analyzed by MALDI time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Experimentally determined peptide masses matched to the peptide masses predicted from the tryptic digestion of a deduced mouse TR1 sequence (see details of mouse TR1 sequences below) and covered >50% of the protein sequence (cysteine-containing and N-terminal peptides were not detected). No post-translational modifications within TR1 that could potentially contribute to different mobilities of TR1 forms on two-dimensional gels were detected. In addition, no significant differences in tryptic peptide maps were found between normal and tumor samples. In addition to multiple TR1 forms that were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2) but migrated as a single 57-kDa band on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1 B), we detected TR1 forms that significantly differed from the 57-kDa isoforms. We noted that longer exposure of 75Se signals detected with a PhosphorImager and analysis of anti-TR1 immunoblot signals often produced two additional bands, ∼67 and ∼110 kDa. These bands partially co-purified with the 57-kDa forms and were present as minor forms in apparently homogeneous enzyme preparations. The 67- and 110-kDa species did not cross-react with anti-TR2 and anti-TR3 antibodies. Migration properties of the 110-kDa minor band corresponded to that of the TR1 homodimer, although the biochemical basis for the possible dimer formation under these conditions is not clear. The possible origin of the 67-kDa band is discussed below. We further tested if the extensive heterogeneity observed within mouse TR1 preparations, occurs in human TR1 preparations. For this purpose, we selected a human T-cell line, J"

This suggests that CTL also activate caspase-independent cell death pathways. The most abundant CTL protease, GrnA, induces rapid cell death that has the features of apoptosis, except for oligonucleosomal DNA degradation (13Beresford P.J. Xia Z. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Immunity. 1999; 10: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Until recently it was unclear whether GrnA induces any DNA damage since small fragments of DNA are not released, DNA degradation is not visualized on agarose gels, and DNA breaks are not generally detected with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase labeling. Induction of cell death by GrnA was considered slow, based on assays that measure the release of small radiolabeled DNA fragments into the supernatant. However, other apoptotic changes occur as rapidly with GrnA loading as with GrnB loading (Ref. 13Beresford P.J. Xia Z. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Immunity. 1999; 10: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, data not shown). DNA damage in the form of single-strand nicks occurs within 2 h in cells loaded with GrnA. These breaks can be labeled with Klenow polymerase and visualized on denaturing alkaline agarose gels. None of the features of GrnA-induced death are blocked by caspase inhibition or Bcl-2 overexpression. Moreover, effector caspases are not activated by GrnA loading. Therefore, the GrnA pathway, including the DNA damage it induces, is caspase-independent. However, perforin loading of GrnA facilitates the oligonucleosomal DNA damage of the caspase-dependent DNase (CAD/DFF40) (20Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Although many of the features of GrnB-induced cell death have been elucidated with the definition of caspase activation pathways, the story is incomplete since GrnB induces cell death but not DNA fragmentation when caspase activation is blocked (13Beresford P.J. Xia Z. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Immunity. 1999; 10: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19Sarin A. Haddad E.K. Henkart P.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2810-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, still less is known about the molecular events triggered by GrnA. Although GrnA has tryptic activity, it is a highly specific protease. When comparable concentrations of GrnA and trypsin with equivalent benzyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine-thiobenzyl esterase activity are incubated at 37 °C with nuclear lysates, trypsin completely degrades the sample within 1 h, so that no bands are visible on SDS-PAGE gels. GrnA, on the other hand, only visibly degrades 1 of 22 bands after 25 h (23Pasternack M.S. Bleier K.J. McInerney T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14703-14708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, only a few candidate GrnA substrates, including interleukin-1β, fibronectin, type IV collagen, the thrombin receptor, pro-urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and nucleolin have been identified (23Pasternack M.S.

While looking for potential nuclear substrates of GrnA, we found that immobilized histone H1 binds GrnA on far-Western blots and that histone H1 is cleaved in nuclear lysates by purified CTL granule extracts (23Pasternack M.S. Bleier K.J. McInerney T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14703-14708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3L. Wagner, W. Gartner, P. J. Beresford, L. Bensinger, Y. Ge, A. H. Greenberg, J. Lieberman, M. S. Pasternack, submitted for publication. Recombinant GrnA degrades purified histone H1 in vitro but requires the presence of heparan sulfate (HS).3 The HS dependence of thein vitro cleavage reaction may not be surprising since the granzymes released from cytolytic granules are complexed to sulfated proteoglycans and because both GrnA and histone H1 are very basic (calculated pI values, 9.1 and 11.3, respectively). Histone H1 is an attractive substrate for a cell death pathway in which DNA is targeted. The linker histone H1 plays a critical role in chromatin hypercondensation (35Weintraub H. Van Lente F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4249-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 36Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Aviles F.X.

Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1463-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which may protect genomic DNA from endonuclease digestion. Lys-and Arg-rich histones might be especially good targets of a tryptase like GrnA. Therefore, we investigated whether histones might be physiologically relevant targets of GrnA. Here we show that recombinant GrnA in vitro andin vivo, after cell loading with perforin, degrades not only histone H1 but also cleaves core histones. The cleavage sites recognized by GrnA are distinct from those cut by trypsin; in fact histone H1 is initially cut in a folded core region that is protected from trypsin digestion. We also find that GrnA loading of isolated nuclei disrupts chromatin and facilitates exogenous DNase access to DNA. Chromatin disruption by histone modification may be essential to GrnA-induced DNA nicking and may also contribute to the synergy of GrnA and GrnB in inducing oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. K562, Jurkat, COS, and HL60 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 2 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Recombinant GrnA and enzymatically inactive Ser → Ala GrnA were produced and purified as previously reported (13Beresford P.J. Xia Z. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J.

The PHAP II plasmid was transformed into BL21 cells (Novagen) and PHAP II expression was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma). His-tagged PHAP II was sequentially purified by nickel resin (Novagen) and anion exchange chromatography. The identity and proper folding of the recombinant protein was verified by reactivity with a rabbit antiserum raised to an N-terminal PHAP II peptide as described (29Adachi Y. Pavlakis G.N.

Greer, M. Jaju, and J. Lieberman, manuscript in preparation. Mononucleosomes and histones were purified from HeLa or HL60 cells as described (40Cote J. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Adolph K.W. Methods in Molecular Genetics. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1995: 108-128Google Scholar). Briefly, 109 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.25m sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.4 mm PMSF). Pelleted nuclei were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.4 mm PMSF). The nuclei were resuspended in buffer A to which was added dropwise with gentle stirring one-third of the total volume of buffer A containing 0.6 m KCl and 10% glycerol. After stirring for 10 min at 4 °C, the nuclear pellet was recovered by centrifugation for 30 min at 17,500 × g. To prepare mononucleosomes, chromatin was isolated after Dounce homogenization, treated for 5 min at 37 °C with micrococcal nuclease, and applied to a Sepharose CL-6B column. The fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and native agarose gels after deproteinization. Fractions containing mononucleosomes stripped of histone H1 were pooled. To purify histones, nuclear pellets containing ∼12 mg of DNA were resuspended in 50 ml of HAP buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.6 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.4 mm PMSF) and stirred gently for 30 min at 4 °C. To this mixture was added 20 g of dry Bio-Gel HTP Hydroxylapatite powder (Bio-Rad) with stirring. The resin was packed into a column, and the flow-through containing partially pure histone H1 was collected. After further washing with 600 ml of HAP buffer, core histones were eluted from the column with HAP buffer containing 2.5 m NaCl. Histone H1 was further purified by gel filtration. Purified histones or H1-stripped HeLa cell nucleosomes (0.5 μg of DNA) were incubated with various amounts of recombinant granzymes in the presence or absence of heparan sulfate (Sigma), recombinant PHAP II, or random plasmid DNA (prepared by plasmid DNA purification kit (Qiagen)) in 25-μl reaction buffer (100 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl) at 37 °C for indicated times. The cleavage reaction was stopped by adding 5× SDS-loading buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml bestatin, 60 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml E-64, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) to which was added 250 μm GrnA specific inhibitor Ph-NHCONH-CiEtOIC (a kind gift of J.C. Powers, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA) (34Beresford P.J. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Boiled samples were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE gels (for core histones) or 12% SDS-PAGE gels (for histone H1) and analyzed by immunoblot using polyclonal antisera against histone H1, H2B, and H3 (Biodesign International, Inc.) or staining with GelCode® Blue (Pierce). For N-terminal sequencing of the cleavage products, electrophoresed samples were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ProBlottTM, Applied Biosystems), and the desired Coomassie-stained bands were cut and sent for protein sequencing by the Tufts Core Facility. Nuclei were isolated from HL-60 cells by Nonidet P-40 lysis as described above and washed twice with buffer B (20 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 0.25m sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2). Nuclei (1 × 106) in 100 μl of buffer B containing 50 mm NaCl were incubated with the indicated amounts of GrnA with or without HS at 37 °C for indicated times. The reaction was stopped by adding 5× SDS-loading buffer and the protease inhibitor mixture. Boiled samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Isolated nuclei as above were washed twice with lysis buffer, resuspended in buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100 and then incubated on ice for 5 min. After further washing with buffer B, 1 × 106 nuclei in 100 μl were incubated with 400 nm GrnA or PMSF-inactivated GrnA and/or 400 nm PHAP II at 37 °C for 2 h. Micrococcal nuclease (20 units, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or RQ1 DNase I (10 units, Promega) was added for 5 min or 10 min, respectively, before the addition of stopping buffer (10 mm EDTA, 200 μg/ml protease K, and 2% SDS in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0)). After overnight deproteinization, DNA was extracted with phenol and ethanol precipitation and analyzed by ethidium bromide staining on 1.5% agarose gels. Recombinant GrnA, Ser → Ala GrnA, or GrnB were loaded with perforin into K562 or Jurkat cells as described (13Beresford P.J. Xia Z. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Immunity. 1999; 10: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For each reaction 1 × 105 cells in 60 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2, and 2 mmMgCl2 were incubated with an indicated amount of recombinant granzymes and sublytic concentrations of perforin at 37 °C for indicated times. In some experiments, caspase activation was blocked by preincubating effector and target cells for 30–60 min with 100 μm z-VAD-FMK and 100 μm z-DEVD-FMK (Calbiochem), concentrations that were maintained throughout the experiment. Quantitation of cytolysis induced by loading was assayed in parallel experiments by treating 51Cr-labeled cells with GrnA and perforin, incubating at 37 °C for 2 h, and counting51Cr released into the supernatant on a Packard Topcount as described (13Beresford P.J.

Specific cytotoxicity was calculated by the formula: ((sample release) − (spontaneous release))/((total release) − (spontaneous release)) × 100. Cells were lysed by adding 5× SDS-loading buffer and a mixture of described previously protease inhibitors. Samples were boiled for 5 min and then electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against histone H1, H2B, and H3 and Rho-GDI (Pharmingen). To assess single-stranded DNA damage induced by GrnA loading, which is not detectable by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay, the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase was used to label DNA breaks as described (13Beresford P.J. Xia Z. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Immunity. 1999; 10: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Six h after Grn loading with perforin, pelleted cells were lysed in an equal volume of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and incubated with 5 units of Klenow (New England Biolabs) and 10 μCi of 32P-dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h at 37 °C. Radiolabeled nuclei, pelleted by centrifuging for 5 min at 2580 × g and washed twice in 5 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, were counted after adding scintillation fluid (Beckman). The DNA labeling index was calculated by dividing the dpm of loaded cells by the dpm of mock-treated cells. Histone H1 is an in vitro substrate of GrnA complexed to HS3(Fig. 1 A). We recently identified two highly acidic proteins PHAP II/set/TAF-Iβ/I2PP2A (calculated pI ∼ 3.9) and PHAP I/I1PP2A (calculated pI ∼ 3.8) as candidate participants in the GrnA cell death pathway based on their binding to recombinant GrnA (30Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Gotz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmermann B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1994; 375: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Beresford P.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PHAP II, which has nucleosome assembly protein activity (32Kawase H. Okuwaki M. Miyaji M. Ohba R. Handa H. Ishimi Y. Fujii-Nakata T. Kikuchi A. Nagata K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), is a GrnA substrate in vitro after GrnA loading with perforin and after CTL attack (13Beresford P.J. Xia Z. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Immunity. 1999; 10: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,34Beresford P.J. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9285-9290Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, PHAP II binds to purified core histones in an ionic interaction (data not shown and Ref. 42Nagata K. Saito S. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Furuya A. Kusano A. Hanai N. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether this negatively charged molecule could substitute for HS in the histone H1 cleavage reaction (Fig. 1 A). Histone H1 is cleaved by GrnA more efficiently on a molar basis in the presence of recombinant PHAP II compared with HS. Histone H1 is cleaved in the presence of HS to a fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa at the lowest concentration of GrnA tested (7 nm). At higher concentrations of GrnA, smaller fragments of ∼22- and 18-kDa are often seen; at the highest concentrations, no immunoreactive band is visible. It should be noted that all the histones migrate aberrantly on SDS-PAGE gels because of their charge. Molecular masses given in this paper are the apparent molecular masses. The digestion in the presence of PHAP II is more rapid and complete; none of the intermediate H1 cleavage products are detected at any of the concentrations tested. Histone H1 isoforms of differing mobilities, due to differences in backbone sequence or post-translational modifications (43Davie J.R. Chadee D.N. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1998; 30–31: 203-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are all susceptible to GrnA digestion. Histone H1 in vitro cleavage is inhibited by increasing concentrations of salt beginning at physiological concentrations of ∼150 mm. (Fig.1 B) The PHAP II-associated acidic protein PHAP I is comparable with PHAP II as a cofactor for GrnA in the histone H1 cleavage reaction (data not shown). The lack of specificity for the negatively charged cofactor and the inhibition by salt suggest that ionic interactions between these charged molecules are important. To determine whether histone H1 cleavage also occursin situ, we treated isolated HL60 nuclei with GrnA in the presence or absence of HS. (Fig.2 A) Within 1 h of incubation at 37 °C with 180 nm GrnA, histone H1 (visualized as a group of bands of molecular mass of ∼35 kDa) is cleaved to ∼25 kDa as seen on immunoblot. At higher concentrations, smaller fragments are sometimes visualized, as in in vitro assays. At higher enzyme concentrations or longer incubation times, no immunoreactive band is visualized, suggesting complete digestion (Fig.2, B and C). Similar results are found with nuclei isolated from Jurkat and HeLa cells (data not shown). The addition of HS does not enhance the cleavage, suggesting that native molecules in the nucleus can replace negatively charged HS. Cleavage occurs as early as 15 min after adding GrnA at concentrations of GrnA as low as 240 nm. To determine whether core histones might also be targets of GrnA, GrnA-treated nuclei were also analyzed by immunoblot for histones H2B and H3 (Fig. 2 D). Specific antibodies to the other core histones are not available. Both of these core histones were also cleaved to smaller fragments, with kinetics similar to the histone H1 cleavage reaction. Cleavage of the core histones is specific, since it does not occur with mutant enzyme or in the presence of GrnA inhibitor. Disruption of the histones in chromatin might alter the sensitivity of DNA to degradation by endonucleases activated during apoptosis. GrnA treatment of isolated nuclei without the addition of exogenous nucleases shows no apparent change in DNA length on agarose gels (data not shown). To determine whether GrnA treatment enhances the nuclease susceptibility of chromatin, isolated nuclei were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 and pretreated with GrnA with and without recombinant PHAP II before brief incubation with micrococcal nuclease (Fig. 3 A) Without GrnA pretreatment, genomic DNA is digested into oligonucleosomes; after GrnA pretreatment, only mononucleosome-sized fragments remain. Although PHAP II is a nucleosome assembly protein that might be expected to alter DNA accessibility, the addition of recombinant PHAP II, either alone or with GrnA, does not alter susceptibility to micrococcal nuclease. After limited RQ1 DNase I digestion of isolated nuclei (Fig. 3 B), DNA fragmentation is also more complete after GrnA pretreatment. DNA from nuclei that were mock-treated or treated with PMSF-inactivated GrnA contains fragments greater than 1.2 kilobases in size; after GrnA treatment, the largest visualized fragments are only 300 base pairs. Therefore, GrnA loading of intact nuclei enhances DNA nuclease digestion. GrnA enhancement of endonuclease susceptibility requires its serine protease activity. Although the PHAP proteins can be found in either the nucleus or cytoplasm, they do not localize to the nucleus by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot under the exponential growth conditions used here (data not shown). Because DNA is a prominent acidic nuclear molecule associated with histones and because DNA binds in a sequence-independent manner to GrnA (data not shown), we determined whether plasmid DNA can substitute in vitro as the negatively charged moiety in the histone H1 cleavage reaction. When plasmid DNA is added, histone H1 is completely degraded (Fig.4 A). Adding approximately equal amounts by weight of plasmid DNA and histone H1 substrate optimizes cleavage in solution; either more or less leads to less rapid proteolysis (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). Histone H1 begins to be cleaved in vitro within 2 min and is completely degraded by 1 h (Fig. 4 B). Core histones contained in purified nucleosomes stripped of linker histones, prepared as described by Cote et al. (40Cote J. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Adolph K.W. Methods in Molecular Genetics. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1995: 108-128Google Scholar), were also cut by GrnA in vitro (Fig."

Activation of MOR by the stable enkephalin analogue, [d-Ala2,MePhe4,Glyol5]enkephalin, led to homologous MOR desensitization in oocytes coexpressing both G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 3 (GRK3) and β-arrestin 2 (arr3). Coexpression with either GRK3 or arr3 individually did not significantly enhance desensitization of responses evoked by wild type MOR activation. Mutation of serine or threonine residues to alanines in the putative third cytoplasmic loop and truncation of the C-terminal tail did not block GRK/arr3-mediated desensitization of MOR. Instead, alanine substitution of a single threonine in the second cytoplasmic loop to produce MOR(T180A) was sufficient to block homologous desensitization. The insensitivity of MOR(T180A) might have resulted either from a block of arrestin activation or arrestin binding to MOR. To distinguish between these alternatives, we expressed a dominant positive arrestin, arr2(R169E), that desensitizes G protein-coupled receptors in an agonist-dependent but phosphorylation-independent manner. arr2(R169E) produced robust desensitization of MOR and MOR(T180A) in the absence of GRK3 coexpression. These results demonstrate that the T180A mutation probably blocks GRK3- and arr3-mediated desensitization of MOR by preventing a critical agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation and suggest a novel GRK3 site of regulation not yet described for other G-protein-coupled receptors.

The molecular basis of tolerance manifests as a reduction in opioid agonist efficacy as demonstrated by a reduction in the rate of G-protein activation by the agonist-bound receptor complex (1Chavkin C. Goldstein A. Life Sci. 1982; 31: 1687-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Chavkin C. Goldstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, the modest reduction in cell surface receptor does not account for the observed decrease in agonist efficacy that accompanies tolerance measured biochemically (4Werling L.L. McMahon P.N. Cox B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6393-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5Tao P.L. Chang L.R. Chou Y.P. Loh H.H. Eur. J.

Neurosci. 1996; 15: 2684-2692Crossref Google Scholar), or electrophysiologically (7Christie M.J. Williams J.T. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 633-638PubMed Google Scholar). One mechanism of opioid receptor desensitization may be a receptor uncoupling from its effector system caused by receptor phosphorylation by a G-protein receptor kinase (GRK)1 and subsequent binding of an arrestin. The process of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization can be resolved as a series of steps leading from GPCR activation to receptor uncoupling, internalization, and receptor recycling (TableI). This model has evolved from the studies done in a large number of laboratories but principally championed by the Lefkowitz group using the β-adrenergic receptor signaling as a prototypic GPCR (8Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 9Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). In this scheme, GRKs phosphorylate the agonist-activated GPCR (8Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 9Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated GPCR induces a conformational change in arrestin, leading to arrestin activation (step 4), which unmasks arrestin's GPCR binding site and allows arrestin to bind the agonist-bound state of the GPCR (10Hirsch J.A.

Arrestin can also promote receptor internalization by serving as an adapter linking the GPCR-arrestin complex to dynamin and the clathrin-mediated endocytotic machinery (8Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 9Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). The internalized GPCR-arrestin complex can subsequently be recycled to the plasma membrane in its preactivated state following receptor dephosphorylation and disassembly of the complex. Alternatively, the arrestin-GPCR complex can be targeted to lysosomes for receptor degradation (8Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

When MOR is coexpressed in theXenopus oocyte heterologous gene expression system with G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels Kir3 (Kir3.1/3.4), receptor activation by the selective MOR agonist, DAMGO, elicits a sustained increase in potassium conductance. Additional expression of both GRK3 and arr3 led to a dramatic increase in the desensitization rate of this MOR response (13Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol.

Strong evidence for a critical GRK phosphorylation site in the C-terminal tail of MOR necessary for homologous MOR desensitization exists, although it remains a matter of controversy.

Differences in the intrinsic GRKs and arrestins in the cell lines used may have caused the apparent discrepancies between the studies. In addition, the desensitization assays used did not clearly distinguish between a change in opioid tolerance caused by receptor uncoupling, internalization, and impaired receptor recycling. Our goal then was to dissect GRK- and arrestin-mediated regulation of MOR in a simpler system to more specifically define the critical GRK phosphorylation sites required for homologous MOR desensitization. To this end, we constructed MOR mutants lacking potential GRK phosphorylation sites and asked whether GRK3- and arrestin 3-dependent desensitization of MOR was affected. DAMGO was from Peninsula Laboratories. Naloxone was from Research Biochemicals International. [3H]CTAP was from Multiple Peptide Systems. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The rat MOR cDNA described previously (13Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the Hin dIII site of pBluescript (Stratagene), which was used for one of three PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis protocols described previously (21Jin W.

Depending on the protocol used, appropriate pairs of sense and antisense oligonucleotides and/or oligonucleotides designed to target the 5′- and 3′-ends of the MOR cDNA were used to generate the described deletions or substitutions of the MOR cDNA. The sense oligonucleotides for the site-directed mutagenesis were as follows: ttacgactcaaggccgttcgcatgctagcgggcgccaaagaa (S261A/S266A/S268A) Δ47) gatacgccaaaatgaaggcggccgccaaca (T97A/T101A/T103A), and gccctggatttccgtgccccccgaaatgccaaaatcgttaacgtc (T180A). An adaptation of the QuickChange protocol from Stratagene was used to substitute serines 190, 195, and 195 to alanine. MOR(T97A/T101A/T103A) and MOR(T180A) cDNAs were made using the polymerase chain reaction overlap extension method (23Sterne-Marr R. Gurevich V.V. Goldsmith P. Bodine R.C. Sanders C Donioso L.A.

All MOR cDNA templates for RNA synthesis were amplified from corresponding mutagenized clones using a 5′ oligonucleotide (aatctagcatttaggtgacactatagaataggggccatggacagcac) that introduced an SP6 transcriptional recognition site and a 3′ oligonucleotide (t30agggcaatggagcagtttc) that introduced a 3′ poly(A) tail. In the same manner, using the 5′ oligonucleotide above and a 3′ oligonucleotide (t30tcatggatgcagaactctctgaagca), we introduced a stop site corresponding to a 47-amino acid truncation of the translated MOR for the construction of MOR(S261A/S266A/S268A) Δ47 and MOR Δ47. All MOR mutations were confirmed by sequencing. All cDNA clones used in this study were described previously (14Kovoor A. Celver J.P. Wu A. Chavkin C. Mol.

T7, T3, or SP6 mMESSAGE MACHINE kits (Ambion, Austin, TX) were used to generate capped cRNAs from the PCR templates of WT MOR and MOR mutants described under “Mutagenesis of MOR” or from linearized plasmid templates for rat GRK3 and bovine arr3. Defolliculated, stage IV oocytes were prepared as described (13Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). cRNA was injected (50 nl/oocyte) using a Drummond automatic microinjector, and then oocytes were incubated at 18 °C for 3–4 days in normal oocyte saline buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) solution supplemented with sodium pyruvate (2.5 mm) and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). Oocytes were clamped at −80 mV with two electrodes filled with 3 m KCl having resistances of 0.5–1.5 ohms using a Geneclamp 500 amplifier and pCLAMP 6 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data were digitally recorded (Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments) and an Intel 386 PC) and filtered. Membrane current traces were also recorded using a chart recorder. To facilitate the inward potassium current flow through the Kir3 channels, normal oocyte saline buffer (ND96) was modified to increase the KCl concentration to 16 mm, and the NaCl concentration was decreased correspondingly. Oocytes were injected with 0.05 ng of MOR, 0.25 ng of GRK3, and 5 ng of arr3 cRNA and then 3 days later were either untreated or pretreated for 1 h with 1 μm DAMGO and washed three times with room temperature ND96. Each group was then incubated for 20 min in 20 nm [3H]CTAP (0.25 μCi/mmol) in ND96 at 4 °C. Four oocytes per group were placed on Whatman GF/C 25-mm circular glass microfiber filter paper under vacuum pressure and washed twice with 500 μl of cold ND96 and placed in 2.5-ml Ecolite scintillation fluid (ICN) for quantification of bound [3H]CTAP. Student's t test (with two-tailed p values) was used for comparison of the independent mean values. Dose-response curves were fitted to a simple Emax model using NFIT software (Island Products, Galveston, TX). As described previously (13Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Kovoor A. Celver J.P. Wu A. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar), in oocytes injected with MOR, Kir3.1, and Kir3.4, DAMGO activation of MOR led to an increase in Kir3 current. Provided MOR expression was relatively low and both channel subunits, Kir3.1 and Kir3.4, were coexpressed, this MOR activation of Kir3 was remarkably stable, with only slight decreases in responsiveness during treatments as long as 12 h (14Kovoor A. Celver J.P. Wu A. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to previous reports in which MOR activation of Kir3 currents in Xenopus oocytes, desensitized rapidly (up to 60% in 4 min) when MOR was expressed with Kir3.1 alone or when MOR was expressed at relatively high levels (24Yu Y. Zhang L. Yin X. Sun H. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28869-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Under these latter conditions, the reduction in current observed was demonstrated to be heterologous desensitization, probably by receptor-independent channel inactivation (25Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, for this study the expression system was deliberately manipulated to minimize heterologous desensitization and to optimize the sensitivity of the system to homologous (GRK3- and arr3-mediated) desensitization of MOR. In addition, levels of MOR expression were adjusted to avoid the confounding effects of spare receptors. As previously reported, coexpression of GRK3 and arr3 led to a marked decrease in MOR responsiveness after pretreatment with DAMGO (Fig.1 B) (13Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Kovoor A. Celver J.P. Wu A. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar). Peak MOR responses from oocytes injected with cRNA for MOR, Kir3.1, and Kir3.4, or also with GRK3 or arr3 cRNA under the two-electrode voltage clamp configuration were measured in oocytes clamped at −80 mV. Oocytes from each group were then incubated in 1 μm DAMGO for 30–60 min. Each oocyte was then washed for 10 min in normal oocyte saline buffer (ND96), and the peak MOR response to 1 μm DAMGO after agonist pretreatment was measured and compared with the response prior to DAMGO incubation. In oocytes injected with MOR and Kir3, responses after DAMGO treatment were greater than 75% of the pretreatment values, and expression of GRK3 or arr3 alone did not significantly alter the MOR desensitization (Fig.1 B). Representative traces of the MOR responses measured before and after DAMGO treatments are displayed in Fig. 1 A. In contrast, coexpression of GRK3 and arr3 increased the extent of MOR desensitization (Fig. 1) as described previously (13Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Kovoor A. Celver J.P. Wu A. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of desensitization was found to be most dependent on the levels of arr3 expression. For example, increasing the amount of cRNA injection for arr3 with the same levels of GRK3 cRNA injected led to MOR responses that desensitized to similar extents in less than 10 min (14Kovoor A. Celver J.P. Wu A. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, decreasing the arr3 cRNA injected required much longer DAMGO incubations for the same degree of MOR desensitization to occur (13Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine whether the reduction in apparent MOR responsiveness was caused by receptor internalization, we performed [3H]CTAP binding assays with whole oocytes under the same conditions in which MOR desensitization was measured electrophysiologically. [3H]CTAP is an antagonist; thus, it will not induce desensitization. Also, it is a charged peptide; thus, it will label only cell surface receptors (26Kramer T.H. Shook J.E. Kazmierski W. Ayres E.A. Wire W.S. Hruby V.J. Burks T.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 249: 544-551PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]CTAP binding was significantly higher in oocytes expressing MOR than in uninjected oocytes (Fig. 1 C). After treatment with 1 μmDAMGO for 60 min, specific binding of [3H]CTAP was not significantly changed in oocytes expressing MOR, GRK3, and arr3. This result demonstrates that the reduction in response seen electrophysiologically was not caused by receptor internalization. To determine the critical phosphorylation sites important for the GRK3- and arr3-dependent desensitization described above, we began by removing the serines and threonines in the C-terminal tail by introducing a stop codon at residue 352 of MOR; MOR Δ47 lacks the last 47 amino acids (Fig.2 A). In addition, we substituted three of the serines in the third cytoplasmic loop of MOR (S261A/S266A/S268A) and introduced the C-terminal truncation resulting in MOR L3Δ47 (Fig. 2 A). Cumulative dose-response curves to DAMGO for WT MOR, MOR L3, MOR Δ47, and MOR L3Δ47 were generated (Fig. 2 B). EC50 values for DAMGO activation of WT MOR, MOR Δ47, and MOR L3Δ47 were not significantly different. The result indicates that the binding affinity and intrinsic efficacy of MOR were not significantly altered by the respective alanine substitutions or truncations (Fig. 2 B). GRK3 phosphorylation of the third cytoplasmic loop or the C-terminal tail has repeatedly been implicated in desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors, and strong evidence exists for a critical role of the C-terminal tail in MOR desensitization (15Deng H.B., Yu, Y.

Thus, we coexpressed GRK3 and arr3 with WT MOR and MOR Δ47 to determine if the serines and threonines in the C-terminal tail were required for GRK3- and arr3-mediated desensitization of MOR in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. As with the WT MOR, MOR Δ47 did not desensitize significantly in the absence of GRK3 and arr3 expression. However, when coexpressed with GRK3 and arr3, MOR Δ47 desensitized at rate that was indistinguishable from WT MOR. The result demonstrates that the serine and threonine residues in the C-terminal tail were not necessary for GRK3- and arr3-mediated desensitization in this system. To determine whether either residues in the third cytoplasmic loop or the C-terminal tail were sufficient for GRK3- and arr3-mediated desensitization of MOR, we compared the desensitization of WT MOR and MOR L3Δ47, which lacked potential GRK3 phosphorylation sites in the third cytoplasmic loop and the C-terminal tail. As before, MOR L3Δ47 expression by itself did not lead to significant receptor desensitization. Coexpression of GRK3 and arr3 with MOR L3 Δ47, however, caused a MOR L3Δ47 desensitization that was indistinguishable from GRK3- and arr3-dependent desensitization of the wild type MOR. These data suggest that GRK3- and arr3-dependent desensitization of MOR in this system did not require phosphorylation of the third cytoplasmic loop or the C-terminal tail of MOR. Since alanine substitution or removal of potential GRK3 phosphorylation sites of MOR in the third cytoplasmic loop and the C-terminal tail failed to block GRK3- and arr3-mediated desensitization of MOR, we next constructed MOR(T97A/T101A/T103A) and MOR(T180A), which lacked potential GRK3 phosphorylation sites in the first and second cytoplasmic loop, respectively (Fig.3 A). To ensure that the described mutations did not alter receptor functioning, we constructed cumulative dose-response curves to DAMGO for WT MOR, MOR(T97A/T101A/T103A), and MOR(T180A) (Fig. 3 B). EC50 values for DAMGO activation of WT MOR, MOR(T97A/T101A/T103A), and MOR(T180A) did not significantly differ, indicating that the receptor functioning of each receptor mutant was intact (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether the critical phosphorylation sites of MOR necessary for GRK3- and arr3-dependent desensitization reside in the first or second cytoplasmic loop, we coexpressed GRK3 and arr3 with MOR(T97A/T101A/T103A) and MOR(T180A) and compared the rates of desensitization with that of WT MOR. MOR(T97A/T101A/T103A) and MOR(T180A) did not desensitize significantly in the absence of GRK3 or arr3 expression (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, MOR(T97A/T101A/T103A), when expressed with GRK3 and arr3, desensitized at a rate that was indistinguishable from that of WT MOR under the same conditions (Fig. 4 B). MOR(T180A), in which a single threonine was substituted for an alanine, however, failed to desensitize in the presence of GRK3 and arrestin coexpression. Instead, MOR(T180A), expressed with GRK3 and arr3, desensitized at rate that was indistinguishable from control rates in the absence of GRK3 and arr3 expression. As a positive control for GRK3 and arr3 expression in the oocytes injected with MOR(T180A), Kir3, GRK3, and arr3, some of the oocytes from the following groups were also injected with cRNA for the β2-adrenergic receptor and Gαs. As previously reported, β2-adrenergic receptor activation by isoproterenol (1 μm) activated Kir3, a response that desensitizes rapidly only in oocytes also coexpressing GRK3 and arr3. β2-Adrenergic receptor desensitization rates in the oocytes injected with WT MOR; the WT MOR, GRK3, and arr3; and MOR(T180A), GRK3, and arr3 were 4.6 ± 1.9, 18.8 ± 3.8, and 16.7 ± 1.7% per min, respectively. The lack of significance between the latter two groups indicates that GRK3 and arr3 expressed well in oocytes expressing MOR WT and MOR(T180A). In addition, the lack of GRK- and arrestin-dependent desensitization of MOR(T180A) was not due to receptor overexpression or a change in the intrinsic efficacy of MOR(T180A). Specific [3H]CTAP binding to oocytes injected with 0.05 ng of cRNA for MOR WT or MOR(T180A) was not statistically different, 6.7 ± 0.9 and 4.7 ± 0.7 fmol bound, respectively (n = 10). In addition, the DAMGO-evoked peak responses measured electrophysiologically were similar, 620 ± 157 nA (MOR WT) and 350 ± 87 nA (MOR(T180A). Thus, the lack of GRK3/arr-mediated desensitization of MOR(T180A) did not result from a relative excess of MOR(T180A) expression compared with WT MOR expression. Furthermore, the average peak MOR response from oocytes injected with a higher dose of cRNA (0.1 ng) for each receptor was significantly higher for both receptor responses (1320 ± 1220 and 1000 ± 164 nA for MOR WT and MOR(T180A), respectively); the result demonstrated a lack of a receptor reserve for each receptor at the dose of cRNA used. These data suggest that MOR(T180A) failed to desensitize because threonine 180 is required for GRK3- and arr3-dependent desensitization of MOR. The insensitivity of MOR(T180A) presumably results from the loss of a critical GRK3 phosphorylation site. Alternatively, GRK3 could phosphorylate MOR(T180A) normally and activate arrestin, but the binding of the activated arr3 to MOR(T180A) might be impaired. To distinguish between these alternatives, we coexpressed WT MOR and MOR(T180A) with a form of arrestin known to desensitize the δ opioid receptor (DOR) and the β2-adrenergic receptor in a manner that was agonist-dependent but GRK-independent (11Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This “dominant positive” form of arrestin does not require activation by the phosphorylated GPCR, but it can bind and inactivate the agonist bound GPCR. Oocytes expressing arr2(R169E) showed robust agonist-dependent but GRK-independent, desensitization of MOR, whereas oocytes expressing WT arr2 did not show enhanced desensitization of MOR (Fig. 4). Furthermore, arr2(R169E) also caused robust desensitization of MOR(T180A) that was not statistically different from WT MOR desensitization by arr2(R169E). This enhanced desensitization of MOR by arr2(R169E) was not due to greater expression compared with arr2 WT. Expression of arr2 WT and arr2(R169E) in the oocytes used for in the desensitization experiments was found to be 0.53 ± 0.06 and 0.40 ± 0.05, respectively, in the MOR WT-expressing oocytes and 0.53 ± 0.07 and 0.41 ± 0.04 in the MOR(T180A)-expressing oocytes (ng of arrestin/μg of protein ± S.D.). These data suggest that the T180A mutation of MOR blocks GRK3- and arrestin-mediated desensitization, not by disrupting the arrestin binding to the receptor downstream of GRK action but because it removed a critical agonist-dependent GRK3 phosphorylation site necessary for arrestin activation. The principal finding of the study was that threonine 180 of MOR was required for GRK3- and arr3-dependent homologous desensitization of MOR expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In our investigation, the removal of potential GRK phosphorylation sites in all other cytoplasmic domains of MOR failed to block MOR desensitization by GRK3 and arr3. Because receptor internalization does not contribute to the desensitization events in this system, the study clearly focuses on the roles of GRK3 and arr3 in the initial receptor uncoupling process. In addition, we further characterized the actions of the dominant positive form of arrestin. Previously, we demonstrated the agonist-dependent but GRK-independent desensitization of DOR and β2-adrenergic receptor by the dominant positive arr2(R169E). Here we report that arr2(R169E) also desensitized MOR in a GRK-independent but agonist-dependent manner. The observation that MOR(T180A) remained sensitive to arr2(R169E) suggested that MOR(T180A) lacked a critical GRK3 phosphorylation site necessary for homologous MOR desensitization. From extensive studies of GRK and arrestin regulation of G-protein-coupled receptors, a common theme has evolved. Serine or threonine residues in the third cytoplasmic loop or the C-terminal tail have repeatedly been demonstrated to be responsible for the regulation of GPCRs by GRKs and arrestins. For example, GRK phosphorylation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m1 and m2subtypes is predominately in the third cytoplasmic loop (27Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Honma T. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5323-5330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Haga K. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U. Shiozaki K. Uchiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2776-2782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, the δ- and κ-opioid receptors (DORs and KORs) require GRK phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail for GRK- and arrestin-dependent desensitization (13Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Appleyard S.M. Celver J.P. Pineda V. Kovoor Wayman G.A. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23802-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The difference between the critical site in MOR and the other GPCRs cannot be attributed to the differences in the expression system, since DOR and KOR desensitization were also characterized using the oocyte system. Interestingly, the finding that homologous MOR desensitization inXenopus oocytes does not require a C-terminal tail determinant was not the only disparity among these closely related opioid receptor subtypes in this system. Homologous MOR desensitization by GRK3 and arr3 proceeds with a dramatically slower time course compared with that of DOR and KOR. Although the rate of MOR desensitization can be accelerated with increased arrestin expression, under conditions where DOR and KOR desensitize in minutes, MOR desensitization required hours in this system (13Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Appleyard S.M. Celver J.P. Pineda V. Kovoor Wayman G.A. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23802-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The relatively slow desensitization rate of MOR might result from a slower kinetics of GRK3 phosphorylation, a less efficient activation of arrestin, or a slower association of activated arrestin with the GPCR. The observation that the dominant positive form of arrestin desensitizes MOR at rates that were equivalent to DOR and KOR desensitization rates suggests that the last explanation is unlikely. Our hypothesis is that GRK3-phosphorylated MOR is a less efficient activator of arrestin than either DOR or KOR, but this remains to be directly tested. The findings that threonine 180 was required for the GRK- and arrestin-mediated desensitization of MOR and that the C-terminal tail was not involved are in sharp contrast with studies of this type in mammalian cell line expression systems (15Deng H.B., Yu, Y.

Although not agreeing on the exact residues responsible, prior studies of MOR desensitization in hypertransfected mammalian cell lines have pointed to sites within the C-terminal tail. The basis for the discrepancy between those studies and this one is not clear. The results using mammalian cell lines often rely on the intrinsic kinase and arrestins expressed; thus, the difference could be due to differences in GRK3 and arr3 and the unknown intrinsic proteins. The desensitization assays using mammalian cell lines are also strongly affected by internalization and receptor recycling rates, and overexpression of receptors produces a large opioid receptor reserve. The contributions of each of these to the tolerance observed would confound the measure of receptor desensitization. The receptor domains responsible for internalization and recycling are likely to be different from those responsible for receptor uncoupling. This distinction has been clearly demonstrated for cannabanoid and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (21Jin W. Brown S. Roche J.P Hsieh C. Celver J.P. Kovoor A. Chavkin C. Mackie K.J. Neuroscience. 1999; 19: 3773-3780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yu Y. Zhang L. Yin X. Sun H. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28869-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as discussed by Law et al. (30Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), recycling of MOR in mammalian cell lines can occur within minutes of agonist treatment such that the number of uncoupled receptors in cells highly overexpressing MOR may not be large enough to see a decrease in MOR-mediated second messenger responses. In addition, the presence of a large receptor reserve requires a large fraction of receptor uncoupling before a significant change in the second messenger response can be measured. This is supported by those who have found a lack of correlation of MOR phosphorylation with receptor desensitization in cells highly overexpressing MOR (31Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 32El Kouhen R. Kouhen O.M. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9207-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This correlation was clearly demonstrated, however, when receptor recycling pathways were blocked or when the functional receptor number was decreased with the treatment of cells with a irreversible MOR antagonist (30Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since desensitization can potentially occur either by receptor uncoupling or internalization, to fully understand both processes it is necessary to have assays that distinguish these mechanisms and clearly define which is involved in terminating the MOR response in the system used. For this reason, we deliberately expressed levels of MOR that were significantly less than those required to fully activate the coexpressed Kir3. This ensured a lack of receptor reserve for the response measured and allowed us to measure receptor desensitization as it occurred. Furthermore, the finding that the C-terminal tail truncation that has been shown to block MOR internalization in mammalian cell lines did not affect MOR desensitization in this system suggests that MOR internalization in the manner that it occurs in mammalian cell lines is not responsible for the homologous MOR desensitization that we observed. This conclusion is supported by the finding that specific [3H]CTAP binding was not decreased under conditions where MOR desensitization occurred. Therefore, it is likely that we have defined a critical role of Thr180 of MOR necessary for receptor uncoupling that is distinct from the role of the C-terminal tail in MOR internalization. Another intriguing possibility is that these data represent a homologue-specific action of GRK3 and arr3. In the Xenopus oocyte expression system, coexpression of GRK3 and arr3 was required for homologous MOR desensitization, which suggests the lack of endogenous enzymes that can substitute for either role. This is in contrast to mammalian cell expression systems where exogenous expression of GRK and arrestin is not required, making it difficult to clearly define roles of exogenously or endogenously expressed GRKs and arrestins. Receptor uncoupling and internalization of MOR represent intimately related cellular processes that may be involved in the development of tolerance to opioid drugs. Thus, understanding these processes in greater detail may enable the elucidation of the roles of these processes separate from other mechanisms of opioid tolerance such as learning and memory and other compensatory changes in neuronal circuitry. Similarly, defining markers for receptor internalization distinct from receptor uncoupling may provide tools to elucidate the roles of each of these processes in opioid tolerance as well as providing multiple targets for improving the clinical use of opioid drugs."

Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Most CDF genes were discovered through overexpression experiments, which resulted in resistance to toxicity from transition metals (2Nies D.H. J.

More recently, additional CDF members have been identified through sequence homology. Members of the CDF family are found in all biological kingdoms, and in eukaryotes, different CDF proteins may be localized to different organelles. In many cases, the normal function of CDF proteins is unknown. In a few cases, gene deletion studies or studies of naturally occurring mutants have defined a physiological role for CDF proteins. Gene knockout studies in mice have demonstrated that ZNT3 is responsible for the accumulation of vesicular Zn2+ in nerve cells (4Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). A mutation in a homologous gene, ZNT4, was shown to be responsible for the murine toxic milk syndrome. ZNT4 proved to be required for secretion of Zn2+ into breast milk (5Huang L. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The sequence of at least five genes in the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae places these genes within the CDF family. Two family members, COT1 and ZRC1, are localized to the vacuole (6Li L.

Other family members,MMT1 and MMT2, encode mitochondrial proteins that were identified through a suppressor screen. Overexpression of eitherMMT1 or MMT2 was shown to affect Fe2+levels in the mitochondria and cytosol (9Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28485-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, deletion of these genes, either alone or in combination, did not affect essential Fe2+-dependent mitochondrial processes, leaving their precise role in mitochondrial Fe2+ metabolism unclarified. The yeast gene YDR205W shows extensive homology to members of the CDF family, with some notable differences. Most members of the CDF family contain six transmembrane domains with an extensive histidine-rich cluster in a cytosolic loop. The protein sequence of YDR205W, however, reveals 12 transmembrane domains and two histidine-rich cytosolic clusters. A deletion in YDR205W was identified in a screen of mutants that affected the rate of meiotic sister chromatid exchange. The gene is referred to as MSC2 (10Thompson D.A. Stahl F.W. Genetics. 1999; 153: 621-641PubMed Google Scholar). The selection system was based on transposon insertion. When the gene was deleted, no increase in unequal sister chromatid exchange was detected in the deletion strain. Thus, the role of the gene in recombination events is unclear (10Thompson D.A. Stahl F.W. Genetics. 1999; 153: 621-641PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the characterization of a msc2 strain. The deletion strain shows an increased sensitivity to H2O2 and is not viable at 37 °C in glycerol-ethanol media. We further show that the deletion strain has an alteration in cellular Zn2+ content leading to an increase in nuclear Zn2+ content in cells grown on respiratory substrates. The yeast strains used in this study were DY150 and DY1457, which were derived from a W303 background. The diploid DY1640 was derived from a cross between DY150 and an isogenic strain with the opposite mating type, DY151 (11Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The media used included: 1% yeast extract, 2.0% peptone, and 2.0% glucose (YPD); 1.0% yeast extract, 2.0% peptone, 2.0% ethanol, and 2.0% glycerol (YPGE); a synthetic medium of yeast nitrogen base, amino acids, and glucose (CM); synthetic media with glycerol-ethanol (CMGE); and low zinc/low iron/low copper CMGE medium (yeast nitrogen base was from BIO101 Inc.). A double fusion PCR technique was used to delete YDR205W, generating the yeast strainmsc2 (12Amberg D.C. Botstein D. Beasley E.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The primers designed to amplify the 5′ end of YDR205W were 5′-GCAAGCCATTGATCAACGTG-3′ and 5′-GTCGTGACTGGGAAAACCCTGGCGAAACACCACCTGCCTCTATC-3′. The primers used to amplify the 3′ end were 5′-TCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTATCCGCTTTACCGCTACAGCCTATAGC-3′ and 5′-CATATATGATTCCTGAAGAC-3′. The HIS3 gene was used as the selectable marker. The double fusion PCR products were transformed into diploid cells (DY1640). The transformed diploid was sporulated, and spores containing the disruption were selected by growth on media lacking histidine. The deletion of YDR205W was confirmed by PCR. A probe to the YDR205W open reading frame was generated by PCR. Southern blot colony analysis (13Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H.

Genet. 1996; 13: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) was used to identify YDR205W in a yeast genomic library. The genomic library was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC#37323) and transformed into DH5αEscherichia coli. A plasmid containing the YDR205W open reading frame and a 1000-base pair upstream region was subcloned into low and high copy plasmids that contained URA3 as a selectable marker. A Myc epitope was added to the carboxyl terminus of YDR205W by PCR. The primers used were 5′-CCCCAAGCTTAGTAAAAGAGTATGTTGAGG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATTAATTCAAGTCCTCTTCAGAAATGAGCTTTTGCTCCATATTTGCTATAGGCTGTAGCGG-3′. A FLAG epitope construct was also generated by PCR using the primers 5′-CCCCAAGCTTAGTAAAAGAGTATGTTGAGG-3′ and 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCTTATCACTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAATCACCACCATTTGCTATAGGCTGTAGCGG-3′. The PCR products were ligated into both low copy and high copy vectors. A Zn-responsive β-galactosidase reporter construct containing the upstream sequence of theZRT1 gene (14Bird A.J. Zhao H. Luo H.

A Cu-sensitive β-galactosidase reporter construct containing the upstream sequence of CTR1 (15Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A Fe-sensitive β-galactosidase reporter construct was created from a PCR fragment of the FET3 promoter region. The PCR primers used to construct the fragment were 5′-TCCCCCGGGTGCCTTGGCTTGCCTATTTC-3′ and 5′-AAAACTGCAGGCATCTAGTTCTAATTTTTTGCTACTCTT-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the Sma I-Pst I sites of YEp354, a LacZ expression vector (16Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing theZap1 up allele was a gift from Dr. Dennis Winge. All plasmids were transformed into either wild type or msc2 cells. Cells were grown in glucose media or glycerol-ethanol media with different concentrations of transition metals for 3 or 14 h before the assay. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described previously (17Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1995Google Scholar). S1 analysis was performed as described previously (18Iyer V. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5208-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng of RNA was hybridized overnight at 55 °C with an end-labeled oligonucleotide probe forZRT1 or CMD1, which was used as an internal control. The RNA was digested by the addition of 50 units of S1 ribonuclease. The samples were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the developed gels were analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis. Cells grown in YPD were transferred to YPGE and grown for 12 h at 37 °C. Subcellular fractionation and organelle isolation were performed as described previously (19Glick, B. S., and Pons, L. A. (1995) 260,213–223Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, spheroplasts were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (“B” pestle). The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The 3,000 × g pellet was resuspended in mitochondria isolation buffer and centrifuged at 120 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and found by microscopy to be enriched in nuclei. The 3,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min and separated into a pellet and supernatant. The pellet was applied to a 15% Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 59,000 × g for 27 min, and the gradient was fractionated as described previously (20Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The 12,000 ×g supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min and separated into a pellet and supernatant. Each fraction was analyzed for protein concentration using the BCA reagent (Pierce) and for Zn2+ content using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometer as described previously (6Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Zinquin (CF-125) a gift from Dr. Thomas V. O'Halloran (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL) was used as described previously (3Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Cells grown in YPD were washed and transferred to YPGE. At specified times, cells were incubated with 25 μmzinquin for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, placed on concanavalin A (1 mg/ml)-coated slides, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells transformed with the Myc- tagged construct of Msc2p were prepared as described previously (6Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The cells were stained with a 1:100 dilution of a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Babco Inc.), followed by a 1:200 dilution of an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes). Cells treated with the primary and secondary antibody were incubated with 5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) for 5 min. Cytoplasm and membrane fractions were isolated from cells transformed with the FLAG-tagged Msc2p-containing plasmid. Samples were run on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with a 1:5000 dilution of a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) followed by a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The blot was developed with chemiluminescence reagents (Renaissance) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A yeast strain with a deletion in YDR205W (Δmsc2) was generated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The deletion strain,msc2, grew well in both YPD and CM at 30 °C and 37 °C. However, the strain showed a temperature-sensitive growth defect in YPGE media at 37 °C (Fig.1 A). The deletion strain also showed an increased sensitivity to H2O2, which was exacerbated by growth on glycerol-ethanol medium (Fig.1 B). Both the growth defect and the increased sensitivity to H2O2 were recessive traits because they were not expressed in the heterozygotic diploid. Microscopic examination ofmsc2 cells grown in YPGE at 30 °C revealed that a small percentage of the population had an abnormal morphology, typified by the presence of large cells containing giant granules. The majority of Δmsc2 cells showed the abnormal phenotype upon a shift in temperature to 37 °C (Fig. 2). Transformation of msc2 cells with either high or low copy plasmids containing MSC2 restored both normal growth and morphology. Increasing the concentration of Zn2+ in the medium restored normal morphology to msc2 cells. Increased media Zn2+ attenuated the growth defect of msc2 cells (Fig. 3 A, a) but did not restore a normal growth rate (Fig. 3 B). Supplementation of YPEG with other transition metals, such as Fe2+ (Fig.3 A, b), Cu2+ (Fig. 3 A, c), or Mn2+ (Fig. 3 A, d) had no effect on the growth defect or morphological abnormality of msc2 cells at 37 °C (data not shown).Figure 2Morphology of wild type and msc2 cells grown in glycerol-ethanol medium.

Wild type, msc2 cells, or msc2 cells transformed with high or low copy plasmids containing MSC2 were spotted on YPGE plates that contained different amounts of the specified transition metals. The cells were grown at 37 °C for 3 days and then photographed (A). Wild type cells and msc2 cells were grown in YPGE media with and without 5 mm Zn2+ at 37 °C. At selected times, samples were taken, and the optical density was measured at a wavelength of 600 nm (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The deletion phenotype suggests that MSC2 affects intracellular Zn2+ homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we measured the transition metal content of wild type andmsc2 cells grown in both glucose-containing and glycerol-ethanol-containing media. Cells grown at 30 °C in glycerol- ethanol media had a higher content of Fe2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ than did cells grown in glucose-containing media (TableI). Although the absolute content of metals differed in each experiment, the relative difference between metals was constant. Of the three transition metals assayed, growth in glycerol-ethanol had a greater affect on Zn2+ than it did on Fe2+ or Cu2+. The msc2 strain grown in either glucose or glycerol-ethanol had similar levels of Fe2+ and Cu2+ when compared with the wild type parent. However, when grown in glycerol-ethanol, msc2 cells had a 50% increase in intracellular Zn2+ compared with wild type cells. Increases in the Zn2+ content ofmsc2 cells were seen at several different concentrations of media Zn2+ (data not shown). Zn2+ content was not uniformly increased in all msc2 organelles. A membrane fraction had a higher Zn2+ content than did the cytosol (Fig. 4). Of all membrane fractions examined, nuclei-enriched fractions had the highest Zn2+content. A more extensive subcellular fractionation was precluded by the loss of Zn2+ from cellular organelles.Table IMetal content of cells grown in CM or CMGE mediaWT/CMΔmsc2/CMWT/CMGEΔmsc2/CMGECu0.44 ± 0.070.50 ± 0.070.60 ± 0.090.90 ± 0.17Fe1.87 ± 0.181.78 ± 0.103.51 ± 0.063.14 ± 0.06Zn3.29 ± 0.483.38 ± 0.3810.32 ± 0.4817.72 ± 1.62Cells were inoculated in CM or CMGE media and grown for 12 hr.

Zinquin is a fluoresceine derivative that fluoresces when bound to Zn2+ and can be visualized microscopically. The intensity of the zinquin fluorescence changes as the levels of Zn2+ change. Wild type cells grown in glycerol-ethanol and incubated in zinquin show a diffuse cytosolic fluorescence. Both the level and distribution of fluorescence change dramatically when intracellular Zn2+ levels are increased. The Zn2+-regulated transcription factor ZAP1 induces the transcription of genes involved in Zn2+ transport and metabolism (22Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the absence of Zn2+, Zap1p permits the transcription of Zn2+-regulated genes through its binding to specific DNA sequences termed zinc-responsive elements. Zap1p regulates the transcription of ZRT1, which encodes a high affinity Zn2+ transporter. Transformation of wild type cells with an allele of the Zn transcriptional regulatorZAP1 up results in constitutive expression of Zn-regulated genes, leading to an increased concentration of cellular Zn2+ (22Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Cells expressing ZAP1 up show increased zinquin fluorescence, with the fluorescence localized to punctate vesicles. Δmsc2 cells also show a robust zinquin fluorescence with the signal concentrated in punctate vesicles (Fig.5). These data support the observation that cellular Zn2+ levels are altered in the Δmsc2 strain. As discussed below, we feel that the vesicular location of the zinquin fluorescence does not reflect the normal distribution of Zn2+. We took advantage of the ability of Zap1p to sense intracellular Zn2+ levels to further demonstrate thatmsc2 cells show an alteration in Zn2+homeostasis. Wild type and msc2 cells were transformed with a plasmid carrying a Zn2+-regulated β-galactosidase reporter construct derived from the promoter elements ofZRT1. As expected, incubation of cells in high Zn2+ medium resulted in decreased transcription of the Zn2+ regulon and low levels of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 6). Conversely, incubation of wild type cells in low Zn2+ media resulted in increased expression of the Zn2+ regulon and increased levels of β-galactosidase. However, incubation of msc2 cells in low Zn2+ media did not result in increased β-galactosidase activity, suggesting that Zap1p may be occupied by Zn2+ and thus transcriptionally inactive. The effect of the MSC2 gene deletion on Zn2+-dependent β-galactosidase activity was seen only when cells were grown in glycerol-ethanol medium. No effect was seen in cells grown in glucose- or galactose-containing media. Alteration in intracellular metal homeostasis was selective for Zn2+ because reporter constructs designed to measure cytosolic levels of Cu2+or Fe2+ showed no alteration in β-galactosidase activity in cells grown in either glucose or glycerol-ethanol. This result is consistent with the determination of metal concentrations in wild type and msc2 cells (Table I), which demonstrated that only Zn2+ was affected by deletion of MSC2. Decreased expression of the Zn2+ regulon in glycerol-ethanol-grown msc2 cells was confirmed by S1 analysis using a probe designed to measure ZRT1 transcripts (Fig. 7). The amount of ZRT1 transcript was reduced in msc2 cells, but not to the same level as measured by the reporter construct. To test the possibility that deletion of MSC2 acted downstream of Zn2+-regulated transcriptional control, both wild type andmsc2 cells were transformed with a plasmid containing theZAP1 up allele. Transformed wild type andmsc2 cells had similar levels ofZRT1-β-galactosidase activity. Similar results were obtained measuring ZRT1 transcript levels. These results suggest that deletion of MSC2 alters the transcription of Zn2+-responsive genes by affecting cellular Zn2+ levels. We generated an epitope-tagged (FLAG) Msc2p to determine its location. MSC2 is predicted to encode a protein of 84 kDa. Western analysis showed the FLAG-tagged Msc2p migrating at a molecular mass of ∼75 kDa (Fig.8 A). Genetic studies confirmed that the epitope marked Msc2p expressed in both low or high copy plasmids complemented the deletion strain with regard to H2O2 sensitivity and inability to grow on glycerol-ethanol at 37 °C (data not shown). Immunofluorescence studies using the high copy Myc-tagged plasmid indicated that the protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum/nucleus (Fig.8 B), as further demonstrated by the images of the Myc-tagged Msc2p surrounding the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nucleus (Fig. 8 C). The appearance of the Myc-tagged protein in the structure near the plasma membrane has been seen for other endoplasmic reticulum proteins (21Romano J.D. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2231-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The CDF transporters affect the concentration of transition metals within cells. Overexpression of CDF genes in bacteria results in increased transition metal resistance by elevating metal export. Increased expression of CDF genes in eukaryotes may also provide transition metal resistance, although eukaryotes sequester metals in intracellular compartments rather than exporting them. Sequestration of metals in vesicles has the effect of lowering their concentration in cytosol. As reported previously, some of yeast CDF proteins are in nonendocytic organelles, and the function of these proteins is less clear. The sequence of MSC2 clearly places it within the CDF family, although the deduced sequence is much larger than other members of the family. By direct sequencing of the isolated functionalMSC2 gene, we have confirmed that the sequence reported in the data base is correct. The size of the epitope-tagged protein (75 kDa) is lower than predicted (84 kDa) but is still larger than the rest of the CDF members. One explanation for the difference between the observed and predicted size is that the protein undergoes posttranslational processing. Our localization data indicate that the protein is localized to an internal membrane system. Overexpressed protein is found in the endoplasmic reticulum/nucleus. We have not been able to detect the protein when expressed by a low copy vector. Thus, the localization of the protein to the nucleus or endoplasmic reticulum is tentative. We have identified a mammalian homologue of Msc2p, which is of a similar size and shows 63% homology to Msc2p, but expression of this homologue in yeast does not complement the msc2 phenotype. The phenotype of the msc2 cells and suppression of the phenotype by increased media Zn2+ suggest that Msc2p is involved in Zn2+ homeostasis. Synthesis of eitherMSC2 mRNA or protein, however, is not regulated by Zn2+ (22Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). 2L. Li and J. Kaplan, unpublished results.Deletion of MSC2 led to a dramatic morphological abnormality and a growth defect in glycerol-ethanol media at 37 °C. Increased media Zn2+ suppressed the morphological abnormality and reduced the growth deficit of msc2 cells. Surprisingly, when grown under identical conditions, msc2 cells had higher Zn2+ levels than control cells. Subcellular fractionation studies indicated that compared with wild type cells, msc2 cells show decreased cytosolic Zn2+ and increased membrane-associated Zn2+, specifically in fractions that were enriched in nuclei. The increased fluorescence of zinquin observed in msc2 cells also suggests an increased Zn2+ content. We expected that the zinquin fluorescence would reflect not only the increased intracellular Zn2+ but also the localization of the Zn2+. The intensity of the zinquin fluorescence did increase in msc2, but the dye was localized in small punctate vesicles. Previously, we reported that overexpression of a vacuolar Zn2+ transporter, Zrc1p, protected cells against Zn2+ toxicity (6Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cells expressing Zrc1p showed an increase in zinquin fluorescence. The fluorescence did not localize to the vacuole but was again found in small punctate vesicles, as we observed in this study (data not shown). Our interpretation of these results is that zinquin-bound Zn2+ is accumulated in vesicles, regardless of the initial distribution of Zn2+. Therefore, the vesicular localization of zinquin fluorescence may not represent the normal distribution of Zn2+ and should be interpreted with caution. There is a precedent for this interpretation because in some mammalian cells, fluoresceine derivatives used for either Ca2+ or pH measurements accumulate in small vesicles. This accumulation does not reflect the native distribution of either Ca 2+ or H+ but is due to accumulation of the dye by a probenacid-inhibitable organic anion transporter (24Cao C.X. Silverstein S.C. Neu H.C. Steinberg T.H. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 165: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have not determined whether probenacid will inhibit the vesicular accumulation of zinquin in yeast. Measurement of the Zn2+ content of subcellular organelles suggests that msc2 cells have a higher nuclear Zn2+ content than wild type cells. This conclusion is supported by the differential response of Zn2+-regulated genes in msc2 cells compared with wild type cells.msc2 cells grown in glycerol-ethanol show decreased expression of Zn2+-regulated genes, which can be overcome by the constitutive allele of ZAP1 (ZAP1 up ). This result indicates that deletion of MSC2 does not prevent Zn2+ from entering the nucleus but rather reduces the egress of Zn2+. The function of MSC2 appears analogous to the CDF family membersMMT1/MMT2 because these genes regulate the distribution of Fe2+ between mitochondria and cytosol. Why does the altered distribution of Zn2+ result in a growth deficit seen only in glycerol-ethanol at the elevated temperature? Our data demonstrate that growth on glycerol-ethanol leads to an increase in transition metal content, particularly in Zn2+ content. It is thought that increased transition metal content is a reflection of increased mitochondrial activity necessary for respiratory activity. A number of enzymes, even cytosolic enzymes, that are necessary for respiratory activity, such as ALD2 orALD3, are Zn2+-requiring enzymes. Transcripts for these enzymes are increased under stress or Zn2+deprivation (23Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It might be expected that under the dual conditions of stress (due to increased temperature) and respiratory growth, alterations in cellular Zn2+ metabolism would be exacerbated. Under these conditions, Δmsc2 cells show increased nuclear zinc, depressing the transcription of Zn2+-regulated enzymes, and decreased cytosolic Zn2+, decreasing the activity of Zn2+-requiring enzymes. Supplementation of media Zn2+ results in an increase in cellular zinc levels, decreasing transcription of the Zn2+ regulon while, at the same time, increasing the absolute concentration of Zn2+ in the cytosol. The increased cytosolic Zn2+ may populate Zn2+-requiring proteins. It is known that transition metals must gain access to the nucleus, both as structural components (Zn2+ fingers) and as regulatory components (metal-sensing transcription factors). Zn2+, as a small molecule, would be expected to diffuse freely between cytosol and nucleus without the need for a transporter to effect either entry or exit. Our data suggest that under the dual conditions of increased temperature and respiratory growth, movement between the nucleus and cytosol becomes rate-limiting, requiring the participation of a transporter. Based on sequence homology, we assume that Msc2p is a Zn2+ transporter. The possibility exists that Msc2p may transport Zn2+chelates, which become rate-limiting under stress conditions. Whereas further experiments are required to determine the chemical nature of the transported molecule, our data do demonstrate that Msc2p is a zinc transporter that is localized to an internal membrane and can effect alterations in cellular Zn2+ homeostasis. We thank our colleagues in the Utah Metals group for their help in preparing the manuscript and Drs. J. Gitscher and R. Palmiter for sharing information regarding gene sequences."

The reaction is catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. eIF-5A is the only protein in eukaryotes and archaebacteria known to contain hypusine. Although both eIF-5A and deoxyhypusine synthase are essential genes for cell survival and proliferation, the precise biological function of eIF-5A is unclear. We have previously proposed that eIF-5A may function as a bimodular protein, capable of interacting with protein and nucleic acid (Liu, Y. P., Nemeroff, M., Yan, Y. P., and Chen, K. Y. (1997)Biol. Signals 6, 166–174). Here we used the method of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to identify the sequence specificity of the potential eIF-5A RNA targets. The post-SELEX RNA obtained after 16 rounds of selection exhibited a significant increase in binding affinity for eIF-5A with an apparent dissociation constant of 1 × 10−7m. The hypusine residue was found to be critical for this sequence-specific binding. The post-SELEX RNAs shared a high sequence homology characterized by two conserved motifs, UAACCA and AAUGUCACAC. The consensus sequence was determined as AAAUGUCACAC by sequence alignment and binding studies. BLAST analysis indicated that this sequence was present in >400 human expressed sequence tag sequences. The C terminus of eIF-5A contains a cold shock domain-like structure, similar to that present in cold shock protein A (CspA). However, unlike CspA, the binding of eIF-5A to either the post-SELEX RNA or the 5′-untranslated region of CspA mRNA did not affect the sensitivity of these RNAs to ribonucleases. These data suggest that the physiological significance of eIF-5A-RNA interaction depends on hypusine and the core motif of the target RNA.

These data suggest that the physiological significance of eIF-5A-RNA interaction depends on hypusine and the core motif of the target RNA. eukaryotic initiation factor 5A systematic evoluton of ligands by exponential enrichment histidine-tagged human eIF-5A precursor histidine-tagged human eIF-5A Rev response element cold shock domain cold shock protein A hypusine polymerase chain reaction nucleotide single-stranded bovine serum albumin expressed sequence tag untranslated region Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A),1 ubiquitously present in eukaryotes and archaebacteria, but not in eubacteria, is the only protein known to contain a hypusine residue (for review, see Refs.1Park M.H.

Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Hypusine is formed in two steps: (i) deoxyhypusine synthase catalyzes the transfer of a 4-aminobutyl moiety from spermidine to a specific lysine residue to form a deoxyhypusine residue,N ε-(4-aminobutyl)lysine; and (ii) deoxyhypusine hydroxylase catalyzes the hydroxylation of the deoxyhypusine residue to form hypusine (N ε-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine). The fact that nature has committed two enzymes to produce one hypusine residue on a single protein underscores the importance of this posttranslational modification. Hypusine formation is tightly coupled to cell proliferation and is essential for cell survival (1Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Biofactors. 1993; 4: 95-104PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y.

Cancer Lett. 1996; 105: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, hypusine formation activity exhibits a marked increase in virally transformed cells (11Chen Z.P. Chen K.Y. Cancer Lett. 1997; 115: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) but a striking attenuation in senescent cells (12Chen Z.P. Chen K.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of eIF-5A in cell proliferation and survival, the physiological function of this protein is unclear. The notion that eIF-5A is an initiation factor comes from the earlier observations that it can be isolated from the ribosome-bound fraction and that it can stimulate the synthesis of methionyl-puromycin (13Benne R. Brown-Luede M. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3070-3075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Park M.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 18527-18530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of eIF-5A in translation initiation has been questioned because of a lack of correlation between eIF-5A and general protein synthesis (16Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12903-12906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gordon E.D. Mora R. Meredith S.C. Lindquist S.L. J. Biol.

Recent studies have suggested that eIF-5A may serve as a target protein for the human immunodeficiency virus type I Rev protein (19Ruhl M. Himmelspach M. Bahr G.M. Himmerschmid F. Jaksche H. Wolff B. Aschauer H. Farrington G.K. Probst H. Bevec D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Rex protein (20Katahira J. Ishizaki T. Sakai H. Adachi A. Yamamoto K. Shida H.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3125-3133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, conflicting data have appeared, and direct evidence of interaction between eIF-5A and viral proteins is lacking (21Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction studies of the eIF-5A precursor from two archaea species show that it is composed of two domains connected by a flexible hinge (22Peat T.S. Newman J. Waldo G.S. Berendzen J. Terwilliger T.C.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 1207-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Yokota H. Kim R. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10419-10424Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains the hypusine residue, which carries two positive charges and closely resembles spermidine and spermine. The C-terminal domain consists of five β-strands, which closely resemble the cold shock domain (CSD) present in bacterial cold shock protein A (CspA). These studies suggest that eIF-5A may interact with nucleic acids, particularly RNA. This notion is substantiated by our previous finding that eIF-5A is capable of binding to Rev response element (RRE) and U6 RNA in vitro (25Liu Y.P. Nemeroff M. Yan Y.P. Chen K.Y. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the finding that the TIF51A gene, which encodes eIF-5A in yeast, could complement the temperature-sensitive growth and mRNA decay phenotypes of ts1159 mutant yeast (24Zu D. Jacobson A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2914-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used the strategy of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX; Ref. 26Turek C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 1249: 505-510Crossref Scopus (7692) Google Scholar) to enrich RNA sequences that bind to eIF-5A with high affinity. We demonstrated that the RNAs enriched over 16 rounds of SELEX shared a high sequence homology, and, more importantly, the binding of eIF-5A to the selected RNAs requires the presence of the hypusine residue. [α-32P]UTP and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from ICN Chemical Radioisotope Division (Irvine, CA). The yeast expression vector pYES2 was a gift of Drs. Herbert and Celia Tabor (National Institutes of Health). Glutathione S-transferase-Rev and pGEM-RRE were given by Dr. Michael H. Malim (University of Pennsylvania), and pET11-CspA and pJJGO2 containing the CspAgene were given by Dr. Masayori Inoyue (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey). All NTPs and RNase inhibitor were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Restriction enzymes and other molecular biological supplies including SP6 RNA polymerase and T7 RNA polymerase were from Promega or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The plasmid pQEh18K containg histidine-tagged the human eIF-5A cDNA insert was constructed from pQTy21 as described previously (27Tao Y. Chen K.Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The histidine-tagged eIF-5A precursor is termed 6xHis-18K-lys, where 18K and lys refer to the apparent molecular weight and the unmodified lysine residue at position 50, respectively. The plasmid pYER18K was constructed by inserting the 6xHis-human eIF-5A cDNA between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of yeast expression vector pYES2. The histidine-tagged eIF-5A is termed 6xHis-18K-hyp, where the lysine 50 residue has been converted to the hypusine residue (hyp). The 6xHis-18K-lys protein was overexpressed inEscherichia coli strain BL 21 (DE3), and the 6xHis-18K-hyp protein was overexpressed in yeast (strain 2602). Both 6xHis-18K-lys and 6xHis-18K-hyp were purified by metal affinity chromatography and fast protein liquid chromatography. The oligonucleotide template used for SELEX was first constructed as a single-stranded 98 mer with the following sequence: 5′-GCGGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAACAGTCCGAGCC(N)40GGGTCAATGCGTCATA-3′, where the central 40 base pairs contained a random sequence (N) based on equal incorporation of A, G, C, and T at each position. The complementary strand was synthesized by annealing a primer with the sequence 5′-GCGGGATCCTATGACGCATTGACCC-3′ (primer 2) followed by the DNA polymerase reaction using a Klenow fragment. Primer 1, containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence, was used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification: 5′-GCGGAATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAACAGTCCGAGCC-3′. Restriction sites for BamHI and EcoRI were included in both primers for cloning. A degenerate double-stranded DNA template was synthesized by PCR using primer 1 (T7 primer) and primer 2 (reverse primer). The template obtained from the PCR reaction was used for in vitro transcription to generate a random pool of RNA molecules as described (28Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). The transcribed RNA was purified by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. RNA was dissolved in an annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmKCl, and 2 mm MgCl2) heated at 95 °C for 2 min and then put on ice for 20 min before the start of the binding reaction. To initiate the in vitro selection, the random pool RNAs were first eluted through a 200-μl Ni-nitrilo triacetic acid-resin column (Promega). The eluted RNAs were incubated at 4 °C with 6xHis-18K-hyp (2 μm) in a 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 30 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, and 3 μg tRNA for 30 min. The binding mixture was then passed through the Ni-nitrilo triacetic acid-resin column (bed volume 20 μl) and washed with 6 ml of binding buffer containing 0.02m imidazole and another 4 ml of binding buffer containing 0.05 m imidazole. The bound RNAs were then eluted with the binding buffer containing 0.4 m imidazole. The eluted RNAs were reverse-transcribed by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (20 units; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using primer 2 in the reverse transcription buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cDNAs obtained were then amplified by PCR using primers 1 and 2. The PCR product was purified by electrophoresis through 8% polyacrylamide gels, eluted, and transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase to generate the pool 1 RNAs for the second round of selection. After the 16th selection cycle, the cDNAs obtained from the selected RNAs were cloned into pCR II vector (Invitrogen) for sequence determination. The 252-nucleotide (nt) RRE RNA was synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase using linearized pGEM-RRE as the template in the presence of [α-32P]UTP and purified by electrophoresis as described (29Heaphy S. Dingwall C. Ernberg I. Gait M. Green S.M. Karn J. Lowe A.D. Singh M. Skinner M.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 685-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The RNAs with sizes of 23, 44, and 86 nt were synthesized by transcribing of the fragment obtained from restriction enzyme digestion of pBluescript IISK with, respectively, XhoI, HindIII, and XbaI. The sequences of these RNAs are: 23 nt, GGCGAAUUGGGUACCGGGCCCCC; 44 nt, GGCGAAUUGGGUACCGGGCCCCCCCUCGAGGUCGACGGUAUCG; and 86 nt, GGCGAAUUGGGUACCGGGCCCCCCCUCGAGGUCGACGGUAUCGAUAAGCUUGAUAUCGAAUUCCUGCAGCCCGGGGGAUCCACUA. The random RNAs (pre-SELEX RNA) were synthesized using the 98 mer containing N40 as the template. The post-SELEX RNAs were obtained by T7 polymerase transcription of the selected oligonucleotides as template. All the RNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]UTP by T7 RNA ploymerase, and the labeled RNA probes were gel-purified by electrophoresis using a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The labeled RNA was eluted with a solution containing 0.3 m sodium acetate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS at 37 °C. For preparation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes, the specific primer was first labeled with [γ-32P] ATP by T4 kinase and PCR amplification, the labeled PCR products were heated to 100 °C, and ssDNA was separated by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. The filter binding assay was carried out in a final volume of 15 μl binding buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2 10 mmKCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA) containing 6xHis-18K-hyp and fixed amounts of RNA (∼50 pm). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. The binding mixture was then filtered through a 0.45-μm BA85 nitrocellulose filter paper (Schleicher & Schuell). The filter paper was thoroughly washed with a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm KCl. Radioactivity retained on the filter paper was measured by an LS650 liquid scintillation counter. The retention of free RNA (always <10%) was substracted from all data points. Radioactively labeled RNA or ssDNA (∼10 fmol) was incubated with 6xHis-18K-hyp or 6xHis-18K-lys protein for 15 min on ice in 15 μl of binding buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, yeast tRNA at indicated concentrations). The stringent conditions referred to the binding reactions carried out in the presence of high tRNA concentrations (>2 μm). The binding mixture was loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel made in Tris borate-EDTA buffer containing 5% glycerol, and electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C. After the electrophoresis the gel was vacuum-dried and visualized by autoradiography. RNA probes were radiolabeled with [α -P32]UTP during in vitrotranscription. The labeled RNA was incubated with various amounts of purified 6xHis-18K-hyp or other recombinant proteins in the RNA binding buffer for 15 min on ice. RNase T1 or RNase A was then added to the binding mixture to initiate RNA digestion. The reaction mixture was kept on ice for 15 min and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed and dried on a DE-81 paper for autoradiography. Fig.1 A shows the purification of the recombinant eIF-5A precursor (6xHis-18K-lys) from E. coliand the recombinant eIF-5A (6xHis-18K-hyp) from yeast (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 8). The RNA binding activity of these two recombinant proteins was compared with that of the wild type HeLa eIF-5A. Fig. 1 B shows that HeLa eIF-5A and recombinant eIF-5A 6xHis-18K-hyp, but not the eIF-5A precursor 6xHis-18K-lys, could bind to RRE RNA (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 7 versus lane 3), indicating that the histidine tag did not interfere with the RNA binding activity of recombinant eIF-5A. We therefore could use 6xHis-18K-hyp affinity chromatography to initiate the in vitro selection. To determine the optimal size of RNA required for in vitro selection, we have tested the binding of eIF-5A to RNAs of different sizes under nonstringent conditions. Fig. 2 shows that 6xHis-18K-hyp did not bind to the 23- or 44-nt RNA (Fig. 2, lanes 1–6) but could bind to the longer RNA with a length of 86 nt (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 9 versus lane 7). On the basis of this result, we designed a DNA template with a total length of 98 nt, consisting of a variable region of 40 nt (N40) and a 5′-end-flanking region containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Both 5′- and 3′-end-flanking regions were designed to avoid self-complementarity and to minimize secondary structure formation that may bias the selection (30Berglund J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1042-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The 98-nt template was used to generate a DNA pool consisting of ∼1024 unique sequences. The DNA pool was transcribed in vitro to give a random RNA pool, termed pre-SELEX RNA. The selection was initiated with the random RNA pool, using 6xHis-18K-hyp as the bait protein (round 0). The RNA pool enriched after 16 cycles of selection was termed post-SELEX RNA. Post-SELEX RNA was then tested for binding with 6xHis-18K-hyp using a gel mobility shift assay. Fig. 3 Ashows that the binding affinity of 6xHis-18K-hyp for the post-SELEX RNA was ∼10-fold greater than that for random RNA under nonstringent conditions (Fig. 3 A, lane 4 versus lane 2). However, the difference in binding affinity became quite pronounced under a more stringent binding condition. Thus, with a higher concentration of tRNA (>2 μm) in the binding buffer, the binding of eIF-5A to random RNA was completely abolished (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2). In contrast, the binding between eIF-5A and post-SELEX RNA remained intact even in the presence of 20 μm tRNA (Fig. 3 B, lane 8). We also compared the binding of eIF-5A to RRE and U6 RNA with that to post-SELEX RNA. Fig. 4 shows that eIF-5A bound to all three RNAs equally well under nonstringent conditions (Fig. 4, lanes 2, 6, and 10). However, under more stringent conditions, eIF-5A bound only to post-SELEX RNA, but not RRE or U6 RNA (Fig. 4,lanes 8 and 12 versus lane 4). Although the binding of eIF-5A to RRE or U6 RNA appeared to be less specific, we cannot rule out the possibility that such binding could still serve some useful functions in vivo.Figure 4Binding of 6xHis-18K-hyp with post-SELEX RNA, U6 RNA, and RRE RNA. The 32P-labeled RNA probe (10,000 cpm) was incubated with 6xHis-18K-hyp at a final concentration of 4 μm, and the binding complex was analyzed by electrophoresis on a native polyacrylamide gel (8%; acrylamide/bis-acrylamide = 29).

Fig. 5 shows that both BSA, an unrelated protein, and 6xHis-18K-lys did not exhibit any binding activity with either random or the post-SELEX RNA (Fig. 5,lanes 2–6 and 11–15). In contrast, 6xHis-18K-hyp exhibited strong binding with the post-SELEX RNA but not with random RNA (Fig. 5, lanes 16–18 versus lanes 7–9). Because the difference between 6xHis-18K-hyp and 6xHis-18K-lys is limited to only one amino acid residue, namely, hypusine versus lysine, the striking difference in their binding activities toward post-SELEX RNA argues strongly for the important role of hypusine in the eIF-5A-RNA interaction. To characterize the nature of post-SELEX RNA, we have isolated independent clones from both pre- and post-SELEX RNA pools for sequence determination and binding study. Table Ilists the sequences of these RNA clones. The individual post-SELEX RNA clones exhibited strong binding to eIF-5A under stringent conditions (Fig. 6 A, lanes 3, 6, 9, and12). Assuming a 1:1 binding stoichiometry, the apparentK d value for the eIF-5A-RNA binding complex was estimated to be ∼1 × 10−7 (Fig.6 B). The apparent K d value for the binding of eIF-5A to random RNA was difficult to estimate because of the low binding affinity under the stringent conditions. The maximal level of binding of eIF-5A with post-SELEX RNA was >100-fold higher than that with pre-SELEX RNA.Table ISequence determination of post-SELEX and pre-SELEX RNACloneSequenceSequences of post-SELEX RNA clones 1AGCTATGACTCCTAAAACCACGCGCCTCGCAATGTCACAC 2AGCTAGTACTCCCTAACCATGTGCCGTCTAAATCTCACAC 3AGCTAGTAACTCCCTAACCCGCGCCTGCTAAATGTCACAC 4AGGCAAATACTTCCTAACCACGCCGCTCAAAATGTCACAC 5AGCGAATACTTCCTAACCACGCGCCTGCTAAATGTCACAC 6AGCTAGTACTCCCTAACCACGCGCCTGCTAAATGTCACAC 7AGCTAGTACTTAACCACGCGCCTCGTAAATGTCACAC 8GCTAGTACTCCTAACCACCTTAAATGTCACACCCGAG 9AGCATAGTACTTAACCACGCGCCTCGAAATGTCACAC 10AGCGAATACTTCCTAACCACGCGCCTGCTAAAGTCACAC 11AGCAGTACTCCCTAACCAACGCGCCTGCTAAATGTCACACSequences of pre-SELEX RNA clones aATATAGCTTAAGTGCTAAATACATTCCGTGACTTGCAGA bACTCAGACATACGCTAAGGTTTAATTAGCCTACAAGGTCAAATT cTGGATAACTAAATTTGATGAAAAGTTAGTTTGGGTT dGAGCCGCTAGTAATTGCCTGTACCTGTGCTTACGTGCGAAGA eCCTTCTGTCCAATATCCTGAGTCTTAGCTTA fGTCCATTAAGATACCAGTTAGGTAATCTAGGGTTGTTAGC gGTGATCGAGATAGATTCGAGTAAAGAATTCGATAAAATGGGACGGGCC Open table in a new tab With the sequences of post-SELEX RNA available (Table I), we proceeded to examine whether they shared any sequence homology. Fig. 7shows that, on the basis of sequence alignment, the consensus sequence of post-SELEX RNA can be defined as either CCUAACCACGCGCCU (sequence I) or CUAAAUGUCACAC (sequence II). If gap formation is allowed, the consensus sequence can also be defined as sequence I + II (CCUAACCACGCGCCUnnCUAAAUGUCACAC). To determine which one is important for eIF-5A binding, we have generated four additional 98-nt RNA sequences (Table II, probes 2–5) containing either sequence I or sequence II and compared their binding affinity to eIF-5A with that of post-SELEX RNA. Table II shows that RNAs containing sequence II (probes 4 and 5) retained high binding affinity with eIF-5A, whereas RNAs containing sequence I (probes 2 and 3) exhibited reduced binding affinity with eIF-5A, indicating that sequence II is required for high affinity eIF-5A binding. Because the two RNAs containing sequence II at different positions exhibited similar binding affinity to eIF-5A (Table II, probe 4 versus probe 5), the position of sequence II within the 98-nt RNA sequence may not be crucial for eIF-5A binding. We also generated a 40-nt RNA with the sequence identical to that of the variable region (N40) of the clone 6 post-SELEX RNA. We found that the binding affinity of eIF-5A with the 40-nt RNA was only ∼110 of that obtained with the 98-nt post-SELEX RNA (data not shown), suggesting that the flanking regions are likely to contribute to the overall stabilization of the eIF-5A-RNA complex.Table IIBinding affinity of RNAs with consensus sequences I, II, and I + II with eIF-5AProbeThe N40 sequences of the RNA probes 2-aAll the RNA probes werein vitro-transcribed and labeled as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All the RNA probes have the identical 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences.

Open table in a new tab 2-b The relative binding affinity is defined as the maximal binding relative to that of the post-SELEX RNA (clone 6). Next we searched for a possible occurrence of sequences I and II in the GenBank or EST data base by BLAST analysis. We found that the 11-nt sequence I (AACCACGCGCCU) is present in 53 EST sequences, and the 11-nt sequence II (AAAUGUCACAC) is present in 474 sequences. However, no match could be found for the 30-nt sequence I + II in either the GenBank or EST data base. Although the sequence II motif appears to be important in the sequence-specific binding of eIF-5A, it remains to be investigated whether the EST sequences that contain sequence II could serve as the physiological targets of eIF-5A in vivo. Along this line, we are currently using the specific nucleic acids associated with proteins method (31Triffillis P. Day N. Kiledjian M. RNA. 1999; 5: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to identify the physiological ligands of eIF-5A. Most CSD-containing proteins are capable of binding to ssDNA (32Jiang W.N. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether eIF-5A could also interact with ssDNA. Both sense and antisense single-stranded DNA were generated from random and post-SELEX RNA clones for gel mobility shift assay. Fig. 8shows that eIF-5A could bind to the sense ssDNA derived from post-SELEX RNA (Fig. 8, lane 7), similar to CspA (Fig. 8, lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1). However, when eIF-5A was used at a lower concentration, the mobility of ssDNA was only partially retarded and appeared as a diffused band (Fig. 8,lane 6, band a). We suspected that the band was attributable to the interaction of CSD with ssDNA, because: (i) a similar diffused band was apparent when the eIF-5A precursor was used in the binding assay (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and 5, band a); and (ii) the C-terminal half of eIF-5A (eIF-5A 84–154) could partially retard the ssDNA (Fig. 8, lane 8). The antisense ssDNA from either random or post-SELEX RNA or the sense ssDNA derived from pre-SELEX RNA did not bind to eIF-5A under the same binding conditions (data not shown). These data suggest that the eIF-5A-ssDNA binding was sequence-specific. Because eIF-5A shares a certain structural similarity with CspA (22Peat T.S. Newman J. Waldo G.S. Berendzen J. Terwilliger T.C.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 1207-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Yokota H. Kim R. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10419-10424Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that they may share some functional similarity. CspA has been proposed to function as an RNA chaperon because it facilitates the ribonuclease-catalyzed degradation of 5′-untranslated region (UTR) CspA RNA (32Jiang W.N. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to test whether eIF-5A shows a similar effect in the same assay system. A direct comparison of the effect of eIF-5A with that of CspA on the 5′-UTR degradation seems warranted, because both proteins appeared to bind to the 5′-UTR equally well under the experimental conditions (Fig.9, lanes 2 and 5 versus lane 1). Whereas the binding of CspA to the 5′-UTR could facilitate the degradation of the RNA (Fig. 9,lane 4 versus lane 3), as previously reported (32Jiang W.N. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), the binding of eIF-5A to the 5′-UTR did not alter the sensitivity of the RNA to RNase T1 (Fig. 9, lanes 9–11 versus lanes 6–8). We then performed a similar ribonuclease assay using the post-SELEX RNA as the target RNA. Fig.10 shows that the ribonuclease digestion patterns of post-SELEX RNA with either RNase A or RNase T1 were almost identical whether measured in the absence or in the presence of eIF-5A (Fig. 10, lanes 7–10 versus lanes 3–6 and lanes 15–18 versus lanes 11–14). These results suggest that eIF-5A may not functionally resemble CspA, at least under the present assay system.Figure 10Effect of eIF-5A binding on the degradation of RNA catalyzed by RNase T1 or RNase A. Ribonuclease assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cloned post-SELEX RNA (clone 3) was radiolabeled with [α-32P]UTP and used as the substrate. The reaction mixture (final volume of 15 μl) was incubated for 10 min at 15 °C. The amount of ribonuclease is shown in μg. The eIF-5A protein, 6xHis-18K-hyp, was added at the amount of 3 μg/assay before the addition of RNase T1 or RNase A. Lane 1, clone 3 RNA alone;lane 2, RNA plus 6xHis-18K-hyp; lanes 3–6, 0.063, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 μg of RNase T1, respectively, added to the reaction mixture; lanes 7–10, same as lanes 3–6, except that 6xHis-18K-hyp (3 μg) was first mixed with RNA;lanes 11–14, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 μg of RNase A, respectively, added to the reaction mixture; lanes 15–18, same as lanes 11–14, respectively, except that 6xHis-18K-hyp (3 μg/assay) was first mixed with RNA. Immediately after the reaction, the reaction mixture was applied to a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was carried out at 150 V at 4 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) eIF-5A is the only cellular protein known to contain hypusine (1Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Biofactors. 1993; 4: 95-104PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 3Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although eIF-5A has been shown to be essential for growth and proliferation, its precise physiological function is still unclear. On the basis of the finding that eIF-5A can bind to RRE and U6 RNA, we have proposed that eIF-5A may function as an RNA-binding protein (25Liu Y.P. Nemeroff M. Yan Y.P. Chen K.Y. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used SELEX, an in vitroselection method, to enrich and identify RNAs that may specifically bind to eIF-5A. The enriched RNAs, termed post-SELEX RNAs, shared a high sequence homology (Table I and Fig. 7) and showed enhanced binding affinity with eIF-5A (Fig. 6). The binding specificity between eIF-5A and post-SELEX RNA was quite high, as indicated by the observation that the binding occurred even in the presence of 20 μm tRNA (Figs. 3 and 4). The finding that eIF-5A can bind to RNA in a sequence-specific manner suggests that eIF-5A may indeed function as an RNA-binding protein. More importantly, the binding of eIF-5A to the selected RNA requires the presence of a hypusine residue (Fig. 5), suggesting that hypusine has a role in the eIF-5A-RNA interaction and that the hypusine-dependent RNA binding might be biologically relevant. The notion that eIF-5A may selectively affect the expression and/or degradation of a small group of certain mRNAs (18Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3934-3940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zu D. Jacobson A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2914-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) is consistent with possibility that some of the EST sequences that contain sequence II may serve as the physiological ligands of eIF-5A. X-ray structures of archaebacterial eIF-5A reveal the presence of hypusine at the N-terminal domain and CSD in the C-terminal domain (22Peat T.S. Newman J. Waldo G.S. Berendzen J. Terwilliger T.C.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 1207-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,23Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Yokota H. Kim R. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10419-10424Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although both the hypusine site and CSD have the potential to interact with RNA, the finding that eIF-5A, but not the eIF-5A precursor, binds to post-SELEX RNA suggests that the hypusine site may be more critical than CSD in the sequence-specific eIF-5A-RNA interaction. In this regard, it may not be surprising that eIF-5A behaves differently from CspA, the namesake of CSD, in the ribonuclease protection assay (Figs. 8 and 9). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that eIF-5A may still function as an RNA chaperon with certain other target RNAs. RNA-binding proteins such as Rev and NS1 are bimodular in that they have a nucleic acid binding domain containing a basic amino acid cluster at the N terminus and a leucine-rich domain at the C terminus used for protein interaction (33Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Motif analysis shows the presence a stretch of basic amino acids clustered at the hypusine site and a leucine-rich stretch at the C-terminal domain in eIF-5A (25Liu Y.P. Nemeroff M. Yan Y.P. Chen K.Y. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, instead of binding only with RNA, eIF-5A may use its bimodular structure to interact with both RNA and protein. Indeed, eIF-5A has been shown to interact with deoxyhypusine synthase (35Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Wolff E.C. Dimitriadis E.K. Park M.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), transglutaminase II (36Singh U.S. Li Q. Cerione R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4362-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether any of these proteins is truly the physological substrate of eIF-5A. Nevertheless, these studies and the finding that eIF-5A can bind to RNA in a sequence-specific manner support the notion that eIF-5A is a bimodular RNA-binding protein. RNA-binding proteins have diverse functions related to RNA processing, turnover, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and transcription and translation (33Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 34Cusack S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the precise functions of eIF-5Ain vivo have been difficult to define, the possibility that eIF-5A may function as an RNA-binding protein provides useful clues on the physiological functions of eIF-5A in living cells.

How exactly methylation causes transcriptional silencing is not known but is relevant if current attempts to reactivate the gene are to be successful. Understanding the effect of methylation requires a better understanding of the factors responsible for FMR1 gene expression. To this end we have identified five evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites in this promoter and shown that four of them are important for transcriptional activity in neuronally derived cells. We have also shown that USF1, USF2, and α−Pal/Nrf-1 are the major transcription factors that bind the promoter in brain and testis extracts and suggest that elevated levels of these factors account in part for elevated FMR1 expression in these organs. We also show that methylation abolishes α−Pal/Nrf-1 binding to the promoter and affects binding of USF1 and USF2 to a lesser degree. Methylation may therefore inhibit FMR1 transcription not only by recruiting histone deacetylases but also by blocking transcription factor binding. This suggests that for efficient reactivation of the FMR1 promoter, significant demethylation must occur and that current approaches to gene reactivation using histone deacetylase inhibitors alone may therefore have limited effect.

This results in hypermethylation of the promoter and transcriptional silencing (3Pieretti M. Zhang F.P. Fu Y.H. Warren S.T. Oostra B.A. Caskey C.T. Nelson D.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 817-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). The major symptoms of fragile X syndrome, mental retardation and macroorchidism, are consistent with the observation that high levels of FMR1 expression occurs in specific cells in brain and testis (4Hinds H.L.

The GC-rich human FMR1 promoter lacks a typical TATA-box and contains several potential Sp1 binding sites as well as an E-box and putative binding sites for the transcription factors α-Pal/Nrf-1,1 AP2, AGP/EBP, and Zeste (5Drouin R. Angers M. Dallaire N. Rose T.M. Khandjian W. Rousseau F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Four regions of protein binding in the unmethylated promoter of the FMR1 gene have been described by in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting analysis in human fibroblasts, peripheral lymphocytes, and lymphoblastoid cell lines (5Drouin R. Angers M. Dallaire N. Rose T.M. Khandjian W. Rousseau F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,6Schwemmle S. de Graaff E. Deissler H. Glaser D. Wohrle D.

These footprints correspond to the α-Pal/Nrf-1 site, 2 GC-boxes, and the E-box. However, the transcription factors that interact with these sites have not yet been identified. Moreover, whereas these footprints do reflect in vivo interactions, their relevance to the regulation of FMR1 transcription in brain and testis, the two major affected organs, is unknown. Because FMR1 knockout mice demonstrate learning deficits and macroorchidism similar to those seen in fragile X patients (7The Dutch-Belgian Fragile X Consortium Cell. 1994; 78: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar), and mice show patterns of temporal and tissue-specific FMR1 expression similar to humans (8Bachner D. Manca A. Steinbach P. Wohrle D. Just W. Vogel W. Hameister H. Poustka A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 2043-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), many of the control elements important for FMR1 gene regulation are also likely to be evolutionarily conserved. To identify conserved promoter elements, we compared the sequence of the human FMR1 promoter with that from two other primates: Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee) and Macaca arctoides(stump-tailed macaque) as well as two more evolutionarily distant species: Mus domesticus (mouse) and Canis familiaris (dog). We also examined the activity of promoter mutations in transient expression assays using a neuronally derived cell line, PC12, and identified the major transcription factors that bind the FMR1 promoter in nuclear extracts of brain and testis. We also demonstrate that binding of one of these factors is abolished by methylation, and binding of the other two factors is also affected. This may have implications for therapeutic strategies aimed at reactivating the gene, since it indicates that methylation of the FMR1 promoter in Fragile X patients does not simply inhibit transcription via the formation of transcriptionally inactive chromatin, as suggested from in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting in lymphoblasts (6Schwemmle S. de Graaff E. Deissler H. Glaser D. Wohrle D. Kennerknecht I. Just W. Oostra B.A. Dorfler W. Vogel W. Steinbach P. Am. J. Hum.

Zhang F. Warren S.T. Reines D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A 129/SVJ mouse (M. domesticus) BAC library was screened by polymerase chain reaction using two primers from exon 1 of the mouse FMR1 gene (Genome Systems, St. Louis. MI). The resultant clone was subcloned and mapped using standard procedures. Exon 1 of the mouse FMR1 gene was localized to a 3.1-kilobase Eco RI fragment that was subcloned into pZero (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This clone designated pEco3.3 was then sequenced using standard procedures. Sequence comparison was done using the GCG package (Wisconsin Package Version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI). The mouse sequence was scanned against the GenBankTM data base. The only significant matches were to the human FMR1 5′ end (including GenBankTM/EBI locus HUMFMR1S). The sequence was submitted to GenBankTM/EBI (Accession Number:AF251347). Polymerase chain reaction amplification of FMR1 promoter from the genomic DNA of chimpanzee (P. troglodytes), macaque (M. arctoides), and dog (C. familiaris) was carried out using the ExpandTM HiFidelity polymerase chain reaction system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the primers Fraxa f (5′-dAGCCCCGCACTTCCACCACCAGCTCCTCCA-3′ from exon 1 and FMRUP2 (5′-dGCNTTCCCGCCNTNCACCAAG-3′) homologous to the 5′ end of the promoter that is conserved in mice and humans. The polymerase chain reaction product was directly sequenced using the Thermosequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemicals Corp.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The sequences obtained were aligned initially using Macvector™ version 5.0.2 (Oxford Molecular Group, Inc., Campbell, CA), followed by visual inspection. The transcription factor binding sites in the human sequence were analyzed using TESS (Transcription Element Search Software, available on the World Wide Web 2Schug, J. and Overton, G. C. (1997) Technical Report CBIL-TR-1997-1001-v0.0 , Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.). The sequences were submitted to GenBankTM (accession numbersAF251349, AF251350, and AF251348 for chimpanzee, macaque, and dog, respectively). A single base insertion was introduced into the middle of the E-box site in p32.9 (10Lavedan C. Grabczyk E. Usdin K. Nussbaum R.L. Genomics. 1998; 50: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using the QuickChange Mutagenesis™ protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the primer pair 5′-GAACAGCGTTGATCACTGTGACGTGGTTTCAGTGTTTAC-3′ and 5′-dGTAAACACTGAAACCACGTCACAGTGATCAACGCTGTTC-3′. The introduction of the single base change to the resultant plasmid (pUSFmut) was confirmed by sequencing. A 909-bp fragment from the original FMR1 promoter in p32.9 and a 910-bp fragment from the mutated promoter from pUSFmut containing 869 and 870 bases from the human FMR1 promoter, respectively, were cloned intoKpn I-Nhe I-digested plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI), which contains the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase reporter gene to make pGL-FMR and pGL-USFmut. The 909-bp wild-type FMR1 promoter was also cloned intoHin dIII-Spe I digested plasmid pRL-null (Promega), which contains the sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) luciferase-coding sequence, to make the control plasmid pRL-FMR. Deletions in the promoter were created either by Exonuclease III and S1 nuclease treatment or by digestion with a combination of restriction enzymes followed by T4 DNA polymerase. Specifically plasmids pΔ−88/+244, pΔ+55/+244, and pΔ−447/+244 were generated by digesting pGL-FMR with Bgl II and filling in the recessed 3′ ends with α−phosphothioate deoxyribonucleotides followed by digestion with Nhe I, Exonuclease III, and S1 nuclease according to standard procedures. Plasmids pΔ−131/−123 were made by digesting pGL-FMR with Bss HII followed by ligation. pΔ−131/−123/USFmut was generated from pGL-USFmut in the same way. Plasmids pΔ−149/−116 and pΔ−151/−81 were generated bySph I digestion followed by T4 DNA polymerase treatment and ligation. Plasmid pΔ−85/−9 was obtained by digestion of pGL-FMR with Pml I and treatment with Exonuclease III and S1 nuclease. A 6-base pair deletion was made in the Initiator (Inr)-like element in the FMR1 promoter using the QuickChange Mutagenesis™ protocol and the primer pair 5′-dGGCCGGGGGTTCGGCCAGGCGCTCAGCTCC-3′ and 5′-dGGAGCTGAGCGCCTGGCCGAACCCCCGGCC-3′. This resulted in plasmid pΔ+5/+10. The deletion was confirmed by sequencing. Similarly, a four-base pair change was made in the two GC-boxes by QuickChange Mutagenesis™ protocol, and the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Specifically, Sp1 site was mutated using primers 5′-dCACTTGAAGAGAGAGGATCTGGCCGAGGGGCTGAGC-3′ and 5′-dGCTCAGCCCCTCGGCCAGATCCTCTCTCTTCAAGTG-3′ to get plasmid pS1mut, and the Sp1-like site was mutated using primers 5′-dGCTGAGCCCGCGGGGGATCTGAACAGCGTTGATCAC-3′ and 5′-dGTGATCAACGCTGTTCAGATCCCCCGCGGGCTCAGC-3′ to get plasmid pS2mut. The plasmids pS1mut and pS2mut were digested with Bss HII and ligated to get pΔ−131/−123/S1mut and pΔ−131/−123/S2mut, respectively. Specific methylation of the E-box and α−Pal/NRF-1 sites were achieved by in vivo methylation with Pml I and Bss HII, methylases, respectively. This was accomplished using pLG339 as the vector for the methylase genes. pLG339 containing the BssHIIM gene (pLG339/BssHIIM) was a gift of New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. A similar clone was constructed for the Pml I methylase by subcloning the 3.5-kilobase Eco RI-Sal I fragment from pEco72m (a gift of MBI Fermentas Inc.) into pLG339 to generate pLG339/PmlIM. pGL-FMR was cotransformed into Escherichia coli along with either pLG339/BssHIIM or pLG339/PmlIM. Methylation in all cases was confirmed by digestion with Pml I orBss HII. Since the plasmids obtained by in vivo methylation are contaminated with the low copy number pLG339 derivative, an unmethylated control was prepared by cotransforming pGL-FMR with pLG339. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies Inc.), 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Sigma), and 1× penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to ∼70% confluence. Culture medium was replaced 18–24 h before the transfection. Ten micrograms of test plasmid DNA together with 10 μg of the control plasmid pRL-FMR were introduced into ∼107cells by electroporation (300 V, 1180 capacitance; Cell-porater, Life Technologies). Transfected cells were plated in duplicate on 6-well plates. After 16 h, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were collected 42–44 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter assay system (Promega) and a MicroLumat LB 96 P luminometer (Berthold Systems, Inc. Aliquippa, PA). At least three independent transfections were performed for each plasmid. The mean of the luciferase activities was plotted after adjusting for the activity of pRL-FMR.

Briefly, the tissues and lymphoblastoid cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in two volumes of ice-cold buffer A (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 7 μg/ml calpain inhibitor II) containing 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Complete™ mini, EDTA-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) per 10 ml of buffer A. The cells were lysed by 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and the tissues were homogenized using a VIRTIS 45 homogenizer (Virtis company Inc., Gardiner, NY). The lysed cells and tissues were then centrifuged at 3500 × g for 15 min to pellet the nuclei. The pellet was spun again at 25,000 ×g for 20 min to remove the residual cytosolic material. The nuclei were resuspended in 3 ml of buffer C/109 cells (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 7 μg/ml calpain inhibitor II, and the same protease inhibitor mixture tablet used previously) and stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. The nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against 50 volumes of buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C overnight using a Slide-A-Lyzer® cassette (Pierce). The dialysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was quick-frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Nuclear extracts from PC12 cell lines were purchased from Promega. A 200-bp mouse FMR1 promoter fragment was amplified with primers mba1 (5′-dCTTTAAGCTTTCCCGCCTTTCACCAAG-3′] and mba2 5′-dGCCAAAAGCTTCGCTGCGCCTCCTGTAAA-3′] from pEco3.3. The 202-bp human FMR1 promoter (−214 to −13) was amplified from plasmid p32.9 with primers hmba1 5′-dCTTTCAAGCTTCCCGCCCTCCACCAAG-3′) and hmba2 (5′-dGAACCCAAGCTTCGCTGCGGGTGTAAACA-3′). The amplified fragments were gel-purified and cloned into the Hin dIII site of pBS (SK+). For EMSA and DNase I footprinting experiments, a gel-purifiedSal I/Not I fragment containing the promoter was end-labeled at the Not I site using [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow DNA polymerase (Life Technologies). The labeled probe was extracted with phenol/chloroform and purified by passing through a Sephadex G-50 column. The promoter was methylated using Sss I methylase (New England BioLabs). Methylation was verified by digestion with the methylation-sensitive enzymes Pml I, Eag I, andHha I (New England BioLabs). Binding was carried out at 30 °C or 4 °C in 30 μl of reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mmNaCl, 0.25 ng of probe, 5 μg of protein, and 1 μg of poly[dA-dT][dA-dT] for 30 min. A 1000-fold excess of nonspecific DNA and transcription factor binding oligodeoxyribonucleotides were included in the reactions as nonspecific or specific competitors. For antibody supershift assays, 4 μg of antibody or BSA was incubated with the protein before the addition of the probe, and reactions were carried out for 40 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 2× gel loading buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 10.5% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue). Reactions were subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (60:1, acrylamide:bis) containing 1.6% glycerol in 1× Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mmglycine, 2.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. For DNase I footprinting, aPst I/EcoNI fragment of p32.9 was end-labeled atEco N I site by [α-32P]dGTP and Klenow DNA polymerase (Life Technologies). Binding reactions were carried out with 1 ng of 3′ end-labeled probe and 20 μg of protein in a 100-μl reaction volume containing poly[dA-dT][dA-dT]. The reactions were treated with 0.25 units of DNase I in the presence of 10 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 for 10 min at 30 °C. The reactions were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated with tRNA as carrier. The sample was dissolved in 100 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm Na2EDTA) and butanol-precipitated. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 10 μl of formamide stop buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF). A 2-μl sample was electrophoresed on a 6% sequencing gel at 1600 V until the bromphenol blue dye reached the bottom of the gel. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. The nuclear extracts were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and electro-blotted to the NitroPure membrane (MSI, Westboro, MA) using standard procedures. Hybridization with primary antibody was carried out as specified by the supplier. Hybridization with the secondary antibody and signal detection were done using ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as per the manufacturer's recommendation. A 466-bp fragment including 272 bp of sequence upstream of the transcription start site of the human FMR1 gene has previously been shown to contain all the elements necessary for the appropriate tissue-specific expression of the FMR1 gene in transgenic mice (12Hergersberg M. Matsuo K. Gassmann M. Schaffner W. Luscher B. Rulicke T. Aguzzi A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To define the minimal promoter region more closely and to identify those transcription factor binding sites that are evolutionarily conserved and that may therefore be important for regulation of this gene, we compared the sequences of the 5′ end of the FMR1 gene that we obtained from a number of different mammals. Fig. 1 shows a dot matrix comparison of the exon 1-containing portion of the mouse fmr1 gene with the corresponding region of the human FMR1 sequence (GenBankTM/EBI locus: HUMFMR1S). The homology between the two sequences is highest in the first exon, but islands of homology both 3′ and 5′ of exon 1 are also seen. The 5′ regions fall within the 272-bp previously defined minimal promoter fragment (12Hergersberg M. Matsuo K. Gassmann M. Schaffner W. Luscher B. Rulicke T. Aguzzi A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the upstream border of which is marked by the black arrow in Fig. 1. No transcription factor binding sites were conserved between mouse and human 5′ of the α−Pal/Nrf-1 site, 131 bases 5′ of the start of transcription. This suggests that the minimal FMR1 promoter may only be 131 bp long. The conserved 3′ regions may represent regulatory elements in the first intron, but they have not been studied in any detail to date. We used a primer derived from the conserved 5′ boundary of the promoter and a primer from exon 1 to amplify the FMR1 5′ region from chimpanzee, Stump-tailed macaque, and dog. The sequences were then aligned with the human and mouse promoter sequences to identify those regions that are conserved in all five species (Fig. 2). The four described previously in vivo protein binding sites, α−Pal/Nrf-1, the 2 Sp1 or GC boxes, and the E-box (sometimes referred to as the c-Myc binding site) (5Drouin R. Angers M. Dallaire N. Rose T.M. Khandjian W. Rousseau F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Schwemmle S. de Graaff E. Deissler H. Glaser D. Wohrle D. Kennerknecht I. Just W. Oostra B.A. Dorfler W. Vogel W. Steinbach P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 1354-1362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) are conserved in all five species (shown in the dark gray boxes in Fig. 2). None of these sequences had a good TATA-box. However, they all contained a conserved motif close to the reported start of transcription (13Hwu W.L. Wang T.R. Lee Y.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that resembles an Initiator (Inr) element. Such elements direct transcription initiation in certain TATA-less promoters (14Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). The region containing the dimethyl sulfate hyperreactive G residue close to the reported transcriptional start site (5Drouin R. Angers M. Dallaire N. Rose T.M. Khandjian W. Rousseau F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) is also well conserved (the complementary C is marked by an asterisk in Fig. 2). This region does not show a protein binding footprint in vivo, at least in cells with low FMR1 activity (5Drouin R. Angers M. Dallaire N. Rose T.M. Khandjian W. Rousseau F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This hyperreactivity is absent in individuals with fragile X syndrome and is therefore thought to reflect some DNA structure that is associated with transcription (5Drouin R. Angers M. Dallaire N. Rose T.M. Khandjian W. Rousseau F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The transcription factors Zeste (5Drouin R. Angers M. Dallaire N. Rose T.M. Khandjian W. Rousseau F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), AP2 (15Carrillo C. Cisneros B. Montanez C. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 276: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and CREB (13Hwu W.L. Wang T.R. Lee Y.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have all been suggested to be important for FMR1 regulation. However the binding sites for these factors were not conserved (shown in the open boxes Fig. 2). Mutated versions of the human FMR1 promoter were assayed in PC12 cells, a neuronally derived cell line. Fig. 3shows that single base insertion in the E-box (pGL-USFmut) or the deletion of 9 bases from the α−Pal/Nrf-1 site (pΔ−131/−123) each reduced the expression of the reporter gene about 5-fold. Both mutations together (pΔ−131/−123/USFmut) reduced activity almost to that of a construct containing a deletion of almost all of the FMR1 sequence (pΔ−447/+244). Therefore the upstream boundary of the minimal promoter region is probably close to the 5′ end of the α−Pal/Nrf-1 site, as suggested by the phylogenetic footprinting. A deletion that included the α−Pal/Nrf-1 site and one of the GC-boxes (pΔ−151/−81) led to an increase in activity over that seen with the nine-base deletion in the α−Pal/Nrf-1 site alone (pΔ−131/−123). Similarly, a deletion that removes both the E-box sequence and its adjacent Sp1 site (pΔ−85/−9) produced a higher activity than the mutant with the single base insertion in the E-box. The activity of this construct was in fact higher than the full-length promoter (pGL-FMR). However, when a 4-base substitution mutation was made in either of the two GC boxes, the activity was reduced to 75 and 50%, respectively (pS1mut and pS2mut). This suggests that these two regions have a positive role in the control of gene expression. The increase in activity seen for deletion constructs pΔ−151/−81 and pΔ−85/−9 that lack these sites could be due to decreased distance between the α−Pal/Nrf-1 site and the transcription initiation site or to the deletion of additional sequences that contain negative regulators of FMR1 activity. Constructs containing both the α−Pal/Nrf-1 deletion and the point mutation in the first GC box (pΔ−131/−123/S1mut) had an activity similar to the α−Pal/Nrf-1 deletion alone, suggesting that there might be some interaction between factors that bind these two sites. However, a −131/−123:S2mut double mutant showed a slightly higher activity than the −131/−123 deletion by itself. Why this should be is not clear at this time but may be related to the uncovering of secondary transcription factor binding sites that can now be used. The pΔ−85/−9 construct lacks the TATA-like sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site. Since deletion of this sequence did not negatively affect promoter activity, it is possible that the TATA-like sequence is dispensable. However, although the initiator-like element is evolutionarily conserved, its deletion had no effect on the promoter activity in PC12 cells (construct pΔ+5/+10 in Fig. 3). Since the region that includes the putative transcriptional start site is not conserved, it may be that transcription initiation in the FMR1 promoter occurs via a novel mechanism that involves as yet undefined signals. Deletion of the region that included the CGG repeats in the 1st exon (pΔ+53/+244) produced a small increase in reporter gene activity. Since this sequence is located within the transcript, it is possible that this effect is mediated either at the level of transcription, mRNA stability, or translation. A negative effect of CGG repeats on translation has been suggested based on the observation that the levels of FMRP, the protein product of the FMR1 gene, are reduced in individuals with long premutation alleles (16Feng Y. Zhang F. Lokey L.K. Chastain J.L. Lakkis L. Eberhart D. Warren S.T. Science. 1995; 268: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, this effect is probably only significant at high repeat numbers. A 20-kDa protein has been shown to bind to CGG repeats and inhibit FMR1 transcription (17Muller-Hartmann H. Deissler H. Naumann F. Schmitz B. Schroer J. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6447-6452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Deletion of the CGG repeat tract may simply eliminate the effect of these or similar proteins. The 200-bp region of both the mouse and human FMR1 promoters, which contains all the evolutionarily conserved putative transcription factor binding sites (shown in bold in Fig. 2) was used as a probe for binding factors in nuclear extracts from mouse brain, testis, and liver"

Since the initial isolation of cDNAs encoding rat ORs (1Buck L. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3753) Google Scholar), ORs have been cloned from several taxonomic groups including mouse, dog, human, fish, chicken (reviewed in Ref. 2Mombaerts P.

The GPCR superfamily also includes other chemoreceptors, two divergent types of mammalian vomeronasal receptors and taste receptors in rodents andDrosophila (6Dulac C. Axel R.

Science. 2000; 287: 1830-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Given the large evolutionary distance between these organisms, the varied environments they inhabit, and the evidence that hundreds of OR genes exist in a single species, it is not surprising that chemosensory receptors are diverse sequences that appear to have little in common besides general topology (2Mombaerts P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The capacity to traffic ORs to the plasma membrane efficiently appears to be specific to mature ORNs. ORs do not traffic well to the plasma membrane when expressed in common cultured cell lines, in neuron-like cell lines, and even cell lines derived from the olfactory epithelium (11McClintock T.S. Landers T.M. Gimelbrant A.A. Fuller L.Z. Jackson B.A. Jayawickreme C.K. Lerner M.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 48: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Gimelbrant A.A. Stoss T.D. Landers T.M. McClintock T.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the presumption that plasma membrane insertion is necessary for OR function and explains why ORs are difficult to functionally express in heterologous systems. Evidence that mature ORNs traffic ORs to the plasma membrane comes from immunocytochemical detection of ORs in olfactory cilia (13Menco B.P.M. Cunningham A.M. Qasba P. Levy N. Reed R.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 26: 297-312Google Scholar), which appear to lack internal membranes, and from the successful functional expression of an OR in ORNs in vivo (14Zhao H. Ivic L. Otaki J.M. Hashimoto M. Mikoshiba K. Firestein S. Science. 1998; 279: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In all other cells, we find that ORs are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffic poorly, if at all, to the Golgi apparatus (12Gimelbrant A.A. Stoss T.D. Landers T.M. McClintock T.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This appears to be the typical behavior of an OR in a heterologous expression system, although exceptions are known among nonmammalian ORs (15Zhang Y. Chou J.H. Bradley J. Bargmann C.I. Zinn K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12162-12167Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Speca D.J. Lin D.M. Sorensen P.W. Isacoff E.Y. Ngai J. Dittman A.H.

In addition, plasma membrane trafficking of ORs in heterologous cells can be improved by extending the N terminus of ORs (18Wellerdieck C. Oles M. Pott L. Korsching S. Gisselmann G. Hatt H. Chem. Senses. 1997; 22: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Krautwurst D. Yau K.-W. Reed R.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). These discoveries serve to underscore our ignorance about the mechanisms regulating trafficking of ORs. Only in Caenorhabditis elegans is the identity of a protein that regulates OR trafficking known. The odr-4 gene, which is expressed specifically in chemosensory neurons, is necessary for trafficking of some ORs to sensory neuron cilia (20Dwyer N.D. Troemel E.R. Sengupta P. Bargmann C.I. Cell. 1998; 93: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). No mammalian homolog of the ODR-4 protein has yet been identified. However, the number of accessory proteins that regulate the trafficking of other types of mammalian GPCRs continues to grow (21Karnik S.S. Khorana H.G. J. Biol.

Access to a cell line that mimics the ability of ORNs to traffic ORs would aid the study of OR trafficking. The recently developedodora cells (30Murrell J.R. Hunter D.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8260-8270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may provide such a model cell line. Differentiated odora cells express neuronal and olfactory markers, including components of the olfactory transduction pathway, and traffic exogenous olfactory receptors to their surface. We found that differentiation is necessary for plasma membrane expression of ORs in odora cells. In undifferentiated odora cells, ORs were not released to the surface but were present in the Golgi apparatus and endosomes. This suggests a two-step model for the regulation of OR trafficking. We also found that differentiatedodora cells were able to traffic VN1-type vomeronasal receptors to their plasma membrane and that coexpression of ODR-4 with rat OR U131 facilitated trafficking of U131 to the plasma membrane. These findings are evidence that mechanisms regulating OR trafficking involve conserved functions.

For transfection, undifferentiated cells were plated in 8-well Lab-Tek Permanox chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, catalog number 177445) at a density of 18,750 cells per well, incubated at 33 °C and 7% CO2 (undifferentiated conditions) and transfected the next day with FuGENE-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For differentiation,odora cells were plated in 8-well chamber slides at a density of 6,250 per well, and the next day they were moved into differentiation conditions (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μg/ml insulin, 20 μm dopamine, and 100 μm ascorbate at 39 °C and 7% CO2). After 5 days, differentiated cells were transfected using TransFast (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. In both cases, the cells were analyzed 3 days after transfection.

For transfection, CHO cells were plated on 8-well chamber slides at a density of 12,500 cells per well, transfected using FuGENE-6 reagent 24 h after plating, and subjected to analysis 3 days after transfection. Several of the constructs used were described previously (11McClintock T.S. Landers T.M. Gimelbrant A.A. Fuller L.Z. Jackson B.A. Jayawickreme C.K. Lerner M.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 48: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); the OR constructs were OR5-GFP, U131-GFP, HA-OR5, and HA-U131, and the human β2-adrenergic receptor constructs were β2-adrenergic receptor-GFP and HA-β2-adrenergic receptor. Epitope-tagged receptors contain the hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA-1) at their N termini; the GFP constructs have receptors fused at their C termini to hGFP-S65T (obtained from CLONTECH; see Ref. 31Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene. 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). To generate PCR products for subcloning, we used high-fidelity polymerases Pfu Turbo (Stratagene) or Platinum Pfx (Life Technologies, Inc.). To generate HA-1-tagged versions of chemosensory receptors, we first made a fusion plasmid, pcDNA3.HA. Using HA-β2-adrenergic receptor as a PCR template (11McClintock T.S. Landers T.M. Gimelbrant A.A. Fuller L.Z. Jackson B.A. Jayawickreme C.K. Lerner M.R. Brain Res. Mol.

This fragment was cloned into aBamHI/XhoI digest of pcDNA3.1(+)/Hygro (Invitrogen). The resulting construct includes XhoI,XbaI, and ApaI restriction sites downstream of the HA-1 coding sequence. To fuse receptor open reading frames with the HA-1 epitope reading frame, receptors were cloned into anXhoI/XbaI digest of pcDNA3.HA. In all cases, fusion at the XhoI site resulted in Leu-Glu as a spacer between HA-1 and the receptor protein. The following primers were used (all from 5′): for VN1, forward ATACTCGAGATGATGAATAAGAACAGC, reverse CCGTCTAGATCAAGGAATATTCAAAC; for VN7, forward ATACTCGAGATGTTCTTTGAAGAG, reverse GAGTCTAGATCAAGTATTTACTATTCTG; for TR2, forward ATTTATCTCGAGCAGGCAAGGACACTC, reverse CTGCTTCTAGATTAGCTCTTCCTCATGGTG (note that this results in the deletion of the first three amino acid residues of TR2); for I7, forward ATACTCGAGATGGAGCGAAGGAAC, reverse ATTTCTAGACTAACCAATTTTGCTGCC; for dor64, forward ATAACTCGAGAAACTCAGCGAAACCC, reverse ATAATCTAGACTAAGAACCCAGGCCATC. To allow for mammalian expression, odr-4 was subcloned into a BamHI/XhoI digest of pcDNA3.1(+)/Hygro. All constructs were sequenced across the junction points to ensure that no frameshifts were introduced. Procedures described previously for other cell types (11McClintock T.S. Landers T.M.

For cell staining prior to fixation, cells were rinsed with PBS (pH 7.3), incubated with primary antibodies (16B12) diluted at 1:300 in 1% BSA in PBS (solution B), then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS and incubated in solution B and with secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse, 1:300 in solution B). All steps through fixation were performed on ice to prevent receptor internalization. For permeabilized cell staining, including dual labeling, cells were washed in PBS, fixed as above, permeabilized for 2 min with cold methanol, and blocked in solution B prior to incubation in primary antibodies (anti-GFP, 1:500; anti-KDEL mAbs, 1:350; anti-TfR mAbs, 1:500; all in solution B), followed by consecutive washes in PBS and solution B and incubation with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit, 1:350; Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse; 1:350) or rhodamine-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (1:2000 in solution B). When two primary antibodies were used, they were applied simultaneously. The following combinations of primary and secondary antibodies were used individually or in combination: for detection of the HA-1 epitope, 16B12 mouse mAbs and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse; for GFP, rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit; for the ER detection, anti-KDEL mouse mAbs and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse; for endosome detection, mouse anti-human TfR mAbs and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse. To mark the Golgi apparatus, rhodamine-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin was used. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed on a Leica TCS confocal system at the University of Kentucky Imaging Facility. The signal from two fluorophores was detected simultaneously. The numbers of pixels with signal from either or both fluorophores was determined on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet) as described previously (12Gimelbrant A.A. Stoss T.D. Landers T.M. McClintock T.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For analysis of intensity of staining, images were collected with a monochrome digital camera (Eastman Kodak Co. Megaplus 1.4) using the same optical settings and exposure time for all images in the experimental series. The number and the grayscale value of pixels in the image were integrated using NIH Image, and the resulting intensity values reflect both area of the staining and its intensity. The intensity values for each condition were compared only to conditions within the experiments performed that day. All quantitation was performed on unenhanced digital images. For presentation purposes, the monochrome images shown have been subjected to contrast enhancement after all the parts of figures were assembled so that differences in staining intensity between the images were not distorted. The first question we addressed was whether undifferentiated odora cells traffic ORs to their plasma membrane as do the differentiated cells. As a positive control for receptor expression and trafficking, we used HA-β2-adrenergic receptor or β2-adrenergic receptor-GFP. In both differentiated and undifferentiatedodora cells, HA-β2-adrenergic receptor was present on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). As previously reported (30Murrell J.R. Hunter D.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8260-8270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HA-U131 (rat) was present on the plasma membrane of differentiated odora cells, and the staining pattern was punctate. In undifferentiated odora cells, HA-U131 was not present on the surface. Two other rat ORs, HA-OR5 (not shown) and HA-I7 (see Fig. 3), behaved in the same manner as HA-U131. We conclude that whereas differentiated odora cells traffic ORs to the plasma membrane, undifferentiated odora cells do not.Figure 3Differentiated odora cells express unrelated chemosensory receptors on the plasma membrane.Differentiated odora cells were transiently transfected with receptors fused to the HA-1 epitope at their N termini. Transfected cells were immunostained prior to fixation so that positive staining would identify only the HA-1 epitope that was expressed on the plasma membrane. The surface staining was apparent in cells transfected with HA-I7, HA-VN1, and HA-VN7 but not in cells transfected with HA-DOR64 or HA-TR2. To demonstrate the difference in appearance between surface staining and intracellular staining, differentiated odoracells were transiently transfected with a β2-adrenergic receptor that was tagged with the HA-1 epitope at the N terminus and GFP at the C terminus (HA-β2-GFP). Two images of HA-β2-GFP in the same cell show the surface staining obtained with immunostaining prior to fixationversus the total distribution of the GFP fluorescence, much of which is from receptors in intracellular membranes. The GFP fluorescence of U131-GFP in a differentiated odora cell is shown to demonstrate the network pattern typical of the intracellular distribution of olfactory receptors.

In contrast, the β2-adrenergic receptor is expressed in the ER, the Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and on the plasma membrane (11McClintock T.S. Landers T.M. Gimelbrant A.A. Fuller L.Z.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because undifferentiated odoracells do not traffic ORs to the plasma membrane, we tested whether they also retained ORs in the ER. We used C-terminal fusions of receptors to hGFP-S65T for these colocalization studies; receptors fused to the HA-1 epitope tag or to GFP variants have the same intracellular distribution (11McClintock T.S. Landers T.M. Gimelbrant A.A. Fuller L.Z. Jackson B.A. Jayawickreme C.K. Lerner M.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 48: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Gimelbrant A.A. Stoss T.D. Landers T.M. McClintock T.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In confocal images of undifferentiated odora cells β2-adrenergic receptor-GFP was distributed as expected (Fig. 2), with 31 ± 11% (mean ± S.D.; n = 4) of pixels with GFP signal coinciding with staining for an ER marker, 56 ± 16% (n = 3) colocalized with the Golgi marker, and 19 ± 9% (n = 6) with an endosome marker. Even though it is not present on the plasma membrane, U131-GFP also colocalizes with the Golgi marker (29 ± 12% of pixels with GFP signal,n = 3) and the endosome marker (37 ± 22%;n = 5), besides being present in the ER (45 ± 29%; n = 4). The percent overlap values for the three compartments are not expected to sum to 100%, because each compartment was tested in different cells, and other compartments that we did not test (e.g. proteolytic compartments and transport vesicles) presumably contain receptors. OR trafficking in undifferentiated odora cells shows a pattern that differs from nonneuronal cells and from mature ORNs. The ORs are released from the ER and are present in the Golgi apparatus and in TfR-positive endosomes but are not detected on the plasma membrane. Our previous results (12Gimelbrant A.A. Stoss T.D. Landers T.M. McClintock T.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) suggest that exit from the ER is a regulated process that depends on structural determinants in the C-terminal part of an OR. These new data suggest a second regulatory process, occurring in a post-Golgi compartment and sensitive to the differentiation state of the ORN. We further investigated whether differentiated odora cells are capable of plasma membrane expression of other families of chemosensory receptors. We made HA-1-tagged versions of rat OR I7, rat vomeronasal receptors VN1 and VN7, Drosophila OR dor64, and rat taste receptor TR2. These groups of chemosensory receptors do not share significant sequence homology but are thought to share the general GPCR topology. As shown in Fig. 3, HA-I7, HA-VN1, and HA-VN7 were detected at the cell surface as punctate or concentrated regions of immunostaining done on living cells. The appearance of this surface staining differed greatly from the intracellular distribution of receptors in these cells. The intracellular distribution was a network that extended throughout the cell, often with high-intensity regions near the nucleus. This is shown in Fig. 3 as the GFP fluorescence of HA-β2-GFP and U131-GFP expressed in differentiated odora cells. Receptors fused at the C termini to GFP show trafficking behavior identical to the same receptors containing the N-terminal HA-1 epitope tag (12Gimelbrant A.A. Stoss T.D. Landers T.M. McClintock T.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These data argue that HA-I7, HA-VN1, and HA-VN7 were present on the plasma membrane of the differentiated odora cells. The efficiency of expression we observed (0.5–2% of the cells) was similar to that for HA-U131 and HA-OR5. As observed with HA-U131 and HA-OR5, none of these chemosensory receptors were detected on the plasma membrane of undifferentiated odora cells (not shown). We did not detect surface staining in undifferentiated (not shown) or differentiated odora cells transfected with HA-TR2 andDrosophila HA-DOR64; the intensity of nonpermeabilized staining in these cells was similar to very weak background staining occurring in control cells. We conclude that differentiatedodora cells are capable of properly trafficking to the plasma membrane at least two unrelated types of chemosensory receptors. The underlying mechanisms must therefore recognize both OR and VN1 receptor families, suggesting that these receptors have some common features. If diverse chemosensory receptors share trafficking behavior in heterologous expression systems, as our data indicate, they should also be expected to share the ability to interact with proteins that regulate their trafficking. Thus far, the only protein known to regulate trafficking of an OR is ODR-4, a unique protein expressed in chemosensory neurons of C. elegans, where it is necessary for the surface expression of chemosensory receptor ODR-10. In odr-4mutants, chemosensory receptor ODR-10 is confined to an intracellular network in the cell body of the receptor neurons (20Dwyer N.D. Troemel E.R. Sengupta P. Bargmann C.I. Cell. 1998; 93: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). When coexpressed with HA-U131 in undifferentiated odora cells, ODR-4 caused an increase in surface expression of HA-U131 in a small (0.3–0.5%) population of cells (Fig. 4 A). Similar observations were made in CHO cells (Fig. 4 C). No staining above background (nontransfected cells) was seen in the cells transfected with ODR-4 alone or HA-U131 alone (Fig. 4, A andC). Coexpression with ODR-4 did not have any effect on the surface expression of HA-OR5 (not shown). The staining intensity of the cells expressing HA-U131 on their surface varied. To estimate the effect of ODR-4 in odora cells, we acquired for each transfection condition the first 12 to 20 images of the cells that were visually perceived as being above the background in both transfected and control cells. We quantified staining in unmodified images of a standard size by digitally integrating pixel values between grayscale levels 40 and 254 using the integration function of NIH Image. Representative images from an odora cell experiment are shown in Fig. 4 A, and the intensity values are presented on Fig. 4 B. For this experiment, the mean intensity values were as follows: 1782 ± 1981 for ODR-4 coexpression with HA-U131, and 135 ± 177 for HA-U131 alone (mean ± S.D.; arbitrary units; the data represent 4 independent transfections). In another experiment we transfected, stained, and collected the intensity data for HA-U131 + ODR-4 (329 ± 320; mean ± S.D.; four independent transfections) and HA-U131 (49 ± 55), HA-OR5 + ODR-4 (81 ± 50), and HA-β2-adrenergic receptor (1396 ± 1557). To test whether coexpression with any protein was sufficient to promote surface expression of HA-U131, other proteins were coexpressed with HA-U131. We tested hAIP1 (fused to the FLAG epitope), which has no sequence similarity to ODR-4, because it was detected in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a possible binding partner of a fragment of U131. 2T. McClintock, C. Josefowicz, S. C. Bose, and A. Gimelbrant, unpublished results. Coexpression with hAIP1 did not increase plasma membrane expression of HA-U131 (Fig.4 B, inset). Coexpression with hGFP-S65T gave identical negative results. ODR-4 had a significant effect (p < 0.05, with averaged intensity values from two separate sets of four transfections each, normalized to the mean value of U131 + ODR-4 in each case) on the plasma membrane expression of U131. The action of ODR-4 did not appear to be correlated with an increased amount of receptor protein. Coexpression of U131-GFP and ODR-4 in undifferentiated odora cells was compared with cotransfection of U131-GFP plus the empty vector pJG3.6. The resulting distributions of GFP fluorescence intensity values were similar, but the peak intensity values from the cells transfected with U131-GFP plus pJG3.6 was 30% higher. Although ODR-4 worked in two cell lines, including a nonolfactory line, it is probably unsuitable for use in functional expression screening of the odorant selectivity of ORs. Its effects are relatively weak and appear to be limited to a subset of mammalian ORs. Nevertheless, our data do suggest parallels between the mechanisms of regulation of the plasma membrane expression of chemosensory receptors in C. elegans and in mammals. The ability to traffic ORs to the plasma membrane appears to be limited to ORNs. When expressed in nonolfactory cell lines, ORs are retained in the ER (12Gimelbrant A.A. Stoss T.D. Landers T.M. McClintock T.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Odora cells are an exception to these generalities, perhaps because they resemble ORNs (30Murrell J.R. Hunter D.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8260-8270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, they traffic ORs to the plasma membrane when in the differentiated state. Second, in the undifferentiated state they show a unique pattern of OR trafficking; ORs traffic into the Golgi apparatus and endosomes but not to the plasma membrane. These data predict that as progenitor cells progress through differentiation to become mature ORNs they may acquire stepwise changes in their ability to move ORs toward the plasma membrane. Our results further indicate that the mechanisms regulating OR trafficking have conserved features. First, trafficking of the VN1 type of vomeronasal receptors depends on the differentiation ofodora cells just as do ORs. Second, the ability of aC. elegans protein, ODR-4, to improve plasma membrane trafficking of a mammalian OR is similar to its ability to facilitate trafficking of a C. elegans OR. Our results support a model of OR trafficking that has two regulatory checkpoints (Fig. 5). The first checkpoint is exit from the ER. Because undifferentiatedodora cells, unlike other cell lines, can traffic ORs past the ER, the mechanism allowing ORs to cross the ER checkpoint may be expressed relatively early in the differentiation of ORNs. Because ORs are not present in the plasma membrane of undifferentiatedodora cells, but are present there after differentiation, a second checkpoint may occur at a post-Golgi compartment. We do not yet have evidence of whether ORs traffic directly to endosomes from the Golgi apparatus or arrive there by rapid internalization from the plasma membrane. The proteins that regulate these checkpoints remain obscure. The model does make predictions, however, about the nature of these regulatory proteins. It predicts that the critical proteins have positive effects, either directly on the OR by activating other proteins to promote OR trafficking or by disinhibition of processes that suppress OR trafficking. There are examples of other GPCRs whose membrane trafficking in heterologous cells improves in the presence of specific accessory proteins (23Ferreira P.A. Nakayama T.A. Pak W.L. Travis G.H Nature. 1996; 383 (. 40): 637Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 24Ferreira P.A. Nakayama T.A. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). We have now shown that at least one OR, U131, behaves similarly when coexpressed with the C. elegans protein, ODR-4. Our model predicts that mammalian ORNs express proteins with functions analogous to ODR-4. Because ODR-4 does not traffic to the cilia of sensory neurons with its receptor inC. elegans, and because ODR-4 promotes plasma membrane trafficking of U131 in a cell line where U131 is normally retained in the ER, we suspect that ODR-4 and its predicted functional homologs in vertebrates are involved in the exit of ORs from the first checkpoint at the ER. Why ORs are retained in the ER in the first place is not yet clear, but misfolding or the lack of a partner for heteromeric proteins are common causes of active ER retention of plasma membrane proteins by ER quality control mechanisms (32Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2107-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Green W.N. Millar N.S. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 280-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The second, post-Golgi checkpoint is more mysterious. It may be specific to cells of the ORN lineage, but this has not been tested directly. The proteins regulating this checkpoint may interact with ORs either at the Golgi apparatus or endosomes to target the ORs onward to the plasma membrane. It is possible that they release ORs from the proteins that promoted exit of the ORs from the first checkpoint. Alternatively, the second checkpoint may consist of proteins that encounter ORs at the plasma membrane, trapping them there and slowing OR recycling to endosomes. The latter possibility is analogous to other GPCRs whose accumulation in certain subdomains of the plasma membrane is regulated by specific accessory proteins (for review see Refs. 34Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar and 35Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). A third alternative is that processing at the ER can generate receptor proteins with differing trafficking capacities, some capable of reaching endosomes and others capable of reaching the plasma membrane. This would be consistent with the ability of ODR-4 to promote plasma membrane trafficking in both CHO cells, where ORs are retained in the ER, and in undifferentiatedodora cells, where ORs reach the Golgi apparatus and endosomes. Whatever the mechanism, the reason for such apparently complex regulation of OR trafficking is unknown. Perhaps it is related to the hypothesis that the olfactory cilium is a privileged plasma membrane domain containing a unique subset of proteins. An alternative to our model is the possibility that mature olfactory receptor neurons lack an otherwise widely expressed factor that suppresses plasma membrane trafficking of ORs. We cannot exclude this possibility, but it is not consistent with the ability of ODR-4 to act as a positive factor or with analogies to positive factors that regulate the trafficking of other GPCRs (23Ferreira P.A. Nakayama T.A. Pak W.L. Travis G.H Nature. 1996; 383 (. 40): 637Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 24Ferreira P.A. Nakayama T.A. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). A more complex mechanism, such as depicted in our model, therefore seems justified. The model is not meant to suggest that negative factors do not play significant roles in regulating OR trafficking, however. For example, ER quality control mechanisms may play a significant inhibitory role if nascent ORs are misfolded or lacking a binding partner, something that is consistent with the effects of truncation on OR trafficking (12Gimelbrant A.A. Stoss T.D. Landers T.M. McClintock T.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An interdependence of positive and negative factors would be consistent with the apparent complexity of OR trafficking. Given the paucity of conserved residues among ORs in particular, and among chemoreceptor proteins in general, wide variability in trafficking behavior in heterologous cells might be expected. Indeed, there are examples of ORs that traffic well to the plasma membrane in at least some heterologous cells (15Zhang Y. Chou J.H. Bradley J. Bargmann C.I. Zinn K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12162-12167Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Speca D.J. Lin D.M. Sorensen P.W. Isacoff E.Y. Ngai J. Dittman A.H.

Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, these are the exceptions rather than the norm. Instead, our results emphasize the conservation of the mechanisms regulating trafficking of chemoreceptor proteins. First, the trafficking behavior of the VN1 type of vomeronasal receptor mirrors that of ORs. They traffic to the plasma membrane of odora cells only when these cells are differentiated. Second, the ability of ODR-4 to increase the plasma membrane trafficking of at least one vertebrate OR suggests conservation of at least part of the mechanism regulating trafficking. The absence of sequence similarity among the receptor proteins we tested argues that the conserved functions we identified depend on protein signal features more complex than the primary structure. This is consistent with the view that a small number of accessory proteins are responsible for regulating the trafficking of the entire OR repertoire.

To identify novel components that affect the ER transcriptional response, we performed a genetic screen in yeast and identified RDI1, a Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (Rho GDI), as a positive regulator of ER transactivation. Overexpression of the human homologue of RDI1, Rho GDIα, increases ERα, ERβ, androgen receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activation in mammalian cells but not activation by the unrelated transcription factors serum response factor and Sp1. In contrast, expression of constitutively active forms of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 decrease ER transcriptional activity, suggesting that Rho GDI increases ER transactivation by antagonizing Rho function. Inhibition of RhoA by expression of either the Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase or a dominant negative RhoA resulted in enhanced ER transcriptional activation, thus phenocopying the effect of Rho GDI expression on ER transactivation. Together, these findings establish the Rho GTPases as important modulators of ER transcriptional activation. Since Rho GTPases regulate actin polymerization, our findings suggest a link between the major regulators of cellular architecture and steroid receptor transcriptional response.

Inhibition of RhoA by expression of either the Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase or a dominant negative RhoA resulted in enhanced ER transcriptional activation, thus phenocopying the effect of Rho GDI expression on ER transactivation. Together, these findings establish the Rho GTPases as important modulators of ER transcriptional activation. Since Rho GTPases regulate actin polymerization, our findings suggest a link between the major regulators of cellular architecture and steroid receptor transcriptional response. estrogen receptor α estrogen receptor β guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor wild type guanine nucleotide exchange factor GTPase-activating protein glucocorticoid receptor androgen receptor serum response factor estrogen response element 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside relative luminescence units The estrogen receptor α (ER)1 is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that transduces the estrogen signal (1Parker M.G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1998; 63: 45-50PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of ER is responsible for female sexual development and maintenance of bone density (2Warner M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Curr. Opin. Obstet. Gynecol. 1999; 11: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 3Bland R. Clin. Sci. 2000; 98: 217-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ER plays a critical role in the development and progression of breast cancer by regulating genes and signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation (4Jordan V.C. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1999; 133: 408-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Regulation of gene expression by the ER requires the coordinate activity of ligand binding, phosphorylation, and cofactor interactions, with particular combinations probably resulting in the tissue-specific responses elicited by the receptor (5Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 6Schapira M. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Abagyan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the extracellular cues and intracellular signaling pathways modulating these components and regulating ER transcriptional activation are not fully understood. To identify novel proteins that modulate ER transcriptional activation, we have carried out a genetic screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ability of the human ER to function within yeast allows a wide variety of genetic approaches to be taken toward further defining the mechanism of ER transcriptional activation given the ease of genetic manipulation and simplicity of gene identification in yeast. In addition, with the large number of orthologous proteins carrying out the same biological functions in both S. cerevisiae and metazoans (8Rubin G.M. Yandell M.D. Wortman J.R. Gabor Miklos G.L.

Science. 1997; 277: 1259-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), it is likely that the yeast factors affecting ER transactivation will have mammalian counterparts, which can be examined in vertebrate systems. The genetic approach we have used to identify factors that affect ER transcriptional activation is dosage suppression analysis. In this technique, a mutant ER protein with a reduced ability to activate transcription is used as a substrate to isolate yeast gene product(s) that are capable of overcoming this mutant phenotype, thus restoring receptor transcriptional activity. The mutant ER derivative used in this screen is defective in transactivation by virtue of serine to alanine mutations in the three major N-terminal phosphorylation sites, serines 104, 106, and 118 (ERAAA). This mutant was selected as the substrate because it has only a modest effect on ER transactivation and therefore has the potential to isolate a broad range of factors that affect receptor activity. We expect to isolate yeast factors that enhance ER transcriptional activity and, importantly, have human homologues that can then be examined in mammalian cells for effects on ER transcriptional response. This approach has proven successful for investigating various aspects of ER signal transduction (11Knoblauch R. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3748-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Using this system, we have isolated RDI1, the yeast Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (Rho GDI), as a gene product that is capable of increasing both ERAAA and WT ER transcriptional activation when overexpressed. This gene product is the yeast homologue of the mammalian Rho GDIα, a cytoplasmic protein originally identified as a negative regulator of the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins (12Fukumoto Y.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Rho family of GTPases, which include RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are best known for their ability to regulate actin cytoskeletal remodeling in response to extracellular signals, thereby promoting changes in cell morphology, adhesion, and motility (16Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5200) Google Scholar). In addition, by affecting multiple signaling pathways, Rho family members regulate gene transcription and cell cycle progression and have been implicated in cellular transformation and metastasis (17Narumiya S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 18Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R.

The Rho family members possess intrinsic GTPase activity and cycle between the inactive cytoplasmic GDP-bound and the active membrane-associated GTP-bound state. The exchange of GDP for GTP induces a conformational change in the G protein that allows effector molecules, such as protein kinases, to bind and initiate downstream signaling events (23Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). This GTP/GDP cycle is tightly regulated in response to extracellular signals by three different classes of proteins. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP, GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Rho GTPases, and GDIs antagonize their activity by blocking GEFs and GAPs (12Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar,24Hart M.J. Maru Y. Leonard D. Witte O.N. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Science. 1992; 258: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, since the cytoplasmic GDP-bound Rho GTPases predominate under physiological conditions, Rho GDI acts as a negative regulator of Rho GTPases mainly by blocking the dissociation of GDP. In addition, Rho GDI controls the subcellular localization of the GTPases, stimulating their release from the plasma membrane (12Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rubino et al. (26Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind S. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) identified an ER-interacting protein, termed Brx, which contains a domain virtually identical to the Rho GEF Lbc and was first to demonstrate a link between ER signaling and the Rho GTPases. In this report, we extend the findings of Rubino et al. (26Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind S. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and examine the effects of human Rho GDIα as well as the Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, on transcriptional activation by ER and other members of the steroid receptor family in mammalian cells. Our findings indicate that Rho GDIα specifically increases the transcriptional activity of ERα and ERβ as well as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR), but not of the unrelated transcription factors serum response factor (SRF) and Sp1, and that this activation is mediated via repression of Rho GTPases. These results further establish the Rho-mediated signaling pathway as an important regulator of ER, GR, and AR transcriptional activity. The reporter plasmid ERE-CYC1-LacZ contains a single estrogen response element (ERE) upstream of a truncated CYC1 promoter linked to the β-galactosidase gene (27Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J.

Hirsch J. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 927-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and was generated by subcloning Sau 3A partially digested yeast genomic DNA into the Bam HI site of the YEP351 plasmid. WT ER and ERAAA were expressed from the Gal1–10 promoter in Trp1, 2 μm plasmid (p2T-GAL) (29Schena M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). p2T-GAL-ERAAA was constructed by subcloning theBam HI fragment containing ERAAA sequence from pcDNA3 (30Rogatsky I.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The ER reporter plasmid contains one ERE from the Xenopus vitellogenin A2 gene, upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (−109) linked to the firefly luciferase coding sequence (XETL) (31Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The GR reporter plasmid (XG46TL) is identical to XETL, except two consensus GREs are substituted for the ERE (31Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D.

Philips, unpublished results. Expression plasmids for N-terminally Myc-tagged Rac1.L61 and Cdc42.L61 have been described previously (36Nobes C.D. Hall A.

Both EXV.RhoA.V14 and EFC3- expressing Myc-tagged C3 transferase under the EF1α promoter have been described elsewhere (37Narumiya S. Sekine A. Fujiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17255-17257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dominant negative form of RhoA, RhoA.N19, was made by site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide 5′-GGAGCCTGTGGAAAGAACTGCTTGCTCATAGTC-3′ and the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pRK5-Myc-RhoA as the template. The entire RhoA.N19 coding region was sequenced to verify the base changed and to ensure that no other mutations were introduced. The Sp1 reporter contains six Sp1 binding sites upstream of the adenovirus major late promoter in front of the luciferase gene (39Tanese N. Saluja D. Vassallo M.F. Chen J.L. Admon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and SRF reporter contains a fragment of the c-Fos promoter upstream of luciferase (18Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). The yeast strain W303a (a ade2 leu2 his3 trp1 ura3) was used to screen for ER activators. Yeast transformation was performed by the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method (40Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). To assay ER transcriptional activation, cells were cultured overnight in the appropriate selective medium containing 2% glucose and subcultured 1:20 in selective minimal medium containing 2% galactose, 1% raffinose to induce receptor expression and treated with 17β-estradiol for 12 h. Quantitative liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (11Knoblauch R. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3748-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Plate assays were performed by replica-plating colonies from glucose plates onto galactose X-gal indicator plates containing 0.1 nm17β-estradiol. Human osteosarcoma U2OS (HTB 96) and human breast cancer MCF-7 (HTB-22) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and the Ishikawa human uterine cancer cell line was obtained from Dr. Seth Guller (NYU School of Medicine). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 10 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (Cellgro), and 2 mml-glutamine (Cellgro). Between 1.2 and 1.3 × 105 cells were seeded onto 35-mm plates in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Transfections using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies) were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Cells were treated with hormone agonists (100 nm 17β-estradiol, 100 nmdexamethasone, and 100 nm R1881 for ER, GR, and AR, respectively), the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 (41Dauvois S. White R. Parker M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1377-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (100 nm), or ethanol vehicle 12 h post-transfection for 24 h. Transfected cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was quantified in a reaction mixture containing 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, using an LB 9507 luminometer (EG & G Berthold) and 1 mmd-luciferin as substrate. The steroid receptor transcriptional activity is normalized to reporter activity in the absence of transfected steroid receptors and to protein concentration as determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Since MCF-7 cells contain endogenous ER, transcriptional activity of the receptor is normalized to XETL activity in the presence of ER antagonist ICI 182,780. The data presented represent the average of two experimental values, with error bars representing the range of the data points. To prepare protein extracts from transfected cells, whole cell extracts prepared for luciferase assay in 1× reporter lysis buffer were normalized for total protein and boiled for 3 min in SDS sample buffer. Protein extracts were fractionated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp.), and probed with anti-ERα polyclonal antibody (HC-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Rho GDI polyclonal antibody (A-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies and the ECL substrate as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Concomitant serine to alanine mutations at N-terminal phosphorylation sites 104, 106, and 118 (ERAAA) result in a ∼50% reduction in ER transcriptional activity in mammalian cells (42Le Goff P. Montano M.M. Schodin D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). To determine whether the transcriptional activity of ERAAA is also reduced in yeast, strains were constructed containing a galactose-inducible expression vector encoding either WT ER or ERAAA and an ER-responsive reporter plasmid. The transcriptional activities of WT ER and ERAAA were measured as a function of hormone concentration. Compared with WT ER, ERAAA exhibited ∼40% reduction of transcriptional activity at all hormone concentrations tested, suggesting that the ERAAA is less efficient at engaging in the interactions necessary for transcriptional activation (Fig.1 A). The ERAAA phenotype is most striking at 0.1 nm17β-estradiol. Under these conditions, yeast colonies expressing WT ER are blue, while ERAAA-expressing colonies appear white (Fig. 1 B). To screen for ER activators, yeasts expressing ERAAA, along with an estrogen-responsive reporter gene, were transformed with a high copy yeast genomic library and assayed for receptor transcriptional activation on X-gal indicator plates containing 0.1 nm 17β-estradiol. Candidate high copy suppressors changing the ERAAA-expressing yeast from white to blue were selected for further analysis (Fig. 1 B). Of the 29,000 colonies screened, which represents approximately 3 times the size of the yeast genome, we identified six yeast open reading frames that enhance ER transcriptional activation (TableI).Table IYeast genes that enhance ER transactivationGeneFunctionMammalian homologueEffect on ERTimes identifiedCKA1α subunit of casein kinase IICasein kinase IIPhosphorylates ER S167in vitro1CAD1Yeast Jun familyc-JunPotentiates ER transactivation1YAK1Ser/Thr kinaseANPKEnhances ER transactivation1MCK1Ser/Thr/Tyr kinaseGSK-3Enhances ER transactivation1RDI1Rho GDP dissociation inhibitorRho GDIαEnhances ER transactivation3LRG1Contains LIM domains similar to Rho GTPase-activating proteinsUnknownEnhances ER transactivation1At the top are shown yeast homologues of two previously known mammalian regulators that affect ER function.

At the bottom are four factors that appear to link ER transcriptional activation to signal transduction pathways previously not known to affect ER function. A search of the yeast genome data base revealed that two of the candidate suppressors were yeast homologues of mammalian proteins previously shown to affect ER transactivation. These include 1)CKA1 (44Chen-Wu J.L. Padmanabha R. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 4981-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a homologue of the mammalian α-subunit of casein kinase II that phosphorylates ER at serine 167 in vitro (45Arnold S.F. Obourn J.D. Jaffe H. Notides A.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and 2) CAD1 (46Wu A. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L.

Kushner P.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2900-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition to genes known to regulate ER activity, several genes not known to affect ER were identified. YAK1 (48Garrett S. Broach J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), a serine/threonine kinase with homology to ANPK, a protein kinase that interacts with the zinc finger region of the AR and increases AR-dependent transcriptional activation, was isolated once (49Moilanen A.M. Karvonen U. Poukka H. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2527-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, MCK1 (50Su S.S. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1993; 133: 67-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a protein kinase with homology to glycogen synthase kinase-3 (51Bianchi M.W. Plyte S.E. Kreis M. Woodgett J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was identified once. We also isolated RDI1 (14Masuda T. Tanaka K. Nonaka H. Yamochi W. Maeda A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19713-19718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the yeast Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (Rho GDI), three times, andLRG1 (52Muller L. Xu G. Wells R. Hollenberg C.P. Piepersberg W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3151-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a yeast protein that contains a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) homology domain, once. Although LRG1 is presently linked to GAP merely through sequence homology, it is interesting to note that GAP and RDI1 are both negative regulators of Rho GTPases. The recovery of known ER regulators together with the repeated isolation of certain genes indicates that the approach was sound and that the library was probably screened to saturation. Since Rho GDI negatively regulates Rho GTPases, this result suggests that the Rho GTPases may modulate ER transcriptional activation and is the focus of this report. Among the human Rho GDIs, RDI1 is most similar to human Rho GDIα, which negatively regulates the best studied Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. To examine whether the mammalian Rho GDI affects ER transcription in mammalian cells, we tested the ability of human Rho GDIα to enhance ER transcriptional activity in the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS. ER-negative U2OS cells were transiently transfected with ERα, an ER-responsive reporter plasmid, along with increasing amounts of Rho GDIα. As shown in Fig.2 A, Rho GDIα stimulates ER transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Enhancement of ER transcriptional activation by Rho GDIα was also observed for ERAAA mutant (not shown). To ensure that this enhanced transcriptional activity was not a result of increased ER protein production, we monitored protein expression in whole cell extracts using Western blot analysis. Fig. 2 B illustrates that ER levels are not increased by Rho GDI expression. Indeed, the steady state concentration of ER decreased slightly with increasing Rho GDI expression, indicating that the effect of Rho GDIα on ER activity is greater than that observed. The effect of Rho GDI on ER transactivation is not restricted to single cell type, since Rho GDIα also enhanced ER transactivation in MCF-7 and Ishikawa cells (Fig. 2 C). Thus, Rho GDIα can act as a positive regulator of ER-dependent transcriptional activation in a variety of mammalian cell lines. We next tested the ability of Rho GDIα to affect transactivation by other members of the steroid receptor family, ERβ, GR, and AR, using transient transfection assays. Our results indicate that Rho GDIα also increased the transcriptional activity of ERβ, GR, and AR in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3, A–C). To determine whether Rho GDI-mediated activation is specific to steroid receptors, we tested the effect of Rho GDIα on Sp1- and SRF-dependent transactivation. Rho GTPase signaling has been previously shown to enhance transcriptional activation by SRF (18Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar); thus, we would expect Rho GDIα, as a negative regulator of Rho GTPases, to decrease SRF transcriptional activity. Consistent with this idea, Rho GDIα expression decreased SRF activity from a reporter plasmid containing the c-Fos SRF element (Fig.4 A). Similarly, Sp1 transcriptional activity using an Sp1-responsive reporter also decreased in response to Rho GDI overexpression (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Rho GDI specifically increases transactivation by steroid hormone receptors, perhaps through a mechanism involving suppression of Rho GTPase signaling.Figure 4Rho GDI inhibits transcriptional activation by SRF and Sp1. U2OS cells were transfected as in Fig. 2 with 0.4 μg of Rho GDIα together with 0.2 μg of SRF reporter (A) or Sp1 reporter (B), harvested after 24 h, and assayed for luciferase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2120712084,"Thrombin acts as a procoagulant when it cleaves fibrinogen and promotes the formation of a fibrin clot and functions as an anticoagulant when it activates protein C with the assistance of the cofactor thrombomodulin. The dual function of thrombin in the blood poses the challenge to turn the enzyme into a potent anticoagulant by selectively abrogating fibrinogen cleavage. Using functional and structural data, we have rationally designed a thrombin mutant, W215A/E217A, that cleaves fibrinogen with a value of k(cat)/K(m) about 20,000-fold slower than wild-type but activates protein C in the presence of thrombomodulin with a specificity comparable with wild-type. This mutant demonstrates for the first time that the relative specificity of thrombin toward fibrinogen and protein C can be completely reversed."

The up-regulation of VPF/VEGF expression by Ras has been found to be through both transcription and mRNA stability. The present study investigates a novel pathway whereby Ras promotes the transcription of VPF/VEGF by activating protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ). The Ras-mediated overexpression of VPF/VEGF was also found to be inhibited by using the antisense or the dominant-negative mutant of PKCζ. In co-transfection assays, by overexpressing oncogenic Ha-Ras (12 V) and PKCζ, there was an additive effect up to 4-fold in activation of Sp1-mediated VPF/VEGF transcription. It has been shown through electrophoretic mobility shift assay that Ras promoted the PKCζ-induced binding of Sp1 to the VPF/VEGF promoter. In the presence of PDK-1, a major activating kinase for PKC, the Ras-mediated activation of VPF/VEGF promoter through PKCζ was further increased, suggesting that PKCζ can serve as an effector for both Ras and PDK-1. In other experiments, with the use of a dominant-negative mutant of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the activation of VPF/VEGF promoter through Ras, PDK-1, and PKCζ was completely repressed, indicating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase as an important component of this pathway. Taken together, these data elucidate the signaling mechanism of Ras-mediated VPF/VEGF transcriptional activation through PKCζ and also provide insight into PKCζ and Sp1-dependent transcriptional regulation of VPF/VEGF.

Although many angiogenic factors have been described, one in particular stands out for its potency and specificity, namely vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF1/VEGF) (3Leung D.W.

Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). VPF/VEGF is overexpressed by a wide variety of human tumors and plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. Although constitutively expressed by many tumor cells, VPF/VEGF expression is substantially up-regulated by hypoxia, cytokines, hormones, and certain oncogenes including activated forms ofsrc and ras (5Mukhopadhyay D.

Among the protein kinase C (PKC) family, the isoform PKCζ plays a critical role in regulating VPF/VEGF overexpression.PKCζ represents an atypical PKC isoform in that: 1) it lacks the C2 domain making its kinase activity Ca2+ independent, and 2) it possesses only one zinc finger region in its regulatory domain (10Ono Y. Fuji T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Consequently, PKCζ does not bind Ca2+ and cannot be activated by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters (11Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16347-16354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, prolonged treatment with phorbol esters does not down-regulate PKCζ (10Ono Y. Fuji T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and most PKC inhibitors do not decrease PKCζ activity (11Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16347-16354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKCζ is found to be involved in a wide range of physiological processes including mitogenesis, protein synthesis, cell survival, and transcriptional regulation (12Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I.

Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like many other protein kinases, PKCζ requires phosphorylation within its activation loops to express full catalytic potential (13Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S.

Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 16Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Ras has also been found to be involved both in transcriptional and post-transcriptional up-regulation of VPF/VEGF expression, and thus angiogenesis (17White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The persistent activation of signaling pathways induced by Ras accounts for overexpression of VPF/VEGF in a significant fraction of human tumors (7Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Bayko L. Filmus J. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4575-4580PubMed Google Scholar, 17White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). PKCζ could have an important cross-talk with Ras (18Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Frutos S. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31706-31710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several reports have shown that cell stimulation activates Ras which triggers a number of important serine/threonine kinases that have MAP kinase kinase (MEK) as substrate, such as MEK kinase, c-Raf-1, and B-Raf, culminating in the activation of MAP kinase (MAPK) (19Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.-F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 20Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J.

Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The kinase-deficient mutants of Raf-1, MEKs, and MAPKs have been shown to block Ras-mediated signaling events and transformation (23Cowly S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar, 24Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Ras may function primarily to promote the translocation of Raf-1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where subsequent Ras-independent events trigger Raf-1 kinase activation (25Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). In some studies, it has clearly been shown that PKCζ may also serve as a downstream target of Ras (26Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Frutos S. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Sanz L. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For example, both proteins have been found to be critically involved in the activation of NF-κB (27Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 28Dominguez I. Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Berra E. Garcia de Herreros A. Cornet M.E. Sanz L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3776-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It appears that the mechanism whereby PKCζ controls cell signaling could, at least in part, implicate the channeling of Ras signals in the activation of MAPK (26Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Frutos S. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Sanz L. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, despite the evidence that Raf-1 is a critical downstream effector of Ras function, there is increasing evidence that Ras may mediate its action through the activation of multiple downstream effector-mediated pathways (29Feig L.A. Science. 1993; 260: 767-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For example, the existence of Raf-independent Ras signaling pathways is suggested by the expanding roster of candidate Ras effectors that have been identified (30Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 31Khosravi-Far R. White M.A., K., W.J. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M.

Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Like Raf-1, these functionally diverse proteins, including Rho family members, show preferential binding to the active GTP-bound form of Ras and this interaction requires an active Ras effector domain (amino acids 32 to 40).Some recent findings have shown that the enzyme phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) is at the hub of many signaling pathways, activating PKB and PKC isoenzymes as well as p70-S6 kinase and perhaps PKA (13Chou M.M.

Furthermore, PDK-1 directly phosphorylates PKCζ at the activation-loop Thr410 residuein vitro (13Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A.

As PKCζ phosphorylation/activation is almost completely blocked by coexpression of dominant-negative PDK-1 or by mutation of Thr410, it is likely that a pre-requisite for PKCζ activation is phosphorylation of Thr410 (13Chou M.M.

PKCζ is found to be associated with PDK-1 in the same complex, and also identified as its in vivo substrate along with Akt/PKB and p70 S6 kinase (39Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that PDK-1 is recruited in the signaling pathways through PI 3-kinase and serves as a multifunctional downstream effector (13Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H.

Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) (11Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19200-19202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 leads to the activation of PKCζ which can be inhibited by chemical inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (42Mendez R. Kollmorgen G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5184-5192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of PI 3-kinase by lipopolysaccharide leads to the activation of PKCζ which is sensitive to PI 3-kinase inhibitors and a dominant-negative PI 3-kinase mutation (43Herrera-Velit P. Knutson K.L. Reiner N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16445-16452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations pinpoint PKCζ as a target of important lipid second messengers and support its role in cell signaling.In previous studies, we have shown that PKCζ plays a significant role in promotion of tumor angiogenesis by stimulating the expression of VPF/VEGF (8Pal S.

In addition to rendering microvessels hyperpermeable, VPF/VEGF stimulates endothelial cells to migrate and divide and profoundly alters their pattern of gene expression (3Leung D.W. Cachianes G.

We have shown that PKCζ interacts with and phosphorylates the transcription factor Sp1 and increases the VPF/VEGF promoter activity in human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) and renal cell carcinoma (786-0) cell lines, where basal level of VPF/VEGF is also very high (9Pal S. Claffey K.P. Cohen H.T. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26277-26280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the present study, we dissect the upstream signaling pathways, with special emphasis on Ras, that is required for activation of PKCζ to promote Sp1-mediated VPF/VEGF transcription. Our observations clearly indicate that coordinated signaling through Ras, PDK-1, and PI 3-kinase may be required to mediate PKCζ-induced activation of VPF/VEGF promoter.DISCUSSIONVPF/VEGF, a multifunctional cytokine, was originally discovered because of its ability to increase the permeability of microvessels, primarily post-capillary venules and small veins, to circulating macromolecules (4Senger D.R.

Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Although constitutively expressed by many tumor cells and transformed cell lines, VPF/VEGF expression is also subject to regulation by both PKC and cAMP-dependent kinase pathways (58Fischer S. Sharma H.S. Karliczek G.F. Schaper W. Brain. Res. Mol.

Other factors that can regulate VPF/VEGF expression include the degree of cell differentiation; local concentrations of oxygen, glucose, and serum; cytokines; hormones; prostaglandins; modulators of PKC; calcium influx; the electron transport chain; depolarizing agents; angiotensin II; stimulators of adenylate cyclase; nitric oxide; and expression levels of certain oncogenes, like src orras (5Mukhopadhyay D.

By blocking PKCζ with the use of its dominant-negative mutant or antisense oligonucleotide, we demonstrate that PKCζ acts as an important intermediary molecule in Ras-mediated overexpression of VPF/VEGF (Fig.2). In accord with earlier work, we also found that PKCζ promoted the Sp1-mediated transcription of VPF/VEGF in human HT1080 and 786-0 cells where the oncogene ras was already activated. With the increase in the dose of PKCζ, there was gradual activation of Sp1-mediated VPF/VEGF transcription, but from a certain dose (1.2 μg), this activation was lowered and then gradually came down to the basal level (Fig. 3). These findings clearly suggest that PKCζ-mediated activation of VPF/VEGF transcription is a rate-limiting step and may need activation through its upstream signaling pathways. Thus, if we overexpress PKCζ beyond a certain concentration, it acts like a dominant-negative factor since it is no longer activated. Here we attempt to dissect the role of Ras, along with PDK-1 and PI-3 kinase in activating PKCζ and show that they play a significant role in PKCζ-mediated activation of VPF/VEGF transcription.Ras is a point of convergence for many signaling pathways and plays a significant role in expression of VPF/VEGF (17White M.A. Nicolette C.

Here, we demonstrate that Ras promotes VPF/VEGF transcription in a Sp1-dependent manner (Fig. 1). It has been reported that Ras triggers activation of series of kinases known as the MAPK cascade (Ras > MEK > MAPK) (16Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J.

Raf-1 in turn activates MAPK kinases (MEK1 and MEK2), which in turn activate p42 and p44 MAPKs/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (19Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.-F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L.

Activated MAPKs then translocate into the nucleus, where they phosphorylate and activate nuclear transcription factors (65Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R.

Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar), resulting in immediate early gene induction. As from the previous reports, PKCζ appears to be located downstream of Ras (12Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapkin R.S. Moscat J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), it seems conceivable that PKCζ could be critically involved in channeling Ras signals for activation of MAPK resulting in up-regulation of VPF/VEGF transcription. In the current study, we observe that PKCζ or Ras alone increased the VPF/VEGF transcription in human HT1080 or 786-0 cells up to 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). But when the cells were transfected in combination with PKCζ and Ha-Ras(G12V), the transcriptional activation was increased up to 4-fold (Fig. 5,A and B). A dominant-negative mutant of Ha-Ras blocked the PKCζ-mediated activation of VPF/VEGF transcription (Fig.5 A). The dominant-negative mutant of PKCζ reduced the VPF/VEGF transcription below the control level (Fig. 5 A). These results clearly indicate that PKCζ needs signaling through Ras for activation. It may also play an important role in channeling a part of Ras signal to its downstream targets to promote tumor angiogenesis. Observations from others have prompted suggestions that PKCζ is a required step of Ras-mediated mitogenic signaling and that Ras directly interacts in vitro with the regulatory domain of PKCζ as well as that the association of PKCζ with Ras in vivo is triggered by platelet-derived growth factor (51Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Dent P. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Hay R.T. Sturgill T.W. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In our studies, although we were unable to detect any direct interaction between PKCζ and Ras, these two proteins were found to be present in the same immunocomplex (Fig.-4A). Therefore, it is quite clear that Ras-mediated signaling is an important step for PKCζ activation and thus increasing VPF/VEGF promoter activity. We have also confirmed this through EMSA, where Ras promoted the PKCζ-induced binding of Sp1 to the VPF/VEGF promoter (Fig. 6 A). Moreover, it is also evident that even the activated form of Ras cannot bypass PKCζ in regulating VPF/VEGF transcription, as the dominant-negative mutant of PKCζ clearly inhibited the Ras-induced binding of Sp1 to the VPF/VEGF promoter (Fig. 6 B).We next set out to dissect the role of Raf-independent downstream effectors that are involved in mediating Ras signals. Mutations in the Ras effector domain (residues 32–40) can impair Ras transforming activity and interaction with effector proteins without causing alterations in intrinsic GDP and GTP regulation (31Khosravi-Far R. White M.A., K., W.J. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Van aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 67Marshall M.S.

Ha-Ras(G12V,T35S) retained the full-length Raf-1 binding activity, while Ha-Ras(G12V,E37G) was impaired in its ability to bind to Raf-1. Consistent with its impaired ability to up-regulate Raf-1 kinase activity, it"

To elucidate the biological meaning of this unique structure containing two probable sugar binding sites in one molecule, we analyzed in detail the sugar binding properties of the two domains by using a newly improved frontal affinity chromatography system. The whole molecule (LEC-1), the N-terminal lectin domain (Nh), and the C-terminal lectin domain (Ch) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and immobilized on HiTrap gel agarose columns, and the extent of retardation of various sugars by the columns was measured. To raise the sensitivity of the system, we used 35 different fluorescence-labeled oligosaccharides (pyridylaminated (PA) sugars). All immobilized proteins showed affinity for N-acetyllactosamine-containingN-linked complex-type sugar chains, and the binding was stronger for more branched sugars. Ch showed 2–5-fold stronger binding toward all complex-type sugars compared with Nh. Both Nh and Ch preferred Galβ1–3GlcNAc to Galβ1–4GlcNAc. Because the Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAc (H antigen) structure was found to interact with all immobilized protein columns significantly, theK d value of pentasaccharide Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc-PA for each column was determined by analyzing the concentration dependence. Obtained values for immobilized LEC-1, Nh, and Ch were 6.0 × 10−5, 1.3 × 10−4, and 6.5 × 10−5m, respectively. The most significant difference between Nh and Ch was in their affinity for GalNAcα1–3(Fucα1–2)Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc-PA, which contains the blood group A antigen; the K d value for immobilized Nh was 4.8 × 10−5m, and that for Ch was 8.1 × 10−4m.

The present results clearly indicate that the two sugar binding sites of LEC-1 have different sugar binding properties. N-terminal lectin domain of LEC-1 C-terminal lectin domain of LEC-1 pyridylaminated phosphate-buffered saline Galectins form a group of animal lectins characterized by their specificity for β-galactosides (1Barondes S.H.

Although biological phenomena in which galectins are involved are extremely diverse, all members of the galectin family must meet two criteria: specific affinity for β-galactosides and an evolutionally conserved sequence motif in the carbohydrate binding site. Galectins are widely distributed in the animal kingdom from humans to sponges. At least 11 galectins (galectins 1–11) have been found in mammals, and 11 also have been found in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Galectins can be classified into three types in terms of molecular architecture, i.e. proto-type, chimera-type, and tandem repeat-type (4Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). LEC-1 (or N32), the 32-kDa galectin of C. elegans, was the first example of the tandem repeat-type galectin composed of two homologous regions (5Hirabayashi J. Satoh M. Ohyama Y. Kasai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Hirabayashi J. Satoh M. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15485-15490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple galectins belonging to this type were also found recently in mammals, e.g. galectin-4 (7Oda Y. Herrmann J. Gitt M.A. Turck C.W. Burlingame A.L. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 4: 548Google Scholar), and galectin-8 (10Hadari Y.R. Paz K. Dekel R. Mestrovic T. Accili D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3447-3453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because LEC-1 has a strong hemagglutination activity, even though LEC-1 itself seems to exist as a monomer, both of its two homologous regions appear to have carbohydrate binding ability (11Arata Y. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we prepared recombinant proteins of the whole molecule (LEC-1), the N-terminal lectin domain (Nh),1 and the C-terminal lectin domain (Ch) and compared their binding affinity for asialofetuin-Sepharose by frontal affinity chromatography (11Arata Y. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We found the ratio of their binding strengths to be 100:1.14:14.6, and this result demonstrates that both of the two domains have sugar binding ability but have different binding properties. A recent x-ray crystallographic study demonstrated that both domains of LEC-1 contain similar β-sandwich motifs as those of proto-type galectins (12Nonaka T. Sekihashi K. Nishizaki S. Arata Y. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Mitsui Y. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: S119Google Scholar). LEC-1 was found to be localized most abundantly in the adult cuticle ofC. elegans by immunohistochemical studies (13Arata Y. Akimoto Y. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Hirano H. Histochem. J. 1996; 28: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may be an essential component of the adult cuticular matrix, serving as a cross-linker with two different sugar binding sites for the construction of the tough and durable outer barrier of the worm's body. Although the binding strength of Nh for asialofetuin-Sepharose was relatively weak compared with that of Ch or the whole molecule LEC-1, some sugar structure strongly recognized by Nh may exist. If we can demonstrate that the sugar binding ability of Nh is comparable with that of Ch but that the specificity is somewhat different, the biological significance of the existence of such a cross-linker may be made clearer. Therefore, we decided to analyze their binding ability in more detail. For this purpose, K d values for 35 different fluorescently labeled oligosaccharides (pyridylaminated (PA) sugars; Ref. 14Hase S. Ikenaka T. Matsushima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) were determined by use of an improved frontal affinity chromatography method (15Hirabayashi J. Arata Y. Kasai K. J. Chromatogr.

Oda Y. Nishikawa M. Ishii S. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 376: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) proved to have many advantages from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints in comparison with zonal chromatography as an analytical tool for molecular interactions, such as enzyme-substrate analog (18Kasai K. Ishii S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Kasai K. Ishii S. J. Biochem.

In frontal affinity chromatography, an excess volume of an analyte solution is continuously applied to the column packed with an affinity adsorbent. The theory is very simple, because we can describe this system in terms of a simple equilibrium. The procedure is also very easy to perform, and the results are reproducible and reliable. From a contemporary viewpoint, however, frontal affinity chromatography has a few drawbacks; e.g. it is time consuming, requires a relatively large amount of analyte, and has not been automated. In a previous study, for example, >100 ml of a protein solution (5 μg/ml) was applied to a relatively large volume column (bed volume, 2 ml), and one run took several hours. Because we keenly believed in the importance of reinforcing this method, we sought to improve it in the following ways: (i) use of mechanically stable chromatographic media for packing; for this purpose, HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose was used; (ii) adoption of a fluorescence-based detection for increasing the sensitivity; in the present study, fluorescence-labeled sugars (PA-oligosaccharides; 320 nm for excitation and 400 nm for emission; Ref. 14Hase S. Ikenaka T. Matsushima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) were used; (iii) design of a semiautomated system; for this purpose, an ordinary high performance liquid chromatography system was used, and the analyte solution was loaded into a relatively large sample loop (1–2 ml) and injected into a miniature column (4.0 mm inner diameter × 10 mm; bed volume, 0.126 ml); and (iv) development of a simple and efficient data-processing procedure that enables the determination of very small differences in retardation with precision. These reinforcements were successful, and reliable data for binding ability were obtained. Comparison of the K d values for 35 different sugar chains obtained for LEC-1, Nh, and Ch clearly showed that LEC-1 has two comparably potent sugar binding sites with different affinities. Thirty-three PA-oligosaccharides (for structures; see Tables I and II; the numbers denote commercially assigned ones and will be used throughout this and future works), PA-rhamnose, and PA-mannose were purchased from Takara Biomedicals.

Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA fragments encoding 32-kDa galectin (LEC-1 or N32), its N-terminal half-domain (Nh), and its C-terminal half-domain (Ch) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using cloned cDNA as a template. The amplified fragments were ligated into digested pET21a (Novagen) and used to transformEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Production of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. LEC-1 and Ch were purified by affinity chromatography on asialofetuin-Sepharose 4B, and Nh was purified by chromatography on DEAE Toyopearl 650S (Tosoh). The recombinant proteins were dissolved in 0.2 m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m lactose and coupled to HiTrap NHS-activated columns following the manufacturer's instructions. After washing and deactivation of excess active groups by ethanolamine, the lectin-immobilized agarose beads were taken out from the cartridge. Each adsorbent was suspended in EDTA-PBS (1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Na-phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl), and the slurry was packed into a stainless steel column (4.0 × 10 mm). The amount of immobilized proteins was determined by measuring the amount of uncoupled protein in the washing solutions by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The basic equation of frontal affinity chromatography, Equation 1, has been described before (17Kasai K. Oda Y. Nishikawa M. Ishii S. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 376: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Vf−V0=BtKd+[A]0Equation 1 Analyte and immobilized ligand are denoted A andB, respectively. K d is the dissociation constant between interacting biomolecules, B t is the total amount of immobilized ligand, [A]0 is the initial concentration of the analyte, A;V f is the elution volume of A (see Fig.1 A, curve I); andV 0 is that of a substance that has no specific interaction with the immobilized ligand (e.g. PA-rhamnose,p-aminophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside; see Fig. 1 A, curve II). K d, B t andV 0 are constant for a given column.V f varies depending on [A]0in the appropriate concentration range. Equation 1 can be rearranged as follows so that a plot of [A]0(V f −V 0) versus (V f −V 0) should be linear:[A]0·(Vf−V0)=Bt−Kd·(Vf−V0)Equation 2 This equation is homologous to the Woolf-Hofstee equation, which is used for enzyme kinetics. The value of K d can be determined from the slope, which corresponds to −K d. The value of B t can be obtained from the intercept on the ordinate. If [A]0 is negligibly small compared withK d, V f approaches the maximum value, V m, which is independent of [A]0, and the following equation is obtained:Vm−V0=BtKdEquation 3 This means that the value of V m −V 0 is proportional to the affinity of a PA-sugar for an immobilized lectin. Therefore, we can compare quantitatively the binding strength of different PA-sugars by measuring the value ofV m − V 0 at a concentration that satisfies [A]0 ≪K d provided that B t is given. V f can be considered the volume at which the hypothetical boundary of the analyte solution would appear if the boundary were not disturbed at all. Therefore,V f is the point at which the area under the elution curve is equal to the area of the rectangle([A]0 for height and (∑ΔS i)/[A]0 for base) shown in Fig. 1 C. If fluorescence intensity data are collected periodically, the area under the elution curve becomes the sum of the areas of small rectangles with ΔV for base and [A]i for height; i.e.ΔS i = ΔV × [A]i (Fig. 1 B). If ΔV is small enough, ∑ΔS i (Fig.1 B, shaded) is close enough to the actual area. If the column i is located at the plateau, division of ∑ΔS i by [A]i gives the length of the base of the large rectangle. Subtracting this value fromV i (i.e. V i − (∑ΔS i)/[A]i) gives the point at which the area below the elution curve and the rectangle becomes equal. If we instruct the computer to calculate this valueV i − (∑ΔS i)/[A]i continuously, and when the elution curve reaches a plateau ([A]0), this value converges to a certain figure that should be V f, the point at which the hypothetical boundary of the analyte appears (Fig. 1 C). By this procedure, reliable values can be obtained even if the elution curve is not symmetrical. The calculation procedure was as follows. Collected data were saved as a text file by using ChromData (Dynamax Compare Modules software; Rainin Instrument Company, Inc.), transferred to an Excel format, and calculated automatically. When V f converged to a certain value, we considered it to be the true V f. We made a homemade Excel template to obtain the V fdata easily (22Arata Y. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Chromatogr. A. 2001; 905: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Multiple text data files were processed automatically by programs written in AppleScript. Although the V fvalue includes the volume of the tubing from the outlet of the column to the fluorescence detector, this can be compensated, because we always consider values relative to V 0, which is the elution volume of a protein without specific interaction with the affinity adsorbent (in this paper, PA-rhamnose orp-aminophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside). PA-oligosaccharide was dissolved in EDTA-PBS and applied to the column through a 2-ml sample loop connected to the Rheodyne 7725 injector. The flow rate was controlled by a Shimadzu LC-10ADvp pump at 0.25 ml/min. The sample loop and the column were immersed in a 20 °C water bath. Elution of PA-oligosaccharide from the column was monitored by a Shimadzu RF10AxL fluorescence detector at 400 nm (excitation at 320 nm). The signal from the detector was sent to a computer (Power Macintosh 7300/180) through a control interface module (Varian Chromatography Systems) at 2-s intervals, and the collected data were processed by Dynamax Compare Module software and by a table-calculating software (Microsoft Excel). The outline of the system is shown in Fig. 2. For the determination of V 0, PA-rhamnose, which has no affinity to galectins, was used. PA-labeled lacto-N-fucopentaose I (PA-043) was used to determine the concentration dependence of the V f value. PA-043 solutions of various concentrations were applied to the column through a 1-ml sample loop connected to the Rheodyne 7725 injector. For immobilized LEC-1 and Ch, the retardation V f −V 0 was measured at 50, 20, 10, 5, and 2 μm PA-043. For immobilized Nh, which showed weaker affinity for PA-043, the concentrations of PA-43 were 100, 50, 25, 10, and 5 μm. Elution patterns were monitored by UV absorption at 300 nm using Shimadzu SPD-10Avp UV monitor, because the concentrations used were too high for fluorescence monitoring. For the determination of V 0,p-aminophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside was used. The whole molecule (LEC-1), the N-terminal lectin domain (Nh), and the C-terminal lectin domain (Ch) of the 32-kDa galectin of the nematode C. elegans were expressed in E. coli by using the expression vector pET21a. Purified recombinant proteins were immobilized on HiTrap NHS-activated columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After the reaction had been terminated, the plastic cartridge was broken, and the lectin-immobilized gel was packed into a stainless steel column (4.0 × 10 mm). The amounts of immobilized proteins for LEC-1-, Nh-, and Ch-immobilized gels were 5.9, 6.6, and 1.9 mg/ml gel, respectively. The outline of the system for the improved frontal affinity chromatography is shown in Fig. 2. One of the PA-sugars dissolved in EDTA-PBS at a concentration of 10 nm was applied continuously to a column containing its counterpart galectin. Elution profiles of PA-sugars from LEC-1-, Nh-, and Ch-immobilized columns are collectively shown in Fig. 3,A–C, respectively. Elution pattern of each PA-sugar was overlaid with that of a control sugar (PA-rhamnose), which does not show any affinity for LEC-1, Nh, or Ch (data not shown). PA-sugar numbers (for structure, see Tables Iand II) are given at the upper left of each profile, and the extent of retardation (V f − V 0) in milliliters is indicated in the middle of each elution pattern (when no retardation was observed, the value was omitted). Because the concentration of every PA-sugar was 10 nm and adequately small in comparison with K d, the retardation volumeV f − V 0 was proportional to the strength of binding to the immobilized lectin (as described under “Experimental Procedures”).Figure 3Elution profiles of various PA-oligosaccharides after application to immobilized LEC-1-, Nh -, and Ch-columns. PA-oligosaccharides were dissolved in EDTA-PBS at a concentration of 10 nm, and 2 ml of each solution was applied to the column (10 × 4.0 mm, 0.126 ml) through a 2-ml loop (inner diameter, 0.75 mm) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min at 20 °C. Each elution pattern of PA-oligosaccharide was superimposed on that of PA-rhamnose so that the retardation could be seen. Large numbers at top left of each elution pattern (001∼050) correspond to the reference numbers of PA-oligosaccharides described in the catalogue of Takara Shuzo Corporation (see Tables I and II). Man corresponds to PA-mannose, and Rha corresponds to PA-rhamnose. Small numbers indicated in the elution patterns are detected retardation volumes (V f − V 0, in ml) for each PA-oligosaccharide. A, LEC-1; B, Nh;C, Ch.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The elution profiles of 001, 002, and 004 indicate thatN-acetyllactosamine-containing, N-linked, complex-type sugar chains interacted with both Nh and Ch and also with LEC-1 and that the binding was stronger for more branched complex-type sugar chains (001 < 002). This was predictable because there would be more chances for interaction. The reason why the affinity of the tetraantennary oligosaccharide (004) was almost the same as that of the triantennary oligosaccharide (002) is not known, but it may be attributable to steric hindrance. We did not obtain theV f − V 0 for a single branch complex-type sugar, because its PA derivative was not commercially available. The affinity for the glycolipid-type disaccharide Galβ1–4Glc-PA (026) was very weak, and retardation was not detectable, probably because the reducing end of the Glc moiety becomes an opened chain structure because of the pyridylamination process. We will probably be able to determine the affinity for conventional galectin-recognized disaccharides such as lactose andN-acetyllactosamine by measuring the inhibition of retardation of strongly recognized PA-sugars (e.g. PA-043) in the near future. The fucose residue added to the chitobiose structure did not affect the affinity (compare 001 and 009, 002 and 010, and 004 and 011). Because the affinity was reduced when position 6 of nonreducing Gal was substituted by NeuAcα2–6 (021, 022, and 023), position 6 of Gal proved to be important for recognition by both Nh and Ch. Ch showed 2–5-fold stronger binding ability toward all sugars except 047 in comparison with Nh (this will be discussed later). Furthermore, Nh and Ch preferred Galβ1–3GlcNAc to Galβ1–4GlcNAc. This can be seen by comparing the affinity between 002 and 003 (one of the antennae of the former is Galβ1–4GlcNAc and one of the latter is Galβ1–3GlcNAc) and that between 041 and 042. When position 3 of GlcNAc of 041 was substituted by Fucα1–3 (045), or when the position 4 of GlcNAc of 042 was substituted by Fucα1–4 (044), the affinity was considerably reduced. These results suggest that the recognition meets the rules found for other vertebrate galectins, i.e. that position 3 of GlcNAc in the Galβ1–4GlcNAc structure or position 4 of GlcNAc in the Galβ1–3GlcNAc structure is important for recognition. When the Gal residue at the nonreducing end was modified by Fucα1–2 (Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc-PA; 043, H Antigen), the affinity became much stronger for all immobilized columns. In this case, Galβ1–3GlcNAc was still the major structure for recognition, because the substitution of position 4 of GlcNAc with Fucα1–4 (046) resulted in significant reduction in the affinity. A significant difference between Nh and Ch was found. When position 3 of Gal at the nonreducing end of 043 was substituted with GalNAcα1–3 (047; blood group A antigen), the affinity for immobilized Nh, but not for Ch, became 3-fold stronger (V f −V 0 increased to 0.384 from 0.143 ml). Such an effect was also reported in the case of mammalian galectin-3. Galβ1–3GlcNAc was still the principal recognition structure, because when position 4 of GlcNAc was substituted with Fucα1–4 (048), the affinity was almost lost (V f −V 0 became 0.010 ml). For Ch, on the other hand, the substitution changing 043 to 047 resulted in significant reduction in the affinity (V f − V 0 was reduced to 0.010 from 0.124 ml). The affinity was recovered, but not completely, by further substitution at position 4 of GlcNAc by Fucα1–4 (048; V f − V 0 was 0.047 ml). The reason is not explainable at this moment. Although a galectin from a marine sponge was reported to have marked affinity for the blood group A-related Forssman antigen saccharide (GalNAcα1–3GalNAcβ1−; 040; Ref. 23Pfeifer K. Haasemann M. Gamulin V. Bretting H. Fahrenholz F. Müller W.E.G. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), neither immobilized Nh nor Ch from C. elegans showed any affinity for this structure. Recent x-ray crystallographic analysis of LEC-1 demonstrated that both lectin domains are composed of a similar β-sandwich motif found in mammalian proto-type galectins (12Nonaka T. Sekihashi K. Nishizaki S. Arata Y. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Mitsui Y. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: S119Google Scholar). Together with the present biochemical data, both of the domains function as sugar binding parts, but they have independent sugar recognition properties. We could compare the affinity of the various PA-sugars for the immobilized galectin by simply looking at the profile shown in Fig. 3, because V f − V 0values are proportional to the affinities of"

Most of the resulting antibodies that were directed against nonstructural components were reactive with components of the terminal complement complex (1Murphy B.F. d'Apice A.J. Pathology. 1988; 20: 130-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These included two antibodies that first identified human clusterin, a component of the SC5b-9 complement complex (2Murphy B.F. Kirszbaum L. Walker I.D. d'Apice A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1858-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The pattern of immunohistological reactivity of another antibody against glomerular immune deposits, K2.254, appeared similar to that of antibodies against complement components in normal and pathological human tissue (1Murphy B.F. d'Apice A.J. Pathology. 1988; 20: 130-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Its reactivity was widespread in all complement-containing glomerular immune deposits and in extra-renal sites of complement deposition. In vitro, however, it did not react with any known complement component or purified complement complexes, and, initially, it did not appear to react with normal human serum. In this paper we describe the characterization of the protein recognized by K2.254. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein, obtained by partial peptide sequencing and cDNA cloning and sequencing, indicates that it is a member of the factor H-related family of proteins. In keeping with current nomenclature in this area, the new protein has been designated factor H-related protein 5 (FHR-5).1 The production and initial screening of monoclonal antibodies K2.254, K2.322 (anti-human C9), K1.115 (anti-human C6), and an isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody, K1.431, has previously been described (1Murphy B.F. d'Apice A.J. Pathology. 1988; 20: 130-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the surface of K562 cells was produced by repeated immunization with K562 cells in pertussis vaccine. Mouse anti-human Factor H and polyclonal rabbit-anti human C3 antibodies were purchased from Serotec (Kidlington, Oxford, UK), and mouse anti-human serum albumin (HSA) antibody was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The secondary antibodies used were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako, Carpenteria, CA), rabbit anti-mouse and donkey anti-goat immunoglobulins (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), which were 125I-labeled as described previously (2Murphy B.F. Kirszbaum L. Walker I.D. d'Apice A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1858-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit (Dako), and sheep anti-fluoroscein-peroxidase Fab fragments (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). A Tetra-His monoclonal antibody (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for detection of His-tagged recombinant protein expression. The human lymphoblast cell line K562 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). 106 K562 cells were incubated with 0.1 mg/ml anti-K562 antibody for 2 h/37 °C, washed 3× in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated with normal human serum (NHS) or control heat-inactivated NHS, 1:2 dilution in PBS/4 h/37 °C. After incubation with sera, the cells were washed 3× in PBS, and the preparation was divided, spun onto aminoalkylsilane (Sigma)-treated microscope slides, fixed in acetone for 10 min, and air-dried. The slides were incubated with 10 μg/ml K2.254, K2.322, or K1.431 for 1 h at room temperature (RT) and washed 3× in PBS. Slides were finally incubated in rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-mouse immunoglobulins (1:20) for 30 min at RT, washed a further three times, and examined by epifluorescence microscopy. In additional experiments, sensitized cells were incubated with NHS, which had been depleted of C9, C8, or C7 as described previously (3Morgan B.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 150: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar). Guinea pig erythrocytes (GPE) were directly lysed using fresh NHS. Washed GPE were suspended 1:10 (v/v) in 0.9% sodium chloride solution, and 5 ml of this preparation was incubated with 20 ml of NHS overnight at 37 °C. The GPE ghosts were retrieved by centrifugation and washed three to five times in saline until the supernatant was clear. To prepare negative control erythrocyte ghosts, 5 ml of the washed 1:10 GPE suspensions was osmotically lysed by the addition of 10 ml of distilled water and the erythrocyte ghosts were recovered and washed as above. NHS, erythrocyte ghosts, and affinity-purified K2.254 antigen were prepared and electrophoresed on 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE gels (4Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Trans-Blot transfer medium, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using a Bio-Rad transblot cell (5Burnette W.N. Analyt. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% dried milk in 0.1 m PBS for 1 h at RT, then probed with appropriate monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Membranes were washed 5 × 5 min in PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 followed by incubation with either 125I-labeled secondary antibody or rabbit anti-mouse-HRP (1:1000) for 1 h at RT. Following washing, radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography and HRP-labeled bands were detected using SuperSignalWest Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Complement-lysed GPE ghosts were extracted with 5 ml of 1% digitonin (Sigma) in 0.1 m PBS overnight at 4 °C. Affinity chromatography was performed using a 10-ml column of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) to which 50 mg of the K2.254 monoclonal antibody had been coupled according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 5-ml digitonin extract was passed over the column and collected. The column was then washed with 200 volumes of PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100 (PBS/Triton) and eluted with 10 ml of 0.05 m diethylamine, pH 11.5. The sample was eluted into 1 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). Each 5-ml extract was passaged twice through the column, and the eluates from three samples (six passages) were pooled, dialyzed extensively against PBS/Triton, and then concentrated to 0.5 ml (YM30 membrane and Centricon 30; Amicon, Beverly, MA). Affinity chromatography was also used to identify and partly purify the K2.254 antigen from NHS. 10 ml of NHS was passed 3× over a 2-ml monoclonal antibody K2.254 Sepharose 4B column, and the column eluate was dialyzed and concentrated as described above. The concentrated eluates were then analyzed by Western blotting. Samples of the concentrated affinity column eluate from GPE ghosts were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with an 80% ether/20% ethanol solution, redissolved in 100 μl of 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, + 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and subjected to reverse-phase HPLC on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech SMART HPLC system using a 2.1-mm ID × 250-mm Brownlee RP300 7-Å C8 column (solvent A: 0.1% TFA, solvent B: 60% acetonitrile 0.1% TFA, flow 100 μl/min). A gradient of 0–100% solvent B in 60 min was employed, and peaks were monitored at 280 nm and collected manually. Fractions were analyzed by Western blot to detect elution of individual components, and fractions containing K2.254 binding activity were pooled and lyophilized. Lyophilized fractions were reconstituted in SDS sample buffer and run on 10% SDS-PAGE. Bands were excised, reduced, pyridylethylated, and subjected to in-gel digestion with Achromobacter Lys-C endoproteinase (Wako) according to Mitchelhill et al. (6Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J.

Extracted peptide mixtures were subjected to HPLC on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech SMART system using a 1-mm ID × 250-mm SGE 300-μm, 5-Å C18 GLT column (solvent A 0.1% TFA, solvent B 60% acetonitrile 0.075% TFA, flow 40 μl/min). A gradient 0–100%B in 150 min was run, peaks were monitored at 214, 254, and 280 nm, and individual peptides were manually collected. Peptide homogeneity and mass were established on a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager DE MALDI mass spectrometer, and the amino acid sequence was determined on a Hewlett Packard G1000A protein sequencer. Homology searches were performed using nonredundant protein data bases (GenBank™ CDS translations + Protein Data Bank + Spupdate + Protein Information Resource) and six translations of the Expressed Sequence Tag data base. Total RNA was extracted from a piece of normal, noninfiltrated human liver, obtained from one patient during liver resection. The tissue was homogenized, and RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of total RNA was treated with DNase to remove contaminating genomic DNA, and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using an Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of human liver poly(A)+ RNA using either oligo(dT) or random primers and Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two degenerate primers, 254-F1 (sequence 5′-GGNGARTGYCAYGTNCCNAT) and 254-R1 (sequence 5′-CARTCNACYTCNGGRTTCCA) were use to amplify an initial product from human liver cDNA. Touchdown PCR, with annealing temperatures of 70 °C down to 65 °C, was carried out in a PTC-200 DNA Engine thermal cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA) for 40 cycles. 3′- and 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was then performed using gene-specific primers (GSP-F and GSP-R, see Table I), Advantage DNA polymerase, and the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Full-length cDNA was amplified from human liver poly(A)+ RNA as above using the GSP-F9 primer (Table I) and the AP1 primer supplied with the Marathon kit.Table IGene-specific primers used in cDNA synthesis and cloningPrimerSequenceGSP-F5′-GTCATGTTGCCCATTTTAGAAGCCAATG-3′GSP-F15′-GGAGAAGGAACACTTTGTGA-3′GSP-F25′-ATAAGAGTTGGATCAGACTC-3′GSP-F35′-GTATATCCTCCAGGGCTAAC-3′GSP-F45′-GTGGATACATACCTGAACTCG-3′GSP-F55′-TCACCAACACCGAAGTGTCTC-3′GSP-F65′-CCATCTACGCTAAAAGTAGCC-3′GSP-F75′-GTTCAGACATCTTCAGATACAGGC-3′GSP-F85′-CAGTTAAAATGGAGAAACGATGG-3′GSP-F95′-CGGGCAGGTGCTTGTTACTGTTAATG-3′GSP-R5′-GGTGTGTTGCAACACACATAGGAAGCTCT-3′GSP-R15′-GAACATAACCGTACTCGAG-3′GSP-R25′-CCACATGATCGTACTTGTC-3′GSP-R35′-GAGCATCTACATTGGCTTC-3′GSP-R45′-GTTGACCCTGGAGGATATAC-3′GSP-R55′-CTGAGCATTAGGTATCTGAGG-3′GSP-R65′-CTTCCCCTGTACGAACTTGGGAA-3′GSP-R75′-GCTACAACCACAAAAGTTGACAGCT-3′BAC-F15′-GAAGGAACACTTTGTGATTTTCC-3′BAC-F25′-CGACGCGTGAAGGAACACTTTGTGA-3′BAC-R15′-GGACTAGTGGCTACTTTTAGCGTAGATGG-3′BAC-R25′-GCCGTCGACCCTTCACATATAGGATATTC-3′ Open table in a new tab PCR products were gel-purified (Qiagen gel extraction kit) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Plasmid DNA was prepared from bacterial cultures using Qiagen Plasmid Mini Kits. The correct identity of the cloned fragments was confirmed by sequencing, PCR, and restriction enzyme analysis. DNA sequencing reactions were performed using the BIGDYE Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and electrophoresed by the Australian Genome Research Facility, Melbourne, Australia. Both strands of cDNA clones were sequenced using standard vector primers and several of the internal primers listed in Table I. Sequence analysis was performed using MacVector (version 5.0.2, Oxford Molecular Group, UK). 10 μg of total RNA from human liver was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) by standard procedures (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA was cross-linked to the membranes using a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and blots were prehybridized in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) at 65 °C for 1 h. Hybridization with specific probes labeled with α-32P using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed at 65 °C for 2 h. Membranes were washed for 15 min in 2× SSC + 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, 1× SSC + 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and 0.1× SSC + 0.1% SDS at RT and filters exposed at −70 °C overnight. A 1672-bp fragment was amplified from the full-length (3.0 kb) cDNA by PCR (touchdown 56–50 °C) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The forward primer (BAC-F2, see Table I) was designed to anneal immediately 3′ of the signal peptide-encoding region and contained a MluI restriction site at its 5′-end. The reverse primer (BAC-R2, TableI) annealed immediately 3′ of the open reading frame (ORF) and incorporated a SalI restriction site at its 5′-end. The PCR product was digested withMluI/SalI (Promega, Madison, WI) and cloned into the pFastBac1-His10+ vector, which was partially digested with MluI, gel-purified, then treated with XhoI. pFASTBAC1-His10+, a modified version of pFastBac1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), encodes a gp67 signal peptide to ensure efficient secretion and a 10-histidine C-terminal epitope tag to facilitate detection and purification. The complete sequence of the insert and its junctions was confirmed by sequencing. A modification of the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression systems protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to obtain purified recombinant baculovirus. Recombinant pFastBac1-His10+vector was transferred into DH10Bac-competent cells and cultured overnight in 4 ml of S.O.C. medium containing gentamicin, tetracycline, and kanamycin. To obtain a pure recombinant virus strain without the need for plaque assay analysis, recombinant Bacmid DNA was isolated as described and transfected into DH10-competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) by electroporation (2.5 kV, 25 microfarads, 200 ohms). Transfected cells were cultured on Luria agar plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside (X-gal), isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, kanamycin, and gentamicin for 24 h. Colonies containing pure recombinant Bacmid DNA were selected by blue/white screening, and total DNA was prepared and used to transfect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells, which were adapted to serum-free conditions using HyQSFX-insect serum-free cell culture medium (Progen, Ipswich, Queensland, Australia). Three days after transfection, culture supernatant was collected and analyzed for secreted recombinant protein by Western blot. 15 μl of supernatant was added to 5 μl of 4× nonreducing or 4× reducing sample buffer, and 20-μl samples were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously. Blots were probed with K2.254 or anti-Tetra-His monoclonal antibody (1:1000), with anti-human Factor H monoclonal antibody (1:1000) as a negative control. The secondary antibody was rabbit anti-mouse-HRP. Recombinant virus was isolated from culture medium 3 days post-transfection, and viral stocks were established. For purification of recombinant protein, 1 × 106 High Five cells in 50 ml of HyQ medium were infected with purified recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Three days after infection, recombinant protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography as described previously (8Kuhn S. Zipfel P.F. Gene. 1995; 162: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western blot. Recombinant FHR-5 or Factor H (Sigma) were serially diluted 1:2 in 0.1m carbonate buffer, pH 9.3. Duplicate wells in microtiter plates were incubated with dilutions of FHR-5 or Factor H from 50 to 0.4 pmol/well. The plates were blocked, and wells were incubated with human C3b (purified as described previously (9Dodds A.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 46-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)), C5b-6 (purified as described (10Murphy B.F. Saunders J.R. O'Bryan M.K. Kirszbaum L. Walker I.D. d'Apice A.J. Int. Immunol. 1989; 1: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)), or HSA (Sigma) at 10 μg/well. C3b was detected by incubation with polyclonal rabbit anti-C3 antibody (1:1000 dilution) followed by peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000 dilution). C5b-6 and HSA were detected using K1.115 (anti-C6) and anti-HSA monoclonal antibodies, respectively (1:500 dilution), followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:2000 dilution). The ELISAs were developed with O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma). The reaction was stopped with 4 mH2S04, and the optical density of the solution was measured at a wavelength of 492 nm using a Behring EL311 microplate reader. Monoclonal antibody K2.254 did not react with the surface of unsensitized K562 cells, K562 cells exposed to anti-K562 antibody and heat-inactivated human serum, or unsensitized K562 cells exposed to fresh human serum. After exposure to both anti-K562 antibody and fresh human serum, however, the cells showed morphological evidence of complement damage and strong cell surface staining for the K2.254 antigen. Similar surface labeling with K2.254 monoclonal antibody was seen when cells were incubated with human sera deficient in C9, C8, or C7 (Table II). The surface staining was similar to that seen using the positive control anti-C9 antibody (K2.322). No staining was detected with the isotype-matched antibody (K1.431). When fresh human serum was substituted with guinea pig or rabbit serum, there was morphological damage to the K562 cells but no cell surface reactivity with K2.254 (Table II).Table IIBinding of K2.254 mAb to complement-exposed cellsTreatmentK2.254 bindingAnti-K562 (sensitized)Serum−−−−NHS−+NHS++++HI NHS−+C9-depleted NHS++++C8-depleted NHS++++C7-depleted NHS++++Guinea pig−+Rabbit−K562 cells were sensitized with anti-K562 antibody as indicated and then incubated with normal human serum (NHS), heat inactivated (HI) NHS, C9-, C8-, or C7-depleted NHS, or guinea pig or rabbit sera.

Open table in a new tab K562 cells were sensitized with anti-K562 antibody as indicated and then incubated with normal human serum (NHS), heat inactivated (HI) NHS, C9-, C8-, or C7-depleted NHS, or guinea pig or rabbit sera. K2.254 reactivity on cell surfaces was examined by epifluorescence microscopy and semiquantitatively scored. These data suggest that the epitope for K2.254 was expressed on an antigen derived from human serum upon activation of complement. The detection of the antigen in cells incubated with C7-deficient serum indicated that the antigen associates with the cell prior to assembly of the terminal attack complex of complement. Western blotting of NHS-lysed GPE with K2.254 identified a band of ∼65 kDa under nonreducing conditions (lane 1, Fig. 1). This band was not observed in control osmotically lysed GPE (lane 2, Fig. 1). Blotting of NHS failed to reveal specific binding of K2.254 (lane 3, Fig. 1), even after inulin pretreatment (2Murphy B.F. Kirszbaum L. Walker I.D. d'Apice A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1858-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) to activate complement. However, the 65-kDa band was observed in Western blots of the column eluate following affinity purification from NHS using a K2.254 affinity column (lane 5, Fig. 1). K2.254 did not detect a band in any preparations under reducing conditions, suggesting that the K2.254 epitope is sensitive to reduction. In additional Western blotting studies, using purified human Factor H (Sigma), the K2.254 antibody showed no cross reactivity with Factor H. 2J. L. McRae, unpublished data. The 65-kDa K2.254 antigen, affinity-purified from NHS, was heavily contaminated by albumin. Therefore, complement-lysed GPE were used to purify sufficient protein for peptide sequencing. Digitonin-extracted GPE ghosts were passed through a K2.254 affinity column, and the eluate was analyzed by Western blotting. The 65-kDa K2.254 antigen was detected (lane 2, Fig.2), but the eluate also contained C9 (lane 1, Fig. 2) and human serum albumin (HSA,lane 3, Fig. 2), although the amount of albumin was markedly less than that in preparations affinity-purified from NHS. Separation from HSA and C9 was achieved by reverse-phase HPLC. Fractions containing material reactive with K2.254 but not anti-human C9 or anti-HSA antibodies were pooled, lyophilized, and used for peptide sequencing. After in-gel proteolysis and HPLC separation of peptides, the sequence of 13 purified peptides was obtained. The majority of peptides showed some homology with members of the Factor H family of proteins (11Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 121-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).

Peptides H1114 and H1121 showed no significant homology to the FH family of proteins. Open table in a new tab The majority of the peptides displayed homology with human FH, whereas peptides H1118, H1119, and H1120 were most closely related to the FHR-1 and FHR-2. Peptides H1114 and H1121 showed no significant homology to the FH family of proteins. Alignment of the peptides with human Factor H was used to design primers for cDNA isolation. Human liver was chosen as the source of RNA, because members of the Factor H gene family are expressed in liver. Degenerate primers, 254-F1 and 254-R1, were used to amplify a 709-bp product. Sequencing of this PCR product revealed an incomplete ORF encoding a protein with 55.5% identity to amino acids 549–785 of human Factor H. The deduced protein sequence contained perfect matches with peptides H1113, H1114, H1116, and H1117 (Table III). Because the new protein was similar but not identical to Factor H and was distinct from Factor H-related proteins 1–4, it was designated Factor H-related protein 5 (FHR-5). We then performed 3′- and 5′-RACE, which yielded 1072- and 2248-bp products, respectively. Sequencing of these clones enabled the amplification of a single full-length FHR-5 cDNA from liver RNA. Fig. 3 shows the position and overlap of these clones to produce the 2823-bp cDNA. To minimize the possibility of PCR-generated errors, the sequence of both strands was obtained from clones generated from at least two independent PCRs. The complete FHR-5 cDNA sequence and deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 4 (GenBank™ data base accession number AF295327). There was an ORF from bases 94 to 1800, with the region of the start codon displaying good agreement with the Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation (12Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar). The ORF encoded an 18-amino acid signal sequence and a mature protein of 551 amino acids. The ORF was followed by 1000 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence, including a consensus polyadenylation signal at positions 2705–2710 and a poly(A)+ tail. Mature FHR-5 has a predicted molecular mass (nonglycosylated) of ∼62,405 Da, and two potential N-linked glycosylation sites at positions 108 and 382 (Fig. 4). There are nine short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, each containing the four characteristic cysteine (C) residues (boxed in Fig.5) and additional conserved amino acids (aligned in Fig. 5). All of the peptide fragments isolated could be assigned to the mature protein. SCRs of FHR-5 display varying homology to members of the Factor H family (Fig. 6). SCRs 1 and 2 of FHR-5 show greatest homology to SCRs 1 and 2 of FHR-1 (X56210) and FHR-2 (X86564–X86565). SCRs 3–7 display homology to SCRs 10–14 of Factor H (Y00716) and SCRs 8 and 9 display homology to the two C-terminal SCRs of Factor H and all FHR proteins (FHR-3, X68679; FHR-4, NM006684). A Northern blot of human liver RNA was probed with the 709-bp FHR-5 PCR fragment (Fig. 3). The 709-bp fragment hybridized to a single mRNA species with an estimated size of 3.0-kb (lane 1, Fig. 7). When the same blot was reprobed with a full-length FHR-5 probe, the 3.0-kb band was the predominant transcript observed (lane 2, Fig.7), with a minor band at 4.4 kb and a diffuse band at 1.4 kb, the latter probably representing transcripts of the FHR proteins 2–4 (13Estaller C.

We identified glutathione sulfonic acid, glutathione disulfideS-oxide (GS(O)SG), glutathione disulfideS-dioxide, and GSSG as the major decomposition products of GSNO. Each of these compounds and GSNO were tested for their efficacies to modify rat brain neurogranin/RC3 (Ng) and neuromodulin/GAP-43 (Nm). Among them, GS(O)SG was found to be the most potent in causing glutathiolation of both proteins; four glutathiones were incorporated into the four Cys residues of Ng, and two were incorporated into the two Cys residues of Nm. Ng and Nm are two in vivo substrates of protein kinase C; their phosphorylations by protein kinase C attenuate the binding affinities of both proteins for calmodulin. When compared with their respective unmodified forms, the glutathiolated Ng was a poorer substrate and glutathiolated Nm a better substrate for protein kinase C. Glutathiolation of these two proteins caused no change in their binding affinities for calmodulin. Treatment of [35S]cysteine-labeled rat brain slices with xanthine/xanthine oxidase or a combination of xanthine/xanthine oxidase with sodium nitroprusside resulted in an increase in cellular level of GS(O)SG. These treatments, as well as those by other oxidants, all resulted in an increase in thiolation of proteins; among them, thiolation of Ng was positively identified by immunoprecipitation.

Indeed, the reactions involving GSNO are fairly complex and generate many potential products including ammonia, NO, nitrous oxide, nitrite, sulfinamide, hydroxylamine, and several oxidized forms of glutathione (20Wong P.S.-Y.

It was suggested that glutathione sulfenic acid was the active component for glutathiolation of proteins.Neurogranin/RC3 (Ng) and neuromodulin/GAP-43 (Nm) are two prominent PKC substrates in the brain. Phoshorylations of both Ng and Nm reduce their binding affinities for calmodulin (CaM) (27Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol.

Rat brain Ng contains four, and Nm contains two Cys residues; these Cys residues in Ng form two pairs of intramolecular disulfides upon oxidation by NO and other oxidants (29Sheu F.-S. Mahoney C.W.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Intramolecular disulfide formation renders Ng a poorer substrate of PKC and also reduces its binding affinity for CaM (29Sheu F.-S. Mahoney C.W. Seki K. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22407-22413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The effect of oxidation of the two Cys residues of Nm has not been elucidated. However, it was shown that treatment of cultured dorsal root ganglion and PC-12 cells with 3-morpholino-sydononimine, which generates both NO and superoxide, inhibited palmitoylation of Nm (32Hess D.T. Patterson S.I. Smith D.S. Skene J.H.P. Nature. 1993; 366: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that treatment of Ng with GSNO caused oxidation to form intramolecular disulfides, as well as glutathiolation; the extent of glutathiolation was greatly increased upon incubation of Ng with the decomposed GSNO (33Huang K.-P. Huang F.L. Li J. Schuck P. McPhie P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7291-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, by using mass spectrometry, we have identified several glutathione derivatives as the degradation products of GSNO, including glutathione sulfonic acid (GSO3H), glutathione disulfide S-oxide (GS(O)SG), glutathione disulfideS-dioxide (GS(O)2SG), and GSSG. Among them, GS(O)SG was the most potent in causing glutathiolation of Ng and Nm. The level of this compound was found to increase upon treatment of rat brain slices with oxidants. Ng had been positively identified as a target of thiolation under oxidative stress.DISCUSSIONWhile testing the effect of GSNO on the oxidation of Ng to form intramolecular disulfide, we found that the freshly prepared GSNO was effective in this modification, but a partially decomposed GSNO was more effective in causing glutathiolation (33Huang K.-P. Huang F.L. Li J. Schuck P. McPhie P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7291-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Analysis of the decomposition products of GSNO led us to identify GS(O)SG as one of the most potent glutathiolating agents among the various glutathione derivatives tested, including GSO3H, GS(O)2SG, GSNO, and GSSG (Fig. 3). Although these latter compounds can oxidize Ng to form intramolecular disulfide bonds, they are not very effective for glutathiolation of this protein. Glutathiolation of protein by GS(O)SG likely proceeds by the following reactions,R1­SH+GS(O)SG→R1­S­SG+GSOHREACTION1R2­SH+GSOH→R2­S­SG+H2OREACTION2where R1 and R2 are either protein or any sulfhydryl-containing compound. Modification of proteins containing multiple sulfhydryl groups, such as Ng, by GS(O)SG is complicated by two competing reactions, namely, formation of intramolecular disulfide and glutathiolation. Partially glutathiolated Ng can be driven to form intramolecular disulfide, but the intramolecular disulfide form of Ng cannot be glutathiolated. Thus, at a low GS(O)SG concentration Ng forms intramolecular disulfide, and at a high concentration Ng is glutathiolated. When the ratio of GS(O)SG/–SH is equal or greater than one, both Ng and Nm are stoichiometrically glutathiolated.Protein S-thiolation, especiallyS-glutathiolation, has been recognized as one of the physiological responses to nitrosative and oxidative stresses. The mechanism by which these stresses induce proteinS-thiolation is poorly understood. Several mechanisms have been proposed for protein glutathiolation including the following: 1) thiol-disulfide exchange between protein thiols and GSSG (38Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar); 2) oxidation of protein thiols by oxy-radicals or H2O2 to form thiyl radicals or sulfenic acids and then to interact with GSH to produce mixed disulfide (39Park E.-M. Thomas J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 964: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); 3) nucleophilic attack of protein thiolate on GSNO to produce mixed disulfide (9Padgett C.M. Whorton A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Ji Y. Akerboom T.P.M. Sies H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13574-13583Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); 4) oxidation of GSH to form sulfenic acid and then interact with protein thiols to form mixed disulfides (10Ji Y. Akerboom T.P.M. Sies H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); and 5) nitrosation of protein thiols followed by interaction with GSH to form mixed disulfides (9Padgett C.M. Whorton A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Ji Y. Akerboom T.P.M. Sies H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The present study suggests another mechanism that utilizes GS(O)SG as a potential GS– donor for protein glutathiolation. GS(O)SG is more potent than GSNO in glutathiolation of protein, and this degradation product of GSNO may account for some of the effects of GSNO. GS(O)SG is present at a low level in the control rat brain slices labeled with [35S]cysteine and is increased under oxidative stress. GS(O)SG and GS(O)2SG have been shown to be the major products generated by oxidation of GSH with H2O2 (40Finley J.W. Wheeler E.L. Witt S.C. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1981; 29: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We also showed that GS(O)SG could be formed by oxidation of both GSH and GSSG with NO (data not shown). Although GSSG can be reduced by glutathione reductase to form GSH, it is unknown whether GS(O)SG and GS(O2)SG are also substrates of the reductase. Accumulation of GS(O)SG under basal physiological conditions could provide tonic glutathiolation of certain proteins that employ this modification mechanism for regulation of their activities or subcellular localization.Thiolation of Ng has been positively identified by immunoprecipitation of the [35S]cysteine-labeled rat brain cortical slices, whereas thiolation of Nm was not detected under the same conditions. The two Cys residues of Nm are the potential sites of palmitoylation, which is involved in the association of this protein with the membrane (31Skene J.H.P. Virág I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It is apparent that the acylated Nm cannot be thiolated. Under the basal conditions, in which the slices were incubated with ACSF without added oxidants, Ng was thiolated to a lower level as compared with those treated with oxidants. In addition, Ng also subjected to oxidation to form intramolecular disulfides in the presence of the oxidants. These findings indicate that Ng can undergo multiple oxidative modifications at its Cys residues. The nature of thiolation of Ng in the brain slices has not been determined; we do not know whether it is because of glutathiolation or mixed disulfides between Ng and Cys. It is interesting to note that both oxidation of Ng to form intramolecular disulfides and glutathiolation convert this protein to become a poorer substrate of PKC by reducing theV max value (see Table I and Ref. 29Sheu F.-S. Mahoney C.W. Seki K. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22407-22413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); however, the former modification, but not the latter, also causes a reduction in the binding affinity of Ng toward CaM. Because the partially thiolated Ng can be converted into the intramolecular disulfide form of Ng, one may consider thiolation as an intermediate step toward intramolecular disulfide formation. Thus, oxidative stress may cause these two modifications of Ng and result in an attenuation of Ng phosphorylation by PKC.In summary, the current study provides evidence that GS(O)SG derived from GSNO is one of the most potent glutathiolating agents known so far. This compound can be easily prepared from the decomposed GSNO, by bubbling GSH or GSSG solution with NO gas, or by treatment of GSH with H2O2. GS(O)SG is relatively stable upon storage but is very reactive toward sulfhydryl group. GS(O)SG apparently is generated in situ following oxidative stress and may be responsible for the glutathiolation of proteins in vivo. Here, we have also demonstrated that Ng is thiolated in rat brain slices and that the extent of thiolation is enhanced under oxidative stress. Protein S-glutathiolation can be induced in cells by mild oxidative stress (1Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). GSSG has been shown to oxidatively regulate the activity of several purified enzymes including carbonic anhydrase III (2Cabiscol E. Levine R.L. J. Biol.

Patterson S.I. Smith D.S. Skene J.H.P. Nature. 1993; 366: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that treatment of Ng with GSNO caused oxidation to form intramolecular disulfides, as well as glutathiolation; the extent of glutathiolation was greatly increased upon incubation of Ng with the decomposed GSNO (33Huang K.-P. Huang F.L. Li J. Schuck P. McPhie P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7291-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, by using mass spectrometry, we have identified several glutathione derivatives as the degradation products of GSNO, including glutathione sulfonic acid (GSO3H), glutathione disulfide S-oxide (GS(O)SG), glutathione disulfideS-dioxide (GS(O)2SG), and GSSG. Among them, GS(O)SG was the most potent in causing glutathiolation of Ng and Nm. The level of this compound was found to increase upon treatment of rat brain slices with oxidants. Ng had been positively identified as a target of thiolation under oxidative stress. DISCUSSIONWhile testing the effect of GSNO on the oxidation of Ng to form intramolecular disulfide, we found that the freshly prepared GSNO was effective in this modification, but a partially decomposed GSNO was more effective in causing glutathiolation (33Huang K.-P. Huang F.L. Li J. Schuck P. McPhie P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7291-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Analysis of the decomposition products of GSNO led us to identify GS(O)SG as one of the most potent glutathiolating agents among the various glutathione derivatives tested, including GSO3H, GS(O)2SG, GSNO, and GSSG (Fig. 3). Although these latter compounds can oxidize Ng to form intramolecular disulfide bonds, they are not very effective for glutathiolation of this protein. Glutathiolation of protein by GS(O)SG likely proceeds by the following reactions,R1­SH+GS(O)SG→R1­S­SG+GSOHREACTION1R2­SH+GSOH→R2­S­SG+H2OREACTION2where R1 and R2 are either protein or any sulfhydryl-containing compound. Modification of proteins containing multiple sulfhydryl groups, such as Ng, by GS(O)SG is complicated by two competing reactions, namely, formation of intramolecular disulfide and glutathiolation. Partially glutathiolated Ng can be driven to form intramolecular disulfide, but the intramolecular disulfide form of Ng cannot be glutathiolated. Thus, at a low GS(O)SG concentration Ng forms intramolecular disulfide, and at a high concentration Ng is glutathiolated. When the ratio of GS(O)SG/–SH is equal or greater than one, both Ng and Nm are stoichiometrically glutathiolated.Protein S-thiolation, especiallyS-glutathiolation, has been recognized as one of the physiological responses to nitrosative and oxidative stresses. The mechanism by which these stresses induce proteinS-thiolation is poorly understood. Several mechanisms have been proposed for protein glutathiolation including the following: 1) thiol-disulfide exchange between protein thiols and GSSG (38Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar); 2) oxidation of protein thiols by oxy-radicals or H2O2 to form thiyl radicals or sulfenic acids and then to interact with GSH to produce mixed disulfide (39Park E.-M. Thomas J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 964: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); 3) nucleophilic attack of protein thiolate on GSNO to produce mixed disulfide (9Padgett C.M.

Akerboom T.P.M. Sies H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); and 5) nitrosation of protein thiols followed by interaction with GSH to form mixed disulfides (9Padgett C.M. Whorton A.R. Arch.

Biophys. 1999; 362: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The present study suggests another mechanism that utilizes GS(O)SG as a potential GS– donor for protein glutathiolation. GS(O)SG is more potent than GSNO in glutathiolation of protein, and this degradation product of GSNO may account for some of the effects of GSNO. GS(O)SG is present at a low level in the control rat brain slices labeled with [35S]cysteine and is increased under oxidative stress. GS(O)SG and GS(O)2SG have been shown to be the major products generated by oxidation of GSH with H2O2 (40Finley J.W. Wheeler E.L. Witt S.C. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1981; 29: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We also showed that GS(O)SG could be formed by oxidation of both GSH and GSSG with NO (data not shown). Although GSSG can be reduced by glutathione reductase to form GSH, it is unknown whether GS(O)SG and GS(O2)SG are also substrates of the reductase. Accumulation of GS(O)SG under basal physiological conditions could provide tonic glutathiolation of certain proteins that employ this modification mechanism for regulation of their activities or subcellular localization.Thiolation of Ng has been positively identified by immunoprecipitation of the [35S]cysteine-labeled rat brain cortical slices, whereas thiolation of Nm was not detected under the same conditions. The two Cys residues of Nm are the potential sites of palmitoylation, which is involved in the association of this protein with the membrane (31Skene J.H.P. Virág I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It is apparent that the acylated Nm cannot be thiolated. Under the basal conditions, in which the slices were incubated with ACSF without added oxidants, Ng was thiolated to a lower level as compared with those treated with oxidants. In addition, Ng also subjected to oxidation to form intramolecular disulfides in the presence of the oxidants. These findings indicate that Ng can undergo multiple oxidative modifications at its Cys residues. The nature of thiolation of Ng in the brain slices has not been determined; we do not know whether it is because of glutathiolation or mixed disulfides between Ng and Cys. It is interesting to note that both oxidation of Ng to form intramolecular disulfides and glutathiolation convert this protein to become a poorer substrate of PKC by reducing theV max value (see Table I and Ref. 29Sheu F.-S. Mahoney C.W. Seki K. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22407-22413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); however, the former modification, but not the latter, also causes a reduction in the binding affinity of Ng toward CaM. Because the partially thiolated Ng can be converted into the intramolecular disulfide form of Ng, one may consider thiolation as an intermediate step toward intramolecular disulfide formation. Thus, oxidative stress may cause these two modifications of Ng and result in an attenuation of Ng phosphorylation by PKC.In summary, the current study provides evidence that GS(O)SG derived from GSNO is one of the most potent glutathiolating agents known so far. This compound can be easily prepared from the decomposed GSNO, by bubbling GSH or GSSG solution with NO gas, or by treatment of GSH with H2O2. GS(O)SG is relatively stable upon storage but is very reactive toward sulfhydryl group. GS(O)SG apparently is generated in situ following oxidative stress and may be responsible for the glutathiolation of proteins in vivo. Here, we have also demonstrated that Ng is thiolated in rat brain slices and that the extent of thiolation is enhanced under oxidative stress. While testing the effect of GSNO on the oxidation of Ng to form intramolecular disulfide, we found that the freshly prepared GSNO was effective in this modification, but a partially decomposed GSNO was more effective in causing glutathiolation (33Huang K.-P.

https://openalex.org/W2018654805,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) constitute a large family of heparin-binding growth factors with diverse biological activities. FGF9 was originally described as glia-activating factor and is expressed in the nervous system as a potent mitogen for glia cells. Unlike most FGFs, FGF9 forms dimers in solution with a K d of 680 nm. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of FGF9 dimerization, the crystal structure of FGF9 was determined at 2.2 Å resolution. FGF9 adopts a β-trefoil fold similar to other FGFs. However, unlike other FGFs, the N- and C-terminal regions outside the β-trefoil core in FGF9 are ordered and involved in the formation of a 2-fold crystallographic dimer. A significant surface area (>2000 Å2) is buried in the dimer interface that occludes a major receptor binding site of FGF9. Thus, we propose an autoinhibitory mechanism for FGF9 that is dependent on sequences outside of the β-trefoil core. Moreover, a model is presented providing a molecular basis for the preferential affinity of FGF9 toward FGFR3.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), have revealed a common core FGF structure consisting of three copies of a four-stranded β-sheet, known as a β-trefoil fold. All FGFs contain N- and C-terminal segments outside the β-trefoil core. However, the length of these segments, especially the C termini, varies greatly among different FGFs. In FGF1, FGF2, FGF4, and FGF7, the end of polypeptide chain virtually coincides with the end of the β-trefoil fold. Consequently, these FGFs have extremely short C-terminal segments. In contrast, other FGFs, such as FGF3, FGF5, and FGF8, have long C-terminal extensions. The functional relevance of these N- and C-terminal extensions remains uncharacterized. FGF9 (glia-activating factor) was purified as a heparin-binding, secreted glycoprotein from cultured human glioma cell line NMC-G1 (11Naruo K. Seko C. Kuroshima K. Matsutani E. Sasada R. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2857-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FGF9 shows 30% sequence identity with the prototypical FGF family members, FGF1 and FGF2 (12Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 7: 4251-4259Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Purified FGF9 is mitogenic for many types of cultured cells including glia cells, oligodendrocyte type 2 astrocyte progenitor cells, smooth muscle cells, pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, and BALB/3T3 fibroblasts (11Naruo K. Seko C. Kuroshima K. Matsutani E. Sasada R. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2857-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because FGF9, unlike FGF1 and FGF2, has no effect on human umbilical vein endothelial cells, it is suggested that FGF9 may have a unique receptor specificity (11Naruo K. Seko C. Kuroshima K. Matsutani E. Sasada R. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2857-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, biochemical studies performed utilizing various soluble FGFR-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins and genetically engineered cells expressing different full-length FGFRs have demonstrated that FGF9 binds preferentially to the IIIc form of FGFR3 (13Santos-Ocampo S.

Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). FGF9, like prototypical FGFs, does not have a typical secretory signal peptide. Yet, it is still glycosylated and efficiently secreted from transfected mammalian cells (12Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 7: 4251-4259Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of secreted FGF9 shows that it is missing only the initiation methionine (12Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 7: 4251-4259Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 16Song J. Slack J.M. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that FGF9 secretion is mediated via a noncleaved signal sequence consisting of the first 33 residues (17Matsumoto-Yoshitomi S. Habashita J. Nomura C. Kuroshima K. Kurokawa T. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Revest J.M. DeMoerlooze L. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have expressed and purified truncated FGF9 (residues 35–208) inEscherichia coli and observed that it dimerizes in solution. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of FGF9 dimerization, the crystal structure of FGF9 was determined. In the crystal, FGF9 forms a 2-fold dimer in which a large surface area is buried. This suggests that the dimer observed in the crystal structure also represents the dimeric FGF9 species detected in solution. Analysis of the dimer interface reveals interactions between the N- and C-terminal segments outside of the β-trefoil core of each FGF9 protomer that are the driving force for dimer formation. Interestingly, a major FGFR binding site becomes occluded upon dimer formation. Thus, we propose that FGF9 regions outside the β-trefoil core have an autoinhibitory role in FGF9 function. Furthermore, our modeling studies afford a structural basis for the preferential affinity of FGF9 toward FGFR3 and for its specific heparin requirement. DNA fragments generated by polymerase chain reaction of human FGF9 cDNA (encoding for residues 35–208) were subcloned into the pET-28a bacterial expression vector using Nco I and Hin dIII cloning sites. Following transformation of the BL21 (DE3) bacterial strain, cells containing the FGF9-expression plasmid were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. The bacteria were then centrifuged and subsequently lysed in a 25 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm EDTA using a French press. FGF9 was found mainly in the soluble fraction and precipitated with saturated ammonium sulfate solution (final concentration, 50%) overnight at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in a HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1m ammonium sulfate, centrifuged and diluted 1:5 prior to loading onto a Source S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound FGF9 was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl to 1 m in a 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) buffer. Subsequent purification of FGF9 was achieved by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with a 25 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1.5 mNaCl. Mass spectrometry of purified FGF9 confirmed the predicted molecular mass of 20,169 daltons for FGF9. Crystals of FGF9 were grown by vapor diffusion at 20 °C using the hanging drop method. 2 μl of protein solution (1.4 mg/ml in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) were mixed with 8 μl of various crystallization buffer conditions of Crystal Screen kits (Hampton Research). Condition 48 (kit I) (2 m ammonium phosphate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) produced diffraction quality crystals. FGF9 crystals belong to the tetragonal space group I4122 with unit cell dimensions a =b = 87.82 Å, c = 115.64 Å. There is one molecule of FGF9 in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of ∼56%. Diffraction data were collected from a flash frozen (in a dry nitrogen stream using mother liquor containing 20% glycerol as cryo-protectant) crystal on a CCD detector at beamline X4A at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). A molecular replacement solution was found for one copy of FGF9 in the asymmetric unit using the program AmoRe (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Simulated annealing and positional/B factor refinement were performed using CNS (21Bruenger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nigles M.

Bulk solvent and anisotropic B factor corrections were applied. Model building into 2F o −F c and F o −F c electron density maps was performed with program O (22Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The atomic model contains residues 52–208 of FGF9, two phosphate ions, and 68 water molecules. The average B factor is 18.5 Å2 for FGF9 molecule, 56.0 Å2 for phosphate ions, and 24.0 Å2 for water molecules. Mass spectral analysis of FGF9 was completed by diluting 1:10 of an aqueous 10 μm stock solution of FGF9 with a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 30% acetonitrile. The sample was spotted on a seeded surface and dried under a stream of nitrogen (23Xiang F. Beavis R.C. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 8: 199-204Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). MALDI-MS were acquired in the linear mode using delayed extraction with a Voyager Elite reflectron time-of-flight instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) with a 337-nm laser. Spectra were acquired using instrument settings described previously (24Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Davis J.C. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1892-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mass spectra were calibrated externally with myoglobin and bovine serum albumin. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments employed an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Samples (in 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1.5 m NaCl) were loaded into six-channel epon charcoal-filled centerpieces, using quartz windows. Experiments were performed at 20 °C, detecting at 235 and 278 nm, using four different speeds (12,000, 18,000, 24,000, and 30,000 rpm.). The program SEDNTERP was used to estimate the solvent density (1.062 g/ml) from its components and the partial specific volume of FGF9 (0.732 ml/g) from its amino acid composition (25Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. in Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Experiments were performed with a range of FGF9 concentrations ranging from 1.6 to 26 μm at the speeds mentioned above. The Optima XL-A Data Analysis Software package (Beckman/MicroCal) was used for global fits of the data to self-association models using nine data sets with 278 nm detection and (independently) nine data sets with 235 nm detection. Identical results were obtained for each group of nine data sets. Reasonable global fits to the data could be obtained only with a simple dimerization model, as discussed under “Results and Discussion.” Goodness of fit was judged by the occurrence of small, randomly distributed, residuals for the fits, as shown in Fig.2 B. The first 33 N-terminal residues of FGF9 were deleted because they are implicated only in secretion and not FGFR binding (17Matsumoto-Yoshitomi S. Habashita J. Nomura C. Kuroshima K. Kurokawa T. Int.

Hybridoma. 1996; 15: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Truncated FGF9 (residues 35–208) was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (see “Experimental Procedures”). Crystallization trials with FGF9 produced tetragonal crystals with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The crystal structure of FGF9 was solved by molecular replacement (see “Experimental Procedures”) and refined at 2.2 Å resolution with an R value of 20.7% (free R value of 23.1%). The atomic model for FGF9 consists of one FGF9 molecule (residues 52–208), two phosphate ions, and 68 water molecules.

Open table in a new tab As anticipated on the basis of sequence alignment, FGF9 adopts a β-trefoil fold (Fig.1). Superimposition of the Cα traces located within the β-trefoil core of FGF9 with those belonging to FGF1 and FGF2 gives a root-mean-square deviation of only 1.0 and 0.73 Å, respectively. Within the β-trefoil core, the major differences between the FGF9 structure and the structures of FGF1 and FGF2 are the β1-β2 and β9-β10 loop conformations. These loops vary both in length and sequence among the various members of the FGF family. In FGF9, the β1-β2 loop is one residue shorter than the corresponding loops of FGF1 and FGF2. In contrast, the β9-β10 loop in FGF9 is longer by 4 and 6 residues than the corresponding loop in FGF1 and FGF2, respectively. This loop bulges out from the main β-trefoil body of FGF9. Two ordered phosphate ions are coordinated in the FGF9 structure; one is bound to the high affinity heparin-binding site at a position similar to where sulfate ions/groups bind ligand in the structures of free or heparin-bound FGF1 (27Zhu X. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Structure. 1993; 1: 27-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A.

Sci. 1991; 88: 3441-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 9Zhang J.D. Cousens L.S. Barr P.J. Sprang S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The other phosphate ion is bound by FGF9 residues, whose homologues in FGF1 and FGF2 have not been implicated in sulfate ion coordination. The most striking structural differences between FGF9 and the prototypical FGFs are the conformations of the N- and C-terminal regions outside of the β-trefoil core. In the crystal structures of free FGF1 and FGF2, the region preceding the β-trefoil core is disordered. However, in the FGF9 structure, part of this region is ordered and forms an α helix (αN) (Fig. 1). Additionally, the entire C-terminal tail following the β-trefoil core is also ordered and contains a short helix (αC) (Fig. 1). The C-terminal region is considerably longer in FGF9 (17 residues) than the C-terminal regions of FGF1 (4 residues), and FGF2 (3 residues). Several interhelical interactions between the αN and αC helices contribute to the ordering of the N- and C-terminal segments in FGF9. As shown in Fig.2 A, the elution position of FGF9 on the size exclusion chromatography column is dependent on the concentration at which it is loaded. When loaded at 2 mg/ml (100 μm), FGF9 elutes at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼40 kDa, indicating that FGF9 forms dimers. By contrast, when loaded at a concentration of 8 μg/ml (0.4 μm), FGF9 elutes at 32 ml, consistent with its monomeric molecular mass (20 kDa). When concentrations between 8 μg/ml and 2 mg/ml are loaded, the elution position of FGF9 is intermediate, suggesting that FGF9 reversibly dimerizes with a K din the micromolar range. This was confirmed quantitatively by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation studies (Fig.2 B), which showed that FGF9 dimerizes with aK d of 680 nm. Sedimentation of FGF9 was analyzed for a series of solutions at concentrations from 1.6 to 26 μm, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Attempts to fit the data to a single species suggested that FGF9 self-associates, and only a simple dimerization model could be fitted globally to multiple data sets collected at different concentrations and speeds. The global fit to the data shown in Fig. 2 B represents a model in which FGF9 dimerizes with a K dof 680 nm. As seen above each graph, the residuals for this fit are small and random for each individual data set. Additional verification of the ability of FGF9 to dimerize was achieved using MALDI-MS under conditions that do not interfere with protein-protein interactions (30Moniatte M. Lesieur C.

J. Mass. Spectrom. 1998; 33: 1088-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Using sinapinic acid as the matrix, two FGF9 species are detected, with molecular masses of 20 and 40 kDa (Fig. 2 C). Use of other matrix conditions, including ferulic acid in tetrahydrofuran and 6-aza-2-thiothymine in ammonium acetate, confirms that the dimer observed in the mass spectrum is not simply an artifact of MALDI-MS sample preparation (data not shown) and provides further support for FGF9 dimerization in solution. Information regarding possible structural modes of FGF9 dimerization can be gained by close inspection of the FGF9 crystal structure. Analysis of the symmetry mates in the crystal reveals a 2-fold crystallographic dimer that is particularly intimate (Fig.3). The large buried surface area (2260 Å2) in the interface between molecules in this dimer is compatible with our measured dissociation constant of 680 nm, suggesting that this is the dimer that occurs in solution. The dimer interface can be analyzed as the sum of two interfaces: an interface outside the β-trefoil core (Fig.4 A) and an interface inside the β-trefoil core (Fig. 4 B). The interface outside the β-trefoil involves the αN and αC helices as well as the respective loops that connect them to the main β-trefoil body. At this interface, the aliphatic side chains of Leu-54, Ile-60, Leu-61, Leu-200, and Ile-204 from one FGF9 protomer are in hydrophobic contact with the corresponding residues of the other protomer (Fig.4 A). A number of hydrogen bonds further strengthen this interface. Sequence alignment of FGFs shows that most of the residues that participate in this interface are conserved in FGF16, suggesting that FGF16 may also dimerize in solution (Fig.5). Analogous residues in the remaining FGFs are divergent, implying that dimerization of these ligands by a similar mechanism is not likely.Figure 5Structure-based sequence alignment of FGFs. Sequence alignment was performed using the CLUSTALW (41Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). All of the FGFs used in this alignment are human. The location and the length of the β strands and α helices are shown on thetop of the sequence alignment. A period indicates sequence identity to FGF9. A dash represents a gap introduced to optimize the alignment. FGF9 residues that participate in dimerization are colored red. In blue are FGF9 residues that constitute the conventional low and high affinity heparin binding sites. FGF9 residues that localize to the periphery of the high affinity heparin-binding site and are predicted to form the distal and central heparin binding sites are colored green andyellow, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The portion of the dimer interface inside the β-trefoil core involves the β1 and β12 strands as well as the β8-β9 loop (Fig.4 B). Several hydrogen bonds fortify hydrophobic contacts that are made at this interface (Fig. 4 B). Surprisingly, several FGF9 residues that participate in this interface are also predicted to interact with Ig-like domain 2 (D2) of FGFR in an FGF9-FGFR complex. As expected, these residues are highly conserved among different FGFs. Still, solution dimers for other FGFs have not been reported, insinuating that these interactions alone are not sufficient to drive FGF dimerization. Therefore, interactions between FGF9 protomers at the dimer interface outside the β-trefoil core are essential in promoting FGF9 dimerization. These interactions must facilitate the formation of the dimer interface within the β-trefoil core and cooperate with this second interface for dimerization to occur. In the process, critical receptor binding sites appear to become occluded upon dimerization, suggesting that dimerization may serve as a biologically relevant autoinhibitory mechanism. We propose that promotion of dimerization by the N- and C-terminal regions outside the β-trefoil core in FGF9 is responsible for driving occlusion of receptor binding sites in the β-trefoil core. Based on the sequence conservation between FGF9 and FGF16, we propose that a similar autoinhibitory mechanism can be extended to FGF16. Receptor binding studies using C- and N-terminal deletion mutants of FGF9 and FGF16 should further elucidate the importance of these regions. Receptor binding specificity is an essential regulatory element of FGF responses and is achieved through both primary sequence variations and alternative splicing. Comparison of three different FGF-FGFR structures defined a general binding interface for FGF-FGFR complexes that involves contacts made by FGF to D2 and to the linker between D2 and the Ig-like domain 3 (D3) (32Plotnikov A.N. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Mohammadi M. Cell. 2000; 101: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). It was also shown that specificity is achieved through interactions between the FGF N-terminal (immediately preceding the β-trefoil core) and central regions with two loop regions in FGFR D3 that are subject to alternative splicing (32Plotnikov A.N. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Mohammadi M. Cell. 2000; 101: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To provide a molecular basis for the specificity of FGF9 toward FGFR3(IIIc), we superimposed the FGF9 structure onto the FGF2 structure complexed with the ligand binding portion of FGFR1 consisting of D2 and D3 (Fig. 6 A). The majority of the interactions in the FGF-FGFR interface can easily be accommodated with minor adjustments of side chain rotamers. However, analysis of the FGF9-FGFR1 interface identified two critical regions, the β8-β9 loop (within the β-trefoil core) and the αN helix (at the N terminus outside the β-trefoil core), that are sterically clashing with the receptor (colored red in Fig. 6 A). These two regions of FGF9 would require major changes in backbone conformation to allow an engagement with FGFR1 to occur. At the primarily hydrophobic FGF9-D2 interface, three critical FGF9 residues (Tyr-67, Tyr-145, and Leu-188) are highly conserved among different members of the FGF family (Fig. 6 B). In the FGF9-linker interface, Asn-146, also highly conserved among FGFs, is expected to form hydrogen bonds with an FGFR-invariant arginine (Arg-250 in FGFR1) in the D2-D3 linker region. In contrast, FGF9 residues predicted to be in the FGF9-D3 interface show little conservation among FGFs. Close inspection of the FGF9-D3 interface at the βC′-βE loop region in D3 affords a potential explanation for why FGF9 binds preferentially to FGFR3(IIIc) over FGFR1(IIIc). The βC′-βE loops of the two FGFRs differ at two positions. Significantly, the residue corresponding to Val-316 in FGFR1 is an alanine (Ala-313) in FGFR3. In the FGF2-FGFR1 structure, Val-316 makes hydrophobic contacts with Tyr-73, Val-88, and Phe-93 in FGF2. Although Tyr-73 is conserved in all FGFs including FGF9, Leu-130 and Val-135 in FGF9 replace Val-88 and Phe-93 in FGF2 (Fig. 6 B). The larger hydrophobic side chain of Leu-130 in FGF9 clashes sterically with Val-316 in FGFR1, thus reducing the affinity of FGF9 toward FGFR1(IIIc). Conversely, the bulkier Leu-130 side chain would better engage the smaller side chain of Ala-313 in FGFR3(IIIc). Interestingly, two other FGF9 residues (Ile-98 and Ile-100) also fall in the vicinity of Ala-313 in the FGF9-FGFR3 model. The aliphatic side chains of these two residues may provide additional hydrophobic contacts with Ala-313 in FGFR3(IIIc) (Fig. 6 B). Ile-98 and Ile-100 lie in strand β4, whose counterpart in FGF2 was shown to play a critical role in determining ligand-receptor specificity in both FGF2-FGFR1 and FGF2-FGFR2 complexes (32Plotnikov A.N. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Mohammadi M. Cell. 2000; 101: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 33Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The requirement of heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans for FGF-induced FGFR dimerization is well documented (34Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumly G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Both FGFs and FGFRs are known to bind heparin (35Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of a ternary FGF2-FGFR1-heparin complex has provided a mechanistic view of the process by which heparin aids FGFs to induce FGFR dimerization (33Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). According to the proposed “two-end” model, heparin interacts via its nonreducing end with the heparin binding sites of FGF and FGFR and promotes the formation of a ternary 1:1:1 FGF-FGFR-heparin complex. A second ternary 1:1:1 FGF-FGFR-heparin complex is then recruited to the first ternary complex via interactions of FGFR, FGF, and heparin in one ternary complex with the FGFR in the adjoining ternary complex. Within each ternary 1:1:1 FGF-FGFR-heparin complex, heparin makes numerous contacts with the heparin binding residues of FGF and FGFR, thereby increasing the affinity of FGF toward FGFRs. This provides the molecular basis for the well documented heparin-dependent 1:1 FGF-FGFR interaction. In addition heparin also interacts with the heparin binding site of the adjoining FGFR, thereby augmenting the weak interactions of FGF and FGFR in one ternary complex with the FGFR in the adjoining ternary complex. In the absence of heparin, these interactions are not sufficient for sustained dimerization to occur. Based on the model, differences in the primary sequences of heparin binding sites of FGFs and FGFRs will effect heparin-dependent FGF-FGFR binding affinity. Hence, each FGF may require different heparin motifs (sulfation pattern and/or length) to exert their optimal biological activities. To analyze potential heparin binding sites of FGF9, a dimeric model for FGF9-FGFR1 was generated by superimposing two copies of the FGF9 structure onto the two copies of FGF2 in the ternary FGF2-FGFR1-heparin structure. As in the FGF2-FGFR1 structure, calculation of the electrostatic surface potential identifies a positively charged canyon. Two phosphate ions (provided by the crystallization buffer) are bound in the predicted high affinity heparin binding sites of FGF9 (Fig.7 A). Because heparin or heparan sulfate moieties of cell surface proteoglycans are certainly longer than heparin decasaccharides used in the FGF2-FGFR1-heparin crystals (33Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to suggest that natural heparins may interact with FGFs beyond the well characterized low and high affinity heparin binding sites. Indeed, close inspection of surface residues at the periphery of the conventional FGF high affinity site led us to consider two unreported potential sites: one at the very distal end of the canyon and another that is more central to high affinity site. The distal site, composed of Thr-81, Lys-121, and Glu-123, does not coordinate a phosphate ion in the FGF9 structure (Fig. 7 B). However, the crystal structure of FGF42 reveals a sulfate ion bound at this site by side chains of the corresponding FGF4 residues (Arg-103, Lys-142, and Lys-144). Thompson et al.(36Thompson L.D. Pantoliano M.W. Springer B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3831-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), who mutated several surface residues of FGF2 to identify potential heparin binding sites, have provided further evidence for the existence of a distal site. Mutation of Arg-81 in FGF2, which corresponds to Glu-123 in FGF9, was found to cause a 2-fold reduction in heparin binding. In contrast, the “central” site does coordinate a phosphate ion via the side chains of Tyr-163 and Arg-180 (Fig. 7 B). Several other FGF9 residues in the vicinity of this phosphate ion may also interact with heparin (Fig. 7 B). Interestingly, several of these residues, including Tyr-163, are located in the highly divergent β9-β10 loop. Because bound sulfate ions at the high affinity heparin binding site of FGFs often mimic the position of the sulfate groups of heparin in heparin-bound FGFs, it is reasonable to suggest that this central site may indeed constitute a genuine heparin binding site. Confirmation of the aforementioned hypothesis requires structural determination of a ternary FGF9-FGFR3-heparin complex. Given the importance of FGF signaling in numerous biological processes, it is likely that multiple levels of regulation exist to modulate FGF activity. Besides FGF9 and FGF16, several other uncharacterized members of the FGF family such as FGF17, FGF18, and FGF19 contain large N- and C-terminal regions outside the β-trefoil main body. It is possible that these regions may also possess some type of autoregulatory activity. Structural delineation of such regions in FGFs may be particularly significant for the design of FGF mimetics. FGF agonists may be used therapeutically to accelerate wound healing or to induce angiogenesis in pathological conditions such as angina and stroke. We thank C.

https://openalex.org/W2019577333,"Entry into mitosis is regulated by the Cdc2 kinase complexed to B-type cyclins. We and others recently reported that cyclin B1/Cdc2 complexes, which appear to be constitutively cytoplasmic during interphase, actually shuttle continually into and out of the nucleus, with the rate of nuclear export exceeding the import rate (1, 2, 3). At the time of entry into mitosis, the import rate is increased, whereas the export rate is decreased, leading to rapid nuclear accumulation of Cdc2/cyclin B1. Although it has recently been reported that phosphorylation of 4 serines within cyclin B1 promotes the rapid nuclear translocation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 at G2/M, the role that individual phosphorylation sites play in this process has not been examined (3, 4). We report here that phosphorylation of a single serine residue (Ser113 ofXenopus cyclin B1) abrogates nuclear export of cyclin B1. This serine lies directly within the cyclin B1 nuclear export sequence and, when phosphorylated, prevents binding of the nuclear export factor, CRM1. In contrast, analysis of phosphorylation site mutants suggests that coordinate phosphorylation of all 4 serines (94, 96, 101, and 113) is required for the accelerated nuclear import of cyclin B1/Cdc2 characteristic of G2/M. Additionally, binding of cyclin B1 to importin-β, the factor known to be responsible for the slow interphase nuclear entry of cyclin B1, appears to be unaffected by the phosphorylation state of cyclin B. These data suggest that a distinct import factor must be recruited to enhance nuclear entry of Cdc2/cyclin B1 at the G2/M transition."

The Eb and Ec core sequences are identical to the consensus sequence for the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of transcription factors, and transcriptional activity of constructs containing the enhancer is increased after treatment with retinoic acid.

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that As4.1 cells express both receptor isoforms, along with RARγ, but do not express RARβ, RXRβ, or RXRγ. Co-transfection of an expression vector encoding wild-type RARα increased enhancer activity, whereas a dominant negative mutant of RARα significantly attenuated retinoic acid-induced activity of the enhancer.

Co-transfection of an expression vector encoding wild-type RARα increased enhancer activity, whereas a dominant negative mutant of RARα significantly attenuated retinoic acid-induced activity of the enhancer. These results demonstrate the importance of the Eb and Ec motifs in controlling baseline activity of the renin enhancer, and suggest the potential importance of retinoids in regulating renin expression. kilobase(s) base pair(s) element a element b luciferase retinoic acid receptor retinoic X receptor fetal bovine serum all-trans-retinoic acid electrophoretic mobility shift assay reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction retinoic acid receptor element The renin-angiotensin system is a critical regulator of arterial pressure and electrolyte homeostasis and is required for continued development of the kidney after birth. The cleavage of angiotensinogen by renin is thought to be the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of angiotensin II and is tightly regulated. Transcription of the renin gene, storage and processing of renin in juxtaglomerular cell secretory granules, and secretion of renin into the systemic circulation, each dictate the level of angiotensin II produced. Although the regulation of therenin gene has been studied for many years, the molecular mechanisms controlling its cell-specific expression and regulation in response to physiological cues remains incomplete.Recent studies have identified an enhancer of transcription located upstream of the renin gene which can markedly induce transcription of renin promoter reporter constructs when transfected into As4.1 cells, a renin expressing tumor cell line isolated from the kidney thought to be derived from juxtaglomerular cells (1Sigmund C.D.

This enhancer, located ∼2.6 kb1 upstream of the mouserenin gene is partially homologous to a sequence located ∼12 kb upstream of the human renin gene (3Yan Y. Jones C.A. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Catanzaro D.F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We previously used mouse/human chimeric enhancers spanning the conserved and nonconserved region to identify important sequences controlling expression (4Shi Q. Black T.A. Gross K.W. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Those studies revealed that a 40-bp segment (m40) in the promoter proximal region of the mouse renin enhancer was required for maximal activity. The m40 segment contained two regulatory elements. The first sequence, element a (Ea), bound the factor NF-Y and acted as a transcriptional repressor because mutations abolishing binding of NF-Y significantly stimulated enhancer-mediated transcription. The second sequence, element b (Eb), was required for maximal activity of the enhancer, and its mutagenesis essentially abolished enhancer activity. Given that Ea and Eb overlapped, we hypothesized that NF-Y blocks enhancer activity by preventing the binding of transcription factors to Eb. This is supported by experiments in which the spacing between Ea and Eb is altered. 2Q. Shi and C. D. Sigmund, submitted for publication.2Q. Shi and C. D. Sigmund, submitted for publication.Based on the observation that the m40 sequence is insufficient to stimulate transcription on its own, we speculated that additional sequences further upstream of m40, but within the 242-bp enhancer are required for maximal induction. Herein we demonstrate that a third element, a direct repeat of Eb, termed Ec, lying upstream of m40 is also required for baseline enhancer activity. This sequence when multimerized can strongly stimulate renin promoter activity on its own. Moreover, the Ec-10 bp-Eb sequence matches the consensus binding site for members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. This sequence can bind the RARα and RXRα transcription factors and is required for induction of the renin promoter by retinoic acid. That retinoic acid can stimulate endogenous renin mRNA in As4.1 cells and mouse kidney suggests they may play a potentially important role in regulating renin expression.RESULTSUsing chimeric enhancers derived from the divergent regions of the mouse and human renin enhancer we previously identified two regulatory elements in the promoter proximal portion of the mouserenin enhancer. These studies were performed using As4.1 cells, which express renin and are likely derived from juxtaglomerular cells. Ea acted as a negative regulatory element and bound the factor NF-Y, and Eb acted as a positive regulatory element (4Shi Q. Black T.A. Gross K.W. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutation of Eb revealed that it is required for maximal enhancer activity, but that Eb and Ea alone were insufficient to stimulaterenin promoter activity, suggesting the presence of other transcription factor-binding sites in the enhancer. The purpose of the current study is to further examine the requirements for enhancer-mediated transcriptional activation and identify the stimulatory factors.Mutational analysis of Eb revealed that it has the core sequence TGACCT. Sequence analysis of the 242-bp mE revealed two other TGACCT motifs which lie upstream (more distal) of Eb. The first motif, termed Es is present at the 5′ terminus of the enhancer at coordinates −2847 to −2852. The other TGACCT motif, termed Ec, is located 10 bp upstream of Eb from −2668 to −2673, and thus lies upstream of the original m40 sequence containing Eb and Ea (Fig.1 B). Since our previous study demonstrated that enhancer function requires Eb, we performed transient transfection analysis in mouse renin expressing As4.1 cells to test whether Es or Ec were also required for enhancer activity. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to convert the GA in TGACCT to TT, which in our previous study caused a loss of function of Eb. Both mutations were individually generated in mE2.6kLUC, which contains the mouse enhancer fused upstream of a 2624-bp mouse renin promoter (Fig. 1 A). Mutation of Ec significantly reduced transcriptional activity (Fig.2), whereas mutation of Es had no effect (data not shown). Interestingly, mutation of Ec caused a significantly greater drop in enhancer activity than did mutation of Eb. Moreover, the increase in enhancer activity caused by mutation of the negative regulatory Ea required both Eb and Ec (Fig. 2). The importance of Ec and Eb was confirmed by mutagenesis of 4.1kLUC which contains the enhancer in its native position. Mutation of Eb and Ec lowered activity of the promoter to that of an enhancerless mutant (data not shown).The mouse renin enhancer acts in a position-independent manner and can strongly stimulate (>100-fold) a minimal mouserenin promoter when placed directly upstream. To characterize whether Ec + Eb has intrinsic enhancer activity on its own, we placed one or three copies of the Ec + Eb sequence directly upstream of the 117-bp promoter. Although one copy of the Ec + Eb sequence only slightly increased promoter activity (5.2-fold), three tandem copies of Ec + Eb markedly increased promoter activity (110-fold) to nearly the same level as mE (Fig.3). Mutation of Eb and Ec in the 3X(Ec + Eb) construct abolished this induction.Figure 3Intrinsic enhancer activity of Eb + Ec.Transient transfection analysis of LUC vector carrying a minimal mouserenin promoter (m117) with or without inserts were transiently transfected into As4.1 cells.

Since both Ec and Eb consisted of a TGACCT stretch we hypothesized that they possessed the same protein binding activity. We identified two major DNA-protein complexes (L and S) formed on Ec + Eb (Fig.4 A). The two complexes were efficiently competed by Ec + Eb as well as mutants lacking either Ec or Eb. On the contrary, a mutant lacking both Eb and Ec was not able to compete. The results suggest that both Ec and Eb have the ability to form both complexes. This was confirmed by demonstrating that mutants lacking either site, but not both, could still form complexes L and S when used as probes in EMSA (Fig. 4 B). The two complexes formed on both Ecμb and μcEb were efficiently competed by competitor DNAs containing either one or two TGACCT stretches (data not shown).Figure 4Nuclear protein binding to Ec + Eb. EMSA of nuclear protein binding activity of Ec + Eb is shown. A, Ec + Eb is used as a probe. Competitor DNAs are indicated and present in 20- and 100-fold molar excess (indicated by ramps). Position of the large (L) and small (S) complex are indicated.B, EMSA was performed using the indicated double stranded oligos as probes. C, EMSA was performed using Ec + Eb as probe. The indicated competitors were added in 100-fold molar excess. Eb was derived from the 3′-half of EcEb. Ec was derived from the 5′-half of EcEb. Both DNAs only contained one TGACCT motif. The mutant competitors contain the indicated single nucleotide mutation in the TGACCT motif of Ec. The last mutation (G to C) lies outside the TGACCT motif and does not prevent competition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To facilitate our identification of the Ec + Eb-binding factors, we determined which bases in the TGACCT stretch were essential to its binding activity. To accomplish this we first demonstrated that complexes L and S could be efficiently competed by DNAs containing a single TGACCT motif from either Eb or Ec (Fig. 4 C). We then examined the requirement of each base in the binding activity by using double stranded oligonucleotides mutated one base at a time as competitors in EMSA (Fig. 4 C). Mutation of any base within the TGACCT motif resulted in loss of competition, whereas a base-change mutation outside of the TGACCT stretch did not affect competition.A direct repeat of the TGACCT motif separated by a spacer of variable length is the consensus recognition sequence for transcription factors in the thyroid/retinoid superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors. As a candidate approach to identify which nuclear receptor could bind to Ec + Eb, we transfected As4.1 cells with the 3X(Ec + Eb)117LUC reporter vector, and then treated the cells with four different common nuclear receptor cognate ligands. To eliminate potential effect of lipophilic hormones, the transfected cells were grown in culture medium supplemented with charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum. Thyroid hormone did not affect promoter activity, while α1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 modestly, but significantly reduced promoter activity (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, promoter activity was significantly increased by 9-cis- retinoic acid and tRA, suggesting that Ec + Eb may be a retinoic acid responsive element (RARE). The increase in transcription caused by tRA was dose responsive (Fig.6).Figure 5Evaluation of candidate nuclear hormone receptor ligands. The 3X(Ec+Eb)117LUC construct was transiently transfected into As4.1 cells, and the transfected cells were treated with 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T 3), α1,25-dihydroxyvitamine D3(D3), 9-cis-retinoic acid (cRA), and tRA.

Both baseline and tRA-induced transcription was abolished by mutation of Ec + Eb (Fig. 6 A). Similarly, transcriptional activity of the 4.1kbLUC construct (which contains the enhancer in its native position) was induced by retinoic acid, and required an intact Ec + Eb sequence (Fig. 6 B). Loss of the Eb and Ec sequence in 4.1kbLUC had the same effect as eliminating the enhancer. Given our observation that both Ec and Eb could bind the same nuclear factors we determined whether both sites were required for the tRA-induced response. Interestingly, although the induction was lower than wild-type mE, tRA treatment still induced (2-fold) the promoter activity of constructs containing a mutation of either Eb or Ec (Fig.7). As above, loss of both Eb and Ec abolished tRA-mediated induction.Figure 7Role of Eb and Ec in mediating the response to retinoids. As4.1 cells were transiently transfected with 2.6kLUC either lacking mE (no mE), containing the wild-type enhancer (mE), or containing mutations in Eb (mEμb), Ec (mEμc), or both (mEμcb). Cells were either treated with vehicle (open) or tRA (1.0 μm,closed). *, p < 0.05 versus vehicle (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To evaluate the physiological relevance of our observation we examined the effect of tRA on the level of endogenous renin in As4.1 cells. Renin mRNA level in As4.1 was modestly increased after 24 h treatment with tRA (data not shown). tRA also modestly increased the level of the renin promoter SV40 T antigen transgene mRNA present in those cells (data not shown). We next examined the effect of tRA on the level of endogenous renin mRNA in mouse kidney. Mice received subcutaneous injections of tRA for 3 days after being fed a vitamin A-deficient diet for 2 months. The treatment significantly increased (3-fold) the level of endogenous renal renin mRNA (Fig.8).Figure 8Induction of endogenous REN by retinoids. C57BL/6J mice received subcutaneous injection of either tRA (n = 5) or vehicle (n = 6) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Mouse kidneys were collected 54 h after the initial tRA treatment. RNA (10 μg) isolated from right and left kidneys were independently subject to RNase Protection Assay using the mouse renin probe and 18 S rRNA probes. Gels were quantified using a PhosphorImager. Data from the right and left kidneys of one mouse were averaged as n= 1. *, p < 0.05 versus vehicle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based on these results we hypothesized that RAR bind to Ec + Eb in mE to stimulate transcription from the renin promoter in As4.1 cells. We therefore performed supershift EMSA using antibodies specifically-targeting either retinoic acid receptors (RARα, -β, or -γ), or RXR. The anti-RARα antisera caused the appearance of a supershifted complex, whereas the antibodies against other subtypes of RAR did not shift the DNA-protein complex (Fig.9). The anti-RXR monoclonal antibody also caused the appearance of a supershifted complex. Subtype-specific antisera for RXR revealed that RXRα bound to Ec + Eb (data not shown). That both RARα and RXRα antisera only partially supershifted the complex suggests that other proteins, perhaps other members of the nuclear hormone superfamily may also bind to mE. RT-PCR and DNA sequencing verified the expression of RARα, RARγ, and RXRα, but not RARβ, RXRβ, and RXRγ in As4.1 cells (data not shown).Figure 9Identification of RAR and RXR subtypes bound to Ec + Eb. Supershift EMSA was performed using Ec + Eb as a probe. Complexes were incubated with the indicated antisera (10 μg for RARα, -β, and -γ, and 0.025 μm of anti-RXR monoclonal antibody indicated by the X).

Both cDNAs were placed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer and were transiently cotransfected into As4.1 cells along with the 4.1kbLUC reporter vector. Co-transfection of the wild-type mRARα expression vector significantly increased promoter activity of m4.1kLUC whether induced with tRA or left untreated (Fig.10). On the contrary, co-transfection of the mRARα403 expression vector significantly attenuated the tRA-induced promoter activity of m4.1kLUC vector, but did not alter baseline expression. The stimulatory effect of the wild-type mRARα was completely abolished when Ec and Eb were mutated (data not shown). Our results suggest an important role of the Ec and Eb sequence in controlling baseline activity of mE and demonstrate a potential role for retinoids in regulating expression of the renin gene.Figure 10Attenuation of enhancer activity by dominant negative RAR.

Black T.A. Fabian J.R. Kane C.M. Jones C.A. Loudon J.A. Abonia J.P. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Its ability to stimulate up to a 100-fold increase in transcriptional activity of therenin promoter makes it an important candidate inrenin gene regulation. We previously identified two transcription factor-binding sites which mechanistically oppose each other (4Shi Q. Black T.A. Gross K.W. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The binding of NF-Y to Ea acts as a negative regulator because it blocks the binding of transcription factors to Eb. Studies where the spacing between Ea and Eb is altered strongly suggests that NF-Y sterically blocks the binding of factors to Eb.2 The importance of Eb was shown by a loss of enhancer activity after mutagenesis. In the present study, we demonstrate that a second TGACCT motif located 10 bp upstream of Eb termed Ec is also required for maximal enhancer activity. Mutation of either Ec or Eb in mE essentially eliminates enhancer function. Mutation of a third TGACCT motif (Es) did not effect enhancer function.The Eb and Ec sequences are clearly required for baseline activity of the enhancer. In addition, their importance is supported by the observation that they fit the consensus sequence for a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, are required to mediate induction of the renin promoter by retinoic acid, and bind RARα and RXRα. There was no induction when cells were treated with thyroid hormone or vitamin D3. Within the superfamily, selective recognition of different ligand/receptors is determined by the number of intervening base pairs between the two TGACCT motifs. In general, heterodimers of TR/RXR selectively bind to DR4 and heterodimers of VDR/RXR selectively bind to DR3. Interestingly, heterodimers of RAR/RXR preferentially bind to DR2 or DR5 (10Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). There are 10 intervening base pairs between Ec and Eb in mE. Our EMSA and supershift studies clearly demonstrate the ability of the DR10 sequence to bind RARα and RXRα. Despite the preference for DR2 or DR5, the retinoic acid responsive γF-crystallin and medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase genes contain DR8, and theoxytocin and laminin B1 genes contain DR14 (11Richard S. Zingg H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21428-21433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Vasios G. Mader S. Gold J.D. Leid M. Lutz Y. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. Gudas L.

This is consistent with our EMSA results showing that probes containing one intact TGACCT motif were still capable of forming two complexes that had the same mobility as those with probe Ec + Eb. Imperfect motifs for RAR/RXR exist in many genes, such as apolipoprotein A1, oxytocin, γF-crystallin, medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and β-crystallin (11Richard S.

This may be an important consideration because the human renin enhancer (hE) has one perfect TGACCT motif (Ec) and one variant motif (TGGCCT, Eb). Baseline transcriptional activity of hE was considerably lower than that of mE (4Shi Q. Black T.A. Gross K.W. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but nevertheless retained modest retinoic acid-induced transcription (data not shown).When a heterodimer of RAR/RXR binds to a TGACCT direct repeat, RAR selectively binds to the upstream TGACCT while RXR selectively binds to the downstream TGACCT (18Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Forcing RAR/RXR to bind RARE in the opposite direction abolished its transactivation activity. In our study, mutation of Ec always had a stronger effect than mutation of Eb, suggesting the possibility for asymmetric binding of RAR/RXR to the RARE. In a model described in Westin et al. (19Westin S. Kurokawa R. Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Milburn M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 395: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), RAR plays a pivotal role to initiate the hierarchical assembly of transcriptional proteins on RARE. If this is true for RAR/RXR binding to Ec + Eb in mE, RAR will bind to Ec and RXR will bind to Eb. Since RAR/RXR-mediated transactivation depends on coactivators, and the interaction between RAR/RXR and coactivators initiates from RAR, disturbance of RAR binding to Ec should cause a marked loss of the functional RAR/RXR-ligand-coactivator complex.Despite the retinoid-mediated induction of the renin promoter (and endogenous renin gene) mediated by RAR, it is likely that other transcription factors bind to the Ec + Eb sequence. EMSA revealed two major protein-DNA complexes, and supershift does not cause a reduction in either the L or S complex. Indeed, Eb and Ec are both required for the induction by retinoids and for baseline activity of the enhancer in the absence of ligand. These data suggest that other transcription factors, perhaps other members of the hormone receptor superfamily may also play a role in regulating renin gene expression. It is possible that the requirement for Ec + Eb in mediating baseline transcriptional activity of mE may occur independently of RAR/RXR, while the retinoic acid induced activity requires RAR/RXR. We are currently attempting to identify other Ec + Eb binding factors using yeast one-hybrid analysis and have preliminary data implicating an orphan nuclear receptor."

Shine J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1992; 4: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The downstream signaling pathways activated by GPCR agonists are dependent on the class of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein that is coupled to the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor. For example, GPCRs such as the dopamine 2 receptor (d2R) are coupled to the PTX-sensitive Gi class of G proteins and thus mediate the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and a lowering of cellular cAMP levels. In contrast, Gq-coupled receptors, such as the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), activate phospholipase Cβ, resulting in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels.

A. 1995; 92: 1590-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) presented evidence that the same inwardly rectifying channel is the recipient of these competing G protein signals in locus coeruleus neurons, supporting the idea that channels can be dually modulated by different classes of GPCRs. Similar effects of GPCRs on ion channels have been documented in defined expression systems using cloned channels and receptors. In cardiac pacemaker cells, the m2 mAChR, which is coupled to the PTX sensitive Gαi protein, is associated with the activation of the G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel (GIRK). GIRK channels are characterized by a low basal level of activity that is dramatically increased upon stimulation of Gi-coupled receptors. The activation of these channels results in a decrease in cellular excitability by hyperpolarizing the cell, thus lengthening the time between action potentials. The GIRK protein family contains five homologous members (GIRK1–5), all of which contain two transmembrane domains flanking a hydrophobic pore region, with both the N and C termini located in the cytoplasm (7Dascal N. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). GIRK channels function in the membrane as tetramers consisting of two GIRK1 subunits and two subunits of one of the other GIRK family members (GIRK2–5) (8Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Sui J.L. Kozak J.A.

The signaling pathway between the activating Gi-coupled receptor and GIRK channels is membrane-delimited and dependent on the direct binding of Gβγ subunits to the cytoplasmic domains of both GIRK1 and GIRK4 (12Soejima M.

Recently, it has been suggested that Gβγ binding to GIRK channels may stimulate channel activity by increasing the affinity of the cytoplasmic regions of GIRK for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (17Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), an association that appears to be required for the activity of all inwardly rectifying potassium channels (17Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Other groups have recently reported that Gq signaling can inhibit GIRK channels (18Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Stevens E.B. Shah B.S. Pinnock R.D. Lee K. Mol.

In this study, we corroborate and further their findings by investigating the effect of m1 mAChR stimulation on GIRK1/GIRK4 whole cell currents in a Xenopusoocyte expression system. We found that stimulation of the Gq-coupled m1 mAChR led to the suppression of GIRK1/GIRK4 currents and that this effect could be mimicked by a potent PKC activator, PMA, and a Ca2+ ionophore. Analysis of chimeric and mutant channels revealed that the GIRK4 subunit is sufficient for responding to these Gq signals but not via direct phosphorylation of a canonical PKC site on the channel itself. The following clones were used in these studies: rat GIRK1, rat GIRK4, rat IRK2, human m1 mAChR, human d2R (long form), rat Gαi2, murine Gβ1, and murine Gγ2. Chimeric GIRK1/IRK2 channels were generated as described previously (15Kunkel M.T. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mutant channels were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) protocol. RNA synthesis and oocyte preparation were performed as described previously (21Kunkel M.T. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3809-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were injected with 50 nl of a cRNA mixture containing the appropriate combination of transcripts in these approximate amounts: 5 ng of GIRK1, 5 ng of GIRK4, 5 ng of d2R, 1 ng of m1 mAChR, and 2 ng of IRK2. In Fig. 1 B, basal GIRK currents were increased by the injection of 2 ng of Gβ1 and 1 ng of Gγ2. A larger amount of Gβγ RNA was injected for Fig. 2 (∼8 ng of Gβ1, 3 ng of Gγ2). Oocytes were recorded 3–5 days later by two-electrode voltage clamp in 90 mmK+ saline (90 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) as described previously (15Kunkel M.T. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Currents from a minimum of five oocytes were recorded for each treatment.Figure 2Overexpressed Gβγ attenuates m1 mAChR-mediated inhibition of GIRK1/4. Xenopus oocytes were injected with GIRK1/4 and m1 mAChR cRNA and then injected a second time with dopamine receptor and either Gβ1γ2 RNA alone or Gαi2 and Gβ1γ2 cRNA (A). The percentage of suppression over time as the result of carbachol addition for each of these batches of oocytes was determined (B). Overexpression of Gβ1γ2 subunits dramatically inhibits suppression of basal GIRK1/4 currents upon stimulation of the m1 mAChR by carbachol (B, open circles). This effect is rescued by the additional expression of Gαi2(B, closed circles). C, the maximal Ca2+-activated Cl− current at 0 mV elicited by m1 mAChR stimulation in each batch of oocytes. D, basal current amplitude at −80 mV of GIRK1/4 currents in each batch of oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To minimize the contribution of endogenous currents, only oocytes with >1μA of whole cell current at −80 mV were used. Endogenous oocyte current amplitudes at −80 mV are generally less than 0.2 μA. Oocytes were held at 0 mV and pulsed to −80 mV for 500 ms at 10-s intervals. Currents were also monitored at 0 and +40 mV. Data from multiple oocytes were normalized by computing the percent suppression: % suppression = −((X − A)/A) × 100, where Xis the current amplitude at a given time point and A is the current amplitude immediately before carbachol addition and after d2R activation (if applicable). Cell-attached patch recordings (see Fig. 1 D) were performed with 140 mm K+ saline (140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2) in both the bath and the pipette. Quinpirole (100 μm) was added to the pipette saline to activate GIRK channels. Glass pipettes (Corning 8161) had tip resistances between 0.8 and 4 MΩ. Cell-attached patches containing multiple channels were held at 0mV. Every 5 s, the voltage was pulsed to −60 mV for 2700 ms, followed by a 460-ms pulse to +60 mV. Carbachol (1 μm) was added to the bath after 100 s and allowed to mix by diffusion. Data were analyzed using Fetchan (Axon Instruments) by calculating the percent total channel activity in a 100-s window beginning 100 s after carbachol (or control saline) addition relative to an identical window before carbachol (or saline) addition. To activate the d2R receptor, 10 μm (−)-quinpirole hydrochloride (Research Biochemicals International) was added to the recording solution. Similarly, the m1 mAChR was activated by addition of 100 nm to 10 μm carbachol. The concentration of carbachol used in each oocyte batch was chosen by normalizing the endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride transient current evoked by m1 mAChR stimulation in oocytes (22Dascal N. Landau E.M. Lass Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 352: 551-574Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A concentration of carbachol that evoked a visible but short lived (<30 s) transient current was used. Oocytes treated with calphostin C, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor mixture (4 μm tyrphostin A-48, 4 μmtyrphostin A-25, 1 μm lavendustin A, and 15 μm genistein), GF109203X, staurosporine, and H-89 were soaked for 20–30 min prior to recording in 90 mmK+ recording saline containing 1:1000 dilutions of both 1000× drug (in Me2SO) and 30% pluronic F-127 (in Me2SO). Pluronic F-127 alone had no effect on whole cell GIRK1/GIRK4 currents (data not shown). PMA and Ca2+ionophore were similarly dissolved and added to the recording solution in the final concentrations given in the text. 4K+-1,2-bis(0-aminophenoxy)ethane- N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) was dissolved in 100 mm KCl to a final concentration of 2 mm. A 50-nl bolus of this solution was injected into oocytes 20–30 min before recording. Control oocytes were similarly injected with 100 mm KCl. Similarly, KT5823 and the inhibitory PKA peptide were dissolved in Ca2+-free OR-2 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) to final concentrations of 20 μm and 200 nm, respectively. A 50-nl bolus was injected 20–30 min before recording and compared with oocytes injected with Ca2+-free OR-2 alone. To test the effect of m1 mAChR stimulation on GIRK currents, Xenopus oocytes expressing GIRK1, GIRK4, d2R, and m1 mAChR were placed under two-electrode voltage clamp. GIRK currents were first activated by the addition of 10 μm quinpirole. Fifty seconds later, the m1 mAChR was stimulated by 100 nmto 5 μm carbachol. Carbachol elicited a short lived endogenous oocyte current that strongly inactivated at negative potentials (Ref. 22Dascal N. Landau E.M. Lass Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 352: 551-574Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar and data not shown). After this transient current had subsided, we noted a carbachol-dependent inhibition in GIRK current amplitude (Fig.1 A, left panel). The right panel of Fig. 1 A shows the average percentage of suppression of activated GIRK currents over time (n = 12). Interestingly, carbachol-treated GIRK currents decreased at a rate that was three times faster than oocytes that were not treated with carbachol. This effect was dependent on signaling through the m1 mAChR because oocytes that were not injected with cRNA encoding the m1 mAChR failed to exhibit a carbachol-induced decrease in activated GIRK whole cell currents. (n = 3, data not shown). These results suggest that m1 mAChR, like the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1a, bombesin 1, and endothelin 1 receptors (18Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Stevens E.B. Shah B.S. Pinnock R.D. Lee K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Rogalski S.L. Cyr C. Chavkin C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), can inhibit GIRK activity. To eliminate the possibility that the m1 mAChR acts by directly inhibiting the d2R receptor itself, we next examined the effect of m1 mAChR stimulation on basal, nonreceptor-activated, GIRK1/GIRK4 currents. Oocytes injected with cRNA encoding GIRK1/4, m1 mAChR, Gβ1, and Gγ2 were screened for a high level of basal GIRK current. As previously reported by Kovoor et al. (23Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we found that the basal current amplitude of GIRK1/GIRK4 decreased slowly in the absence of any agonists after placing the oocytes into high potassium saline. However, when carbachol (0.5–1.0 μm) was added to the bath, the basal GIRK current amplitude was significantly inhibited (Fig. 1 B) with similar kinetics to those seen in the inhibition of d2R-activated GIRK currents. This finding suggests that m1 mAChR-mediated inhibition of GIRK1/4 occurs downstream of the activating receptor. The inwardly rectifying potassium channel, IRK2 (Kir2.2), is 45% homologous to GIRK1 but does not respond to Gi-coupled receptor signaling. We found that the large basal current characteristic of IRK2 was also insensitive to Gq-coupled receptor signaling; carbachol stimulation of the m1 mAChR had no effect on IRK2 current amplitude (Fig. 1 C). Similarly, the small steady-state endogenous oocyte currents seen at −80 mV were also insensitive to m1 mAChR signaling (n = 5; data not shown). To determine whether second messenger molecules are necessary for m1 mAChR-mediated inhibition of GIRK1/4, we recorded GIRK currents in a cell-attached patch configuration and tested for their sensitivity to carbachol added to the bath. The left panel of Fig.1 D shows the openings of single GIRK channels in aXenopus oocyte patch. We found that carbachol added to the bath inhibited channels located within the pipette, implying the involvement of second messenger molecules (Fig. 1 D). This is in contrast to GIRK channel activation, which occurs by a membrane-delimited pathway and thus requires addition of agonist to the pipette; agonist addition to the bath does not activate GIRK currents (12Soejima M. Noma A. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1984; 400: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Many groups have reported that overexpression of Gβγ subunits results in an increase in basal GIRK1/4 current, presumably because of increased binding of Gβγ to the cytoplasmic regions of the channel and subsequent channel activation (8Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Sui J.L. Kozak J.A. Pabon A. Ladias J.A. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 25Velimirovic B.M. Gordon E.A. Lim N.F. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ) do not activate GIRK. The previous experiments described here utilized only G proteins that are endogenous to the oocyte (although small amounts of Gβ1 and Gγ2 cRNA were injected in Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, we found that GIRK currents in oocytes that were injected with Gβ1 and Gγ2cRNA were less responsive to Gq signaling than oocytes that also expressed the Gαi2 subunits, suggesting that free Gβγ subunits are capable of reversing or preventing Gqinhibition (Fig. 2, A andB). Notably, the slower agonist-independent GIRK suppression was similarly affected by the overexpression of G protein subunits (Fig. 2 B). Basal GIRK1/4 current was significantly decreased by the overexpression of Gαi2, suggesting that Gαi2 protein was expressed and functional (Fig.2 D). Furthermore, the amplitude of the transient Ca2+ activated Cl− current was comparable in the oocytes expressing Gβγ and Gαi2βγ, indicating similar levels of m1 mAChR stimulation under these two conditions (Fig.2 C). These experiments show that high levels of free Gβγ subunits have an inhibitory effect on Gq receptor signaling to GIRK1/4. Gq-coupled receptors, such as the m1 mAChR, have been linked to many downstream effector pathways including activation of phospholipase C, PKC, and tyrosine kinases (26Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 27Ashkenazi A. Peralta E.G. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10 (suppl.): 16-22Google Scholar, 28Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1145-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In an effort to determine whether these pathways are involved in the second messenger-dependent m1 mAChR-mediated suppression of GIRK1/4 currents, oocytes injected with GIRK1, GIRK4, d2R, and m1 mAChR mRNA were treated with various pharmacological agents. PKC is a ubiquitous kinase known to be activated by Gq-coupled receptors (29Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 10 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent PKC activator, mimicked the effect of m1 mAChR signaling on both activated (Fig. 3 A) and basal (Fig.3 B) GIRK1/4 currents. The kinetics of GIRK inhibition by PMA were very similar to the receptor-mediated suppression (compare with Fig. 1). PMA treatment also inhibited IRK2 currents; however, this inhibition took considerably longer to develop and occurred at a slower rate than GIRK1/4 inhibition (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that PMA acts on these two channels by different mechanisms. Treatment with a broad specificity serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (3 μm), slowed both m1 mAChR-mediated and agonist-independent channel suppression (Fig. 3 D). H-89 (50 μm), another broad specificity kinase inhibitor, also slowed m1 mAChR-mediated inhibition of activated currents (data not shown). However, we were unable to further illustrate the involvement of PKC in GIRK1/4 inhibition through the use of specific PKC inhibitors. The cell-permeable PKC inhibitor, calphostin C (up to 1 μm), did not affect m1 mAChR-mediated suppression of GIRK1/4 (Fig. 3 E). Another PKC inhibitor, GF109203X (1 μm), also failed to affect receptor-mediated inhibition of GIRK currents. At higher concentrations (15 μm), GF109203X blocked and disrupted GIRK1/4 currents (data not shown). Because both H-89 and staurosporine inhibit a broad range of kinases including PKC, PKA, and cGMP-dependent kinase at the concentrations used here, it is difficult to further define the role of a specific kinase in GIRK suppression. Additional experiments utilizing PKA and cGMP-dependent kinase inhibitors were unable to identify a specific role for these kinases. Both a protein kinase A inhibitory peptide (10 nm, Calbiochem) and KT5823 (1 μm, Calbiochem) failed to significantly affect m1 mAChR-mediated inhibition of GIRK channels (data not shown). In addition to the activation of PKC and other kinases, Gq-coupled receptors also strongly increase intracellular Ca2+ levels in the cell. To explore the possibility that Ca2+ signaling may mediate the Gq effect on GIRK channels, we modulated intracellular Ca2+ levels in oocytes with various pharmacological agents. Treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, inhibited GIRK1/4 currents in a manner indistinguishable from m1 mAChR signaling or treatment with PMA (Fig. 3 F). However, inhibition of Ca2+ signaling by injection of the calcium chelating agent, BAPTA, did not significantly affect m1 mAChR signaling to GIRK1/4, despite the complete elimination of the transient Ca2+-activated Cl− current (Fig. 3 G). Tyrosine kinases have been implicated in the suppression of a voltage-gated potassium channel by m1 mAChR signaling (28Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1145-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, we have found no evidence for tyrosine kinase phosphorylation in the regulation of GIRK channels by m1 mAChR. Treatment of oocytes with a mixture of tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not affect the carbachol-induced inhibition of GIRK1/4 currents (data not shown). Because pharmacology implicated a role for protein kinases in m1 mAChR-mediated suppression of GIRK1/4 currents, we searched for potential phosphorylation sites on the GIRK proteins that may mediate this effect. A ProSite data base search revealed 10 putative phosphorylation sites for both PKA and PKC in GIRK1 and three PKA sites and six PKC sites in GIRK4 (30Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the extended C terminus of GIRK1 contains a particularly high density of phosphorylation sites. To narrow our search, we were interested in identifying the domains of the GIRK1 and GIRK4 proteins that mediate the inhibitory effect of Gq signaling on GIRK currents. A series of chimeric and mutant ion channels derived from GIRK1 and IRK2 were generated previously by Kunkel and Peralta (15Kunkel M.T. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). We coexpressed these chimeras with the m1 mAChR and tested whether they were responsive to m1 mAChR signaling. The results from these experiments are summarized in Fig. 4 A. The d2R-activated current of both the GR2/GIRK4 and the ΔN1/GIRK4 mutant channels were suppressed upon stimulation of the m1 mAChR with carbachol. Taken together, these results suggest that the serine/threonine-rich distal N-terminal (amino acids 1–24) and C-terminal (amino acids 357–501) regions of GIRK1 are not required for GIRK inhibition by m1 mAChR. Thus, it appears that the numerous potential phosphorylation sites in these regions are not necessary for channel responsiveness to Gq signaling. In contrast, the large basal (nonreceptor activated) currents of the GR3 and GR7.1 chimeras were insensitive to Gq signaling, suggesting that amino acids 1–84 and 290–501 of GIRK1 are not capable of conferring Gq sensitivity onto IRK2. Interestingly, the chimeras that require coinjection of cRNA encoding the GIRK4 subunit to produce visible whole cell currents were suppressed upon m1 mAChR stimulation. This correlation suggested that the GIRK4 subunit itself may be responsive to Gq signals. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of a mutation in the pore region of GIRK4, a serine to phenylalanine substitution at amino acid 143, that allows wild-type and S143F mutant GIRK4 subunits to form functional homomeric channels (31Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 32Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We found that GIRK4/GIRK4(S143F) homomeric channels are indeed inhibited by stimulation of the m1 mAChR (Fig. 4 B) in a similar manner to GIRK1/4 heteromeric channels. Thus, the GIRK4 subunit is sufficient to respond to Gq signals. Our pharmacological analysis implicates serine/threonine kinases in the regulation of GIRK channels by m1 mAChR signaling. Because GIRK channels contain numerous putative PKA and PKC phosphorylation sites, we wondered whether phosphorylation of GIRK1 or GIRK4 is required for GIRK current inhibition by m1 mAChR signaling. To address this question, we generated site-specific mutations to eliminate potential phosphorylation sites and tested these mutants for their ability to be suppressed by m1 mAChR. In particular, we took advantage of the GIRK4(S143F) pore mutation that allows GIRK4 to form homomeric channels and used site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate the canonical PKC phosphorylation sites found in this protein. GIRK4 contains six putative PKC sites ((S/T)X(R/K)), five of which are predicted to be accessible to intracellular kinases. The sixth PKC site is located immediately adjacent to the pore helix (H5 region), N-terminal to the second transmembrane domain (Fig.5 A). GIRK4 homomeric channels in which all five intracellular PKC sites have been mutated to alanine, designated GIRK4(φPKC), did not produce current in oocytes coinjected with the dopamine 2 receptor. However, the subsequent injection of Gβ1 and Gγ2 cRNAs produced whole cell GIRK currents of greater than 1 μA from these mutant channels. Interestingly, GIRK4(φPKC) channels are inhibited by Gqstimulation (Fig. 5 B) to a similar extent as wild-type GIRK4 homomeric channels. This result suggests that direct PKC phosphorylation of the channel is not necessary for Gq-mediated inhibition. In this paper, we have shown that a cloned inward rectifier, GIRK1/GIRK4, is functionally coupled to the m1 mAChR in aXenopus oocyte expression system. Thus, the regulation of GIRK1/4 conductance is mediated in opposing manners by different classes of GPCRs; it responds to an activation signal from Gi-coupled receptors such as d2R and an inhibitory signal from the Gq-coupled m1 mACh receptor. Other studies have demonstrated that stimulation of the m1 mAChR increases excitability in some cells by suppressing a voltage-gated K+ channel, Kv1.2 (28Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1145-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that GIRK1/4 may also contribute to these m1 mAChR-mediated stimulatory signals by lowering the membrane permeability to K+, thus allowing the cell to reach firing threshold more quickly. It is interesting to speculate that the inhibition of GIRK currents by Gq-coupled receptors may be partially responsible for determining the specificity of GIRK activation. Although all G proteins release Gβγ subunits upon activation, only Gi-coupled receptors are capable of activating GIRK. Interestingly, GIRK channels do not seem to prefer particular combinations of β and γ subunits, suggesting that only the identity of the Gα subunit is important for determining specificity (14Wickman K.D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Davenport P.A. Taussig R. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Gi-coupled receptors often have inhibitory physiological effects and are not generally thought to activate many cellular kinases. In contrast, other G proteins such as Gq and Gs stimulate many kinases, including PKC and PKA. Perhaps activation of these kinases inhibits GIRK channels by lowering their affinity for Gβγ, thus protecting them from subsequent activation. Other groups have also shown that GIRK channels can be suppressed by Gq-coupled receptors, including the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1a, the endothelin A receptor, and the bombesin 1 receptor (18Sharon D.

Thus, it is likely that all Gq-coupled receptors are capable of inhibiting GIRK currents, just as GIRK currents are activated by any Gi-coupled receptor. However, the mechanism of Gq-mediated suppression of GIRK remains unclear. Activating protein kinase C (via PMA) or increasing cytosolic Ca2+ levels with A23187 mimicked the suppression of GIRK currents elicited by stimulation of the m1 mAChR with carbachol. Surprisingly, in our experiments, specific PKC targeting drugs that inactivate typical PKC subtypes failed to prevent or slow m1 mAChR-mediated suppression of GIRK1/4. However, broad specificity kinase inhibitors slowed both m1 mAChR-mediated and agonist-independent inhibition of GIRK1/4 currents, suggesting that serine/threonine kinases are likely to be involved in GIRK inhibition by Gq-coupled receptors. There are many different classes of PKC enzymes, all of which prefer similar phosphorylation site sequences (33Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). It is possible that an atypical PKC family member is responsible for mediating the m1 mAChR effect on GIRK channels. In fact, Sharonet al. (18Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) suggested PKC-μ, an atypical PKC, as a likely candidate. Stevens et al. (19Stevens E.B. Shah B.S. Pinnock R.D. Lee K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) also found pharmacological evidence for the involvement of PKC. These pharmacological data led many of these groups to speculate that PKC may directly phosphorylate the channel itself resulting in a subsequent current inhibition. This mechanism is known to inhibit other channels, including an IRK family member, Kir2.3 (34Zhu G. Qu Z. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11643-11646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, our results suggest that this mechanism is unlikely to explain Gq-mediated inhibition of GIRK currents because a mutant homomeric GIRK4 channel that does not contain accessible canonical PKC sites continues to respond to Gq signaling. Because stimulation of m1 mAChR can inhibit both basal and receptor-activated GIRK currents, m1 mAChR appears to regulate GIRK channel activity at a level downstream of the activating dopamine 2 receptor. GIRK activation occurs by a membrane-delimited pathway involving direct Gβγ binding to the channel (12Soejima M. Noma A. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J.

Thus, it seems likely that m1 mAChR signaling targets either the activating heterotrimeric G protein or the GIRK channel itself. The exact nature of basal GIRK activity remains unclear, and it is a source of argument in the field whether GIRK channels display G protein-independent activity (see Ref. 7Dascal N. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In oocytes, the basal current does not depend on the amount of expressed receptor, and ∼80% of the basal GIRK current is sensitive to PTX toxin, which targets the Gi heterotrimeric G protein (8Chan K.W.

Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Davenport P.A. Taussig R. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 24Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A.

These findings suggest that a significant fraction of the basal GIRK current results from basal G protein activity. Thus, it remains possible that Gq signaling inhibits GIRK currents by inactivating the Gi protein rather than directly targeting the channel itself.

This paper reports the cloning and sequencing of enr genes specifying enoate reductase of C. tyrobutyricum, C. thermoaceticum, and C. kluyveri. TheC. thermoaceticum gene was expressed in enzymatically active form in recombinant Escherichia coli.DISCUSSIONThe amino acid sequences predicted by enr genes ofC. tyrobutyricum, C. kluyveri, and C. thermoaceticum indicate that enoate reductases belong to a family of pyridine nucleotide-dependent flavoproteins (Table VII). An alignment of the sequences of enoate reductase from C. tyrobutyricum and the other protein sequences with the exception of old yellow enzyme from yeast is shown in Fig. 5. All sequences showed homology over their entire lengths (29–34% identity to enoate reductase of C. tyrobutyricum). A region with 4 conserved cysteine residues is present in all sequences. The consensus pattern C-(2X)-C-(2–3X)-C-(11–12X)-C is similar to Fe4S4 clusters in ferredoxins and other iron-sulfur proteins (30Krauth-Siegel R.L. Blatterspiel R. Saleh M. Schiltz E. Schirmer R.H. Untucht-Grau R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 121: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31Russel M. Model P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9015-9019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies of trimethylamine dehydrogenase indicated that these 4 cysteins are ligands for the Fe4S4 cluster (32Barber M.J. Neame P.J. Lim L.W. White S. Mathews F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6611-6619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of trimethylamine dehydrogenase and dimethylamine dehydrogenase, all sequences show two other well conserved motifs (amino acid residues 404–431 and 529–546 in enoate reductase) with similarity to the binding sites for the ADP moiety of FAD and NAD(P)H in other flavoproteins (32Barber M.J.

Schulz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but no similarity exists between enoate reductases and eukaryotic 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductases (39Koivüranta K.T. Hakkola E.H. Hiltunen J.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It should be noted that 2,4-dieonyl-CoA reductase of E. coli and eukaryotic organisms yield different products (40Dommes V. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1781-1788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The N terminus of enoate reductases (residue 1–368) shares 26% identity (44% similarity) with old yellow enzyme fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (EC 1.6.99.1) which was recently shown to reduce 2-enals and methyl-3-en-ketones (41Murthy Y.V.S. Meah Y. Massey V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5344-5345Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The stereochemical course of the reaction is trans, opposite to that of enoate reductase. Old yellow enzyme does not contain iron-sulfur clusters. It catalyzes the transfer of the pro-R hydrogen from NADPH to the β-position of the substrate (42Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) in contrast to enoate reductase, which transfers the pro-S hydrogen (24Bühler M. Simon H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1982; 363: 609-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Enoate reductases have no detectable similarity to enoyl-CoA reductases (43Duran E. Komuniecki R.W. Komuniecky P.R. Wheelock M.J. Klingbeil M.M. Ma Y.C. Johnson K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in line with the different stereochemistry of the reaction products formed by the addition of hydrogen by enoate reductases and enoyl-CoA reductases (Fig. 1).With the exception of trimethylamine dehydrogenase and dimethylamine dehydrogenase, the oxidoreductases with similarity to enoate reductases have subunit molecular masses the in the range of 71–73 kDa, but the subunit structure varies widely. All enzymes have been shown either directly or indirectly to have iron and acid-labile sulfide, and all contain at least one molecule of flavin. Reduced pyridine nucleotides served as electron donors with the exception of trimethylamine dehydrogenase and dimethylamine deydrogenase, which have trimethylamine or dimethylamine as electron donors, respectively. These facts correspond well to the features across the amino acid sequences concerning the putative FeS-cluster-, FAD-, and NAD-binding sites (Table VIII). A comparison of the amino acid sequences of enoate reductases showed strong conservation betweenC. tyrobutyricum and C. thermoaceticum (59% identity), although the GC content of the DNA sequences from these microorganisms differs widely (30 and 54%, respectively (44Gottschalk G.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant expression of enoate reductase from C. tyrobutyricum in aerobically grown E. coli host strains directed the formation of insoluble, inactive protein. The expression level was very low, so that the protein could only be detected on SDS-PAGE gels as a weak band and by Western blot analysis. This is likely because of the low GC content of the C. tyrobutyricumDNA (30%), which is also observed in the open reading frame of theenr gene. This fact is reflected in a much different codon usage of E. coli and C. tyrobutyricum, which results in up to 90 so-called regulatory codons in the open reading frame (46Yang C.C. Packman L.C. Srutton N.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Recombinant enoate reductase from C. thermoaceticum from aerobically grown E. coli host cells was insoluble and enzymatically inactive too, but was expressed to a level of about 20% of total cell protein (data not shown). This is likely due to the different GC content resulting in only 20 regulatory codons identified across the DNA sequence of the enr gene from C. thermoaceticum. However, in anaerobically grown E. colihost cells recombinant enoate reductase was expressed in soluble and enzymatically active form. The recombinant enzyme was purified nearly to homogenity and preliminary studies on characterizations were performed indicating both differences and similarities in properties of the highly conserved enoate reductases from C. tyrobutyricumand C. thermoaceticum. The catalytic activity of recombinant enoate reductase from C. thermoaceticum (2.4 μmol min−1 mg−1) is similar to that of the enzyme isolated from wild type C. tyrobutyricum (10.6 μmol min−1 mg−1). Enoate reductases (EC 1.3.1.31) from Clostridium tyrobutyricum and Clostridium kluyveri catalyze the NADH-dependent reduction of carbon-carbon double bonds of nonactivated 2-enoates as well as of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, cyclic ketones, and methylketones (Fig.1) (for review see Refs. 1Simon H.

Hiltunen J.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It should be noted that 2,4-dieonyl-CoA reductase of E. coli and eukaryotic organisms yield different products (40Dommes V. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1781-1788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The N terminus of enoate reductases (residue 1–368) shares 26% identity (44% similarity) with old yellow enzyme fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (EC 1.6.99.1) which was recently shown to reduce 2-enals and methyl-3-en-ketones (41Murthy Y.V.S. Meah Y. Massey V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5344-5345Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The stereochemical course of the reaction is trans, opposite to that of enoate reductase. Old yellow enzyme does not contain iron-sulfur clusters. It catalyzes the transfer of the pro-R hydrogen from NADPH to the β-position of the substrate (42Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V.

This is in line with the different stereochemistry of the reaction products formed by the addition of hydrogen by enoate reductases and enoyl-CoA reductases (Fig. 1).With the exception of trimethylamine dehydrogenase and dimethylamine dehydrogenase, the oxidoreductases with similarity to enoate reductases have subunit molecular masses the in the range of 71–73 kDa, but the subunit structure varies widely. All enzymes have been shown either directly or indirectly to have iron and acid-labile sulfide, and all contain at least one molecule of flavin. Reduced pyridine nucleotides served as electron donors with the exception of trimethylamine dehydrogenase and dimethylamine deydrogenase, which have trimethylamine or dimethylamine as electron donors, respectively. These facts correspond well to the features across the amino acid sequences concerning the putative FeS-cluster-, FAD-, and NAD-binding sites (Table VIII). A comparison of the amino acid sequences of enoate reductases showed strong conservation betweenC. tyrobutyricum and C. thermoaceticum (59% identity), although the GC content of the DNA sequences from these microorganisms differs widely (30 and 54%, respectively (44Gottschalk G.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant expression of enoate reductase from C. tyrobutyricum in aerobically grown E. coli host strains directed the formation of insoluble, inactive protein. The expression level was very low, so that the protein could only be detected on SDS-PAGE gels as a weak band and by Western blot analysis. This is likely because of the low GC content of the C. tyrobutyricumDNA (30%), which is also observed in the open reading frame of theenr gene. This fact is reflected in a much different codon usage of E. coli and C. tyrobutyricum, which results in up to 90 so-called regulatory codons in the open reading frame (46Yang C.C. Packman L.C. Srutton N.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Recombinant enoate reductase from C. thermoaceticum from aerobically grown E. coli host cells was insoluble and enzymatically inactive too, but was expressed to a level of about 20% of total cell protein (data not shown). This is likely due to the different GC content resulting in only 20 regulatory codons identified across the DNA sequence of the enr gene from C. thermoaceticum. However, in anaerobically grown E. colihost cells recombinant enoate reductase was expressed in soluble and enzymatically active form. The recombinant enzyme was purified nearly to homogenity and preliminary studies on characterizations were performed indicating both differences and similarities in properties of the highly conserved enoate reductases from C. tyrobutyricumand C. thermoaceticum. The catalytic activity of recombinant enoate reductase from C. thermoaceticum (2.4 μmol min−1 mg−1) is similar to that of the enzyme isolated from wild type C. tyrobutyricum (10.6 μmol min−1 mg−1). The amino acid sequences predicted by enr genes ofC. tyrobutyricum, C. kluyveri, and C. thermoaceticum indicate that enoate reductases belong to a family of pyridine nucleotide-dependent flavoproteins (Table VII). An alignment of the sequences of enoate reductase from C. tyrobutyricum and the other protein sequences with the exception of old yellow enzyme from yeast is shown in Fig. 5. All sequences showed homology over their entire lengths (29–34% identity to enoate reductase of C. tyrobutyricum). A region with 4 conserved cysteine residues is present in all sequences.

https://openalex.org/W1972335275,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have been shown to synergistically increase tissue factor (TF) expression in endothelial cells; however, the role of the VEGF receptors (KDR, Flt-1, and neuropilin) in this process is unclear. Here we report that VEGF binding to the KDR receptor is necessary and sufficient for the potentiation of TNF-induced TF expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. TF expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. In the absence of TNF-α, wild-type VEGF- or KDR receptor-selective variants induced an approximate 7-fold increase in total TF expression. Treatment with TNF alone produced an approximate 110-fold increase in total TF expression, whereas coincubation of TNF-α with wild-type VEGF- or KDR-selective variants resulted in an approximate 250-fold increase in TF expression. VEGF lacking the heparin binding domain was also able to potentiate TF expression, indicating that heparin-sulfate proteoglycan or neuropilin binding is not required for TF up-regulation. Neither placental growth factor nor an Flt-1-selective variant was capable of inducing TF expression in the presence or absence of TNF. Inhibition of protein-tyrosine kinase or protein kinase C activity significantly blocked the TNF/VEGF potentiation of TF up-regulation, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a protein kinase C activator, increased TF expression. These data demonstrate that KDR receptor signaling governs both VEGF-induced TF expression and the potentiation of TNF-induced up-regulation of TF.

In contrast, stimulation of TNFR80 by a TNFR80-specific TNF mutant did not enhance TF expression. Thus, TNFR60 is the principle receptor involved in the synergistic up-regulation of TF induced by TNF and VEGF. The role that the VEGF receptors, KDR and Flt-1, play in this process is unknown. Therefore, in the present study we have investigated the role of KDR and Flt-1 receptor signaling in TF up-regulation and in its synergy with TNF by using VEGF receptor-selective variants. VEGF and TNF work in concert to synergistically up-regulate TF expression in human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells. Here we demonstrate that KDR receptor signaling is necessary and sufficient for the potentiation of TNF-induced TF up-regulation. Recombinant human VEGF165(rhVEGF165) was produced in Escherichia coli (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The VEGF109, an heparin binding domain (HBD)-deficient variant, was prepared as described previously (28Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. de Vos A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The VEGF receptor-selective variants were prepared as described by Li et al. (14Li B. Fuh G. Meng G. Xin X. Gerritsen M.E. Cunningham B. de Vos A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29823-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, a Flt-1-selective variant (Flt-sel) was created based on a comprehensive mutational analysis of the receptor binding site of VEGF. This variant contains four substitutions (Ile-43 → Ala, Ile-46 → Ala, Gln-79 → Ala, and Ile-83 → Ala) from the wild-type protein and is heparin binding domain-deficient. Flt-sel binds to Flt-1 with wild-type affinity and has 470-fold reduced affinity for KDR binding. In addition, Flt-sel had no effect on autophosphorylation of KDR but significantly induced the secretion of matrix metalloprotease-9 in human aorta smooth muscle cells that express Flt-1 only. Two KDR-selective variants (KDR-sel1 and KDR-sel2) were created by using a competitive phage display strategy. The KDR-sel1 has the HBD, whereas KDR-sel2 is HBD-deficient. These variants have approximately wild-type affinity for KDR but 2000-fold reduced affinity for binding to Flt-1. KDR variants showed activity comparable with the wild-type VEGF in KDR autophosphorylation and EC proliferation assays but had no effect on the secretion of matrix metalloprotease-9. The heterodimeric form of recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was produced in and isolated from Chinese hamster ovary cells as described previously (29Zioncheck T.F. Richardson L. Liu J. Chang L. King K.L. Bennett G.L. Fygedi P. Chamow S.M. Schwall R.H. Stack R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recombinant human TNF-α, fibroblast growth factor basic (FGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, TGF-β2, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). TNF-β and anti-TF antibody (3D1) were from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Genistein, staurosporine, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), PD98059, PP1, and wortmannin were purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All reagents were prepared as 1000× stock solutions unless otherwise specified. HUVEC were purchased from Cell Systems (Kirkland, WA) and maintained as instructed by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were first grown in a T-75 flask. When HUVEC cells reached 70–80% confluency, they were subcultured onto 6-well tissue culture plates for Western blot (WB) analysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). All flasks and culture plates were precoated with an attachment factor provided by the manufacturer. HUVEC cells were used between passages 3 and 8. Fresh medium was replaced every 24 h. For drug treatment, subconfluent cells were switched to a GF/serum-free medium overnight and then treated with VEGF or other drugs as specified. The methods for cell lysis and WB are described in detail elsewhere (30Shen B.-Q. Lee D.Y. Gerber H.P. Keyt B.A. Ferrara N. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29979-29985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin/pepstatin A/aprotinin for 15 min on ice. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Protein concentration in the supernatants was determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). An equal amount of protein was denatured and separated using SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Novex, San Diego, CA), transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and blocked in 5% milk overnight. A monoclonal anti-TF antibody (3D1) was used at a 1:2500 dilution to probe TF protein. A secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and enhanced chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Phamacia Biotech) were used to visualize the TF immunoreactive bands. Multiple exposures of films were obtained to determine the optimal exposure time. In general, the blots for samples that were treated in the presence of TNF-α were exposed to x-ray films for ∼2–5 min, whereas the blots for samples that were treated in the absence of TNF-α were exposed to x-ray films for ∼30–50 min because of lower TF signal. The protein bands were scanned by a densitometer, and the relative intensities were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The relative TF expression was always normalized to controls (no VEGF or TNF) on the same blot with the same exposure. The treated HUVEC cells were washed with a FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and dissociated with versene (Life Technologies, Inc.) or Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies, La Jolla, CA) for 10 min at 37 °C, harvested, pelleted at 1050 rpm for 5 min, and then resuspended in cold FACS buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, filtered) at 3–5 million cells/ml. Cells (0.3–0.5 million) were incubated with 167 nm of 3D1 or anti-GP120 for 1 h at 4 °C on a shaker. When the incubation was complete, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and further incubated with 100 nm fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at 4 °C on a shaker. Cells were washed and resuspended in 500 μl of FACS buffer for FACS analysis. FACS analysis was carried out with a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Data were collected in FL-1 with a 530-nm band pass filter. For each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded. The data were gated on the main population identified on the forward scatter versus side scatter dot plot (80–85% of total events) and analyzed with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) for relative fluorescence intensity. The results are reported as means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was conducted following comparison of results from the VEGF variants in the absence of TNF to the TNF minus control (no VEGF or TNF); similarly, results obtained in the presence of TNF/VEGF variants were compared with the TNF plus control (with TNF but no VEGF). An unpaired Student's t test was used to determine significant differences. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. To investigate the effect of VEGF on TF expression and whether VEGF interacts with TNF in regulating TF expression, subconfluent HUVEC cells were treated with VEGF, TNF-α, or a combination of VEGF and TNF-α for 0 to 9 h. The VEGF concentration was selected based on a dose-response study that showed that 1000 pm of VEGF induced a maximal increase in TF expression (data not shown). The optimal TNF-α concentration (5 ng/ml) was selected based on previously reported studies (26Camera M. Giesen P.L.A. Fallon J. Aufiero B.M. Taubman M. Tremoli E. Nemerson Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27Clauss M. Grell M. Fangmann C. Fiers W. Scheurich P. Risau W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Total TF expression in whole cell lysates was evaluated by WB using a specific anti-human TF antibody. In the absence of TNF-α, VEGF induced a modest time-dependent increase in TF expression (Fig.1, A and B). TF up-regulation was noted at 3 h and reached a peak (7-fold over control) at 6 h post-VEGF exposure. TNF-α treatment resulted in a more rapid and greater increase in TF expression relative to VEGF. The maximal TF expression (110-fold) was observed at 3 h post-TNF-α exposure (Fig. 1, A and B). Coincubation of VEGF with TNF-α produced an even more striking increase in total TF expression. The maximum 270-fold increase occurred at 3 h post-exposure to both agonists (Fig. 1, A andB). The TF up-regulation persisted for at least 9 h. We also investigated the effect of TNF-β, another member of TNF family cytokine, on TF expression in this cell culture model. As shown in Fig.1, C and D, treatment with TNF-β alone also resulted in a time-dependent increase in TF expression, although to a lesser degree than TNF-α (35-fold for TNF-βversus 110-fold TNF-α). When VEGF was coincubated with TNF-β, a maximal of 130-fold increase in TF expression was observed at 9 h post-exposure (Fig. 1, C andD). Taken together, these data suggest that VEGF is capable of interacting with either TNF-α or TNF-β in a synergistic manner to increase TF expression. To elucidate the role of VEGF receptors in the synergistic up-regulation of TF induced by VEGF and TNF concomitant treatment, we treated HUVEC cells with equimolar concentrations of wild-type VEGF-, KDR-, or Flt-1 receptor-selective variants in the presence or absence of TNF-α for 6 h. The VEGF HBD-deficient variants (VEGF109, KDR-sel2) were also used to address the role of the HBD in TF up-regulation. Fig.2, A and B shows a representative WB result and quantification by densitometry of three independent experiments. In the absence of TNF-α, KDR-selective variants induced an increase in total TF expression similar to that induced by wild-type VEGF (both ∼7-fold); in the presence of TNF-α, a more pronounced increase (∼250-fold) in total TF expression was induced by wild-type VEGF- and KDR-selective variants (Fig. 2,A and B). In contrast, the Flt-1-selective variant had no effect on TF expression in either the presence or absence of TNF-α (Fig. 2, A and B). The HBD did not appear to play a significant role in TF up-regulation, as VEGF variants without the HBD (VEGF109 and KDR-sel2) induced an increase in TF expression similar to that induced by VEGF variants with the HBD (VEGF165 and KDR-sel1) (Fig. 2). FACS analysis was used to confirm these observations and to further characterize the subcellular localization of the newly synthesized TF. In the absence of TNF-α, KDR receptor variants induced an increase in cell surface TF expression similar to that induced by wild-type VEGF (∼3-fold) (Fig. 3), and the Flt-1-selective variant had no significant effect (Fig. 3). In a separate experiment, treatment with TNF-α alone induced an ∼10-fold maximal increase in TF fluorescence density (data not shown). When coincubated with TNF-α, wild-type VEGF- and KDR-selective variants both induced an ∼20-fold maximal increase in the cell surface TF expression (Fig. 3). In contrast, Flt-selective variant did not potentiate TNF-α-induced TF expression on the cell surface (Fig. 3). Once again, the HBD did not seem to play a role in up-regulating cell surface TF expression as VEGF variants without HBD (VEGF109and KDR-sel2) induced a similar increase in TF expression as VEGF variants with HBD (VEGF165 and KDR-sel1) (Fig. 3). To further address the role of the downstream signaling pathway following KDR binding and activation in TF up-regulation, several inhibitors to tyrosine kinases, Src kinase, PKC, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) were coincubated with VEGF and TNF. Fig. 4 shows that inhibition of protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) with genistein, a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly blocked VEGF/TNF-induced TF up-regulation. Similarly, inhibition of PKC with staurosporine also blocked VEGF/TNF-induced TF up-regulation. In contrast, treatment of HUVECs with only PMA, a PKC activator, resulted in an increase in TF expression similar to that induced by VEGF/TNF. Inhibition of phospholipase C-γ with PP1 or inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase with PD-98059 only partially blocked VEGF/TNF-induced TF up-regulation. Meanwhile, inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin resulted in an increase in TF expression. These data suggest that both PTK and PKC are involved in VEGF/TNF-induced TF up-regulation and that PI3K may negatively regulate TF expression in ECs. The effect of VEGF on TF expression was also compared with several other GFs including FGF, HGF, EGF, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2. HUVEC cells were treated with equimolar concentrations of VEGF, FGF, HGF, EGF, or TGF-β in either the presence or absence of TNF-α for 6 h. Fig. 5 shows that only VEGF treatment increased TF expression and potentiated TNF-α-induced TF up-regulation, whereas FGF, HGF, EGF, or TGF had little or no significant effect. Tissue factor is a 47-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in coagulation by serving as a cofactor for coagulation factor VII activation. It is also involved in early wound healing, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis (31Decoster E. Cornelis S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Fiers W. J.

Normally, TF is not expressed on the surface of cells that are in direct contact with blood such as the endothelium lining vessels and circulating monocytes; however, growth factors and cytokines may induce TF expression in these cells (25Clauss M. Weich H. Breier G. Knies U. Rockl W. Waltenberger J. Risau W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17629-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 26Camera M. Giesen P.L.A.

Scheurich P. Risau W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HUVEC cells were selected as our model system, because they have been shown to express both KDR and Flt-1 receptors and have been previously used to assess TF regulation (26Camera M. Giesen P.L.A. Fallon J. Aufiero B.M. Taubman M. Tremoli E. Nemerson Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27Clauss M. Grell M. Fangmann C. Fiers W.

VEGF and TNF have been shown to synergistically up-regulate TF expression in endothelial cells, but the role of VEGF receptors in this synergy has not been studied. Therefore, we have 1) investigated the role of the VEGF receptor(s) in TF up-regulation by using VEGF receptor-selective binding variants; 2) determined the contribution of PTK, PKC, and PI3K to VEGF/TNF-induced TF up-regulation; and 3) evaluated the specificity for the effect by comparing the ability of VEGF with various other GFs to up-regulate TF. Our data demonstrate that wild-type VEGF- or KDR-selective variants alone induce a modest increase in both total and cell surface TF expression relative to TNF. In the presence of TNF, wild-type VEGF- and KDR-selective variants both significantly potentiate TNF-induced TF up-regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PTK and PKC signaling pathways are required for this effect. In comparison with other angiogenic growth factors, VEGF is unique in its ability to induce TF up-regulation and synergistically interact with TNF to produce TF. TNF-α and TNF-β are structurally similar, but TNF-α binds to the TNFR60 receptor with higher affinity (31Decoster E. Cornelis S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Fiers W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with this observation in that VEGF/TNF-α induced a higher TF expression relative to VEGF/TNF-β. Previously, Clauss et al. (27Clauss M. Grell M. Fangmann C. Fiers W. Scheurich P. Risau W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and Camera et al. (26Camera M. Giesen P.L.A. Fallon J. Aufiero B.M. Taubman M. Tremoli E. Nemerson Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) reported that VEGF or TNF-α alone had little effect on TF expression in HUVEC, but cells treated with both agonists showed a significant increase in TF expression. Our observations are consistent with these previously published reports in that VEGF synergistically up-regulates TNF-induced TF expression; however, we were able to demonstrate an increase in TF expression with either VEGF or TNF alone. It is well accepted that VEGF exerts its biological effects through the two high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases, KDR and Flt-1, predominately expressed on the vascular endothelial cells (2Ferrara N. Houck K. Jakeman L. Leung D.W. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar, 11Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear which VEGF receptor(s) mediates the synergy between VEGF and TNF with respect to TF up-regulation. To address this question, we have used VEGF receptor-selective variants recently developed by Li et al. (14Li B. Fuh G. Meng G. Xin X. Gerritsen M.E. Cunningham B. de Vos A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29823-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These receptor-selective binding variants have been demonstrated to be highly selective and bioactive (14Li B. Fuh G. Meng G. Xin X. Gerritsen M.E. Cunningham B. de Vos A.M. J. Biol.

Treatment of HUVEC cells with KDR-selective variants resulted in an increase in both total and cell surface TF expression similar to that induced by wild-type VEGF and significantly enhanced TNF-α-induced TF up-regulation (Figs. 2 and 3), whereas the Flt-1-selective binding variant had no significant effect on TF expression in either the presence or a"

Signal peptides exhibit three distinct regions: an amino-terminally charged region, a hydrophobic core, and a polar carboxyl-terminal region containing the cleavage site (1von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar, 2von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 3von Heijne G. Abrahmsen L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Upon entering the ER lumen a glycoprotein must undergo a series of maturation and folding events before it can be transported through the secretory pathway and, eventually, out of the cell. Two early events in the maturation process are the cleavage of signal peptides by the signal peptidase complex (SPC) and the addition of core oligosaccharides to Asn-X-Ser/Thr acceptor tripeptides by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) (4Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Fiedler K. Simons K.

The SPC and OST are integral proteins of the ER membrane. The SPC active site is probably located at the lumenal surface of the membrane, based on the crystal structure of Escherichia coli leader peptidase, a single subunit enzyme that is functionally related to the SPC (7Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In contrast, the active site of the OST is positioned within the lumen, 30–40 Å above the lipid bilayer. This estimate comes from an in vitro study showing that the minimal distance between an Asn-X-Ser/Thr acceptor site and the end of a transmembrane segment of an integral membrane protein required for half-maximal glycosylation is ∼10 residues (8Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secretory proteins prepro-α-factor and preinvertase expressed by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are examples of glycoproteins that contain cleavable signal peptides. Interestingly, both precursors have an acceptor tripeptide located only four amino acids from the signal peptide. Because signal peptides typically contain a hydrophobic core that could possibly pull an acceptor tripeptide close to the surface of the ER membrane and thus away from the OST active site, we used these precursors to test the idea that a signal peptide must be cleaved before a nearby acceptor tripeptide can be glycosylated. The data presented in this paper support this hypothesis, demonstrating that a sequential and dependent interaction exists between the SPC and OST. Genotypes of yeast strains CMYD1, RSY427, PBY408A, HFY402 (9Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol.

The genotype of strain TBY103 is MATa sec23–1 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ 901 suc2-Δ 9 (from Todd Graham, Vanderbilt University), and strain CVY9 is MATα wbp1–1 ura3–52. A description of the plasmid constructs and oligonucleotides used to make site-directed mutations is available upon request. Antibodies were used in the following amounts: anti-HA antibodies (2 μg/3A 600 equivalents of yeast cells), anti-α-factor antibodies (1 μl/1 A 600equivalent of yeast cells) (from Todd Graham), and anti-CPY antibodies (0.5 μl/1 A 600 equivalent of yeast cells) (from Todd Graham). Anti-FLAG antibodies (1 μg/1A 600 equivalent of yeast cells) and protein G-agarose were used instead of agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibodies for native immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Sec11p (10VanValkenburgh C. Chen X. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To generate substrate for the assay, 3 A 600 cell equivalents of strains CMYD1 (sec11)/pXC4 (encoding prepro-α-factor-HA minus sequon 4) and CMYD1 (sec11)/pXC5 (encoding prepro-α-factor-HA minus sequon 38) were grown to log phase at 23 °C. Cells were shifted to 37 °C for 30 min to inactivate the SPC and then were subjected to a 15-min pulse labeling. Substrate was immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions using anti-HA antibodies, and the antibodies were captured using protein G-agarose. 30 μl of SDS (0.1%) was added to the protein G pellet. 3 μl of the suspended protein G pellet was added to each reaction. To generate enzyme, the SPC was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibodies under nondenaturing conditions from 1000 A 600 log phase cell equivalents of strain CVY1-bearing plasmids pCV101 (FLAG-Sec11p) and pCV102 (HA-Spc3p) (10VanValkenburgh C. Chen X. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated SPC bound to protein G-agarose beads was resuspended in 300 μl of a solution containing 75 mm KOAc, pH 8, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine, 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol (11YaDeau J.T. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2928-2934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 27 μl of a protein G suspension containing the SPC was used in each reaction. The reactions were performed for up to 2 h at 16 °C and terminated by boiling in a solution containing 8 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (4×). One-half of each reaction was loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. The substrate and enzyme suspensions were stable for at least 3 days on ice. Pulse-labeling methods have been described (9Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29092-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of proteins under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions has been described (10VanValkenburgh C. Chen X. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We took two approaches to determine whether glycosylation was dependent on signal peptidase function. The first was to inhibit the SPC using the sec11mutation (12Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and then ask whether glycosylation was, in turn, inhibited in the yeast S. cerevisiae. The substrate employed was the precursor to α factor, a yeast mating pheromone. Prepro-α-factor is translocated across the ER membrane and cleaved by the SPC, generating pro-α-factor (13Julius D. Schekman R. Thorner J. Cell. 1984; 36: 309-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Pro-α-factor has a total of three Asn-linked glycosylation sites. The first site, sequon 4, is placed only four amino acids downstream of the signal peptide (Fig.1). A temperature-sensitive sec11 mutant expressing prepro-α-factor was grown to log phase at the permissive temperature (23 °C) and shifted to 30 °C for 15 min to inactivate Sec11p, the catalytic subunit of the SPC (10VanValkenburgh C. Chen X. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min, and proteins were precipitated from cell extracts using anti-α-factor antibodies. Yeast strains and their genotypes are listed in the figure legends and under “Experimental Procedures.” Controls, which were treated identically, included a wbp1 mutant containing a temperature-sensitive defect in the Wbp1p subunit of the OST protein complex (15te Heesen S. Janetzky B. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2071-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and a sec23 mutant containing a temperature-sensitive defect in Sec23p that is required for vesicular transport to the Golgi apparatus (16Hicke L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The sec23 mutant was needed to visualize fully glycosylated pro-α-factor (Fig.2 A, lane 4), because almost no α factor precursor could be detected in wild-type (wt) MATα cells (lane 1) because of the efficient transport and proteolytic processing of this protein in the Golgi stacks. Two major forms of the α factor precursor were present in thesec11 mutant (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), one having all three of its acceptor sites modified and one containing only two Asn-linked glycans. The presence of this latter species suggested that the sec11 mutation inhibited glycosylation of prepro-α-factor. Two additional underglycosylated polypeptides appeared in wbp1 cells (Fig. 2 A,lane 2), one containing a single Asn-linked glycan and one lacking carbohydrate. Because these latter two forms were absent insec11 cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), the data suggest that addition of carbohydrate to only one acceptor site was inhibited by the sec11 mutation. Because of its proximity to the signal peptide, we reasoned that sequon 4 of prepro-α-factor may be glycosylated inefficiently in thesec11 mutant. We therefore repeated our analysis using a protein lacking an acceptor site next to the signal peptide. The precursor to carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a vacuolar protease, contains four Asn-X-Ser/Thr tripeptides (17Valls L.A. Hunter C.P. Rothman J.H. Stevens T.H. Cell. 1987; 48: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Importantly, the first is separated from the signal peptide by 104 residues. When this protein was examined by pulse labeling, the fully glycosylated species, and no apparent underglycosylated species, was present in the sec11mutant (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the sec11 mutation appeared to inhibit glycosylation of prepro-α-factor but not preproCPY. The second approach to determine whether glycosylation was dependent on signal peptidase function was to construct mutations that changed Ala to Asn at the −1 position and Ala to Gln at the −3 position in prepro-α-factor (Fig. 1). These positions in signal peptides usually contain small uncharged amino acids and are important for signal peptide cleavage (1von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar, 2von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 3von Heijne G. Abrahmsen L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For convenience, we introduced a sequence encoding the HA epitope (18Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) at the carboxyl terminus of prepro-α-factor, and we placed the construct under control of theADH1 promoter (19Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3018-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which produced levels of protein that were ∼50% of that synthesized by the natural promoter (data not shown). The HA-tagged constructs containing and lacking the A−1N and A−3Q mutations were introduced into wt and sec23 mutant strains. The pulse-labeling analysis presented in Fig. 2 C shows that two differentially glycosylated forms of the α-factor-HA precursor were present in wt cells when signal peptide cleavage was inhibited by the A−1N and A−3Q mutations (lane 3). As expected, pro-α-factor-HA that lacked the A−1N and A−3Q mutations was present primarily in the form containing three Asn-linked glycans insec23 mutant cells (Fig. 2 C, lane 2), and low levels of pro-α-factor-HA were present in wt cells (lane 1). Evidence that the A−1N and A−3Q mutations inhibited cleavage came from the fact that prepro-α-factor-HA containing these mutations was retained in the ER (Fig.2 C, compare lanes 1 and 3). Further evidence was that the protein present in Fig.2 C, lane 2 migrated more slowly on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels than the corresponding protein in lane 3. We have reported previously that prepro-α-factor migrates faster than its signal peptide cleaved form in our gel system (9Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29092-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 2 C thus demonstrate that the introduced signal peptide mutations inhibited cleavage of prepro-α-factor, which caused a defect in its glycosylation. The data presented thus far suggest that the presence of an uncleaved signal peptide inhibited glycosylation of prepro-α-factor, probably at only one of its three acceptor sites. To identify the site affected, we made three constructs, each containing one of the following site-directed mutations, T6A, T40A, and T50A. These mutations disrupted sequon 4, sequon 38, and sequon 48, respectively. The constructs were expressed in the sec11 mutant, and cells were subjected to pulse labeling. Consistent with the results shown above, prepro-α-factor-HA lacking an acceptor site mutation exhibited two glycosylated forms in the sec11 mutant, one containing 3 glycans and one containing 2 glycans (Fig. 3, lane 1). Prepro-α-factor-HA minus sequon 4 exhibited primarily the form containing two Asn-linked glycans, which was fully glycosylated for this construct (Fig. 3, lane 2). Eliminating either sequon 38 (Fig. 3, lane 3) or sequon 48 (lane 4) from prepro-α-factor-HA resulted in two proteins appearing, one containing two Asn-linked glycans and one containing only one glycan. These data therefore demonstrated that efficient glycosylation of sequon 4 in prepro-α-factor-HA was dependent on cleavage of the signal peptide. A protein smear, whose apparent molecular mass was 1–2 kDa greater than the major protein species, was evident above some of the bands depicted in Fig. 3. As discussed below, this heterogeneity was probably due to a slow transport of this protein through the Golgi stacks, concomitant with modification of the attached carbohydrate. In searching the Saccharomyces genome data base, we found that preinvertase contained a glycosylation site also positioned four amino acids downstream of the signal peptide (Fig. 1). Invertase has a total of 13 Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons. Therefore, to reduce the complexity of our analysis, we prepared a truncated DNA fragment encoding the signal peptide and the first 93 residues of the mature portion of invertase. The truncated protein contained three acceptor sites located 4, 45, and 78 amino acids downstream of the signal peptide. The truncation also contained a carboxyl-terminal HA epitope, and transcription was placed under control of theADH1 promoter. We prepared a series of site-directed mutations, T6A, T47A, and S80A, that eliminated each of the glycosylation sites in the invertase fragment. These constructs were introduced into sec23 andsec11 mutant strains, and log phase cells were analyzed by pulse labeling. The data presented in Fig.4 demonstrate that efficient glycosylation of sequon 4 of the preinvertase fragment was dependent on cleavage of the signal peptide. Our data have thus far revealed a sequential interaction between the SPC and OST. What is the functional significance of this interaction? We reasoned that reversing the order of action of the SPC and OST may cause a dead end in the maturation pathway. That is, attachment of carbohydrate only four amino acids from the signal peptide may produce a molecule whose attached glycan sterically inhibits cleavage. To test this, we devised anin vitro assay that used uncleaved prepro-α-factor-HA immunoprecipitated from the sec11 mutant and the SPC immunoprecipitated from wild-type yeast overexpressing the SPC (see “Experimental Procedures”). The specific substrates employed were prepro-α-factor-HA minus sequon 38 and prepro-α-factor-HA minus sequon 4, because we could easily resolve their cleaved and uncleaved forms on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Upon mixing enzyme and substrate, we observed that the signal peptide of prepro-α-factor-HA minus sequon 4 was cleaved by the SPC, yielding ∼30% pro-α-factor-HA after 2 h at 16 °C (Fig.5, lanes 1–4). This protein lacked an amino-terminal glycosylation site and therefore served as a positive control. Prepro-α-factor-HA minus sequon 38 exhibited two differentially glycosylated forms because it was immunoprecipitated from the sec11 mutant (Fig. 5, lane 6). The higher molecular weight form resulted from carbohydrate attachment to sequon 4 and sequon 48, whereas the lower molecular weight form was modified only at sequon 48. Not surprisingly, the form containing only one glycan (prepro-α-factor-HA + 1 glycan) was cleaved with an efficiency similar to that detected for the above-mentioned positive control (Fig. 5, lanes 6–9). Interestingly, the signal peptide was similarly cleaved from the twice-modified form (prepro-α-factor-HA + 2 glycans) (Fig. 5, lanes 6–9), indicating that attachment of carbohydrate to the Asn residue of sequon 4 (Fig. 1) did not prevent cleavage. Prepro-α-factor-HA + 1 glycan from the sec11 mutant migrated as a series of closely spaced bands (see Fig. 5, lane 9), resolved on this gel because of the absence of sodium salicylate treatment (compare Fig. 5 to Fig. 3). In contrast, a small amount of pro-α-factor + 1 glycan was present in the sec23mutant, and this protein was represented by a single species (Fig. 5,lane 10). Because this protein comigrated with the fastest migrating form of pro-α-factor + 1 glycan in the sec11mutant (Fig. 5, lane 9), we believe the multiple forms present in the sec11 mutant represent a series of carbohydrate modifications occurring because of a slow transport of this abnormal protein through the Golgi stacks. We also detected a small amount of a second cleavage product (Fig. 5, lanes 3,4, 8, and 9; indicated by astar). This product appears to represent cleavage by the SPC at an uncharacterized site downstream of the signal peptide. In this paper we have investigated the functional relationship between two enzymes that operate early in the secretory pathway, the SPC, which cleaves amino-terminal signal peptides, and OST, which attaches the preassembled oligosaccharide Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to asparagines in Asn-X-Ser/Thr tripeptides. We have examined two secretory proteins that have naturally occurring glycosylation sites located only four amino acids downstream of their signal peptides, the precursors to α factor and invertase (Fig. 1). Prepro-α-factor contains three Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons. Preinvertase contains 13 Asn-X-Ser/Thr tripeptides; however, to simplify our analysis, the gene encoding preinvertase was truncated to encode a protein containing only the first three acceptor tripeptides. Our data show that addition of carbohydrate to sequon 4, the amino-terminal acceptor site in both prepro-α-factor and the preinvertase fragment, is partially inhibited when cleavage of the signal peptide is inhibited within cells of the yeast S. cerevisiae (Figs. 2, A and C, 3, and 4). The remaining acceptor sites in prepro-α-factor and the preinvertase fragment are glycosylated independently of cleavage. However, all three sites in prepro-α-factor and the preinvertase fragment can be glycosylated when the signal peptide is cleaved. These results support the hypothesis of Nilsson and von Heijne (8Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that glycosylation of an Asn-X-Ser/Thr acceptor site located close to a signal peptide may be dependent on cleavage of the signal peptide. The probable positioning of the SPC active site near the surface of the ER membrane (7Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and the OST active site 30–40 Å above the lipid bilayer (8Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provides a likely explanation for the observed sequential interaction between the SPC and OST. As illustrated in Fig.6, a hydrophobic signal peptide is probably able to pull a nearby Asn-X-Ser/Thr tripeptide toward the surface of the ER membrane and away from the OST active site. Cleavage of the signal peptide is thus a prerequisite for efficient glycosylation of an acceptor tripeptide located close to a signal peptide. A similar situation has been found to exist in integral membrane proteins. Asn-X-Ser/Thr tripeptides are ∼50% glycosylated if placed 10 residues from a transmembrane segment as monitored by anin vitro assay (8Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or ∼5 residues from a transmembrane segment in Xenopus oocytes (21Hasler U. Greasley P.J. von Heijne G. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29011-29022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In our study, ∼50% of prepro-α-factor (Fig. 3) and ∼75% of the preinvertase fragment (Fig. 4) were glycosylated at sequon 4 in the absence of signal peptide cleavage. Based on the integral membrane protein model, one interpretation of this result is that the partial glycosylation seen here reflects the relative distances between sequon 4 and the membrane-spanning portions of the signal peptides of prepro-α-factor and the preinvertase fragment. However, most signal peptides exhibit less hydrophobic character than bona fide transmembrane segments. Indeed, using a standard cell fractionation analysis, we have discovered that 60–70% of prepro-α-factor can be found in the water-soluble and carbonate-extracted fractions. 2N. Green, unpublished results. It is therefore plausible that partitioning of prepro-α-factor and the preinvertase fragment out of the membrane could contribute to the partial glycosylation seen. We do not believe, however, that an abundance of uncleaved precursors leave the ER membrane normally, because most signal peptides are processed during or immediately after translocation in cells expressing signal peptidase activity. At present, the functional significance for the observed sequential interaction between the SPC and OST is unclear. One idea that we had was that addition of carbohydrate to an Asn residue located only four amino acids from the signal peptide may prevent cleavage because of a steric effect. We have shown, however, that glycosylation of sequon 4 prior to cleavage does not prevent cleavage of the signal peptide of prepro-α-factor, based on an in vitro assay (Fig. 5). To further assess the functional significance of the sequential interaction between the SPC and OST, a key issue is whether polypeptides entering the ER begin the maturation process before their signal peptides are cleaved. If cleavage is the first event following translocation, then a sequential interaction between the SPC and OST may be fortuitous and have no bearing on the maturation process. If other maturation events precede cleavage, then the maturation process could be dramatically influenced by a functional interaction between the SPC and OST. For example, if acceptor sites distal to the signal peptide can be glycosylated before cleavage (see Fig. 6), then our observed interaction between the SPC and OST could affect the order in which acceptor sites are glycosylated and, thus, the overall folding pathway.

SERT cDNAs have been cloned and sequenced from a number of species, as well as from several different human tissues (for reviews, see Refs. 1Rudnick G. Clark J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev.

The DNA and predicted amino acid sequences of these SERT isoforms are highly homologous, not only to each other but also to the transporters for the other biogenic amines, dopamine and norepinephrine. The biogenic amine transporters in turn belong to a larger superfamily of neurotransmitter and bioactive amine transporters, each of which couples uptake to the transmembrane Na+ and Cl− gradients. Hydropathy analysis predicts that these transporters contain 12 membrane-spanning α-helices, connected by hydrophilic loops lying inside and outside the cell (Fig. 1). Our group and others are using site-directed mutagenesis to test these structural predictions about SERT and its relatives, and to correlate structural information with the physical mechanisms by which the Na+ and Cl− gradients are coupled to the inward movement of serotonin.

Recently, we reported the results of random site-directed mutagenesis on the residues predicted to make up TM7 (14Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28098-28106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This study identified a stripe of functionally important amino acid residues that runs along one side of the predicted TM7 α-helix. Experimental evidence suggested that these residues might be involved in Na+binding or in the coupling of Na+ to serotonin transport. One possibility was that the critical stripe represents one wall of a water-filled pore or channel, through which ions and/or serotonin enter the cell. To examine this possibility, we decided to test the accessibility of cysteine substitutions in TM7 to the aqueous environment, using membrane-impermeant methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents. MTS reagents have previously been used to investigate the external accessibility of cysteines in both the serotonin (8Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1608-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The reaction of these reagents with cysteine residues introduces a positively or negatively charged group into the protein's structure (21Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). If the reacting cysteine lies in a functionally important position, transporter activity will be sensitive to the modification. In the course of the random mutagenesis study, we isolated five mutants containing cysteine substitutions in TM7: N368C/C369G, F373C, F377C, F380C, and Y385C/I379V (two mutants contain multiple substitutions due to the random mutagenesis protocol) (14Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28098-28106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The predicted positions of these cysteine substitutions with respect to the membrane ranged from Asn-368, which is predicted to lie well within the membrane, to Tyr-385, which is predicted to lie near the end of the helix and thus might be exposed to the external environment. Sensitivity to hydrophilic reagents at Tyr-385 might allow us to define the end of the membrane-spanning helix. Sensitivity at other positions might indicate the presence of a water-filled pore or, alternatively, that this region of the protein does not lie buried in the membrane as predicted by hydropathy analysis. Here we report the results of these studies, which have led to the conclusion that the critical stripe residues of TM7 do not form part of a water-filled pore, since they do not appear to be accessible to hydrophilic MTS reagents. Our results suggest instead that TM7 is involved in the propagation of conformational changes occurring after ion binding to the transporter, perhaps as part of the translocation mechanism. The critical stripe region is likely to represent a close contact region between TM7 and one or more other TMs. Plasmid DNA was prepared using Qiagen Midiprep kits (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA.) Restriction fragments were purified from agarose gels using the Geneclean kit (Bio-101, Inc., Vista, CA). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. The plasmid pRSTag carries a cDNA encoding the rat brain serotonin transporter, with the addition of sequences encoding a c-Myc epitope tag at the N terminus and a FLAG epitope tag at the C terminus (22Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used site-directed mutagenesis to add a silent mutation at base pair 1273, creating a new, unique Mfe I restriction site (plasmid pRSTagM). The random mutants used in this paper were created by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis, using pRSTagM as a template (described in detail in Ref. 14Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28098-28106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We added the C109A mutation to selected TM7 mutants by removing a 623-base pairEco RV-Rsr II fragment, which encodes the N terminus and TMs 1–3, and replacing it with the equivalent fragment from the C109A mutant (17Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). After ligation, colonies were picked and minipreps prepared using the boiling water lysis method (23Holmes D. Quigley M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Each mutant plasmid was screened for the presence or absence of diagnostic restriction sites, indicating the presence or absence of the desired mutations. The presence of the C109A mutation was confirmed by the absence of a native Nde I site, while the TM7 mutations were confirmed by the presence of the Mfe I site, and the absence or presence of Bsp MI, Ssp I, or Hin dIII sites as appropriate (also as described in Ref. 14Penado K.M.

A large plasmid preparation of each positive colony was then made and re-tested for the presence or absence of the screening sites. Plasmid preparations were also tested with the diagnostic enzymes Pvu II andPst I to detect any major rearrangements, insertions, or deletions in the SERT cDNA. The expression system used has been described in detail elsewhere (24Elroy-Stein O. Fuerst T.R. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6126-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 25Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmid pRSTagM contains a promoter for T7 RNA polymerase upstream from the rat brain SERT cDNA. This promoter was used to express wild type and mutant SERTs in the vaccinia/T7 polymerase/HeLa cell system. HeLa cells were plated in 48-well plates at 50% confluence and allowed to grow overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.). The next day they were infected with a vaccinia virus strain, VTF-7 (25Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which makes T7 RNA polymerase (added to the cells in 50 μl/well DMEM without serum). After a 15-min incubation with the virus at 37 °C, the cells were transiently transfected with wild type and mutant plasmids (400 ng of plasmid DNA and 1.2 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) per well in 100 μl of DMEM without serum). Wild type SERT, no plasmid (mock-transfected) controls, and mutants were each transfected in duplicate wells. [3H]Serotonin transport assays were carried out the next day between 19 and 24 h after infection. For the standard assay, cells were washed twice with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2 (PBSCM). Transport was measured by incubating the cells with 14.6 nm [1,2-3H]serotonin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; NET-498) in 80 μl of PBSCM for 10 min at room temperature, an interval previously determined to include only the initial, linear phase of transport. Each well was washed very quickly three times with 200 μl of ice-cold PBS. The cells were lysed in 300 μl of 1% SDS, transferred to scintillation vials, and counted in 3 ml of Optifluor (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). Mutants were tested for their sensitivity to the MTS reagents ([2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) and sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES); both reagents obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals, Ontario, Canada). Cells were preincubated with these reagents for 10 min at room temperature, in buffer K (1.4 mmKH2PO4, 4.3 mmK2HPO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) with the addition of 150 mm NaCl, 150 mm LiCl, or 150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride (NMDG-Cl). After preincubation, each well was washed rapidly three times with 200 μl of room temperature PBSCM. The third wash was left in the wells until the transport assay was performed in PBSCM as described above. In control wells, cells were incubated with the same concentrations of ions but without MTS reagent. For later experiments in which the Na+ and Li+ concentrations were varied, NMDG-Cl was used as a compensating ion to maintain the same total ionic strength in all wells. In these experiments, the cells were washed twice with 200 μl of K buffer containing 300 mm NMDG-Cl before the MTS preincubation. In all experiments, MTS reagents were freshly weighed out and dissolved in distilled deionized H2O immediately prior to addition to the cells. Experiments measuring the Na+ and Li+dependence of the MTSET reaction were repeated two to four times. Curves were fitted to obtain K 12 values using the Origin plotting program (MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA). The values reported represent the means and standard deviations of values obtained from several experiments. Figures show representative experiments. TM7 mutants containing novel cysteines were also tested for their ability to react with the biotinylating reagent, MTSEA-biotin (Toronto Research Chemicals). HeLa cells were grown and transfected as described above except in 12-well plates, with appropriate scaling up of DNA and other reagents. Eighteen to 24 h after transfection, each well was washed twice with 1.2 ml of room temperature PBSCM. After removing the second wash, 450 μl of PBSCM was added, and 50 μ l of MTSEA-biotin (10 mm, dissolved in water) was added to each well. Cells were allowed to incubate with MTSEA-biotin for 10 min at room temperature before washing the reagent away three times with 600 μl of room temperature PBSCM. The MTSEA-biotin-labeled cells were lysed in 120 μl of SDS-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Sigma Protease Inhibitor Mixture (P8340)) for 30 min. on ice. The cell lysate was diluted to 1.2 ml with ice-cold lysis buffer (same as SDS-lysis buffer above but without SDS or protease inhibitors). The biotinylated proteins were recovered by overnight incubation with 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads/sample (Pierce) at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The next day, the beads were washed once with 1.2 ml of lysis buffer, once with 1.2 ml of high salt lysis buffer (same as lysis buffer except with 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100) and twice with 1.2 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The biotinylated proteins were eluted using 100 μ l of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% mercaptoethanol, 0.003% bromphenol blue) for 10 min at 85 °C. One fifth of each sample was applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE gel (Laemmli protocol (Ref. 27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar)) and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting (Towbin protocol (Ref. 28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar)). Wild type SERT and mutant transporters were detected in the mixture of biotinylated proteins using the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) directed against the FLAG epitope tag located at the C terminus. Blots were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight with gentle rocking, washed, and then further incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce). After further washing, bands were detected by chemiluminescence using Super Signal West Pico (Pierce). MTSEA-biotinylated samples were compared with two controls: NHS-SS-biotinylated samples and total cell expression. Sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (NHS-SS-biotin; Pierce) was used to detect the total surface expression of each transporter, as described in Ref. 26Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar. Total cell expression levels were determined without biotinylation by lysing cells directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heating to 85 °C for 10 min., and running them on the gel without further sample preparation. As described in the Introduction, we had previously isolated by random mutagenesis five mutants containing cysteine substitutions in TM7: Y385C/I379V, F380C, F377C, F373C, and N368C/C369G (positions shown in Fig. 1). Wild type SERT, although containing 18 native cysteine residues, is resistant to the membrane-impermeant reagents MTSET or MTSES at physiological Na+ concentrations. In the presence of Li+, SERT becomes sensitive to both reagents. This sensitivity in Li+ has been traced to a native cysteine residue, Cys-109, which lies in extracellular loop 1 (EL1) between TMs 1 and 2 (17Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). By testing the mutants in Na+, where the wild type is insensitive, we could detect any new sensitivity caused by the presence of the cysteine substitutions, which could mean that these residues were exposed to reaction with the MTS reagents. However, it was also possible that cysteine mutations in TM7 might make the transporter sensitive by changing the structure of SERT so that a previously inaccessible native cysteine (or cysteines) became exposed. Due to the large number of mutants isolated in the random mutagenesis project, we also had at least one noncysteine substitution at each of the five positions to use as controls for this possibility. These controls were: Y385N, F380Y, F377Y, F373Y, and N368I (the single mutations C369G and I379V were also tested separately and found to have no effect on SERT sensitivity to MTS reagents; data not shown). Cells expressing TM7 cysteine mutants, noncysteine control mutants, or the wild type transporter were pretreated with MTSET or MTSES in the presence of 150 mm NaCl, 150 mm NMDG-Cl, or 150 mm LiCl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After pretreatment, unreacted reagents and the salts were washed away, and [3H]serotonin uptake measured under normal, high Na+ conditions. Fig. 2 shows the results of these experiments, using 1 mm MTSET (solid bars) or 2 mm MTSES (hatched bars). As had been shown previously (17Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), wild type SERT was highly sensitive to MTSET or MTSES in the presence of Li+ but not in Na+(panels C and A). Wild type SERT was also resistant to both reagents in NMDG (panel B), indicating that it is the presence of Li+rather than the absence of Na+ that results in MTS sensitivity. Panel A shows that, in Na+, all of the TM7 cysteine mutants were more sensitive than wild type to one or both reagents, albeit to varying degrees. Mutants Y385C/I379V and N368C/C369G were most sensitive to MTSET, while mutant F380C was most sensitive to MTSES. A similar pattern was found for these mutants in the presence of NMDG (panel B). In Li+ (panel C), all of the mutants were highly sensitive to MTSET, in all cases much more than wild type. Two mutants, F380C and F373C, also showed a much higher than wild type sensitivity to MTSES. The enhanced sensitivity of the TM7 cysteine mutants, especially in Na+ and NMDG, would seem to suggest that the novel cysteines in TM7 were accessible to reaction with the MTS reagents. However, Fig. 2 (panels D–F) shows that in many cases the noncysteine control mutants were also more sensitive than wild type to the MTS reagents. In Na+, mutant F380Y was more sensitive than both wild type and its cysteine-containing counterpart F380C, to both reagents (panels A and D). In NMDG, F380Y and F377Y were more sensitive to MTSET than both wild type and their counterparts F380C and F377C (panels B and E). In Li+, all of the noncysteine TM7 mutants except Y385N show the same enhanced sensitivities as the TM7 cysteine mutants. These results suggest that it is not the presence of novel cysteines in the TM7 mutants that confers enhanced MTS sensitivity, but rather that mutations in TM7 disturb the structure of SERT to expose a previously unexposed native cysteine or cysteines to these reagents. The observation that Li+ even further enhanced the sensitivity of the TM7 mutants suggested that the newly exposed native cysteine could be Cys-109, previously identified in wild type SERT as the source of its sensitivity in Li+. We tested this possibility by incorporating the C109A mutation into all of the TM7 cysteine mutants. The C109A mutation was added by replacement of a restriction fragment in the SERT cDNA (described under “Experimental Procedures”). For the most part, the Cys-109-less mutants retained a significant portion of the transport activity found in the parent mutants (Table I). The results of MTSET and MTSES treatment of these mutants are shown in Fig.3 (panels B andD), compared with wild type, the C109A construct alone, and the parent mutants (panels A and C). In all TM7 cysteine mutants, removal of Cys-109 resulted in nearly complete loss of sensitivity to the MTS reagents. This was true for both reagents and under all three ionic conditions. The C109A mutation was also incorporated into the noncysteine TM7 control mutants, resulting in the same complete loss of MTS sensitivity in these mutants (data not shown). These results indicate that Cys-109 was the major source of enhanced MTS sensitivity in the TM7 mutants, whether they contained novel cysteines or not.Table ITransport activities of mutant SERTsMutantTransport activity% wild typeY385C/I379V87 ± 7Y385C/I379V/C109A70 ± 4F380C22 ± 8F380C/C109A14 ± 2F377C67 ± 18F377C/C109A72 ± 7F373C76 ± 21F373C/C109A46 ± 6N368C/C369G20 ± 4N368C/C369G/C109A12 ± 3C109A89 ± 5Wild type and mutant transporters were assayed for serotonin transport activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Wild type and mutant transporters were assayed for serotonin transport activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We examined the concentration dependence of MTSET and MTSES reaction with two mutants, Y385C/I379V and F380Y. Mutant Y385C/I379V was of particular interest because position 385 is predicted to lie near the end of the TM7 α-helix, perhaps accessible to the external environment. It seemed possible that this residue might react with MTS reagents at higher concentrations, if tested in a C109A background to eliminate Cys-109 as a source of sensitivity. Mutant F380Y was investigated to learn more about its very high sensitivity to these reagents. Fig.4 shows the effects of increasing concentrations of MTSET (A) or MTSES (B), in 150 mm LiCl, on the activity of these mutants and wild type SERT. In the wild type background (Cys-109 present), the two mutants showed very different patterns of concentration dependence. Mutant F380Y, as expected, showed a very steep concentration dependence for both reagents, while Y385C/I379V showed a concentration dependence similar to wild type. Mutant Y385C/I379V/C109A remained completely resistant to both reagents even at very high concentrations, up to 5 mm for MTSET and 2.5 mm for MTSES (complete curves not shown). The same was true of F380Y/C109A, as expected since it does not contain any novel cysteines. These results reinforce the conclusion of Fig. 3, that the major source of MTS sensitivity in both these mutants is due to reaction with Cys-109. The cysteine at position 385 does not appear to react with MTS reagents, even at very high concentrations. We further studied the dependence of the reaction between MTSET and Cys-109 on Na+ and Li+ concentrations, using NMDG to maintain the same ionic strength in all samples (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 5shows the effects of changing the ionic conditions on the rate of MTSET inactivation of the wild type (panels A andD), F380Y (panels B and E), and Y385C/I379V (panels C and F). After MTSET preincubation in the indicated salt concentrations, the unreacted reagents and salts were washed away and transport measured under high Na+ conditions. MTSET-treated wells were compared with control wells that were subjected only to the varying salt conditions without the addition of MTSET. We chose two MTSET concentrations for each mutant and the wild type: a low concentration at which inhibition was limited, and a high concentration at which inhibition was complete (both as observed in 150 mm LiCl; see Fig. 4 A). These concentrations allowed us to observe whether the ions could accelerate or reduce the rate of MTSET inhibition. The results for wild type SERT are shown in panels A and D. Wild type SERT was equally insensitive to MTSET in all concentrations of Na+, at all MTSET concentrations tried (up to 5 mm). As expected, Li+ increased the sensitivity of the wild type transporter. However, this effect was apparent only at higher concentrations of MTSET (panel D; results for 0.5 and 1 mm MTSET were similar to the curve shown here for 5 mm MTSET.) MTSET at 0.05 mm had little or no effect on wild type SERT regardless of the Li+concentration (panel A). At 5 mmMTSET, Li+ increased the rate of inactivation in a saturable, concentration-dependent fashion, with aK 12 of 252 ± 48 mm. The F380Y mutant, shown in panels B andE, revealed a very different phenotype. F380Y is highly sensitive to MTSET when treated in NMDG, unlike the wild type (Fig.2 E). At a low concentration of MTSET (0.05 mm), the rate of inactivation in NMDG was low but measurable (panel B, 0 mm data point). This reaction rate was increased dramatically by increasing concentrations of Li+ (panel B). At a high concentration of MTSET (1 mm), the inactivation rate in NMDG was quite high already (panel E, 0 mm data point). Under these conditions, F380Y in NMDG was completely inhibited within the 10-min time interval, so any further stimulatory effect of Li+ could not be observed and no Li+ curve is shown. However, we did observe a strong protective effect of increasing concentrations of Na+(panel E). This is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2 (D–F), which shows that F380Y is much less sensitive to MTSET in 150 mm NaCl than it is in NMDG-Cl or LiCl. The stimulatory effect of Li+ on MTSET inactivation of F380Y, observed"

In the present study, we performed experiments with Aβ and calcitonin, another amyloid-forming peptide, to examine the role of G protein activation in amyloid toxicity. We demonstrated that the peptides, when prepared under conditions that promoted β-sheet and amyloid fibril (or protofibril) formation, increased high affinity GTPase activity, but the nonamyloidogenic peptides had no discernible effects on GTP hydrolysis. These increases in GTPase activity were correlated to toxicity. In addition, G protein inhibitors significantly reduced the toxic effects of the amyloidogenic Aβ and calcitonin peptides. Our results further indicated that the amyloidogenic peptides significantly increased GTPase activity of purified Gαo and Gαi subunits and that the effect was not receptor-mediated. Collectively, these results imply that the amyloidogenic structure, regardless of the actual peptide or protein sequence, may be sufficient to cause toxicity and that toxicity is mediated, at least partially, through G protein activation.

Various research groups have hypothesized potential molecular mechanisms of β-amyloid toxicity, but there is no consensus. Cellular responses to Aβ that have been postulated to result in toxicity encompass destabilization of calcium homeostasis, membrane depolarization, increased vulnerability to excitotoxins, increased membrane permeability due to free radical generation, blockage or functional loss of potassium channels, and direct disruption of membrane integrity (17Busciglio J.

Westermark P. Natvig J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 143: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The fibrils of human calcitonin have also been shown to be neurotoxic (44Schubert D. Behl C.

A. 1999; 96: 9989-9990Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), suggesting that the amyloidoses may possess a shared mechanism of toxicity related to their secondary and macromolecular structures. To explore if a common, fundamental mechanism of toxicity exists in the amyloidoses, we examined the structure-function relationships of several synthetic Aβ sequences, Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(25–35), Aβ-(1–16), and bovine calcitonin. We were able to manipulate the secondary and macromolecular structures of these peptides to produce stable amyloid and nonamyloid structures. With these model systems, we demonstrated that the peptides in an amyloid state (with high β-sheet content and the ability to bind Congo Red) altered G protein activity associated with both cell membrane extracts and purified Gα subunits. We showed that the abilities of the peptides to induce GTPase activation were correlated with their toxicities, and the neurotoxicities of the peptides were attenuated by specific and nonspecific GTPase inhibitors. In addition, we demonstrated that significant GTPase activities were still induced even when the cell surface receptors were removed with a nonspecific protease. These results suggest that G protein activation, possibly induced via a protein-membrane interaction, plays an important role in the toxicity of Aβ and other amyloid-forming proteins. Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(25–35), and Aβ-(1–16) were purchased from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA), and bovine calcitonin was obtained from Sigma. ATP and GTP were purchased from Aldrich, and [γ-32P]GTP was from ICN Biochemicals (Irvine, CA). Suramin and Pronase were acquired from Calbiochem and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Purified 1,2-dipalmytoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and cholesterol were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The XK16/70 column and Superfine Sephadex G-50 for size exclusion were acquired from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Purified Go and Gi α subunits and epinephrine were purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Sigma. The Aβ peptides were prepared analogously to established methods in the toxicity and structural literature for forming β-sheet structures and fibril formations (47Gorevic P.D. Castano E.M. Sarma R. Frangione B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 48Shen C.L. Fitzgerald M.C. Murphy R.M. Biophys.

After incubating for 1 h at 25 °C, the peptide stock solutions were diluted to concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.01 m NaH2PO4, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4) with antibiotics. These solutions were rotated on a model RD4524 rotator (Glas-col, Terre Haute, IN) at 60 rpm at 25 °C for 24 h. The peptides were then diluted to final concentrations of 20 μm in sterile medium and rotated for an additional 24 h prior to being added to the culture wells or plates for the toxicity and GTP studies. Bovine calcitonin was directly dissolved in various solvents and buffers at concentrations of 40 and 80 μm. CD measurements of the solutions were recorded 2–24 h later on a model 62DS spectrometer (Aviv Instruments, Lakewood, NJ) at 25 °C using a bandwidth of 1.0 nm, a step interval of 0.5 nm, and an averaging time of 2 s. A 0.01-cm quartz cell was used for the far-UV (190–250 nm) measurements. The instrument was calibrated usingd(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. Three scans each of duplicate samples were measured and averaged. Control buffer and solvent scans were run in duplicate, averaged, and then subtracted from the sample spectra. Spectra were analyzed using the secondary structural parameters reported by Chang (51Chang C.T. Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) to ascertain the sample percentages of α-helix, β-sheet, β-turn, and random-coil. To assess the presence of amyloid fibrils in the calcitonin solutions, Congo Red binding studies were performed. Congo Red dye was dissolved in PBS to a final concentration of 112 μm. Congo Red absorbances of the calcitonin solutions and free dye controls were determined by adding Congo Red to a final concentration of 12 μm and acquiring spectral measurements from 300 to 900 nm at 25 °C on a model 420 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Spectral Instruments, Tucson, AZ) (52Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 53Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Both the calcitonin solutions and the control solutions were allowed to interact with Congo Red for 1 h prior to recording their spectra. Congo Red difference spectra were calculated by subtracting the free dye absorbance from the calcitonin-dye absorbances. Finally, bovine calcitonin was prepared in the following manner for the toxicity and GTP studies. Calcitonin was dissolved at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml in either deionized water or a solution of 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2in water. These solutions were rotated at 60 rpm at 25 °C for 24 h. Then the calcitonin solutions were diluted to 40 and 80 μm with sterile medium and rotated for an additional 24 h prior to being added to the culture wells or plates for the toxicity and GTP studies. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (a gift of Dr. Evelyn Tiffany-Castiglioni, College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas A & M University, College Station, TX) were cultured in a humidified 5% (v/v) CO2/air environment at 37 °C in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 3 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (fungizone). Likewise, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse serum, 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 3 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone in a 5% (v/v) CO2/air environment at 37 °C. For the GTP studies, cells were plated at densities ranging from 2.5 to 4 million cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. For the viability assays, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105cells/well in 96-well plates. During both the GTP and viability studies, the peptides were added to the cells 24 h after plating. After incubation with the peptides or controls for 30 min at 37 °C, the PC12 or SH-SY5Y membranes were isolated using the widely accepted method of Seifert and Schultz (54Seifert R. Schultz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested with a cell scraper and collected by centrifugation (1600 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). Subsequently, they were washed with a buffer consisting of 10 mm triethanolamine (TEA) and 140 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) and disrupted by nitrogen cavitation in a 50 mmKH2PO4 buffer with 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.0). The nuclear portion of the cells was removed by a short centrifugation (1000 × g, 4 °C, 2 min), and membrane sedimentation was attained with a long centrifugation (15,000 × g, 4 °C, 60 min). The resulting membrane pellet was suspended in a 10 mm TEA/HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and the total membrane protein content was measured with the BCA assay (55Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T.

The GTPase activities of the PC12 and SH-SY5Y membranes were assessed similarly to procedures described previously (56Cassel D. Selinger Z. Biochim. Biophys.

Reaction mixtures of 100 μl consisted of 0.4 μm [γ-32P]GTP (0.5 μCi/tube), 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm AMP-PNP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 40 μg of creatine kinase, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mm TEA/HCl (pH 7.4). Following a 5-min preincubation period at 25 °C, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 5–8 μg of membrane protein. After 15 min at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 800 μl of a 20 mm KH2PO4 buffer (4 °C, pH 7.0) containing 5% (w/v) activated charcoal. The released32Pi was separated from the nucleotide-bound phosphate by centrifugation (15000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min), and 100 μl of the supernatant was counted on a Topcount Microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Low affinity or nonspecific GTPase activity was measured by adding excess unlabeled GTP (50 μm) to the aforementioned reaction mixture and conducting the reaction as described. Specific high affinity GTPase activity was calculated as the difference between the total GTPase activity in the absence of unlabeled GTP and the low affinity GTPase activity. Pronase studies were conducted analogously to established procedures (61Lazari M.F. Porto C.S. Freymuller E. Abreu L.C. Picarelli Z.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 62Dorland R.B. Middlebrook J.L. Leppla S.H. J. Biol.

Pronase at a concentration of 3 mg/ml in serum-free RPMI was incubated with the plated PC12 cells for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were harvested with a cell scraper and collected by centrifugation (1600 ×g, 4 °C, 20 min). Then the cells were thoroughly washed with PBS and centrifuged again (1600 × g, 4 °C, 20 min) prior to the addition of the peptides or controls for the GTPase assays. For the epinephrine control, 200 μm epinephrine in serum-free RPMI was incubated with these Pronase-treated PC12 cells for 30 min prior to the membrane isolation step. SH-SY5Y and PC12 cell viability was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay. MTT is reduced by viable cells to form blue formazan crystals, and inhibition of this reaction is indicative of cellular redox alterations that could result in toxicity (64Pollack S.J. Sadler I.I. Hawtin S.R. Tailor V.J. Shearman M.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 184: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The peptides were incubated with the SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells for 24 h, after which time MTT reduction was assessed. MTT was added to the culture medium to yield a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The cells were allowed to incubate with the MTT for 4 h in a CO2incubator after which time 100 μl of a 5:2:3N,N-dimethylformamide/SDS/water solution (pH 4.7) was added to dissolve the formed formazan crystals. After 18 h of incubation in a humidified CO2 incubator, the results were read using an Emax Microplate reader at 585 nm (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Viability is reported relative to control cells unexposed to the peptides. Pertussis toxin (PT) (100 ng/ml), GDPβS (600 μm), and suramin (20 μm) were incubated with the PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells for 24, 3, and 3 h, respectively, at 37 °C prior to the peptide additions for the GTPase or toxicity assays. The peptide solutions for these assays also contained the same inhibitors at the same concentrations. Control cells were treated identically except for the presence of peptide. Vesicles consisted of 82% (w/w) DPPC and 18% (w/w) cholesterol, and they were prepared by mixing the DPPC and cholesterol in chloroform and evaporating off the solvent under nitrogen at 50 °C in a 421–4000 Micro Rotary Evaporator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO). 20 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0) containing 0.4% (w/v) deoxycholate and 0.04% (w/v) cholate was then added to suspend the lipid film, producing a final lipid concentration of 1 mg/ml. The resulting DPPC/cholesterol suspension was sonicated for 10 min. Subsequently, 1.2 volumes of these DPPC/cholesterol vesicles were combined with 0.6 volume of Gαo or Gαi in a 10 mm NaHepes buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (v/v) Genapol. This mixture was gel-filtered using an ÄKTA Explorer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with Sephadex G-50 in a XK16/70 column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min according to procedure of Pedersen and Ross (65Pedersen S.E. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7228-7232Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The elution buffer consisted of 20 mm NaHepes buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1m NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2. GTPase activity was assayed by incubating the Gαo or Gαi vesicles (5 μl; 75 fmol of Gαo or Gαi) at 30 °C in a total volume of 100 μl containing 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm adenosine AMP-PNP, 0.1 mm ascorbic acid, and 0.1 μm[γ-32P]GTP. After the specified time, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 250 μl of a 50 mmNaH2PO4 buffer (4 °C, pH 7.0) with 5% (w/v) activated charcoal and rapid chilling. The mixture was centrifuged (1200 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), and the [32P]Pi in the supernatant (200 μl) was counted on a Topcount Microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard Instrument Co.). The significance of results was determined using a Student's t test on nindependent measurements, where n is specified in the figure legend. Unless otherwise indicated, significance was taken asp < 0.05. The structures of the Aβ peptides under the employed solvation conditions have been well characterized and were not re-examined. Under these conditions, Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(25–35) have been shown to be amyloidogenic (containing fibrils and protofibrils) and to contain extensive β-sheet structures, whereas Aβ-(1–16) has been demonstrated to be nonamyloidogenic and predominantly random coil (47Gorevic P.D. Castano E.M. Sarma R. Frangione B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 48Shen C.L. Fitzgerald M.C. Murphy R.M. Biophys.

Commun. 1994; 199: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because the solution structures of bovine calcitonin are not as well documented, we identified conditions that promoted the formation of β-sheet structure and amyloid using CD spectroscopy and Congo Red binding assays. As determined by CD (Fig.1 A), both 40 and 80 μm bovine calcitonin in water containing 5 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 adopted structures with ∼55 ± 10% β-sheet and only 15 ± 10% α-helix. Incubating the peptide in deionized water alone at these same concentrations (Fig. 1 A) produced structures devoid of β-sheet character with 95 ± 10% α-helical contents. As depicted by Congo Red difference spectra (Fig. 1 B), the 40 and 80 μm water solutions of bovine calcitonin with 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2significantly bound and shifted the spectral properties of Congo Red, indicating the formation of amyloid. The zero difference spectrum of the peptide in deionized water indicated an absence of Congo Red binding and substantial amyloid fibril formation (spectrum not shown). By using Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(25–35), and bovine calcitonin in water with 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 as models of peptides with amyloidogenic structures and Aβ-(1–16) and bovine calcitonin in deionized water as models of peptides without amyloidogenic structures, we examined the relationship between peptide structure and GTPase activity. We found that the rate of high affinity GTP hydrolysis in PC12 membranes increased by 31 ± 12% on average with exposure to the peptides containing extensive β-sheet and amyloid contents relative to the rate of hydrolysis of control cells unexposed to peptides (Fig. 2 A). In all cases, the increases in GTPase activity were significant relative to the control cells (p < 0.001). The rates of GTP hydrolysis were significantly greater for Aβ-(25–35) and 80 μm calcitonin (p < 0.001), the two peptides with the greatest amyloid content, than for Aβ-(1–40) and 40 μm calcitonin, suggesting that the extent of macromolecular structure influences the process. Similarly, Aβ-(1–16) and bovine calcitonin in deionized water, the peptides devoid of amyloid and β-sheet structures, did not significantly alter the GTPase activities of the PC12 cells relative to untreated controls (Fig. 2 A) (p > 0.2). To ensure that the observed phenomena were not isolated to PC12 cells, we examined the GTPase activities of SH-SY5Y membranes exposed to bovine calcitonin. We found similar trends to those observed with the PC12 cells (Fig. 2 B). The rate of GTP hydrolysis increased from 16.0 ± 0.5 pmol/mg/min for the control cells to 23.8 ± 0.6 and 18.7 ± 0.6 pmol/mg/min for the cells exposed to 80 and 40 μm bovine calcitonin in water with 5 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, respectively (p < 0.002). The nonamyloidogenic 80 μmcalcitonin in water did not significantly alter GTPase activity relative to the controls (16.0 ± 0.3 pmol/mg/min,p > 0.4). In parallel to the GTPase activity experiments, we examined the relationship between peptide structure and toxicity using our model peptides. As seen in Fig. 3,A and B, analogous to our GTPase results, we found that exposure to the peptides containing extensive β-sheet and amyloid contents resulted in significant PC12 (Fig. 3 A) and SH-SY5Y (Fig. 3 B) cell toxicity (p < 0.001). Conversely, Aβ-(1–16) and bovine calcitonin in deionized water, the peptides devoid of amyloid and β-sheet structures, did not significantly alter cell viability relative to untreated controls (p > 0.2). To identify the family or families of G proteins activated by the amyloid-forming peptides, we investigated the effects of GDPβS and suramin, two nonspecific G p"
https://openalex.org/W2069368340,"The two subtypes of human estrogen receptor, α (hERα) and β (hERβ), regulate transcription at an AP-1 response element differently in response to estradiol and the anti-estrogens tamoxifen and raloxifene. To better understand the protein determinants of these differences, chimeric and deletional mutants of the N-terminal domain and the F region of ERα and ERβ were made and tested in transient transfection assays at the classical estrogen response element (ERE) site as well as at an AP-1 site. Although the same regions on each receptor subtype appeared to be primarily responsible for estradiol activation at an ERE and in HeLa cells, major differences between ERα and ERβ mutants were seen in the estrogen and anti-estrogen responses at an AP-1 site. This differential ligand response maps to the N-terminal domain and the F region. These results suggest that different estrogenic and anti-estrogenic ligands use different mechanisms of activation and inhibition at the AP-1 site. In contrast to previous studies, this work also shows that many of subtype-specific responses are not transferred to the other subtype by swapping the N-terminal domain of the receptor. This implies that there are other unique surfaces presented by each subtype outside of the N-terminal domain, and these surfaces can play a role in subtype-selective signaling. Together, these data suggest a complex interface between ligand, response element, and receptor that underlies ligand activation in estrogen signaling pathways.

Fletterick R.J. Scanlan T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 559-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). One feature of the nuclear receptor family is that a receptor can both activate and repress different sets of genes in response to the same ligand, but the mechanisms behind these differential effects are still not well understood. Estrogen receptor is unusual among the nuclear receptors, because its differential regulatory effects manifest themselves as tissue-specific responses to a given ligand (2MacGregor J.I. Jordan V.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 151-196PubMed Google Scholar). For example, tamoxifen functions as an anti-estrogen in breast tissue, but acts as an estrogen in the uterus and bone. Controlling these tissue-specific effects is the ultimate goal in the design and study of selective estrogen receptor modulators for the treatment of diseases such as breast cancer and osteoporosis (3Gustafsson J.Å. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One explanation for the different effects is that a ligand may elicit different responses when the receptor acts through different effector sites (4Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The estrogen receptor regulates transcription through binding to estrogen response elements (EREs) in the upstream promoter regions of target genes as well as through interactions with a growing number of “nonclassical” response sites (5Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Saville B. Wormke M. Wang F. Nguyen T. Enmark E. Kuiper G. Gustafsson J.A. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5379-5387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These nonclassical sites do not necessarily require DNA-protein interactions between the receptor and the promoter element, but instead regulate transcription through protein-protein interactions between the receptor and other transcription factors such as AP-1 and Sp-1. By receptor interactions with different response elements, the same ligand could then cause both activation and repression of different sets of genes. The estrogen receptor exists in two different forms, ERα and ERβ (7Giguere V. Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Steroids. 1998; 63: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It has since been shown that the response to both estrogens and anti-estrogens at an AP-1 site depends on the subtype of the receptor (8Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.Å. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar); estradiol elicits transcriptional activation with ERα, but transcriptional repression with ERβ. The two ER subtypes also respond differently to the selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene at an AP-1 site; ERβ shows much stronger activation in response to raloxifene than ERα.

In an effort to understand the mechanism of estrogen receptor action at the AP-1 site and nuclear receptor action at nonclassical response elements in general, this study describes efforts to identify regions in ERα and ERβ that can account for the differential ligand activation at an AP-1 site. We report that different polypeptide regions on ERα and ERβ in both the N- and C-terminal regions are important for the differential ligand response. The construction of the expression vectors for both hERα (HE0) and hERβ as well as the AP-1-regulated luciferase construct (Coll73-luc) have been described previously (5Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.Å. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). The ERE-driven luciferase reporter gene consists of two repeats of the upstream region of the vitellogenin ERE promoter from −331 to −289, followed by region −109 to +45 of the thymidine kinase upstream region and the luciferase gene. The chimeric ER constructs were made with overlap extension PCR and inserted into SG-5 expression vectors. While a point mutant of ERα that has a lower hormone-independent response was used in these studies (HE0), constructs were also made using wild-type ERα (HEG0), and no significant difference in the activation profiles was seen (data not shown). The N-terminal chimera βαα, replacing amino acids 1–178 of the ER point mutant HE0 with amino acids 1–96 of hERβ, was made by amplifying a fragment of corresponding to amino acids 179–476 of HE0 using primers with the sequences 5′-AGTCAGTGAGCGAGGAAGCG (this primer will hereby be known as primer RW1) and 5′-CTATGCTTCAGGATATCATTATGGAGTC. The fragment was then digested and inserted into the Eco RV and Bam HI sites in the pSG5-hERβ expression vector. Chimera αββ, replacing amino acids 1–96 of hERβ with amino acids 1–178 of HE0, was made by PCR overlap extension. ASac II site in the N-terminal domain of HE0 was eliminated by first amplifying one fragment with primers with the sequence 5′-GATCCCGCGGATGACCATGACCCTCCACACC (primer RW2) and 5′-CGCGTTGGCGGCGGCCGCCGCGTTGAACTCGTAG and the other fragment with primers with the sequence 5′-CTACGAGTTCAACGCGGCGGCCGCCGCCAACGCG and 5′-GATCGATATCCTGAAGCATAGTCATTGCACAC (primer RW3). The overlap extension was then performed using primers RW2 and RW3 and then digesting and inserting the resulting fragment into theSac II and Eco RV sites of the pSG5-hERb expression vector. The αββ chimera deletion mutant α(Δ129–178)ββ, which deletes amino acids 130–177 in the N-terminal domain of αββ, was made using the same procedure but using the plasmid Δ129–178 (15Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N. Kwok G.R. McInerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Nilsson S. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1672-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the PCR template. The αββ chimera deletion mutants α(Δ109)ββ and α(Δ117)ββ, which deletes amino acids 2–108 and amino acids 2–116, respectively, were made by using primer RW2 and RW3 with the templates n109 and n117, respectively (15Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N. Kwok G.R. McInerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Nilsson S. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1672-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and inserting the fragments into the Sac II andEco RV sites in the pSG5 hERβ expression vector. To make the N-terminal deletion mutant Δββ, which deletes amino acids 2–96 of hERβ, a PCR fragment of ERβ was generated using the primer RW1 and a primer with the sequence 5′-AGGGATCCGCGGATGTGCGCTGTCTGCAGCG. The PCR product was then digested and inserted into the Sac II and Bam HI sites of the pSG5-hERβ construct. Five other N-terminal ERβ deletion mutants, Δ9ββ, Δ17ββ, Δ21ββ, Δ28ββ, and Δ53ββ, were made in the same fashion with primer RW1 and the primer containing the appropriate truncation. The F region chimera βFα, swapping amino acids 451–477 of hERβ with amino acids 553–595 of HE0, was made by PCR overlap extension. One fragment was amplified from HE0 using the RW1 primer and a primer with the sequence 5′-AGCCGTGGAGGGGCAT. The other fragment was amplified from ERβ using primers with the sequence 5′-AAGAGCTGCCAGGCCTGCCG (primer RW4) and 5′-ATGCCCCTCCACGGCTCTTGCACCCGCGAAG. The overlap extension was then performed using primers RW1 and RW4 and then digesting and inserting the resulting fragment into the Sac I and Bam HI sites of the pSG5-hERβ expression vector. The F region chimera αFβ, swapping amino acids 553–595 of HE0 for amino acids 451–477 of hERβ, was made by first inserting a silent mutation to insert a Spe I restriction site into HE0 via Quikchange mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primers with the sequence 5′-GCGCCCACTAGTCGTGGAG and 5′-CTCCACGACTAGTGGGCGC. A PCR fragment was then amplified from ERβ using the RW1 primer and a primer with the sequence 5′-GAACTAGTTCCATCACGGGGTC. The fragment was then digested and inserted into the Bam HI site and the newly generated Spe I site of HE0. The F domain mutant αΔF, deleting amino acids 553–595 of HE0, was made by PCR amplification of HE0 using primer RW4 and a primer with the sequence 5′-ATGGGATCCTCAAGTGGGCGCATGTAGGC. The fragment was digested and inserted into the Hin dIII and Bam HI sites of the HE0 expression vector. The other deletion mutant, βΔF, deleting amino acids 451–477 of hERβ, was made by PCR amplification of ERβ with primer RW4 and a primer with the sequence 5′-ATGGGATCCTCACTTGCACCCGCGAAG. The fragment was then digested and inserted into the Sac I and Bam HI sites of the pSG5-hERβ expression vector. HeLa cells were grown in 0.1 μm filtered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 0.876 g/liter glutamine, 100 mg/liter streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G and 10% newborn calf serum. Cells were grown to a density of not more that 5 × 104cells/cm2. For transient transfection assays, cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of electroporation buffer in 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvettes at ∼1.5 × 106cells/cuvette with 5 μg of the reporter plasmid and the optimal amount of the receptor expression vector. The optimal receptor plasmid concentration for maximal ligand activation was determined for each mutant and was found to be 5 μg of plasmid per transfection except for the αββ and βαα chimera, which required only 1 μg expression plasmid per transfection. The electroporation buffer consisted of 0.2 μm filtered PBS, 0.1% glucose, and 0.001% Biobrene detergent. Cells were transfected by electroporation at a potential of 0.25 kV and a capacitance of 960 microfarads. The transfected cells were immediately resuspended in growth medium supplemented as described above with the exception that the newborn calf serum had been treated with charcoal. Cells were plated into six-well dishes at 2 ml/well at a density ∼1 × 105cells/well. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, hormones were added in 2 μl of ethanol (8Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.Å. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were lysed by first removing the medium from the wells, washing with PBS, and then adding 0.2 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 100 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The plates were frozen at −80 °C, thawed, and scraped with a rubber policeman to loosen the cell fragments. The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min, and 0.1 ml of the supernatant was combined with 0.3 ml of the luciferase assay buffer consisting of 25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 15 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8) with the addition to a final concentration of 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 0.2 mmluciferin. Luminescence was measured for 10 s with a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Each hormone dose was performed in triplicate, and the relative error was determined by calculating the S.E. of the mean. Each construct was tested at least five times, and no significant differences in the results were observed between experiments. Transfection efficiency and receptor expression levels were tested using a whole cell ligand binding assay (16Kushner P.J. Hort E. Shine J. Baxter J.D. Greene G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). After each transfection with the reporter and expression plasmids described above, a portion of the transfected cell suspension was plated into four wells of a 24-well plate at a density of 105 cells/well. The cells were grown as described above for ∼12 h, then the medium was removed, the cells were washed once with PBS and then treated with 200 μl of medium minus the newborn calf serum and containing 20 nm [2,4,6,7,16,17-3H]estradiol. To two of the four wells, diethylstilbestrol was added to a concentration of 10 μm. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for approximately 1 h. The medium was removed, the cells were washed three times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS and then extracted twice with ethanol. The ethanol extractions were than diluted in scintillation fluid and counted for activity. Specific binding to the receptor was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding (measured from the cells treated with diethylstilbestrol) from total binding (measured from the cells not treated with diethylstilbestrol). This assay has been repeated with each construct at least five times, and the specific binding has differed less than 15% between experiments. A normalization factor for each transfection was then determined by dividing the amount of specific ligand binding for each transfect by the specific ligand binding of a transfection standard performed with every set of transfections using 5 μg of HE0 expression plasmid. The relative light unit values and errors determined from the luminescence experiments performed on each transfection were then divided by the normalization factor to give the final, normalized luminescence data. Deletional and chimeric mutants of ERα and ERβ were made to determine the regions of the ER responsible for the different ligand effects at an AP-1 site. Polypeptide regions that had the highest sequence variability between the two subtypes were chosen. The estrogen receptor, like all nuclear receptors, has three structural domains, an N-terminal domain, a DNA binding domain (DBD) and a ligand binding domain (LBD). Of these three domains, only the N-terminal domain shows significant differences between ERα and ERβ in both sequence identity and length. There have been reports of longer forms of ERβ that extend the N terminus of the receptor (17Leygue E. Dotzlaw H. Lu B. Glor C. Watson P.H. Murphy C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 3754-3755PubMed Google Scholar). These longer forms of ERβ also possess very low sequence similarity with ERα in the N-terminal domain and show no difference in activity at the AP-1 site (15Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N. Kwok G.R. McInerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Nilsson S. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1672-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeras and deletions of the N-terminal domain of both subtypes were constructed (Fig. 1 a) and tested in a transient transfection reporter gene assay with a reporter construct consisting of a luciferase gene driven by a classical ERE (5Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To account for potential differences in the expression levels of each chimeric receptor, a whole cell estradiol binding assay was also performed with every transfection (16Kushner P.J. Hort E. Shine J. Baxter J.D. Greene G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The estradiol binding data were used to normalize the luciferase reporter activity. This normalization corrects for differences in transfection efficiency and also serves as a control to assay ligand binding activity of the various mutant receptors used in the study. All of the chimeric and deletion mutants showed less than a 2-fold variation in the amount of specific tritiated estradiol binding except for the ERβ construct containing the N-terminal domain of ERα (αββ), which showed 8-fold increased binding activity (Table I). All the mutant receptors also showed maximal ligand activation in the reporter gene assay at the same receptor expression plasmid concentration except for the αββ and βαα chimeric receptors, which had an optimal concentration 5-fold lower than the others.Table IRelative estradiol binding ability of estrogen receptor mutantsReceptorRelative estradiol bindingERα100ERβ95ERαββ713ERβαα143ERΔαα62ERΔββ109ERαFβ87ERβFα68ERαΔF130ERβΔF145Binding affinity was determined by the specific binding of 1 nm tritiated estradiol by HeLa cells expressing transiently transfected receptor. Specific binding was determined by running the assay with and without 10 μm diethylstilbestrol and determining the difference. Relative binding affinity was determined by normalizing each assay to ERα. Differences in relative binding differ less than 15% between multiple transfections.

Relative binding affinity was determined by normalizing each assay to ERα. Differences in relative binding differ less than 15% between multiple transfections. In HeLa cells, swapping or deleting the N-terminal domain causes some changes in the magnitude of activation, but all of the mutants were still capable of activating transcription in response to estradiol at an ERE-tk promoter in HeLa cells (Fig.2). Truncations in amino acids 21–96 of the N-terminal domain of ERβ or in different regions in the N-terminal domain of the αββ chimera also had no effect on estradiol activation at an ERE-driven promoter (data not shown). As expected, little or no activation is seen with tamoxifen or raloxifene at any of the full-length or mutant receptors. The lack of tamoxifen activation at this ERE in HeLa cells is consistent with other reports (5Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J. Anderson C. Feng W.J. Nguyen M.P. Chen D.G. Huang S.M. Subramanian S. McKinerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S.

The other region of the receptor that shows great differences between ERα and ERβ is the C-terminal tail (also known as the F region). The F regions of ERα and ERβ share relatively low sequence identity (23%) compared with the rest of the LBD and DBD. In addition, ERα also has a longer F region than ERβ (42 residues for ERα versus 26 for ERβ). Chimeras and deletion mutants were also made for the two subtypes (Fig. 1 b) and tested in the same transient transfection assays described above. Although there are some changes in the overall magnitude of the activation (Fig.3), each of the mutants behaved like full-length ERα and ERβ in their response to ligands: estradiol activated transcription, whereas the anti-estrogens raloxifene and tamoxifen did not. A higher level of hormone-independent activation was also seen with the F deletion mutants, but the underlying cause for this increase is still unknown. When the chimera and deletion mutants were tested at an AP-1 site, significant differences in ligand activation were seen. Deleting the N-terminal domain of ERα (Δαα) or replacing it with the N-terminal domain of ERβ (βαα) resulted in receptor that showed no activation by estradiol, a weak activation by tamoxifen, and a much stronger activation response to raloxifene than that of full-length ERα (Fig.4). On the other hand, deletion of the N-terminal domain in ERβ (Δββ) abolished all ligand activation at an AP-1 site. Deleting the first 53, 28, or 21 amino acids in the N-terminal domain of ERβ abolished all ligand activation at the AP-1 site as well (Fig. 5). The chimera of ERβ with the N-terminal domain of ERα (αββ) showed transcriptional activation in response to only tamoxifen at a level 3-fold higher than the hormone-independent activation but showed no activation by raloxifene compared with the 10-fold activation seen with full-length ERβ. Deleting either the first 109 or 117 amino acids of αββ eliminated any tamoxifen activation but resulted in a 2.5-fold activation by raloxifene (Fig.6). An internal deletion between amino acids 129 and 178 in the N-terminal domain of αββ also showed no activation by tamoxifen and a slight activation by raloxifene.Figure 5Transient transfection assay with N-terminal deletion mutant receptors of ER β and the AP-1-driven luciferase reporter gene.

As was seen with the N-terminal domain mutants, ERα and ERβ appear to function differently (Fig. 7). Deleting the F region of ERβ (βΔF) or replacing it with the F region of ERα (βFα) does not affect the ligand response of the receptor. However, removing the F region of ERα (αΔF) or replacing the F region with that from ERβ (αFβ) results in receptors that show little or no activity in response to estradiol at an AP-1 site but still allows a significant tamoxifen activation. The deletion mutant (αΔF) also shows significant activation by raloxifene in contrast to the full-length ERα receptor. It has been previously shown that ERα and ERβ have different ligand activation properties at an AP-1 site (8Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.Å. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). Both estrogens and anti-estrogens stimulate transcriptional activation with ERα whereas with ERβ, anti-estrogens promote transcriptional activation, while estrogens promote repression. The aim of this study was to define the elements of each ER that are responsible for the differential responses at AP-1. We focused on the N-terminal (A/B) domain and the C-terminal F region of ERα and ERβ, since these regions are the most dissimilar in terms of length and sequence between the two ERs. Of the three structural domains, the function of the N-terminal domain is the least understood, but is generally believed to play a role in transactivation and repression (19Tora L. White J. Brou C.

The AF-1 region has been shown to contribute to ligand-independent activation and to synergistic enhancements of ligand-dependent activation with activation function 2 (AF-2), located in the ligand binding domain. Both the constitutive and synergistic effects attributed to the AF-1 region are highly dependent on cell context (20Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P.

While ERα possesses this AF-1 region between amino acid 41 and amino acids 120–150 depending on the cell type, the equivalent AF-1 region in ERβ is either extremely weak or absent entirely (27Kobayashi Y.

This step is mediated by eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)1 2, a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein, which, when liganded with GTP, is able to bind the initiator Met-tRNA to form a ternary complex (eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi). This complex then binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit, forming the 43S pre-initiation complex that then interacts with other initiation factors on the mRNA to allow selection of the translation start codon. The GTP molecule is hydrolyzed late in the initiation process releasing eIF2 as a relatively stable and inactive binary complex (eIF2·GDP). At physiological magnesium concentrations, the affinity of eIF2 for GDP is high and recycling of eIF2 to the active GTP-bound state requires a further protein factor, eIF2B, a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, which in yeast and mammals is composed of five nonidentical subunits (α–ε) (2Webb B.L.J.

The best characterized mechanism of regulation, which is known to operate both in yeast and in mammalian cells, is the inhibition of eIF2B by the phosphorylation of its substrate, eIF2, at a highly conserved serine residue (Ser51 in mammals) in its α-subunit (3Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar). Phosphorylated eIF2α acts as a potent competitive inhibitor of eIF2B, and, as cellular levels of eIF2 generally exceed those of eIF2B, low levels of eIF2α phosphorylation can cause substantial inhibition of eIF2B. Recent data suggest that the α-, β-, and δ-subunits of eIF2B interact with eIF2 and that these subunits are required to sensitize eIF2B to inhibition by this mechanism (4Pavitt G.D. Ramaiah K.V.A. Kimball S.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 5Pavitt G. Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1298-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To date, a number of eIF2α kinases have been studied in yeast and mammals. In S. cerevisiae, general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), is activated under conditions of amino acid deprivation, leading to increased phosphorylation of eIF2α and partial inhibition of global protein synthesis. However, translation of the mRNA for the transcriptional activator GCN4 is actually enhanced by virtue of a set of short upstream open reading frames in its 5′-leader region (1Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). GCN2 homologs have been described in mammals and in Drosophila melanogaster (6Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 17: 7499-7509Crossref Google Scholar, 7Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D.

J. 2000; 346: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting analogous regulatory mechanisms may operate in these species. Recently, a new eIF2α kinase, pancreatic eukaryotic initiation factor-2α kinase (PEK), was identified in mammalian pancreatic cells and characterized as a membrane-bound protein localized in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This kinase has been implicated in the control of translation in response to ER stresses such as improper protein folding. In total, mammalian cells possess at least four eIF2α kinases (heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI; Ref. 9Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR; Ref. 10Clemens M.J. Elia A. J.

Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar)), which are generally activated under conditions of cellular stress (e.g. viral infection, disruption of endoplasmic reticulum function, and heme deprivation (Ref. 3Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar)). The initiation phase of translation and the role of eIF2 and its regulation have been studied intensively in S. cerevisiae and also in mammalian systems (12Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). However, relatively little work has focused on other metazoans. In D. melanogaster the evidence that a mechanism of guanine nucleotide exchange exists remains equivocal. Previous studies indicated that D. melanogaster eIF2 can be purified as a stable binary complex with GDP. The affinity of eIF2 for GDP at physiological magnesium concentrations was such that a mechanism of catalysis would be required to form the active eIF2·GTP complex (13Mateu M.G. Maroto F.G. Vicente O. Sierra J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 14Mateu M.G. Sierra J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, Mateu and colleagues (13Mateu M.G. Maroto F.G. Vicente O. Sierra J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 15Mateu M.G. Vicente O. Sierra J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported that nucleotide exchange on D. melanogaster eIF2 was independent of an exchange factor under several conditions. Moreover, no guanine nucleotide exchange activity for eIF2 in D. melanogaster was detected in embryos (14Mateu M.G. Sierra J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The sequence of eIF2α from D. melanogaster does, however, contain a seryl residue (Ser50) in the position corresponding to Ser51 in mammals and in a very similar sequence context. Indeed, this residue and the surrounding 19 amino acids are conserved with those found at the phosphorylation site (Ser51) in mammalian and S. cerevisiae eIF2α (16Qu S. Cavener D.R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 140: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). D. melanogaster eIF2α can be phosphorylated in vitro by reticulocyte HRI, and this phosphorylation was shown to inhibit guanine nucleotide exchange by mammalian eIF2B (13Mateu M.G. Maroto F.G. Vicente O. Sierra J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 14Mateu M.G. Sierra J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the α-subunit of D. melanogaster eIF2 at residue Ser50 in vivo has never been examined. However, two eIF2α kinases have been identified in D. melanogaster. A D. melanogaster ortholog of theS. cerevisiae GCN2p kinase has been identified and characterized (17Berlanga J.J. Santoyo J. de Haro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 18Olsen D.S. Jordan B. Chen D. Wek R.C. Cavener D.R. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1485-1509Google Scholar). Complementation experiments ingcn2-deleted strains of S. cerevisiae have confirmed that D. melanogaster GCN2 (dGCN2) is a functional homolog of GCN2p. Expression studies show that dGCN2 is expressed in a developmentally regulated manner and is restricted to the central nervous system during later stages of development. More recently, aD. melanogaster ortholog of the mammalian PEK has been identified through sequence homology (8Sood R. Porter A.C. Ma K. Quilliam L.A. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the physiological conditions and mechanism by which these kinases function in vivo in D. melanogaster remain unclear, especially in the absence of information about eIF2B and its regulation in this species. Thus, it was unclear whether D. melanogaster possessed or required a factor equivalent to eIF2B or whether this process was truly regulated by eIF2α phosphorylation in this organism. Another mechanism by which eIF2B can be regulated in mammalian systems is the phosphorylation of its ε-subunit (eIF2Bε) by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). The activity of GSK-3β is known to be modulated in response to insulin, which induces the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3β (19Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 20Saito Y. Vandenheede J.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Welsh G.I. Stokes C.M. Wang X. Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This response occurs concomitantly with the dephosphorylation of the ε-subunit of mammalian eIF2B, at the site of phosphorylation by GSK-3β, causing the activation of eIF2B (22Welsh G.I. Miller C.M. Loughlin A.J. Price N.T. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). D. melanogaster has a homolog of GSK-3β, Shaggy (23Ruel L. Bourouis M. Heitzler P. Pantesco V. Simpson P. Nature. 1993; 362: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), however, although its role in insulin signaling has not been elucidated. Genetic evidence has indicated that Shaggy acts downstream ofDishevelled in the Wingless pathway inactivatingArmadillo (the D. melanogaster homolog of β-catenin) (24Noordermeer J. Klingensmith J. Perrimon N. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 367: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and biochemical evidence suggests Shaggy is downstream of protein kinase C (25Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumpathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). A putative phosphorylation site for GSK-3β has been identified in D. melanogaster eIF2Bε, based on sequence homology (26Williams D.D. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the role of phosphorylation of this site has not been studied. Together, these data suggest that a mechanism of guanine nucleotide exchange and its regulation by eIF2α and eIF2Bε phosphorylation probably exist in D. melanogaster. However, neither nucleotide exchange (eIF2B) activity nor the phosphorylation of eIF2α has been demonstrated in vivo in D. melanogaster. Given the recent discoveries of eIF2α kinases in this species, establishing that eIF2α phosphorylation is a regulatory mechanism in the initiation of translation, in fruit flies, was an important priority. In this study we report the presence of guanine nucleotide exchange activity in D. melanogaster S2 cell lines and its regulation by eIF2α phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. We identify cDNAs encoding all five subunits of D. melanogaster eIF2B (α, β, γ, δ, and ε), and have cloned cDNAs encoding the α-, β-, γ-, and ε-subunits. We have also characterized the functions of the α- and ε-subunits. We also report that eIF2α phosphorylation occurs in a regulated mannerin vivo, that GSK-3β phosphorylates eIF2Bε in vitro, and that eIF2B activity can be inhibited in vitro by GSK-3β. eIF2B and its regulation in this species appear to be similar to other eukaryotic organisms that have so far been studied. Chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from BDH (Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom (UK)) and Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, Dorset, UK), unless stated otherwise. [3H]GDP (10 Ci/mmol), [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml) were from Amersham International. X-ray film was obtained from Konica Corp.. Nitrocellulose filters (0.45-μm pore size) were obtained from Whatman. Restriction enzymes and DNA polymerases were obtained fromPromega, and oligonucleotide primers were obtained from MWG Biotech. Recombinant HRI was kindly provided by Dr. J.-J.. Chen (Harvard-Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) and the vector encoding PKR was kindly provided by Dr. T. Dever (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Recombinant GSK-3β was provided by Dr. A. Paterson (University of Dundee, Dundee, UK) and the vector pGEX-HA was kindly provided by Dr. N. Helps (University of Dundee, Dundee, UK). D. melanogaster Schneider (S2) cells were grown in 75-ml tissue culture flasks in DES expression medium with l-glutamine (Invitrogen, Netherlands), containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) (27Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morph. 1972; 27: 363-365Google Scholar). S2 cell used in guanine nucleotide exchange assays were harvested (at a density of 8 × 106 cells/ml) in lysis buffer containing 100 mmTris, pH 7.6, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 1.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml microcystin, protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and benzamidine; all 1 μg/ml), and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For starvation experiments, cells were starved by placing them into medium containing no serum when they reached a density of 3 × 106cells/ml and lysed or recovered at the times indicated. For experiments involving ER stresses, thapsigargin (1 μg/ml) in dimethyl sulfoxide or tunicamycin (1 μm) also in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the cells 12 h prior to lysis; control cells were incubated for the same time in the same concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using gels containing 12.5% acrylamide and 0.1%N,N′-methylene-bis-acrylamide (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue and dried or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore) and subjected to immunoblotting. For Western blotting, samples of total extracts from D. melanogaster S2 cells were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with either an antibody raised against the peptide CQFDPEKEFNHKGSGAGR corresponding to residues 313–330 of D. melanogaster eIF2α (αD eIF2Bα) or an antibody against a peptide with the sequence GMILLSELSpRRRIRIN (where Sp denotes a phosphoseryl residue) corresponding to the phosphorylation site in eIF2α (New England Biolabs). Anti-His and anti-Myc antibodies (both Sigma-Aldrich) were used as indicated in the figure legends. Antibody-antigen complexes were detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep, rabbit, or mouse secondary antisera. Guanine nucleotide exchange (eIF2B) activity was determined by measuring the loss of [3H]GDP from pre-formed mammalian eIF2·[3H]GDP binary complexes, in the presence of GTP, in an assay similar to that described (29Mehta H.B. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3438-3441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kleijn M. Welsh G.I. Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Proud C.G. Thomas A.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5536-5541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). More specifically, formation of the binary complex was achieved by incubating 570 nm purified eIF2 with 7.2 μm[3H]GDP in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mmdithiothreitol for 20 min at 30 °C (∼1 pmol of of eIF2 binds 1 pmol of [3H]GDP). Assays were carried out, following the addition of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 200 μm GTP, at 30 °C. D. melanogaster S2 cell extract (45 μg of protein) was used in each assay, unless otherwise stated. Following a given time, a sample was removed and diluted in 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 90 mm KCl, and 5 mm Mg(CH3CO2)2 and filtered through nitrocellulose. Filters were washed in the same buffer and dried, and associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Formation of [eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi] (ternary) complexes was assayed as described previously using [35S]methionyl-tRNA (31Proud C.G. Pain V.M. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Purification of eIF2, as a substrate for eIF2B assays, was carried out as described (32Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) except that HeLa cell extracts were used as the source instead of rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The partial purification of D. melanogaster eIF2·eIF2B complex was also performed in a similar manner. 5 liters of S2 cells were grown to a density of 6 × 106 cells/ml and harvested by centrifugation at 480 ×g. The cells were then lysed mechanically in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 0.5% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and benzamidine; all 1 μg/ml), and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Extract was then loaded on to a Fast Flow Q-Sepharose column and eluted using a continuous gradient of KCl (from 100 mm to 1 m in a total of 20 ml). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected. Sequence homology searches were performed using the BLAST program (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) in the D. melanogaster data base Flybase (available via the World Wide Web) to obtain sequence data for the eIF2B subunits. These searches revealed either expressed sequence-tagged cDNA encoding a partial sequence (HL01112) for the α-subunit, or genomic sequence (from the D. melanogaster sequencing project for the others). The β-subunit sequence is encoded within locus DMC100G10.3 (accession no. AL023874), and the ε-subunit is encoded within the cosmid clone 86E4. Unfortunately, these sequences were either partial sequences or contained introns. To obtain full-length sequence, oligonucleotide primers were designed to the 5′ end of the known sequence and used with a T7 primer (at the 3′ end of the cDNA library used) to amplify cDNAs encoding the full-length sequence. These were then cloned into the vector pGEMTeasy by ligation of the A and T nucleotides on the 3′ and 5′ ends of the PCR product and the vector. The sequence for the γ-subunit was also identified using BLAST searches, which revealed an expressed sequence tag encoding what initially seemed to be a partial sequence (GM07434, accession no. AA696313). However, when sequenced, the full-length coding region of this protein was revealed. The sequences encoding the putative δ-subunit of D. melanogaster eIF2B was found by searching the recently completed D. melanogaster genomic sequence; however, cDNA encoding this subunit has not been acquired. This has revealed a full-length sequence encoding 626 amino acid residues with homology to mammalian and yeast eIF2Bδ (see “Results”). Where appropriate, oligonucleotide primers were then designed and used to PCR amplify cDNAs from the Nicholas Brown cDNA library (34Brown N.H. Kafatos F.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). PCR reaction products were then gel purified and subcloned into a pGEMTeasy vector using a TA cloning kit (Promega). cDNAs were sequenced on both strands by dideoxy chain termination method using the ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequence ready reaction kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase FS and the Automatic Sequencer system 373A (Applied Biosystems). For bacterial expression the cDNA sequence for the α-subunit was the cloned (in frame) into pET28c(+) (Novagen), to produce a His-tagged eIF2Bα, using Nde I andBam HI (sites for cloning were introduced on the oligonucleotide primers). The cDNA sequence encoding the ε-subunit was cloned into pGEX-HA (in frame) using Nde I and Xho I for bacterial expression and pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His (Invitrogen) using Eco RI andHin dIII for expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. HEK 293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (35Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 3 days after transfection and lysed in the buffer used for lysing S2 cells (described above). In vitro transcription and translation reactions were performed using the T'n'T reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Escherichia coli (BL21 DE3 or JM109) transformed with the appropriate vector was grown at 37 °C overnight in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. They were then diluted 1/10 and grown to anA 600 of 1. Cultures were then cooled on ice for 15 min and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 × g and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and benzamidine; all 1 μg/ml), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 g/ml lysozyme for 30 min on ice. To ensure lysis and shear any DNA, the cells were sonicated. Purification of recombinant proteins was performed using either nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) or glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were used the same day. cDNA encodingD. melanogaster eIF2Bα open reading frame was cloned usingMlu I and Nhe I into the yeast expression vector pAV1411 (pGAL-GCN2FH (Ref. 36Gomez E. Pavitt G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3965-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)) by standard techniques (36Gomez E. Pavitt G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3965-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid (pDWD eIF2Bα) was transformed into isogenic yeast strains GP3153 (MAT a leu2–3 leu2–113 ura3–52 trp1-Δ63 gcn3Δ::LEU2) and GP3140 (MAT a leu2–3 leu2–113 ura3–52 trp1-Δ63 gcn2Δ) (5Pavitt G. Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1298-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These yeast strains were also transformed with control plasmids expressing yeast GCN3 (Ep69) (38Hannig E.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4808-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and yeast GCN2 (p722) (39Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Jackson B.M. Freeman B. Hinnebusch A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5801-5815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains containing each plasmid were grown at 30 °C to confluence on SGal medium (10% galactose) supplemented with leucine (2 mm) and tryptophan (1 mm) and replica-plated to the same medium and to SGal medium additionally supplemented with 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) and incubated at 30 °C for an additional 3 days. Previous data concerning the existence of eIF2B in D. melanogaster were equivocal. Thus, to assess whether D. melanogaster cells contain a protein with eIF2B activity, we assayed extracts of S2 Schneider cells for their ability to catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange on eIF2 using complexes containing mammalian eIF2 and [3H]GDP as substrate. The data (Fig. 1 A) clearly show that S2 cell extracts effectively mediate nucleotide exchange on eIF2, allowing bound [3H]GDP to be replaced by GTP. Pretreatment of S2 cell extracts with the eIF2α kinase HRI led to increased phosphorylation of eIF2 as assessed using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of eIF2α (Fig. 1 B). The identity of the band as eIF2α was confirmed by comparison with the positions of mammalian and D. melanogaster eIF2α (probed with antibodies specific for the respective proteins). This confirms the earlier finding that D. melanogaster eIF2α is a substrate for HRI (15Mateu M.G. Vicente O. Sierra J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). PKR was also able to phosphorylate eIF2α in extracts of Schneider cells (data not shown). When eIF2B assays were performed with cell extract that had been pretreated with HRI, eIF2B activity was markedly reduced (Fig.1 A). Inhibition of eIF2B activity by eIF2α phosphorylation is a property common to both yeast and mammalian eIF2B. When isolated from mammalian cells, eIF2 and eIF2B tend to copurify with one another through a number of ion-exchange steps (32Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Feldhoff R.C. Karinch A.M. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Prep. Biochem. 1993; 23: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kimball S.R. Everson W.V. Myers L.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2220-2227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize further the corresponding factors from D. melanogaster, Schneider cell extracts were subjected to ion-exchange chromatography on an Mono-Q column, which was developed with a salt gradient from 0.1 to 1.0 m KCl. Fractions were subjected to immunoblotting with the antibody to D. melanogaster eIF2α. They were also assayed both for eIF2 activity (measured as formation of ternary complexes) with [35S]Met-tRNAi in the presence of GTP and for eIF2B activity using the mammalian eIF2·[3H]GDP complex as substrate. Western blotting revealed a strong signal with the anti-eIF2α antiserum in the region of the gradient corresponding to 350–450 mm KCl at an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa (Fig.2 A). These fractions also showed eIF2 activity (Fig. 2 B). When fractions in this region of the gradient were assayed for eIF2B activity, nucleotide-exchange activity was observed in fraction 11 (≡ 490 mm KCl), i.e. just aft"
https://openalex.org/W2097092669,"Unlike the neuroendocrine cell lines widely used to study trafficking of soluble and membrane proteins to secretory granules, the endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary are highly specialized for the production of mature secretory granules. Therefore, we investigated the trafficking of three membrane proteins in primary anterior pituitary endocrine cells. Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), an integral membrane protein essential to the production of many bioactive peptides, is cleaved and enters the regulated secretory pathway even when expressed at levels 40-fold higher than endogenous levels. Myc-TMD/CD, a membrane protein lacking the lumenal, catalytic domains of PAM, is still stored in granules. Secretory granules are not the default pathway for all membrane proteins, because Tac accumulates on the surface of pituitary endocrine cells. Overexpression of PAM is accompanied by a diminution in its endoproteolytic cleavage and in its BaCl2-stimulated release from mature granules. Because internalized PAM/PAM-antibody complexes are returned to secretory granules, the endocytic machinery of the pituitary endocrine cells is not saturated. As in corticotrope tumor cells, expression of PAM or Myc-TMD/CD alters the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. PAM-mediated alterations in the cytoskeleton may limit maturation of PAM and storage in mature granules. Unlike the neuroendocrine cell lines widely used to study trafficking of soluble and membrane proteins to secretory granules, the endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary are highly specialized for the production of mature secretory granules. Therefore, we investigated the trafficking of three membrane proteins in primary anterior pituitary endocrine cells. Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), an integral membrane protein essential to the production of many bioactive peptides, is cleaved and enters the regulated secretory pathway even when expressed at levels 40-fold higher than endogenous levels. Myc-TMD/CD, a membrane protein lacking the lumenal, catalytic domains of PAM, is still stored in granules. Secretory granules are not the default pathway for all membrane proteins, because Tac accumulates on the surface of pituitary endocrine cells. Overexpression of PAM is accompanied by a diminution in its endoproteolytic cleavage and in its BaCl2-stimulated release from mature granules. Because internalized PAM/PAM-antibody complexes are returned to secretory granules, the endocytic machinery of the pituitary endocrine cells is not saturated. As in corticotrope tumor cells, expression of PAM or Myc-TMD/CD alters the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. PAM-mediated alterations in the cytoskeleton may limit maturation of PAM and storage in mature granules. peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine α-amidating lyase trans-Golgi network transmembrane domain cytoplasmic domain bovine serum albumin phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate sodiumN-Tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethansulfonic acid adrenocorticotropic hormone fluorescein isothiocyanate growth hormone proopiomelanocortin POMC adenovirus Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM)1 is a bifunctional enzyme involved in the posttranslational processing of many prohormones and neuropeptides. PAM catalyzes the formation of α-amidated peptides from peptide precursor molecules with a COOH-terminal glycine. In neurons and endocrine cells, biologically active peptides are stored in secretory granules that undergo regulated release in response to external stimuli. Localized in secretory granules of many neural and endocrine tissues, PAM is one of a small number of posttranslational processing enzyme occurring naturally in soluble and membrane forms (1Hu H.M. Thorn N.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 2Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 287-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J.

For this reason, we have used PAM to investigate the trafficking of soluble and membrane proteins into secretory granules (5Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6Milgram S.L. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Soluble and membrane PAM are targeted to the regulated secretory pathway in different ways (5Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J.

By stably expressing wild type and mutant PAM in AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells, protein domains containing trafficking information were identified (7Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21128-21138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The two catalytic domains of PAM can be expressed independently, and both are efficiently targeted to secretory granules. In contrast, membrane PAM is predominantly localized in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) at steady state. The small amount of membrane PAM on the cell surface is rapidly internalized and accumulates in the TGN region (7Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cytosolic domain of PAM contains information necessary for the trafficking of this membrane protein within the secretory pathway (7Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins lacking the cytosolic domain are less extensively cleaved by secretory granule endoproteases, accumulate on the plasma membrane, and fail to undergo internalization. A marker protein lacking both catalytic domains of PAM, consisting only of the PAM signal sequence followed by its transmembrane/cytosolic domain, is highly localized to the TGN region of AtT-20 cells (10Bruzzaniti A. Marx R. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24703-24713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); appending the cytosolic domain of PAM to Tac, a plasma membrane protein, rerouted Tac to the TGN (11Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cytosolic tail of PAM interacts with proteins that affect cytoskeletal organization and expression of membrane PAM alters the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, perhaps explaining the ability of membrane PAM to affect secretory granule biogenesis (12Mains R.E.

The endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary are highly specialized for the production of peptide hormones, their storage, and regulated release from mature secretory granules (4El Meskini R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our initial studies of PAM trafficking in anterior pituitary endocrine cells identified similarities and clear differences in the trafficking of endogenous PAM in primary cells and exogenous PAM in AtT-20 tumor cells. As in AtT-20 cells, the endogenous PAM in pituitary cells is subjected to endoproteolytic cleavage, generating soluble PHM and PAL. In both cases, PAM processing products are subjected to regulated exocytosis. Unlike transfected AtT-20 cells, immunostaining and subcellular fractionation identifies PAM mainly in pituitary secretory granules. Anterior pituitary cells rapidly internalize membrane PAM from the cell surface, but unlike AtT-20 cells, massive accumulation of retrieved PAM in the TGN region is not observed in primary pituitary cells. To elucidate the trafficking of membrane proteins in endocrine cells and understand the distinctly different steady state localization of endogenous PAM in primary pituitary cells and transfected PAM in AtT-20 cell lines, we investigated the trafficking of three membrane proteins in primary anterior pituitary: membrane PAM (PAM-1); a truncated version of PAM with only a small lumenal epitope (Myc-TMD/CD); and the interleukin-2 receptor α chain (Tac), normally a T-lymphocyte plasma membrane protein (13Leonard W.J. Depper J.M. Crabtree G.R. Rudikoff S. Pumphrey J. Robb R.J. Kronke M. Svetlik P.B. Peffer N.J. Waldmann T.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 14Reeves R. Leonard W.J. Nissen M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4666-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We used recombinant adenovirus to overexpress membrane PAM or Myc-TMD/CD in anterior pituitary cells; Tac was expressed in the same cells by transfection. Using immunofluorescent staining and subcellular fractionation, we show that the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of PAM are sufficient to target the protein to the secretory granules. In parallel, the capacity of pituitary endocrine cells to cleave and store greatly increased amounts of PAM has been assessed. Although overexpression of PAM alters the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, neither the regulated secretion or the endocytic machinery is affected in anterior pituitary cells. Cultures were prepared as described (4El Meskini R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Anterior pituitaries were dissected from the neurointermediate lobes of 5–20 adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (175–200 g; Charles River, Wilmington, MA) and dissociated with collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ), hyaluronidase (Sigma), and benzonase (EM Science, Darmstadt, Germany), followed by trypsin (Sigma). This procedure consistently produced 1.5 × 106 cells/anterior pituitary. The dissociated cells were plated on protamine-coated culture wells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal clone III bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 10% Nu-Serum IV (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) for the first 24 h and then maintained in the same medium containing 10 μm cytosine arabinoside (Sigma). Where indicated, anterior pituitary cells were infected with 2 × 103plaque-forming units/ml of recombinant adenoviruses (V) 72 h after plating. Recombinant adenoviruses have been described previously (15Marx R. El Meskini R. Johns D.C. Mains R.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8300-8311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): PAM-1V encodes full length rat PAM-1 (nucleotides 293–3245); POMCV encodes mouse POMC (nucleotides 1–920); Myc-TMD/CDV encodes a chimeric protein described previously (10Bruzzaniti A. Marx R. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24703-24713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in which the PAM signal (amino acids 1–26; nucleotides 298–375) and the pro-domain (amino acids 27–35; nucleotides 376–420) were fused in frame to Myc epitope followed by the transmembrane domain (TMD) and cytoplasmic domain (CD) (amino acids 858–976; nucleotides 2871–3225) of PAM. For recombinant adenovirus constructions, cDNAs were subcloned into the virus shuttle vector (pAdLox) as described previously for PAM-1V and POMCV (15Marx R. El Meskini R. Johns D.C. Mains R.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8300-8311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293-CRE8 cells were then cotransfected with the shuttle vector and purified Ψ5 adenoviral DNA to produce recombinant adenovirus. The next day, the virus-containing cell culture medium was replaced with serum-containing medium; for all experiments the cells were used 48 h after infection, but cells were viable for at least 2 weeks after infection. pCDM·Tac expression vector, kindly provided by Dr. Juan Bonifacino (Cell Biology and Metabolism Branch, National Institutes of Health), was transiently transfected in anterior pituitary cells using GenePorter (Gene Therapy Systems) following the manufacturer's protocols. Mouse AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells expressing PAM-1 (AtT-20 PAM-1) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal clone III bovine serum, 10% Nu-Serum IV, and G418 as described previously (6Milgram S.L. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For each secretion experiment, pituitary cell cultures were initially rinsed for three 30-min periods in complete serum free medium/BSA: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Ham's F-12 medium with 1 μg/ml insulin, 0.1 μg/ml transferrin, and 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA. Following this equilibration period, medium was collected for two 1-h periods of basal secretion (first basal and second basal) followed by a 1-h period of stimulated secretion using either 1 mm BaCl2 or 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) diluted in complete serum free medium/BSA (4El Meskini R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Ciccotosto G.D. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After the collected media were centrifuged to remove cell debris, a mixture of protease inhibitors was added (4El Meskini R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the samples were stored at −80 °C. Cells were scraped into 20 mm NaTES, 10 mmmannitol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors and used for PHM or PAL assays or for Western blot analysis. Rat anterior pituitary tissue was homogenized in the same buffer. Before use, samples were frozen and thawed three times and centrifuged for 5 min to remove debris. PHM and PAL activities were measured in cell extracts or media as described previously using α-N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-Gly and α-N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-OH-Gly substrates, respectively (17Kolhekar A.S. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Quon A.W. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10901-10909Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Samples were assayed in duplicate, and reactions were carried out for 1.5 h. PHM and PAL specific activity is expressed as picomoles of product formed per hour (units) per microgram of protein or as a percentage of the corresponding total enzyme activity in the cell extract. Anterior pituitary cells were extracted in 5 n acetic acid containing protease inhibitors; the soluble material was lyophilized, dissolved in immunoassay buffer, centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and stored frozen. Assays were performed on media and cell extracts using antibody Kathy (1:20,000) and [125I]ACTH (1–39) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Antiserum Kathy only recognizes POMC products in which the COOH-terminal end of ACTH (1–39) is exposed (18Schnabel E. Mains R.E. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cultures prepared from 10 anterior pituitaries were harvested at 4 °C in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors, passed six times through a 26-gauge needle, and then 12 times through a ball-bearing homogenizer (H & Y Enterprises, Redwood City, CA) (8Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cell debris (P1) was removed by centrifugation at 800 ×g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant (S1) was separated into a P2 pellet and soluble fraction (S2) by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min (2Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 287-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P2 pellet largely enriched in secretory granules was resuspended in homogenization buffer and fractionated further on a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Resuspended P2 was layered onto a density gradient consisting of 200 μl each of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 m sucrose, 350 μl each of 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6 m sucrose, and 200 μl of 2.0m sucrose; this gradient was designed to keep the densest secretory granules from pelleting. Gradients were centrifuged for 2 h at 120,000 × g; 150-μl fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and proteins in an equal fraction of each sample were analyzed. Finally, a P3 pellet and a cytosolic fraction (S3) were obtained following centrifugation of S2 at 350,000 × g (2Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 287-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4El Meskini R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Samples were fractionated by 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to Western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal antisera to PHM (JH1761, 1:1000), exon A (JH629, 1:1000), and PAL (JH471, 1:1000) or mouse monoclonal antibodies to the cytosolic domain of PAM (6E6, 1:50; Refs. 4El Meskini R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17004-17010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAM, Myc-TMD/CD, POMC, TGN38, and VAMP-2 were detected in anterior pituitary cells using indirect immunofluorescence. Cells (200,000 cells/well of a 4-well slide) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4) for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.075% Triton X-100, and blocked with 2 mg/ml BSA in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PAM exon A (JH629), PAM CD (JH571), or TGN38 (JH1481) (19Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J.

Permeabilized or nonpermeabilized anterior pituitary cells expressing membrane Tac protein were stained using a monoclonal antibody 7G7 (AMAC, Westbrook, ME) directed against the lumenal domain of Tac. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Caltag, San Francisco, CA) or Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). To detect filamentous actin, cells were stained with FITC-phalloidin (0.1 μg/ml; Sigma). Cells were viewed with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and photographed with a Micromax CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Princeton, NJ) or a Spot RT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Primary pituitary cells were incubated in complete serum free medium/BSA containing a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antiserum to PAM exon A (JH629) for 20 min at 37 °C and either prepared immediately for immunofluorescence staining or chased in antibody-free medium for 1 or 2 h at 37 °C (4El Meskini R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Steveson T.C Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Eipper BA J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21128-21138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether the endocytosis of PAM were affected by the binding of bivalent PAM antibody, control experiments were performed using monovalent Fab fragments. We generated Fab fragments by digestion of IgG prepared from PAM exon A antiserum with immobilized papain as described by the manufacturer (Pierce); the Fab fraction was separated from nondigested IgG and Fc fragments using immobilized protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The purity of the Fab fragments was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Primary pituitary cells were incubated with exon A antibody or Fab fragments prepared from the same serum for 20 min at 37 °C and then harvested or chased in the absence of antibody for additional time periods, as described above. To evaluate the level of protein expression achieved following infection of primary cells with adenovirus, PHM and PAL specific activities were compared in PAM-1V-infected pituitary cells, uninfected pituitary cells (4El Meskini R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), anterior pituitary tissue, and stably transfected AtT-20 PAM-1 cells (Fig.1, top panel). PHM and PAL specific activities increase 40–50-fold after PAM-1V infection, reaching levels substantially higher than in adult rat anterior pituitary or stably transfected AtT-20 PAM-1 cells (Fig. 1, top panel). Specific activities in PAM-1V-infected pituitary cells are about 2-fold higher than in adult rat atrium, the richest source of PAM in the body (24Braas K.M. Stoffers D.A. Eipper B.A. May V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1387-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To assess the fraction of cells expressing virally encoded PAM, we used indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 1, bottom panels). Virally encoded PAM-1 is expressed at varying levels in essentially all of the primary pituitary cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with the 50-fold increase in PHM and PAL specific activities, endogenous PAM is not visualized under the same conditions (Fig. 1, D and E). Because these cultures contain very few nonendocrine cells (4El Meskini R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), almost all of the virally encoded PAM is expressed in cells proficient at producing secretory granules. Punctate staining for virally encoded PAM is observed throughout the cytosol of most of the endocrine cells (Fig. 1 C). The vesicular staining pattern observed for virally encoded PAM mimicks the pattern observed previously for endogenous PAM in pituitary cells (4El Meskini R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To better evaluate the subcellular localization of PAM, PAM-1V-infected pituitary cultures were simultaneously visualized for PAM (Fig.2 A) and TGN38 (Fig.2 B), a trans-Golgi network marker (25Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). PAM (inred) is localized to vesicular structures distributed throughout the cell, whereas TGN38 (in green) is highly localized to a compact, reticular structure in the perinuclear region of each cell (Fig. 2 B, arrows). Very little PAM is identified in the TGN region (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, double immunofluorescent staining of PAM-1V-infected pituitary cells for PAM (Fig. 2 D) and VAMP-2 (Fig. 2 E), a secretory granule marker (20Majo G. Aguado F. Blasi J. Marsal J. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), reveals a largely overlapping distribution. As with endogenous anterior pituitary PAM (4El Meskini R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), overlaying the PAM and VAMP-2 images (Fig. 2 F, PAM in green and VAMP-2 in red) reveals a range of colors, with some structures enriched in PAM and others in VAMP-2. Despite massive adenovirus-mediated overexpression, membrane PAM is largely localized to vesicular structures with no accumulation on the cell surface or in the TGN area. The routing of integral membrane PAM involves contributions from the two lumenal, catalytic domains and from the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain (11Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To evaluate the importance of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of PAM in trafficking in anterior pituitary endocrine cells, we generated a recombinant adenovirus encoding Myc-TMD/CD (Fig. 3). In this chimeric protein (Fig. 3 A), the PAM signal and NH2-terminal regions allow the Myc epitope tag, which precedes the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of PAM, to adopt a lumenal location (10Bruzzaniti A. Marx R. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24703-24713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Primary anterior pituitary cells were infected with adenovirus encoding Myc-TMD/CD, and the chimeric protein was visualized simultaneously using antisera to PAM-CD and Myc (Fig. 3, B andC). With both antisera, vesicular staining distributes throughout the cytosol of all of the pituitary cells (Fig. 3,B and C). Antisera to the lumenal domain (Fig.3 C) and to the cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 3 B) exhibited identical patterns. Simultaneous visualization of Myc-TMD/CD and TGN38 (Fig. 3, D and E) demonstrated distinctly different patterns; Myc-TMD/CD does not accumulate in the TGN area (Fig. 3 F). In contrast, simultaneous visualization of Myc-TMD/CD and VAMP-2 (Fig. 3, G and H) suggests that Myc-TMD/CD, like intact PAM-1, is largely localized to secretory granules (Fig. 3 I). Western blot analysis of extracts of cultures infected with the Myc-TMD/CD virus identified a single 23-kDa protein that is recognized by antibodies to Myc and to the cytosolic domain of PAM (Fig.4 A). To explore further the trafficking of Myc-TMD/CD in anterior pituitary cells, we used differential centrifugation followed by sucrose gradient fractionation (Fig. 4, B and C). The majority of the Myc-TMD/CD is recovered in the P2 pellet (Ref. 2Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 287-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 4 B). Visualization of VAMP-2 demonstrated the presence of secretory granules in the P2 fraction (Fig. 4 B). The P2 pellet was further fractionated on a sucrose gradient (Fig. 4 C). Fractions 9–11 are enriched in Myc-TMD/CD and in VAMP-2, confirming the localization of Myc-TMD/CD to secretory granules. A similar subcellular localization is observed for the majority of the endogenous anterior pituitary PAM (4El Meskini R. Mains R.E.

Anterior pituitary endocrine cells commit a significant percentage of their total protein synthesis to production of secretory granules (26Watanabe T. Banno T. Jeziorowski T. Ohsawa Y. Waguri S.

Therefore, we considered the possibility that secretory granule localization might represent the default trafficking pathway in these cells. To address this issue, we transfected anterior pituitary cultures with Tac, the interleukin-2 receptor α chain, a membrane protein that normally resides on the surface of T-lymphocytes (13Leonard W.J. Depper J.M. Crabtree G.R. Rudikoff S. Pumphrey J. Robb R.J. Kronke M. Svetlik P.B. Peffer N.J. Waldmann T.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 14Reeves R.

Immunofluorescent staining of nonpermeabilized pituitary cells, using an antibody against the lumenal domain of Tac, demonstrates that a significant amount of the expressed protein is present on the cell surface (Fig.4 D).

The solution structure of myeloid progenitor inhibitor factor-1 (MPIF-1) has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure reveals that MPIF-1 is a monomer with a well defined core except for termini residues and adopts the chemokine fold of three β-strands and an overlying α-helix. In addition to the four cysteines that characterize most chemokines, MPIF-1 has two additional cysteines that form a disulfide bond. The backbone dynamics indicate that the disulfide bonds and the adjacent residues that include the functionally important N-terminal and N-terminal loop residues show significant dynamics. MPIF-1 is a highly basic protein (pI >9), and the structure reveals distinct positively charged pockets that could be correlated to proteoglycan binding. MPIF-1 is processed from a longer proprotein at the N terminus and the latter is also functional though with reduced potency, and both proteins exist as monomers under a variety of solution conditions. MPIF-1 is therefore unique because longer proproteins of all other chemokines oligomerize in solution. The MPIF-1 structure should serve as a template for future functional studies that could lead to therapeutics for preventing chemotherapy-associated myelotoxicity.

All are 70 to 120 amino acids in length, and are characterized by four conserved cysteine residues. Chemokines are broadly classified into CC and CX C families on the basis of whether the first two cysteines are adjacent (CC) or separated by an amino acid (CX C). The CX C chemokines can be further divided into two subgroups, “ELR” and “non-ELR.” All ELR CX C chemokines activate neutrophils, whereas non-ELR CX C chemokines activate different subsets of lymphocytes. CC chemokines activate monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, basophils, T cells but not neutrophils. In addition, a single member of a C family, which contains only two cysteines, and a single member of a CX 3C family have also been identified. Chemokines bind and activate 7-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors on leukocytes, and also bind cell surface highly sulfated proteoglycans. Proteoglycan binding could play a role in forming a concentration gradient for leukocyte recruitment (4Rot A. Immunol.

Myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor-1 (MPIF-1)1 (also known as CKβ8), a member of CC family, was initially identified in a large scale sequencing effort and is constitutively expressed in liver, lung, pancreas, and bone marrow (14Patel V.P.

Further processing at the N terminus results in a 76-residue protein, henceforth called MPIF-1, that was significantly more active (16Nardelli B. Tiffany H.L. Bong G.W. Yourey P.A. Morahan D.K. Li Y.

Cross-desensitization experiments in both monocytes and eosinophils indicate that MPIF-1 binds predominantly to the CCR1 receptor but incomplete desensitization also suggests that additional receptor(s) may be involved (16Nardelli B.

MPIF-1 induces a rapid dose-dependent release of arachidonic acid from monocytes that is dependent on extracellular calcium and is blocked by phospholipase A2 inhibitors. Furthermore, phospholipase A2 activation is shown to be necessary for filamentous actin formation in monocytes. In this study, we have determined the solution structure and characterized the backbone dynamics of MPIF-1 by NMR spectroscopy. We have studied the proteoglycan binding of MPIF-1 and full-length MPIF-1 proprotein using heparin affinity chromatography, and the self-association propensities under a variety of solution conditions by sedimentation ultracentrifugation measurements. The implications of the structure, dynamics, heparin binding, and the self-association properties are discussed in terms of the protein's functions. The data from this study will form the structural basis for therapeutics for preventing chemotherapy-associated myelotoxicity. The MPIF-1 gene sequence was chemically synthesized with codons optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. The gene was then subcloned into the expression vector pHE4, which contains a strong synthetic promoter with two lac operators, an efficient ribosomal-binding site and a synthetic transcriptional terminator downstream of the inserted gene. The expression plasmid was transformed into the E. coli K12-derived strain SG13009. The following protocol was followed for preparing 15N- and13C-labeled MPIF-1. The seed culture was prepared by inoculating 1:4000 dilution of frozen seed stock into 125 ml of LB media with kanamycin. After induction with 5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, MPIF-1 was produced as an insoluble protein in minimal media supplemented with [15N]ammomium sulfate and [13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory, Andover, MA) and was extracted and refolded in 1.75 m guanidine HCl in the presence of 5 mm cysteine. The expressed protein carries an extra Met (the initiation codon) in the N terminus that for simplicity is considered as the first residue of MPIF-1. The protein was purified to homogeneity by successive passages through strong cation (poros HS-50), anion (poros HQ-50), and cation (poros CM-20) exchange columns and finally through a size exclusion (Sephacryl S-100) column. The full-length 99-amino acid MPIF-1 proprotein was cloned, expressed, and purified as outlined for the MPIF-1 protein. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed using a Beckman model XL-A ultracentrifuge at 20 °C at rotor speeds 23,000, 28,000, and 40,000 rpm. Experiments were carried out at two different starting concentrations (0.6 and 1.2 mgs/ml) in different buffers and ionic strengths to study their effect on dimerization (Table I). Absorbance was measured at 280 nm, and the data was collected as an average of five successive radial scans using a 0.003-cm step size.

Partial specific volumes were calculated from the weight average of the partial specific volumes for individual amino acids. Data were fitted to the equation by nonlinear least squares using the Microcal Origin 4.1 software provided by Beckman for the XL-A. The quality of the fit was characterized by χ2, the sum of the squares of the residuals, and examination of the residuals for systematic deviation. The data were fitted to a single species or to a monomer-dimer model. The molecular weights calculated from the fit indicated that both proteins are monomers under all solution conditions (Table I). A 0.8-ml heparin-POROS PE-20 column (4.6 × 50 mm) was equilibrated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl using Waters Alliance HPLC. Chemokine protein was loaded onto the column, washed in the same buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 m to 0.75 m NaCl over 50 column volumes. The NaCl concentration for elution of each chemokine was calculated by the conductivity of eluted peak. MIP-1α and MPIF-1 were expressed inE. coli, interleukin-8 was synthesized from solid-phase chemical synthesis, and HCC-2, MIP-1β, MCP-3, and RANTES were purchased from R & D Systems. All spectra were collected at 35 °C on a Varian Unity Plus 600 or a INOVA 500-MHz spectrometer, both equipped with field gradient accessories. The protein concentration was 2 mm in 20 mm sodium acetate, 1 mmsodium azide, pH 5.2, in 90% H2O, 10%2H2O(v/v) or 99.99%2H2O. Chemical shifts are referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid using the method of Wishart et al. (18Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L.

Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) and HCCH-TOCSY (21Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Singer A.U. Muhandiram D.R. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1993; 101: 333Crossref Scopus (562) Google Scholar) experiments. A high-resolution two-dimensional1H-1H nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY), TOCSY, and double-quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopy experiments were used to assign the aromatic protons. Inter-proton distances were derived from 15N-edited NOESY (mixing time 50 ms and 150 ms) and15N/13C-edited NOESY (mixing time 75 ms) experiments (22Pascal S.M. Ratliff N. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 103: 197-201Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). NOE buildup curve showed that the NOE intensities were essentially linear for the mixing times used in generating the distance restraints. NOE cross-peak intensities were classified as strong, medium, weak, or very weak, corresponding to upper distance restraints of 2.8, 3.5, 4.0, and 5.0 Å, respectively. φ Restraints were obtained from a HNHA experiment (23Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) and stereospecific assignment of the β protons was obtained from 3J coupling constants derived from a HACAHB experiment (24Grzesiek S. Kuboniwa H. Hinck A.P. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5312-5315Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and the relative intensities of the NOEs from the NH and the CαH to CβH protons in NOESY spectra. The potential candidates for hydrogen bonding were initially identified on the basis of observing slow-exchanging amide protons from a series of two-dimensional1H-15N HSQC spectra recorded within 24 h of dissolving the protein in 2H2O. For each hydrogen bond, two distance restraints were used (rNH-O, 1.8–2.3 Å and rN-O, 2.4–3.3 Å). The hydrogen bonding restraints were used only after an initial set of structures had been calculated. Only the amide protons which satisfied distance and angular restraints with hydrogen-bond acceptors were used in the structure calculations. All NMR spectra were processed using the nmrPipe suite of programs (25Delaglio F. Gresiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11626) Google Scholar). Structures were calculated by the hybrid distance geometry-dynamical simulated annealing method using the program XPLOR (26Brünger A.T. XPLOR Version 3.1. Manual. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). A total of 711 nonredundant NOE distance restraints (319 intra-residue, 179 sequential, 82 medium range, and 131 long range NOEs) were used. In addition, 82 dihedral (53 φ and 29 χ1) and 36 hydrogen bonding restraints (from 18 hydrogen bonds) were used in the final structure calculations. The initial structures were generated with NOE restraints alone and, in subsequent structure calculations, the dihedral and hydrogen-bond restraints were included. The simulated annealing calculations were carried out using the standard force-field parameter set and topology file in XPLOR version 3.1. A total of 50 structures were generated and the top 30 structures were selected on the basis of the lowest energies. 15N-T1, T2, and {1H}-15N NOE experiments were recorded at 35 °C on a uniformly labeled sample of 15N MPIF-1 using gradient version of the pulse sequences (27Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar). {1H}-15N NOEs were measured by recording HSQC spectra with and without proton saturation. The spectra without NOE were recorded with delays of 5 s and spectra with NOE with 2 s delay and 3 s of proton saturation to give the same delay of 5 s between transients. The spectra were processed using nmrPipe, and T1 and T2 values were obtained by nonlinear least-square fits of the cross peaks to a two-parameter exponential decay. Uncertainties in the T1and T2 values were taken as the S.D. of the fit. NOE values were obtained from the ratio of the peak intensities recorded with and without proton saturation. Uncertainties in the NOE values were estimated from the base line of the spectra according to Farrowet al. (27Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar). Chemokines are known to self-associate, a process that is dependent on solution conditions such as pH and ionic strength. The association properties of the MPIF-1 and the full-length MPIF-1 were studied using ultracentrifugation methods at different pH and ionic strength conditions. The summary of results is shown in Table I. The data indicate that both proteins are monomeric under the experimental conditions and show no tendency to self-associate. The monomeric state of MPIF-1 is consistent with both the NMR structure and the calculation of the correlation time from 15N dynamics. The statistics of the 30 final simulated annealing structures are shown in TableII, and the superimposition of the individual structures on the average structure is shown in Fig.1 A. The structure of the protein is well defined except for the terminal residues 1–10 and 67–77. The quality of the structures was tested using the programs PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and VADAR (VADAR-structural analysis of protein structures available for various criteria such as the stereochemistry, hydrogen bonds, the region of occupancy in the Ramachandran plot, van der Waals contacts, buried charged residues, number of buried residues, and packing defects). All 30 structures met the above mentioned criteria, which are expected of a high resolution structure.Table IIStructural statistics and r.m.s. differences for 30 calculated MPIF-1 structuresEnergies (kcal mol−1) NOE2-aThe values for NOE and torsion angles were calculated from a square well potential with a force constant of 50 kcal mol−1 Å2 and 200 kcal mol−1 rad−2, respectively.3.21 ± 0.48 Dihedral2-aThe values for NOE and torsion angles were calculated from a square well potential with a force constant of 50 kcal mol−1 Å2 and 200 kcal mol−1 rad−2, respectively.0.01 ± 0.01 Bonds4.31 ± 0.09 van der Waals1.54 ± 0.30Deviations from idealized geometry2-bThe values for bonds, angles, and impropers show the deviation from ideal values based on perfect stereochemistry.

Open table in a new tab All the structures and the energy-minimized average structure displayed good covalent geometry (Table II) and minimal NMR constraint violations. None of the 30 simulated annealing structures had NOE violations greater than 0.2 Å and dihedral angle violations greater than 2°. The r.m.s. distribution for residues 11 and 66 between all 30 structures and the average structure is 0.57 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.09 Å for the heavy atoms (Fig.2, A and B). The precision of the torsion angles is assessed in terms of the order parameter S (29). The torsion angle order parameters (φ and ψ) for most of the residues in the structured region is >0.95, an observation that indicates that the backbone of the structures is well defined (Fig. 2, C and D). The order parameter for χ1 is shown in Fig. 2 E. Fig. 2 F shows the solvent accessible area, and a low value implies that the side chain is buried and inaccessible to the bulk solvent. These residues tend to be hydrophobic and in general are highly structured as evidenced by high order parameter for χ1 > 0.9. One exception of a large hydrophobe that shows a low S is Ile13. It is solvent exposed and structure-function studies have shown an essential role for this residue in receptor binding in several CX C and CC chemokines. It is observed that all of the torsion angles in all 30 structures fall in the favored region of the Ramachandran plot. Seventy-two percent of the residues fall in the core (most favored) region, 23% in the allowed region, and 1% in the generous region. The structure of MPIF-1 consists of an extended loop at the N terminus followed by three β strands and a C-terminal α helix (Fig. 1 B). The first 10 residues preceding the CC motif show no or only sequential NOEs, have low order parameters for φ and ψ, and therefore lack defined structure. These are followed by a N-terminal loop that contains a series of turns (residues 13–20) that leads into a 310 helix (residues 21–24). The first β strand (residues 27–31) is connected by a type III turn to the second β strand (residues 39–44), which is in turn connected by a type I turn to the third β strand (residues 48–52). The third strand leads into the helix (residues 56–66) via a type III turn. Residues 67–77 are largely unstructured, a feature that is consistent with the lack of long range NOEs, a few medium NOEs, and low order parameters. Hydroxyl protons of Thr31 and Thr44, located at the end of the 1st strand and 2nd strand, respectively, are H-bonded to the backbone carbonyls across the strand and therefore play a structural role. Of the six cysteines, four are characteristic of all CC chemokines: Cys11 forms a disulfide with Cys35, which is part of the turn linking first and second β strands, and Cys12 forms a disulfide bond with Cys50 in the third β strand. MPIF-1 has two additional cysteines, Cys22 in the 310 helix and Cys62 in the α-helix. We have created a data base of cysteine chemical shifts and have observed that the Cβshifts are uniquely different in the free and the disulfide bonded form (53Sharma D. Rajarathnam K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The shifts of Cys22 and Cys62 indicate that they are involved in disulfide bond formation. The structure reveals that the cysteines are proximal to form a disulfide bond, and this is also evident from the NMR properties such as the small coupling constant, slow exchanging amide proton, and NOE pattern for Cys62 that are characteristic of a helical residue. The Cys12-Cys51 disulfide bond adopts a left-handed twist in the majority of the structures whereas the other two disulfide bonds are unstructured. The core of the structure is well defined by a number of long-range hydrophobic contacts (Ile20, Leu25, Tyr28, Phe29, Val40, Phe42, Phe50, Ala52, Val59, Met63, and Leu66) between residues of the α-helix and β-strands. Besides the disulfide bonds, long range NOEs between Thr31, Gly39, Tyr15, Cys11, Cys12, and Cys51 orient the N-terminal loop and the N-terminal residues with respect to the core structure, which could be essential for their function. The 15N T1, T2, and NOE relaxation data could be obtained for 60 out of 73 expected resonances (Fig. 3, A-C). The15N T1, T2, and NOE relaxation data were analyzed to describe the internal dynamics of MPIF-1 using the model-independent formalism of Lipari-Szabo (30Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem.

Relaxation data for each residue were fitted to different models that includeS 2 − τc (model 1),S 2 − τc − τe (model 2),S 2 − τc − R ex(model 3), S 2 − τc − τe −R ex (model 4), and a two-time scale model (model 5) that allow internal motions to occur at two distinct time scales (32Clore G. Szabo A. Bax A. Kay L.E. Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 4989-4991Crossref Scopus (972) Google Scholar). The appropriate model was chosen for each residue, by evaluating the quality of the fit. The optimal τc was initially calculated on a per residue basis by minimizing the experimental and the calculated T1, T2, and NOE values using the isotropic spectral density function. For calculating the overall correlation time τc, 26 residues with either15N-{1H} NOE values <0.65 and/or with T1/T2 ratio outside 1 S.D. (Fig.4 D) from the mean were excluded. τc was calculated to be 4.6 ± 0.2 ns on the basis of the remaining 34 residues.Figure 4Structural comparison of MPIF-1 and other CC chemokines.

Residues 11 to 66 of MPIF-1, 11 to 66 of MIP-1β, 6 to 61 of HCC-2, 10 to 65 of RANTES, and 11 to 67 of MCP-3 were used for superimposition.

Generalized order parameters provide a measure of the amplitude of internal motion, where S 2 = 1 means that the given N-H bond vector is rigid andS 2 = 0 indicates that the motion is unrestricted. Residues 67–77 in the C terminus and residues 1–10 preceding the first cysteine in the N terminus exhibit low order parameters (S 2 <0.7). Both termini are poorly defined in the NMR structures, and the dynamics data confirm that these residues are intrinsically mobile and that the lack of structure is not due to lack of experimental restraints. Excluding the termini, the average S 2 value for residues 11–66 is 0.84 ± 0.06. Other residues that exhibit low order parameters are Arg18 and Ile20 (S 2 = 0.7), which are part of the N-terminal loop. Relaxation data for residues Tyr15, Cys22, Thr44, Cys51, Ala52, and Asn77 required an exchange term (model 3 and 4) (Fig. 3 G) and for C-terminal residues 69–73, the two time scale model.

https://openalex.org/W2073560326,"In the biosynthesis of archaeosine, archaeal tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) catalyzes the replacement of guanine at position 15 in the D loop of most tRNAs by a free precursor base. We examined the tRNA recognition of TGT from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus horikoshii. Mutational studies using variant tRNA(Val) transcripts revealed that both guanine and its location (position 15) were strictly recognized by TGT without any other sequence-specific requirements. It appeared that neither the global L-shaped structure of a tRNA nor the local conformation of the D loop contributed to recognition by TGT. A minihelix composed of the acceptor stem and D arm of tRNA(Val), designed as a potential minimal substrate, failed to serve as a substrate for TGT. Only a minihelix with mismatched nucleotides at the junction between the two domains served as a good substrate, suggesting that mismatched nucleotides in the helix provide the specific information that allows TGT to recognize the guanine in the D loop. Our findings indicate that the tRNA recognition requirements of P. horikoshii TGT are sufficiently limited and specific to allow the enzyme to recognize efficiently any tRNA species whose structure is not fully stabilized in an extremely high temperature environment."
https://openalex.org/W2036966741,"The mode of recognition of tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and translation factors is largely unknown in archaebacteria. To study this process, we have cloned the wild type initiator tRNA gene from the moderate halophilic archaebacteriumHaloferax volcanii and mutants derived from it into a plasmid capable of expressing the tRNA in these cells. Analysis of tRNAs in vivo show that the initiator tRNA is aminoacylated but is not formylated in H. volcanii. This result provides direct support for the notion that protein synthesis in archaebacteria is initiated with methionine and not with formylmethionine. We have analyzed the effect of two different mutations (CAU→CUA and CAU→GAC) in the anticodon sequence of the initiator tRNA on its recognition by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in vivo. The CAU→CUA mutant was not aminoacylated to any significant extentin vivo, suggesting the importance of the anticodon in aminoacylation of tRNA by methionyl-tRNA synthetase. This mutant initiator tRNA can, however, be aminoacylated in vitro by the Escherichia coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, suggesting that the lack of aminoacylation is due to the absence inH. volcanii of a synthetase, which recognizes the mutant tRNA. Archaebacteria lack glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase and utilize a two-step pathway involving glutamyl-tRNA synthetase and glutamine amidotransferase to generate glutaminyl-tRNA. The lack of aminoacylation of the mutant tRNA indicates that this mutant tRNA is not a substrate for the H. volcanii glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. The CAU→GAC anticodon mutant is most likely aminoacylated with valine in vivo. Thus, the anticodon plays an important role in the recognition of tRNA by at least two of the halobacterial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases."

Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). They possess a conserved N-terminal motor domain, 1–6 light chain-binding sites, and a C-terminal tail that has a region rich in basic residues (the polybasic domain). The polybasic domain binds directly to either pure anionic phospholipid vesicles or stripped native plasma membranes with high affinity, in the 100 nmrange, in vitro (2Adams R.J. Pollard T.D.

The first is a region rich in glycine, proline, and alanine (or serine or glutamate), referred to as the GPA domain, that binds to actin in an ATP-insensitive manner, and the second is a Src homology 3 (SH3)1 domain either at the extreme C terminus or within the GPA domain (4Doberstein S.K.

The nature of the roles played by myosin Is suggests that they may specifically interact with the plasma membrane and intracellular transport vesicles such as early endosomes or lysosomes.The mechanism by which myosin I interacts with membranes in vivo and how that interaction is regulated remains unclear. The ability of the polybasic domain to mediate the binding of myosin I to membranes via electrostatic interactions (2Adams R.J. Pollard T.D. Nature. 1989; 340: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3Miyata H. Bowers B. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) indicates that this motor protein could interact nonspecifically with any membrane that contains negative phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine. This suggests that in Dictyostelium, for example, myosin I could be associated with the contractile vacuole, the plasma membrane, and lysosomes, all compartments that contain least 15–20% acidic phospholipids (23Nolta K.V. Padh H. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18318-18323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the amoeboid myosin Is are discretely localized to particular membrane compartments as well as in regions enriched for actin (3Miyata H. Bowers B. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Goodson H.V. Anderson B.L. Warrick H.M. Pon L.A. Spudich J.A. J.

Therefore, there must be a mechanism to direct the specific membrane association of myosin Iin vivo, such as a receptor.A complete understanding of the mechanism(s) by which myosin I may be localized within the cell requires the isolation of a myosin I-containing membrane fraction and identification of factors that may interact with myosin I either in the cytosol or on specific membranes to determine its localization in vivo. Dictyostelium has emerged as an excellent system for such studies as several of the amoeboid myosin Is have been purified and analyzed (29Lee S.F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20923-20929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and information regarding their in vivo roles has been obtained by molecular genetic methods (30Uyeda T.Q.P. Titus M.A. Maeda Y. Inouye K. Takeuchi I. Dictyostelium: a Model System for Cell and Developmental Biology. University Academy Press, Tokyo, Japan1997: 43-64Google Scholar).Therefore, an analysis of the membrane association of severalDictyostelium myosin Is, MyoA, -B, -C, and -D, and a myosin I heavy chain kinase (MIHCK) that regulates the activity of MyoD (31Lee S.F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) has been performed as the first step in elucidating how their subcellular distribution and, by extension, their function, may be controlled.DISCUSSIONThe membrane association of four Dictyostelium myosin Is, MyoA, -B, -C, and -D, has been investigated using a fractionation approach. Despite the presence of a high affinity membrane-binding domain in their C termini, only a small fraction, 7–15%, of each is membrane-associated (Fig. 1). The association membranes appears to be mediated by the polybasic domain, as a MyoB tail fragment lacking this domain is not membrane-associated (Fig. 5 B). The finding that the majority of each myosin I is found in the cytosolic fraction is consistent with earlier observations that 80% of the total high salt K+-ATPase activity (presumably contributed largely by the myosin I) in a low salt Dictyostelium lysate is soluble (29Lee S.F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20923-20929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acanthamoeba myosin IA is also largely cytosolic, as determined by quantitative immunoelectron microscopy (26Baines I.C. Brzeska H. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, a large proportion of the closely related Acanthamoeba myosin Is, myosin IB and -IC, are membrane associated (26Baines I.C. Brzeska H. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been reported that two different forms of mammalian myosin I, Myr1 and Myr2 (nonamoeboid type myosin Is), are membrane associated in rat liver and smooth muscle cells (54Hasegawa Y. Tsuwaki S. Yamada N. Araki T. Kimura S. Sugawara J. Yamamoto K. Okamoto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 55Balish M.F. Moeller E.F. Coluccio L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These myosins also appear to be associated with more than one membrane compartment, although they are predominantly found in Golgi (Myr2 in rat liver) or plasma membrane (Myr1 in rat liver) fractions. This indicates that there must be specific sequences in each myosin I that directs a particular myosin to the appropriate membrane compartment and also regulates the proportion of that myosin that is cytosolic or membrane-bound. These unidentified distinctive tail sequences that most likely reside in the polybasic domain could directly play a role in targeting these myosins to a receptor on the appropriate membrane. Alternatively, they could be responsible for associating with a cytosolic protein that prevents binding to membranes or plays a role in mediating myosin I-myosin I interactions in the lipid bilayer.The MIHCK that regulates MyoD activity was also found to be largely cytosolic under our fractionation conditions. Only a small proportion was found in the total membrane fraction following lysis of the cells (Fig. 1). In contrast to this result, a more significant amount of MIHCK was found in association with a high speed pellet that contains total membranes and the cytoskeleton when cells are directly lysed in the presence of 20 mm salt (47Lee S.F. Mahasneh A. de la Roche M. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27911-27917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This binding was significantly reduced, but not abolished, when the salt concentration was raised to 100 mm, suggesting that MIHCK binding to the membrane under low salt conditions can occur via electrostatic interactions (47Lee S.F. Mahasneh A. de la Roche M. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27911-27917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).The Dictyostelium myosin Is cofractionate with plasma membranes (Figs. 2, C and D, and 3 A) and do not appear to be bound to any other membrane compartment such as lysosomes or contractile vacuoles, indicating that there is a mechanism for specific association of the amoeboid myosin I with the plasma membrane in Dictyostelium. These results are consistent with immunolocalization experiments that found these myosins present at or near the plasma membrane (25Fukui Y. Lynch T.J. Brzeska H. Korn E.D. Nature. 1989; 341: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 56Morita Y.S. Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. Fukui Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 371-379PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of the four myosin Is to the plasma membrane is consistent with mutant analyses that implicate MyoA and MyoB in cell migration (20Wessels D. Murray J. Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. Soll D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Titus M.A. Wessels D. Spudich J.A. Soll D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and all of these myosin I in macropinocytosis (15Novak K.D. Peterson M.D. Reedy M.C. Titus M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1205-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Jung G. Wu X. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), functions that require the activity of the actin-rich membrane cortex of cells.There is a specific recruitment of MyoB (2-fold, Table II) to the plasma membrane during chemotaxis (Table I). The net increase in membrane-associated MyoB is substantial if one takes into account the observation that there is an overall 5-fold increase in the total amount of this protein during streaming (18Jung G. Wu X. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, streaming cells have 10 times more MyoB on the plasma membrane than do normal growth phase cells. This recruitment of MyoB may be required for controlling appropriate pseudopod formation as myoB −mutants extend an increased number of pseudopodia (20Wessels D. Murray J. Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. Soll D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, significantly less MyoC and MyoD is present on the plasma membrane in streaming cells. The total amounts of these myosin I are lower than that of MyoB and they do not increase during streaming (18Jung G. Wu X. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and a much smaller increase in their association with the membrane is observed (Table I). The lower levels of plasma membrane-associated MyoC and MyoD in streaming cells are consistent with the finding thatmyoC − and myoD − mutants move at normal rates of speed and do not exhibit any delays in streaming (51Jung G. Fukui Y. Martin B. Hammer III, J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14981-14990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Peterson M.D. Novak K.D. Reedy M.C. Ruman J.I. Titus M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1093-1103PubMed Google Scholar).The finding that the deletion of a single amoeboid myosin I from either yeast or Dictyostelium does not result in profound phenotypes, suggests that these motors share overlapping roles (15Novak K.D. Peterson M.D. Reedy M.C. Titus M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1205-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 17Goodson H.V. Anderson B.L. Warrick H.M. Pon L.A. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1277-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 18Jung G. Wu X. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, compensation for the loss of one myosin I by another could occur either up-regulation of the activity or amount of one or more remaining myosin I. Examination of the remaining amoeboid myosin Is (MyoC and MyoD) in the myoA − andmyoB − cells and MyoB in themyoA − cells reveals that the overall levels of these myosin Is are not increased in the mutants (Table II). However, there is a 2-fold increase in the amount of membrane-associated MyoC and -D in the myoA − andmyoB − mutants (Table II). The availability of free myosin I-binding sites on the plasma membrane may allow an increased amount of MyoC and MyoD to bind to the plasma membrane. Alternatively, the mutant cells may have a mechanism for increasing the recruitment of the remaining myosin I to the plasma membrane during streaming in an effort to compensate for the loss of either MyoA or MyoB. The 2-fold increase in the levels of membrane-associated MyoC and MyoD in the myoA − ormyoB − mutants (Table II) is clearly insufficient to compensate for the loss of either of these myosin I. This is most likely due to the fact that the levels of MyoC and -D expressed by the cell during streaming are significantly lower than those of MyoB (18Jung G. Wu X. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, there is evidence that the relatively small increase in MyoC and -D on the plasma membrane could be playing a role in maintaining some level of normal function related to motility in the mutant cells. The motility of amyoB −/D − double mutant does not appear to be worse than that of themyoB − single mutant, however, themyoB −/C −/D −triple mutant moves a bit more slowly and is more severely delayed in streaming (18Jung G. Wu X. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, MyoC may play a role in the efficient motility ofDictyostelium myosin I mutants but, despite increased recruitment to the plasma membrane, it is not sufficient to fully compensate for the loss of MyoB.The role of membrane association in myosin I function remains unclear. A kinetic analysis of two Acanthamoeba myosin Is, IA and IB, demonstrates that this class of motor protein is not proccessive, and indicates that myosin I must tightly gather on membranes and/or the actin cytoskeleton to power membrane movement or contraction of the actin cortex (57Ostap E.M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Ostap and Pollard (57Ostap E.M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) estimated that a cluster of at least 20 molecules of myosin I would be necessary for membrane-based myosin I function. The present results showing 32 molecules of MyoB present per μm2 of plasma membrane would suggest that this amount is insufficient to move the plasma membrane along actin if it were uniformly dispersed across the inner plasma membrane surface. However, immunolocalization data indicate that all three of theDictyostelium amoeboid myosin Is are specifically concentrated in one region of the cell (such as in an extending pseudopod or macropinocytic ruffle) (25Fukui Y. Lynch T.J. Brzeska H. Korn E.D. Nature. 1989; 341: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 56Morita Y.S. Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. Fukui Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 371-379PubMed Google Scholar). A highly motile, chemotactic cell must have a high local concentration of MyoB on the plasma membrane. This would result from a combination of a 5-fold increase in levels of MyoB (when compared with growth phase cells) and a 2-fold overall increase in MyoB on the plasma membrane during streaming (18Jung G. Wu X. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (Table II). The average amount of plasma-membrane bound MyoB in chemotactic cells, now increased to 320 molecules per μm2, could occupy 0.1 μm2 (assuming that 20 molecules of myosin I occupy 25 × 25 nm on the plasma membrane; Jontes and Milligan as cited in Ref. 57Ostap E.M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) of the membrane surface. In other words, 10% of the unit membrane area would be covered by MyoB. Given that the average length of F-actin in Dictyostelium is 0.2 μm (58Podolski J.L. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1312-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this appears to be sufficient to generate force for motility along F-actin. Therefore, the membrane association of MyoB could potentially be important in allowing this myosin I to participate in the regulated formation of pseudopodia during directed migration, consistent with the finding that deletion of MyoB results in significant defects in pseudopod formation (20Wessels D. Murray J. Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. Soll D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The class I myosins are expressed in a wide range of organisms and cell types where they have roles in moving membranes along actin filaments (1Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). They possess a conserved N-terminal motor domain, 1–6 light chain-binding sites, and a C-terminal tail that has a region rich in basic residues (the polybasic domain). The polybasic domain binds directly to either pure anionic phospholipid vesicles or stripped native plasma membranes with high affinity, in the 100 nmrange, in vitro (2Adams R.J. Pollard T.D. Nature. 1989; 340: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3Miyata H. Bowers B. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses reveals that there are at least four myosin I subclasses. The amoeboid subclass is the most widely expressed and its members are distinguished by the presence of two additional C-terminal tail domains (5Pollard T.D. Doberstein S.K. Zot H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 653-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Coluccio L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first is a region rich in glycine, proline, and alanine (or serine or glutamate), referred to as the GPA domain, that binds to actin in an ATP-insensitive manner, and the second is a Src homology 3 (SH3)1 domain either at the extreme C terminus or within the GPA domain (4Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Lynch T.J. Albanesi J.P. Korn E.D. Robinson E.A. Bowers B.A. Fujisaki H. J. Biol.

Molecular genetic analysis of myosin I function in yeast,Aspergillus, and Dictyostelium reveals that the individual members of this family have distinct, yet overlapping roles in mediating the functions of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (14McGoldrick C.A.

The nature of the roles played by myosin Is suggests that they may specifically interact with the plasma membrane and intracellular transport vesicles such as early endosomes or lysosomes.

T cell hybridomas expressing an α-CPM-mutated TCR show a dramatic impairment in antigen-driven interleukin-2 production. This defect can be complemented by a calcium ionophore, indicating that activation of the calcium pathway is impaired. Several lines of evidence implicate Fyn in the regulation of calcium mobilization, at least in part through the activation of phospholipase Cγ. Here we have investigated the potential involvement of Fyn in the TCR α-CPM signaling defect. Using T cell hybridomas expressing either a wild-type TCR or an α-CPM mutant, we show that Fyn fails to be activated by the mutant receptor following SEB binding and fails to generate tyrosine-phosphorylated Pyk2, a member of the focal adhesion kinase family. This defect correlated with an impairment in phospholipase Cγ phosphorylation. Production of interlukin-2 and activation of the transcription factor NF-AT in response to triggering of the TCR α-CPM mutant with SEB were fully restored in the presence of constitutively active Fyn. Hence the signaling defect generated by the TCR α-CPM mutation results at least in part from an impaired coupling of the TCR·CD3 complex to Fyn activation.

Cell. 1994; 76: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 2Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Following interaction with its ligand, the TCR triggers a tyrosine kinase (PTK) cascade orchestrated by Src and Syk family PTKs (2Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 3van Leewehn E.E.M. Samelson L.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As opposed to receptor PTKs, the TCR splits the dual function of ligand binding and signal transduction between a recognition module, the αβ heterodimer, which is responsible for ligand binding, and an effector module, the CD3/ζ complex, which interacts with the constant regions of the TCRαβ and is composed of the γε and δε heterodimers and a more loosely bound ζ/ζ or ζ/η dimer (4Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 487-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The intracellular domains of all the components in the CD3/ζ complex contain specific motifs, termed ITAMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif), which are present as one copy in the γ, δ, and ε chains and as three copies in the ζ chain. Upon TCR engagement these ITAMs become phosphorylated on their dual tyrosine residues by the Src kinases Lck and Fyn and as such become docking sites for SH2 domain containing proteins. This permits recruitment to the activated receptor of a number of signaling proteins, among which the central one is the Syk family PTK, ZAP-70. ZAP-70 preferentially interacts with fully phosphorylated ζ, an event which results in enhancement of its kinase activity and autophosphorylation/transphosphorylation on a number of tyrosine residues, which in turn permits recruitment of the next components in the signaling cascade (2Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 3van Leewehn E.E.M. Samelson L.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The evolution of a signaling strategy based on an effector module composed of multiple elements, each of which can be involved in protein recruitment to the activated receptor, has profound implications in terms of signal output, both in terms of quality and quantity. This is an essential feature for a receptor which must evaluate the quality of the ligand and translate it into a signal which can lead to activation, anergy, or apoptosis. The drawback of a receptor which has distinct ligand binding and signaling modules is the requirement of a mechanism whereby the TCRαβ can inform the CD3/ζ complex that contact with the specific peptide ligand has occurred and that signaling must initiate. An important role in this process has been recently attributed to a conserved motif (α-CPM) within the α-chain connecting peptide domain of the TCRαβ. Mutation of this motif, while not affecting surface expression of the TCR·CD3 complex, results in specific functional deficits (5Bäckström B.T. Milia E. Peter A. Jaureguiberry B. Baldari C.T. Palmer E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Most notably, thymocytes in transgenic mice expressing an α-CPM-mutated TCR fail to undergo positive selection (6Bäckström B.T. Muller U. Hausmann B. Palmer E. Science. 1998; 281: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, T cell hybridomas expressing this mutated receptor exhibit a dramatic impairment in IL-2 production and activation of the transcription factor NF-AT, despite a normal phosphorylation of the ζ chain. Interestingly, this defect can be complemented by a calcium ionophore, indicating that activation of the calcium pathway is specifically impaired (5Bäckström B.T. Milia E. Peter A. Jaureguiberry B. Baldari C.T. Palmer E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence implicate Fyn in the activation and modulation of calcium flux. Overexpression in T cells of wild-type Fyn, or expression of a constitutively active mutant, results in enhanced calcium mobilization and overcomes the requirement for a calcium ionophore in a pharmacological model of NF-AT activation (7Davidson D. Chow L.M. Fournel M. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1483-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 8Baldari C.T. Heguy A. Telford J.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, ζ chain-mediated calcium mobilization can be reconstituted by Fyn coexpression in a heterologous cell system (9Hall C.G. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Science. 1993; 261: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). At least part of this effect is achieved, either directly or indirectly, through phosphorylation and subsequent activation of PLCγ (10Shiroo M. Goff L. Biffen M. Shivnan E. Alexander D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4887-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 11Fusaki N. Semba K. Katagiri T. Suzuki G. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which hydrolyses membrane phospholipids, resulting in increased levels of IP3 and release of calcium ions from intracellular stores. Furthermore, Fyn has been shown regulate the function of the IP3 receptor by phosphorylation, thereby promoting release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (12Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Part of the effect of Fyn appears, however, independent of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis, although the underlying mechanisms are not known (13Rigley K. Slocombe P. Proudfoot K. Wahid S. Mandair K. Bebbington C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1136-1145PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the potential involvement of Fyn in the signaling defect displayed by a TCR harboring a mutant α-CPM. The T cell hybridomas expressing the SEB-specific TCR 3BBM74 and the TCR α-CPM mutant αIV/βIII have been described previously (5Bäckström B.T. Milia E. Peter A. Jaureguiberry B. Baldari C.T.

To minimize variability among samples, activation assays were carried out on duplicate aliquots of a single pool of transfected cells.

Cells were collected 8–10 h after activation and assayed for luciferase activity using the protocol from Promega and a BioOrbit 1253 luminometer. Luciferase activities in cells tranfected with a control vector were barely above background in the absence of stimulation (0.005–0.020 relative luciferase units). Although transfection with the expression vectors encoding F528Fyn or F505Lck significantly increased the level of basal luciferase activity, this was further enhanced following stimulation with antigen. To normalize the results and compare them among different experiments, basal activities were subtracted from induced activities. The resulting values were expressed as ratio of the SEB-induced activity to maximal phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/A23187induced activity. Cells were analyzed for TCR/CD3 surface expression using a FacsScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and saturating concentrations of biotinylated B20.1 (anti-Vα2.1 mAb) or F23.1 (anti-Vβ8.1 mAb) and phycoerithrin-labeled streptavidin, or fluoresceinated 145.2c11 (anti-CD3 mAb). Activations with mAb or SEB were carried out as described (5Bäckström B.T. Milia E. Peter A. Jaureguiberry B. Baldari C.T. Palmer E.

The optimal stimulation time using SEB-loaded APCs was determined by a time course analysis of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The ratio of T cells to APCs was 10:1. Cells (2–5 × 107/sample) were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl (in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aproteinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and postnuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated using the appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Italia) or agarose-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma Italia srl, Milan). When required, the milder detergents digitonin (1%) or CHAPS (10 mm) were used for cell lysis instead of Nonidet P-40. Lysates for in vitro autophosphorylation assays were obtained using 3% Nonidet P-40 to disrupt pre-existing intermolecular interactions. Molecular weight markers were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Italia.In vitro autophosphorylation assays of Fyn, Lck, or ZAP-70 specific immunoprecipitates were carried out in 20 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, at room temperature for 16 and 4 min for Fyn and Lck, respectively, and at 37 °C for 20 min for ZAP-70. The reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The filters were subsequently analyzed by immunoblot with anti-Fyn, Lck, or ZAP-70 antibodies to check that similar amounts of specific PTK were recovered in each immunoprecipitate. Immunoblots were carried out using a chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Retroviruses encoding F528Fyn were generated by transfection of the packaging line GP+E-86 and subsequent selection in 500 μg/ml hygromycin (Life Technologies Italia) as described (5Bäckström B.T. Milia E. Peter A. Jaureguiberry B. Baldari C.T. Palmer E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Virus-containing supernatants from drug-resistant pools of transfected GP+E-86 cells were collected from confluent cell layers after 7–10 days. T hybridoma cells (5 × 105) were infected with 1 ml of virus-containing supernatant in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. After 4 h incubation at 37 °C, the supernatants were replaced with complete medium containing 500 μg/ml hygromycin and kept under selection for 7–10 days. Determination of IL-2 in the culture supernatants of hybridoma T cells activated with increasing concentrations of SEB was carried out as described using the HT-2 indicator cell line (5Bäckström B.T.

We have previouly shown that a T cell hybridoma expressing a chimeric staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-specific TCR lacking the α chain CPM has a severe impairment in IL-2 production in response to antigenic ligand. This defect could be fully rescued by a calcium ionophore, suggesting that the calcium pathway fails to be activated by the mutant TCR (5Bäckström B.T. Milia E. Peter A. Jaureguiberry B. Baldari C.T. Palmer E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A central molecule in the induction of calcium mobilization is PLCγ, which is activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine residues following TCR triggering and as such induces release of calcium from intracellular stores by generating IP3 from membrane phospholipids. PTKs of the Src, Syk, and Tec families have been implicated, either directly or indirectly, in PLCγ phosphorylation (10Shiroo M. Goff L. Biffen M. Shivnan E. Alexander D.

We assessed the capacity of the α-CPM TCR mutant to promote PLCγ phosphorylation. PLCγ-specific immunoprecipitates from lysates of T cell hybridomas expressing either wild-type or mutant TCR and activated with SEB were probed by immunoblot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, SEB-dependent phosphorylation of PLCγ was completely abolished in the hybridoma expressing the mutant TCR. Hence the defect in the capacity of TCR α-CPM mutant to activate the calcium pathway is due at least in part to the failure of this TCR to activate PLCγ. Fyn has been implicated both directly and indirectly in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ (10Shiroo M. Goff L. Biffen M. Shivnan E. Alexander D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4887-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 11Fusaki N. Semba K. Katagiri T. Suzuki G. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A portion of the total cellular Fyn is found in a complex with the TCR, where it interacts through its N-terminal unique region with the γ, ε, and ζ chain, independently of the activation state of the TCR (25Samelson L.E.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Following TCR engagement, Fyn is activated and can in turn phosphorylate a number of substrates, which include, in addition to PLCγ, the adaptors FYB/SLAP-130, SKAP-55, and the PTK Pyk2 (27da Silva A.J.

Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To determine whether Fyn could be activated by the α-CPM-mutated TCR, Fyn activity was determined using in vitro kinase assays of Fyn-specific immunoprecipitates from lysates of the hybridomas expressing either wild-type or mutant receptors and activated with SEB. As shown in Fig. 2 A, a dramatic reduction in SEB-dependent Fyn activation was observed in cells expressing the mutant TCR, while direct TCR triggering with an anti-TCR mAb (which bypasses antigen presentation) resulted in normal levels of Fyn activation. No significant difference in the basal activity of Fyn was detectable in the hybridomas expressing wild-type and mutant receptor and in the parental hybridoma lacking the TCRαβ (data not shown). To assess whether the defective activation of Fyn was caused by an impairment in the association between Fyn and ζ, ζ-specific immunoprecipitates from lysates of the hybridomas expressing either wild-type or mutant TCR were probed by immunoblot with anti-Fyn antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 B, similar levels of Fyn co-precipitated with ζ in both hybridomas, ruling out a defective association between Fyn and ζ. Similar results were obtained fromin vitro binding assays using a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing the intracellular domain of the ζ chain (data not shown). The focal adhesion kinase family PTK Pyk2 is phosphorylated in response to TCR signaling and plays a key role in T cell activation (29Qian D. Lev S. van Oers N.S. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Katagiri T. Takahashi T. Sasaki T. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19645-19652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pyk2 is constitutively associated with Fyn, and as such associates, albeit loosely, with the resting TCR complex. Following TCR engagement, Pyk2 is phosphorylated by Fyn (29Qian D. Lev S. van Oers N.S. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We asked whether Pyk2 was constitutively associated with Fyn in cells expressing the TCR α-CPM mutant, and whether it could be phosphorylated in response to TCR engagement. Fyn-specific immunoprecipitates from lysates of the hybridomas expressing either the wild-type or the mutant TCR and stimulated with SEB were sequentially probed by immunoblot with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Pyk2 antibodies. As a control, the same experiment was carried out on cells stimulated with anti-TCR mAb. The results are presented in Fig. 3. Following SEB presentation, a phosphoprotein of about 115 kDa, which was identified as Pyk2, co-precipitated with Fyn in cells expressing the wild-type, but not the mutant TCR (left panel). Similar levels of phospho-Pyk2 co-precipitated with Fyn in both hybridomas when the TCR was directly triggered with an anti-TCR mAb (right panel). Of note, the association of Pyk2 with Fyn was similar in both hybridomas (middle panel). Also a p72-kDa phosphoprotein, which normally co-precipitates with and is phosphorylated by Fyn following TCR engagement (31da Silva A.J. Yamamoto M. Zalvan C.H. Rudd C.E. Mol. Immunol. 1992; 29: 1417-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), is absent from Fyn-specific immunoprecipitates from the hybridoma expressing the mutant TCR following SEB presentation (Fig. 3). Hence the TCR α-CPM mutant is incapable of activating Fyn and promoting phosphorylation of Fyn's downstream substrates. Tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ is found in a complex with ZAP-70, LAT, and Grb2 following TCR engagement (32Nel A.E. Gupta S. Lee L. Ledbetter J.A. Kanner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18428-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for ZAP-70 in PLCγ phosphorylation. In turn ZAP-70 activation requires a Src kinase at two sequential stages, first to generate appropriate docking sites on the CD3/ζ ITAMs, then to phosphorylate a tyrosine residue on ZAP-70 critical for its function (2Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 3van Leewehn E.E.M. Samelson L.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 33Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We asked therefore whether Lck and ZAP-70 could be activated in response to SEB by the TCR α-CPM mutant. The activity of both kinases was determined with in vitro kinase assays of Lck or ZAP-70 specific immunoprecipitates from lysates of the hybridomas expressing either the wild-type or the mutant TCR and activated with SEB. As shown in Fig.4, activation of both kinases was impaired in cells expressing the mutant TCR. Although a reduction in ZAP-70 activity is predictable if Src kinases are impaired, the failure of the mutant TCR to activate Lck suggests that both Fyn and Lck might be implicated in the signaling defect observed with the mutant TCR. To assess this possibility, we used a TCR defective Jurkat T cell model. Expression of the mutant TCR in these cells shows a defect in SEB-dependent activation of the transcription factor NF-AT, which could be rescued by a calcium ionophore (5Bäckström B.T. Milia E. Peter A. Jaureguiberry B. Baldari C.T. Palmer E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We used this model to ask whether bypassing antigen-specific TCR triggering by forced expression of constitutively active forms of Fyn or Lck could restore NF-AT activation by the TCR α-CPM mutant. Cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors encoding wild-type or chimeric TCR αβ, a NF-AT/luciferase reporter, and either empty vector or an expression vector encoding the constitutively active F528Fyn mutant lacking the negative regulatory tyrosine C-terminal residue. After recovery, cells were activated with SEB. Similar experiments were carried out using a vector encoding the constitutively active F505Lck mutant. The results are shown in Fig.5. Expression of F528Fyn restored the levels of NF-AT activation induced by SEB in cells expressing the mutant TCR to levels comparable to those induced by the wild-type TCR. Expression of F528Fyn also resulted in an enhancement of SEB-dependent NF-AT activation by the wild-type TCR (Fig.5). No significant increase in the NF-AT response to SEB was observed either in the presence of F505Lck (Fig. 5), or by a constitutively active Ras mutant (data not shown). Hence the introduction of constitutively active Fyn effectively complements the signaling defect in the α-CPM mutant receptor. To confirm this finding and analyze biochemically the effects of F528Fyn expression we cloned the cDNA encoding F528Fyn in a retroviral vector. Retroviral supernatants containing this construct were used to infect the T cell hybridomas expressing either the wild-type TCR or the TCR α-CPM mutant. Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of hygromycin. Flow cytometric analysis revealed no differences in the levels of surface TCR in these cells as compared with the respective parental lines (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6 A, the levels of Fyn in total cells lysates were significantly increased in the F528Fyn hybridomas, which is expected due to the presence of a long terminal repeat-driven F528Fyn expression construct. Probing the same filter with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed a considerably more complex phosphoprotein pattern in the F528Fyn-transduced hybridomas (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, in vitro kinase assays of Fyn-specific immunoprecipitates from hydridomas expressing the wild-type or mutant TCR, and from their respective F528Fyn transfectants, showed a large increase in Fyn activity in the F528Fyn-transfected cells (Fig. 6 B). Immunoblot analysis of similar Fyn-specific immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, followed by anti-Pyk2 antibodies (not shown), revealed higher levels of Fyn-associated, phospho-Pyk2 in the F528Fyn hybridomas (Fig. 6 C). Furthermore, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of ζ-specific immunoprecipitates showed constitutive ζ chain phosphorylation in F528Fyn-expressing cells (data not shown). To understand whether constitutively active Fyn could restore the IL-2 response to SEB in cells expressing the α-CPM-mutated TCR, the hybridomas expressing the wild-type or mutant TCR, and their respective counterparts expressing F528Fyn, were assayed for the capacity to produce IL-2 in response to SEB stimulation. As shown in Fig.7, the amount of IL-2 detected in the culture supernatant of the hybridoma expressing the mutant receptor and stimulated with SEB was close to background. On the other hand, the IL-2 response to SEB induced by the mutant TCR was fully restored in the presence of F528Fyn. Similar to the results obtained in the Jurkat T cell model, an enhancement of the response elicited by wild-type TCR in the presence of F528Fyn was also observed (Fig. 7). Collectively, the results strongly suggest that the signaling"

These studies emphasized the essential roles played by both the glycerol-3-phosphate and the malate-aspartate shuttles in modulating the cytosolic NADH pool.

In purified preparations of mGPDH from a variety of sources, both iron and acid extractable sulfur have been reported (2Dawson A.P. Thorne C.J.R. Biochem.

No further evidence, however, was obtained to support this suggestion, and the iron center of mGPDH has remained uncharacterized. In addition to the need to clarify the iron/l-ascorbic acid relationship of mGPDH in intact mitochondria, it was essential to examine the effect of l-ascorbic acid, iron and specific di-iron metalloenzyme inhibitors on homogeneous mGPDH. In the present study, the effects of propyl gallate and other related polyhydroxybenzoate inhibitors on pig brain mGPDH in intact mitochondria and on preparations of pure mGPDH were examined. Because of the potential role of mGPDH for shuttling reducing equivalents into the mitochondria during glucose-induced insulin release from pancreatic β cells, we also investigated the effects of a di-iron metalloenzyme inhibitor, propyl gallate, on glucose usage and glucose-induced insulin release from the rat insulinoma cell line, INS-1. dl-α-Glycerol phosphate, mannitol, MOPS, NaN3, Triton X-100, SHAM, PCAEE, DEAE-Sepharose (fast flow), and Sephacryl S-300 (fast flow) were purchased from Sigma.

Cerebra were removed shortly after slaughter, chilled on ice, washed in 0.25 m sucrose to remove excess blood, and frozen (−70 °C) for storage.

The supernatant fraction was then centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. The upper layer was decanted off, and the pellet was gently rinsed with small amounts of homogenizing fluid to remove broken mitochondrial remnants. The pellet was gently resuspended in 5 volumes of homogenizing fluid using a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was gently washed with homogenizing fluid to remove light weight fluffy mitochondrial fragments. The pellet was resuspended in 2.5 volumes of homogenizing fluid in a Dounce homogenizer, and the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted off, and the pellet was resuspended in ∼1 ml of 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, per g original tissue weight. Mitochondria were isolated as described above and placed in a freezer at −20 °C until needed. ETPs were prepared according the method of Green and Ziegler (24Green D.E. Ziegler D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 58: 416-425Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The thawed mitochondrial preparations were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended to a concentration of ∼20 mg protein/ml in a solution of 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP at 4 °C. The suspension was sonicated by a Branson Sonifier 450 with 3 × 30 s bursts of energy (40 watts). The suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min in a Spinco Ultracentrifuge 40K rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP. The suspended ETPs at ∼5–6 mg protein/ml were stored at −20 °C until assayed. Protein concentrations of mitochondria or ETP preparations were determined by the BCA protein assay protocol according to the manufacturer's direction (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. mGPDH activity in intact mitochondria was measured by oxygen uptake using a Clark oxygen electrode. mGPDH from freshly prepared mitochondrial suspensions of 5–7 g protein/ml in 250 mm sucrose, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, from frozen pig brain was assayed as described previously (18Jung C.-H. Wells W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Clark oxygen electrode chamber of 3.0 ml (model 53 oxygen monitor, Yellow Springs Instrument Co. Yellow Springs, Ohio) contained 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm GSH, 0.5–0.8 mg of mitochondrial protein, with or without 50 μml-ascorbic acid. Typically, oxygen uptake was measured for 3–6 min followed by the addition of 50 mmdl-glycerol-3-phosphate, pH 7.5, at 37 °C. The rate of oxygen uptake was measured with a Linseis recorder, and the rate, in nmol oxygen uptake/min, was corrected for the basal oxygen uptake rate before addition of the substrate. Values were expressed as nmol oxygen uptake/min/mg protein. Stock solutions of the inhibitor compounds were made up in absolute ethanol. When added to the assay mixture, ethanol aliquots of 30 μl or less were preincubated with the mitochondria for 3 min followed by the sequential addition of 50 μml-ascorbic acid (3 min of incubation) and 50 mmdl-glycerol-3-phosphate. Controls of up to 30 μl of ethanol in the 3.0-ml reaction volume had no effect on the oxygen uptake rates (data not shown). NADH dehydrogenase (oxidase) from pig brain ETPs was assayed spectrophotometrically by a modification of the method of Singer (25Singer T.P. Glick D. Methods of Biochemical Analysis. Academic Press, New York1974: 123-175Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm GSH, 0.26 mm NADH, 0.1–0.12 mg ETP protein, with or without 3 min of preincubation with various levels of inhibitors or 50 μml-ascorbic acid at 30 °C in a total of 500 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADH, and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded in a Gilford Response II recording spectrophotometer. NADH dehydrogenase activity (nmol/min/mg protein) were calculated from the extinction coefficient of NADH of 6.22 × 103m−1 cm−1. Because 5 μl of ethanol were without effect on enzyme activity, all additions of inhibitors were made with less than 5 μl of ethanol. Succinoxidase activity in ETP preparations was assayed by a modification of the method of Green and Ziegler (24Green D.E. Ziegler D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 58: 416-425Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The rate of succinate oxidation at 37 °C was measured by oxygen uptake analysis using a Clark oxygen electrode. The 3.0-ml reaction chamber contained 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm GSH, 0.3 mg of ETP protein, 50 mm potassium succinate, and with or without various concentrations of inhibitors or 50 μml-ascorbic acid. When inhibitors or l-ascorbic acid were included, ETPs were preincubated for 3 min. Ethanol, up to 30 μl/3.0 ml reaction volume, did not affect the succinoxidase activity. All steps in the purification of mGPDH were monitored for activity spectrophotometrically by the method of Garrib and McMurray (26Garrib A. McMurray W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The assay cuvettes contained in a final volume of 0.5 ml, 90 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm KCN, 3 mm INT, 0.6 mm menadione, and various enzyme fractions. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 mmdl-glycerol-3-phosphate and was monitored at 500 nm. The extinction coefficient of reduced INT was taken as 11.5 × 103m−1cm−1 at 500 nm (26Garrib A. McMurray W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Rates were expressed as nmol/min, and protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protocol described above. The purification of mGPDH was a modification of the method of Garrib and McMurray (27Garrib A. McMurray W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8042-8048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a typical preparation, 65–100 g of frozen pig brain were thawed and homogenized at 4 °C in 650–1000 ml of homogenizing buffer containing 200 mm mannitol, 80 mm sucrose, 0.2 mml-ascorbic acid, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, in a Waring blender for 1 min at low speed. The suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min in a Sorval RC2-B refrigerated centrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatant was stored on ice or kept at 4 °C for all subsequent steps, and the pellet was resuspended in 300 ml of homogenizing buffer and homogenized with an all glass Dounce homogenizer using five strokes of the pestle. The homogenate was diluted with 300 ml of homogenizing buffer, stirred for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant fractions of the previous steps were combined and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in 300 ml of 0.15 m KCl containing 1 mm DTT and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm sucrose followed by dilution 10-fold with 1 mm DTT. The slurry was stirred for 60 min on ice, and the diluted suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was washed with 300 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.02% NaN3 followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.02% NaN3, and the protein content was determined by the BCA method described previously. The suspension was stored at −70 °C until required. Washed and stored mitochondria were thawed at 37 °C, chilled, and kept at 4 °C throughout each subsequent purification step. The mGPDH was solubilized by addition of appropriate amounts of 10% Triton X-100 (Triton X-100/protein = 0.25 mg/mg protein) and was stirred for 60 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant fraction was saved for further purification. A 2.5 × 15 cm column of DEAE-Sepharose (fast flow) was equilibrated with buffer A consisting of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1 mmDTT, and 10% glycerol. After loading the sample, the column was washed with buffer A, and the enzyme was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient consisting of 150 ml of buffer A and 150 ml of buffer A containing 0.6m NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions with enzyme activity were pooled and diluted with triple distilled water to 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% glycerol, and 0.02% NaN3. A column of hydroxylapatite (2.5 × 6.0 or 12.0 cm) was equilibrated with buffer B consisting of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmDTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.02% NaN3. The diluted enzyme sample from the DEAE column was applied to the hydroxylapatite and washed with buffer B. The enzyme was eluted by a linear sodium phosphate gradient consisting of 50 ml of buffer B and 50 ml of buffer B with 150 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The enzyme containing fractions were subjected to LDS-PAGE to monitor purity. The fractions with highest activity and purity were pooled and concentrated to 1.5 ml by an Amicon Centiprep YM-10 apparatus. The concentrated enzyme fraction was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 (fast flow) column (2.5 × 92 cm) equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, and 0.2 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The fractions containing mGPDH activity were pooled, concentrated as described above, and subjected to LDS-PAGE analysis to assess purity. LDS-PAGE was performed on samples of purified mGPDH by a modification (28Hagopian K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) of the basic method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207478) Google Scholar). The stacking and separating gels (0.75 mm) had polyacrylamide concentrations of 5 and 8%, respectively. The gels were run at a constant 100V in a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For measurement of the mGPDH specific activity and kinetic properties, preparations of the pure enzyme were assayed by oxygen uptake using the Clark electrode following a modification of the assay described by Beleznai et al. (30Beleznai Z. Szalay L. Jancsik V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 631-636Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Homogeneous mGPDH (2–5 μg), stabilized in a solution of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, and 20% glycerol, was placed in a 3.0-ml chamber at 37 °C containing 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 0.6 mm GSH, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.15 mm menadione (freshly prepared as a 10 mmstock solution in absolute ethanol) as electron acceptor. Whenl-ascorbic acid was added, stock solutions of 10 mm crystalline l-ascorbic acid were freshly prepared in Chelex treated triple distilled water and stored on ice. For the addition of Fe2+ or Fe3+, freshly prepared stock solutions of 10 mm FeSO4 or FeCl3 were added prior to the preincubation period. After a 2-min preincubation, followed by a period (3–5 min) of linear recording for blank oxygen consumption, rates for mGPDH were initiated by the addition of 75 mmdl-glycerol-3-phosphate (stock solution of 1.5m substrate dissolved in 30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6). In the absence of enzyme, the addition of substrate caused no change in background oxygen uptake rate. For inhibition analysis, stock solutions of 60 mm propyl gallate in absolute ethanol were stored at −20 °C. When propyl gallate was included, it was added to the incubation mixture at 37 °C for 2 min prior to measurement of control oxygen uptake rates and those following addition of dl-glycerol-3-phosphate. Oxygen uptake measurements were carried out as described above using varying concentrations ofl-glycerol-3-phosphate (as the DL mixture) with 4.4 μg of protein in a 3.0-ml oxygen electrode chamber. GSH (0.6 mm), which had no effect on the oxygen uptake reaction rates, was added to each sample to maintain the l-ascorbic acid, when added, at the level designated, 150 μm. When iron was added to the reaction mixture, it was provided as 150–300 μmFeSO4 or 300 μm FeCl3. Reaction rates after substrate addition were corrected by rates measured in the absence of substrate. Other controls were run in the absence of enzyme when appropriate. Values were expressed as nmol/min and kinetic constants, K m (app) andV max(app), were determined using the advanced kinetics software provided by Gilford for the Response II spectrophotometer. The values for k cat were calculated by dividing V max(app) by the molar concentration of pig brain mGPDH with the molecular weight taken as 75,000 (21Cottingham I.R. Ragan C.I. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). INS-1 cells (kindly provided by Dr. C. B. Wollheim (31Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar)) were routinely cultured in CO2/air (1:19) at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11.1 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units penicillin/ml, and 100 μg streptomycin/ml. Cells were passed weekly by trypsin-EDTA detachment. All experiments were performed on INS-1 cells between passages 70–85. For static secretion studies, INS-1 cells were plated onto 12-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium plus supplements and grown for 24 h. The growth medium was then changed to RPMI 1640 containing 4 mm glucose plus the supplements described above, and cells were cultured for an additional 30 h. Cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in Krebs Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB buffer) (118.5 mm NaCl, 2.54 mmCaCl2, 1.19 mm KH2PO4, 4.74 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.19 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 4.0 mm glucose. Cells were then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in KRB buffer containing 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and either 4 or 16.7 mm glucose in the absence or presence of metabolic inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends. Propyl gallate was dissolved in absolute ethanol, and therefore all controls contained equal amounts of ethanol. Concentrations of insulin released into the medium were determined by insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a modification of the procedure described by Kekow et al. (32Kekow J. Ulrichs K. Muller-Ruchholtz W. Gross W.L. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Insulin released into the medium was normalized to cellular protein concentrations determined according to Lowry et al. (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose usage was measured using a modification of the method of Zawalich and Matschinsky (34Zawalich W.S. Matschinsky F.M. Endocrinology. 1977; 100: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,35Zawalich W.S. Pagliara A.S. Matschinsky F.M. Endocrinology. 1977; 100: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). INS-1 cells were plated onto 12-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/well and grown for 24 h. The growth medium was then changed to RPMI 1640 medium containing 4 mm glucose and supplements described above and incubated for an additional 30 h. Cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in KRB buffer containing 4.0 mm glucose. Glucose utilization was then measured by incubating cells for 30 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of KRB buffer containing 100 μm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and either 4 mm or 16.7 mm glucose and [5-3H]glucose at a final specific activity of 2.2 dpm/pmol. Vehicle controls or metabolic inhibitors were added as indicated in the figure legends. Background controls were determined by incubating the medium in the absence of cells. After incubation, duplicate 50-μl samples of the incubation medium were added to Eppendorf tubes containing 5 μl of 1n HCl. The Eppendorf tubes were then placed in scintillation vials containing 0.5 ml of H2O, and the scintillation vials were sealed tightly and incubated at 50 °C for 18 h. After cooling, the Eppendorf tubes were removed, 10 ml of Safety-Solve scintillation mixture were added to the vials, and the samples were counted in a Beckman scintillation counter. Glucose utilization was then determined from the following formula and expressed as picomoles of glucose metabolized per min per mg protein. The equilibration coefficient (EQC) was determined with3[H]H2O following the procedure outlined above. Glucose usage = (dpm − blank)/(specific activity × EQC × min). Pig brain mGPDH activity in isolated intact mitochondria was 28.6 ± 6.6 nmol/min/mg protein (n = 11). Addition of 50 μml-ascorbic acid increase mGPDH activity to 62.9 ± 10.7 nmol/min/mg protein (n = 11). These activities were completely inhibited by 10 mm KCN (data not shown), indicating that a functional cytochrome c oxidase was required to complete the reaction with oxygen whetherl-ascorbic acid was present or not. SHAM, PCAEE, propyl gallate, and lauryl gallate were potent inhibitors of pig brain mGPDH activity in intact mitochondria stimulated by l-ascorbic acid (Fig. 1). In contrast, these agents were without effect on the basal activity, i.e. activity in the absence of l-ascorbic acid (data not shown). The concentration of each compound calculated to cause 50% inhibition of the l-ascorbic acid stimulated activities were: SHAM, 27.7 ± 6.9 μm; PCAEE, 585 ± 203 nm; propyl gallate, 305 ± 113 nm; and lauryl gallate, 111 ± 42 nm. NADH dehydrogenase and succinoxidase activities from pig brain ETPs were compared in the presence and absence of the four hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives. Minimal concentrations of each agent, previously found to completely inhibit the l-ascorbic acid-stimulated mGPDH activity, had no effect on these two well established iron/sulfur enzymes (data not shown). In addition, l-ascorbic acid had no stimulatory effect on the activity of either NADH dehydrogenase or succinoxidase (data not shown). The purification of mGPDH from pig brain was accomplished by a series of steps including Triton X-100 extraction of washed mitochondria, DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, Bio-Gel HT hydroxylapatite chromatography, and Sephacryl S-300 gel chromatography (Table I). mGPDH was judged to be homogeneous based on LDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2) with a molecular weight of 75,000. This value is in good agreement with that reported by Cottingham and Ragan (21Cottingham I.R. Ragan C.I. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Table IPurification of pig brain mGPDHPurification stepProteinTotal mGPDH activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgnmol/minnmol/min/mg%foldSolubilized inner membrane supernate89.737,819421.61001.0DEAE-Sepharose24.123,098957.6612.3Bio-Gel HTP hydroxylapatite1.6920,55112,1395428.8Sephacryl S-300 HR0.233,57815,7159.537.069 g of frozen pig cerebrum was used."
https://openalex.org/W2096016001,"The heavy-chain CDR3 region of the high affinity (<i>K</i> <sub>a</sub> = 1.3 × 10<sup>10</sup>m<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>) anti-digoxin monoclonal antibody 26-10 was modified previously to shift its specificity, by substitution of tryptophan 100 by arginine, toward binding analogs of digoxin containing substitutions at position 16. To further change specificity, two 5-mer libraries of the randomly mutagenized phage-displayed 26-10 HCDR3 region (positions 94–98) were panned against digoxin-bovine serum albumin (BSA) as well as against 16-acetylgitoxin-BSA. When a mutant Fab that binds 16-substituted analogs preferentially was used as a parent sequence, clones were obtained with affinities for digoxin increased 2–4-fold, by panning on digoxin-BSA yet retaining the specificity shift. Selection on 16-acetylgitoxin-BSA, however, resulted in nine clones that bound gitoxin (16-OH) up to 150-fold higher than the wild-type 26-10, due to a consensus mutation of Ser<sup>H95</sup> to Gly<sup>H95</sup>. The residues at both position H95 (serine) and position H100 (tryptophan) contact hapten in the crystal structure of the Fab 26-10-digoxin complex. Thus, by mutating hapten contact residues, it is possible to reorder the combining site of a high affinity antibody, resulting in altered specificity, yet retain or substantially increase the relative affinity for the cross-reactive ligand."
