https://openalex.org/W2024060531,There is a deep and useful connection between statistical mechanics (the behavior of systems with many degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium at a finite temperature) and multivariate or combinatorial optimization (finding the minimum of a given function depending on many parameters). A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods.
https://openalex.org/W2061555491,A rapid increase in the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was observed when samples of natural surface and ground water from various locations in the United States were exposed to sunlight. The hydrogen peroxide is photochemically generated from organic constituents present in the water; humic materials are believed to be the primary agent producing the peroxide. Studies with superoxide dismutase suggest that the superoxide anion is the precursor of the peroxide.

Triploid parthenogenetic females are distributed throughout central and western Australia and are all heterozygotes for one or more pericentric inversions that also distinguish the extant bisexual diploid cytotypes. These data on karyotype provide strong evidence that the various clones have arisen through multiple hybridization events between bisexual ancestors.

A survey of postcranial bones of Cretaceous and early Cenozoic multituberculates from North America reveals similar locomotor specializations. Multituberculates possessed distinctive tarsal adaptations for a range of pedal mobility characteristic of arboreal mammals that descend trees headfirst. The divergent hallux could move independently of the other digits. The long robust tail of Ptilodus possessed musculoskeletal features that, among living mammals, are associated with prehensility."

This makes these theories difficult to test in natural environments. It has proved possible, however, to design experiments to test these theories in a controlled, laboratory environment. The results of these experiments reveal shortcomings and incompleteness in the descriptive power of currently available theories of bargaining. However, these results also suggest important regularities in bargaining behavior. Together with recent theoretical developments, these results suggest some directions in which a more descriptively powerful theory of bargaining might be developed."
https://openalex.org/W1994819101,"Larvae of the bryozoans Bugula neritina and Bugula stolonifera exhibit an apparent negative geotaxis under conditions of darkness and constant temperature. This behavior cannot be accounted for by buoyancy since the larvae are negatively bouyant, nor is it a consequence of gradients in the partial pressures of dissolved gases since the response occurs under conditions where the gradient is reversed or when experiments are conducted in chambers with interfaces of only glass and water. Pressure bomb experiments indicate that the behavior is not a barokinesis. Centrifuge experiments, however, showed that larvae of Bugula stolonifera orient directly and actively to gravity, while those of Bugula neritina have some other measure of geographic up. Since bryozoan larvae lack statocysts, the sensory apparatus mediating the gravity response in Bugula stolonifera is still unknown."

The most important feature of the chamber was its wide mouth, which permitted easy insertion and removal of samples. With the double system of connections, either total or intermittent determinations were made with only momentary stoppage of the air-stream. The flow-meter proved very satisfactor in maintaining a known and uniform rate of aeration. The apparatus described was admirably adapted to the determination of carbon dioxide as a measure of respiration on apples, tomatoes and cut flowers."

This article discusses the discovery and future research steming from the discovery as well as the history of the research."

Also discussed is a less controversial alternative to continue to have DOE oversee the individual contractors but make deep cuts in department and laboratory bureaucracies and a third alternative, a hybrid of the other two, is presented."

https://openalex.org/W2027747913,"Hardly a word was said about Fermat's Last Theorem at the joint meetings of the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America, held this year from 4 to 7 January in San Francisco. For Andrew Wiles's proof, no news is good news: There are no reports of mistakes. But mathematicians found plenty of other topics to discuss. Among them: a computational breakthrough in the study of turbulent diffusion and progress in slimming down the proof of an important result in group theory, whose original size makes checking the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem look like an afternoon's pastime."
