https://openalex.org/W2119938020,"The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger is widely exploited by the fermentation industry for the production of enzymes and organic acids, particularly citric acid. We sequenced the 33.9-megabase genome of A. niger CBS 513.88, the ancestor of currently used enzyme production strains. A high level of synteny was observed with other aspergilli sequenced. Strong function predictions were made for 6,506 of the 14,165 open reading frames identified. A detailed description of the components of the protein secretion pathway was made and striking differences in the hydrolytic enzyme spectra of aspergilli were observed. A reconstructed metabolic network comprising 1,069 unique reactions illustrates the versatile metabolism of A. niger. Noteworthy is the large number of major facilitator superfamily transporters and fungal zinc binuclear cluster transcription factors, and the presence of putative gene clusters for fumonisin and ochratoxin A synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2003207389,"The molecular controls that govern the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells remain poorly understood. DGCR8 is an RNA-binding protein that assists the RNase III enzyme Drosha in the processing of microRNAs (miRNAs), a subclass of small RNAs. Here we study the role of miRNAs in ES cell differentiation by generating a Dgcr8 knockout model. Analysis of mouse knockout ES cells shows that DGCR8 is essential for biogenesis of miRNAs. On the induction of differentiation, DGCR8-deficient ES cells do not fully downregulate pluripotency markers and retain the ability to produce ES cell colonies; however, they do express some markers of differentiation. This phenotype differs from that reported for Dicer1 knockout cells, suggesting that Dicer has miRNA-independent roles in ES cell function. Our findings indicate that miRNAs function in the silencing of ES cell self-renewal that normally occurs with the induction of differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2149631083,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurological disorder characterized by mental retardation, motor dysfunction and epilepsy. We show that the molecular and cellular deficits of an AS mouse model can be rescued by introducing an additional mutation at the inhibitory phosphorylation site of αCaMKII. Moreover, these double mutants no longer show the behavioral deficits seen in AS mice, suggesting that these deficits are the direct result of increased inhibitory phosphorylation of αCaMKII."
https://openalex.org/W1976830636,"The structural diversity of glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharides is determined by the expression and regulation of glycosyltransferase activities and by the availability of the appropriate acceptor/donor substrates. Cells in different tissues and in different developmental stages utilize these control points to manifest unique glycan expression patterns in response to their surroundings. The activity of a Toll-like receptor, called Tollo/Toll-8, induces a pattern of incompletely defined, but neural specific, glycan expression in the Drosophila embryo. Understanding the full extent of the changes in glycan expression that result from altered Tollo/Toll-8 signaling requires characterization of the complete N-linked glycan profile of both wild-type and mutant embryos. N-Linked glycans harvested from wild-type or mutant embryos were subjected to direct structural analysis by analytic and preparative high pressure liquid chromatography, by multidimensional mass spectrometry, and by exoglycosidase digestion, revealing a predominance of high mannose and paucimannose glycans. Di-, mono-, and nonfucosylated forms of hybrid, complex biantennary, and triantennary glycans account for 12% of the total wild-type glycan profile. Two sialylated glycans bearing N-acetylneuraminic acid were detected, the first direct demonstration of this modification in Drosophila. Glycan profiles change during normal development consistent with increasing α-mannosidase II and core fucosyl-transferase enzyme activities, and with decreasing activity of the Fused lobes processing hexosaminidase. In tollo/toll-8 mutants, a dramatic, expected loss of difucosylated glycans is accompanied by unexpected decreases in monofucosylated and nonfucosylated hybrid glycans and increases in some nonfucosylated paucimannose and biantennary glycans. Therefore, tollo/toll-8 signaling influences flux through several processing steps that affect the maturation of N-linked glycans.

The vital functions of cellular glycans and the pathophysiologic consequences of altered glycosylation emphasize the need for understanding the basic mechanisms that regulate glycan expression in intact organisms. The expanding characterization of glycosyltransferases in Drosophila melanogaster has begun to define the bounds of structural diversity in the glycan portfolio of the organism and has also generated new opportunities for genetically dissecting the mechanisms that control glycosylation. Loss-of-function mutations have been described in a handful of key enzymes that are necessary for N-linked glycosylation (15Sarkar M. Leventis P.A. Silvescu C.I. Reinhold V.N. Schachter H.

These studies have reinforced the predicted functions of the enzymes in vivo and verified the synthetic and compensatory pathways that lead to production of major N-linked glycans in Drosophila. However, relatively little is known about the extent to which glycan diversity is affected by mutations in genes that do not directly act on the substrates, precursors, or products of oligosaccharide synthesis pathways. Such genes are candidates for regulators of glycan expression. We previously characterized a Drosophila Toll-like receptor protein, called Tollo/Toll-8, which is required for the induction of neural specific glycosylation in the embryo (20Seppo A. Matani P. Sharrow M. Tiemeyer M. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Neurons in tollo/toll-8 mutant embryos fail to generate oligosaccharides that carry Fuc in α1-3 linkage to the internal GlcNAc residue of the chitobiose core (GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ-linked to Asn) of their N-linked glycans. This structure, known as the HRP 3The abbreviations used are: HRP, horseradish peroxidase; CID, collision-induced dissociation; MALDI-TOF/MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization with time-of-flight mass spectrometry; NSI-MS, nanospray ionization with linear ion trap mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; TIM, total ion mapping; PNGase, peptide N-glycosidase; LacNAc, (Galβ1-3/4GlcNAc); LacdiNAc, GalNAcβ1-3/4GlcNAc; FucTA, fucosyl-transferase activity; GlcNAcT, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity; GalNAcT, N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity; SiaT, sialyltransferase activity; SA, sialic acid; Hex, undetermined hexose; HexNAc, undetermined N-acetylhexosamine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PMAA, partially methylated alditol acetates.

The abundance of the HRP epitope has not been determined previously in wild-type embryos, and loss of the epitope in tollo/toll-8 mutant embryos has only been detected by staining with anti-HRP antibody. Thus, it has remained to be determined whether Tollo loss-of-function affects the expression of glycans other than those that bear the HRP epitope. More broadly, the diversity of N-linked glycans in the wild-type Drosophila embryo has only been partially characterized (24North S.J. Koles K. Hembd C. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panin V.M. Haslam S.M. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has been appreciated for quite some time that the dominant class of N-linked glycans is of the high mannose type (24North S.J. Koles K. Hembd C. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panin V.M. Haslam S.M. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Williams P.J. Wormald M.R. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Parker G.F. Roberts D.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, considerable uncertainty has surrounded suggestions that Drosophila, at any stage of development, may be capable of synthesizing hybrid or complex glycans. Additional questions have been raised regarding the presence or absence of sialic acid (29Koles K. Irvine K.D. Panin V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4346-4357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Marchal I. Jarvis D.L. Cacan R. Verbert A. Biol.

Therefore, to provide a basis for assessing the specificity of mutations that alter glycan expression, we have characterized the major and minor N-linked glycans of the wild-type Drosophila embryo. We demonstrate that complex glycans are present as a minor species, including structures capped with sialic acid. As development progresses, the wild-type glycan expression profile shifts toward increased structural complexity. Finally, changes in glycan expression in mutant embryos indicate that Tollo/Toll-8 regulates activities in addition to α3-linked fucosylation. Materials—PNGaseF (N-glycanase), α-sialidases (Arthrobacter ureafaciens and Streptococcus pneumoniae), and β-galactosidase (S. pneumoniae) were obtained from Prozyme (San Leandro, CA). Trypsin, chymotrypsin, α-fucosidase (bovine kidney), and PNGaseA were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem. Other glycoprotein standards and fine chemicals were from standard sources. Standard media for propagation and growth of Drosophila were obtained from Genesee Scientific (San Diego, CA) or were prepared from commercially available agar and juices (apple or grape). Collection of Embryos and Preparation of Fly Embryo Powder—Antibody staining was performed on embryos that were fixed, dechorionated, and devitellinized as described previously (20Seppo A. Matani P. Sharrow M. Tiemeyer M. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Patel N.H. Goldstein L.S.B. Fyrberg E. Drosophila Melanogaster: Practical Uses in Cell and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 445-487Google Scholar). For the preparation of embryos for glycan analysis, large scale collections were harvested from grape juice agar plates placed into population cages that contained ∼1 × 104 D. melanogaster adults of the OreR strain. Overnight collections (0-18 h) generally yielded between 5 and 15 g wet weight of embryos. Smaller collections were obtained from apple juice agar collection vials that contained less than 50 adults. Over-night collections from vials generally yielded between 10 and 50 mg wet weight of embryos. Vial collections were used to obtain staged OreR embryos (early and late) and to collect embryos of the genotype Brd15/TM3, which are mutant for tollo/toll-8 (20Seppo A. Matani P. Sharrow M. Tiemeyer M. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For large or small scale collections, embryos were dechorionated in 2.5% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min, extensively washed with distilled water, and stored frozen at -80 °C for subsequent extraction. For staged collections, early embryos were collected from 0 to6hof duration, and late embryos were collected from 6 to 24 h of duration (adult flies were removed from the plate after 18 h of incubation and embryos were then aged for an additional 6 h). Collected embryos were de-lipidated as described previously (33Svennerholm L. Fredman P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 34Seppo A. Moreland M. Schweingruber H. Tiemeyer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3549-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos were disrupted on ice by Dounce homogenization in ice-cold water. Lipids were extracted by adjusting the solvent mixture to give a final ratio of chloroform/methanol/water equal to 4:8:3. The extract was incubated for 18 h at room temperature with end-over-end agitation. The insoluble proteinaceous material was collected by centrifugation and re-extracted three times. The final pellet of insoluble protein was dried under a stream of nitrogen or by rotary evaporation, following several additions of absolute ethanol to azeotrope residual solvent. The resulting solids were ground with a pestle to produce a uniform, granular fly embryo powder, which was stored desiccated at -20 °C. The protein content of fly embryo powder was determined by BCA assay (Pierce) and by quantitative densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein recovery in fly embryo powder, relative to total protein in the homogenate, was determined to be 91-95%. By quantification of Western blots probed with anti-HRP antibody, fly embryo powder contained 95% of the total HRP-reactive material of the homogenate, and the profile of recognized glycoprotein bands was not detectably different (data not shown). Preparation of Glycopeptides and Release of N-Linked Glycans—Fly embryo powder, generally 5 mg, was resuspended in 200 μl of trypsin buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, containing 1 mm CaCl2) by sonication and boiled for 5 min. After cooling to room temperature, 25 μl of trypsin solution (2 mg/ml in trypsin buffer) and 25 μl of chymotrypsin solution (2 mg/ml in trypsin buffer) were added. Digestion was allowed to proceed for 18 h at 37 °C before the mixture was boiled for 5 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed and dried by vacuum centrifugation. The dried peptide mixture was resuspended in 250 μl of 5% acetic acid (v/v) and loaded onto a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge column (35Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morri H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). The cartridge was washed with 10 column volumes of 5% acetic acid. Glycopeptides were eluted stepwise, first with 3 volumes of 20% isopropyl alcohol in 5% acetic acid and then with 3 volumes of 40% isopropyl alcohol in 5% acetic acid. The 20 and 40% isopropyl alcohol steps were pooled and evaporated to dryness. Dried glycopeptides were resuspended in 50 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for digestion with PNGaseF, or in 50 μl of 0.2 m citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, for digestion with PNGaseA, or in 200 μl of anhydrous hydrazine. Following PNGase digestion for 18 h at 37 °C, released oligosaccharides were separated from peptide and enzyme by passage through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. The digestion mixture was adjusted to 5% acetic acid and loaded onto the Sep-Pak. The column run-through and an additional wash with 3 column volumes of 5% acetic acid, containing released oligosaccharides, were collected together and evaporated to dryness. Glycan release by hydrazinolysis followed by re-N-acetylation and desalting over AG50-X8 were performed as described previously (36Patel T.P. Bruce J.A. Merry A. Bigge C. Wormald M.R. Jaques A. Parekh R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Preparation and HPLC Analysis of Pyridylaminated Glycans—Portions of released oligosaccharide mixtures were reductively aminated with twice-recrystallized 2-aminopyridine and sodium cyanoborohydride as described previously (37Hase S. Ikenaka T. Matsushima Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Pyridylaminated oligosaccharides were purified by passage through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge with stepwise elution using 100, 95, 90, and 50% acetonitrile in water. Oligosaccharides conjugated to 2-aminopyridine were quantitatively collected in the 50% step, dried, and stored at -80 °C. A standard of pyridylaminated isomaltose oligosaccharides, ranging over 1-20 glucose units, was prepared from an acid hydrolysate of dextran. Pyridylaminated glycan mixtures were fractionated on TSK amide-80 (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh Bioscience). The column was equilibrated with 10% buffer A (3% acetic acid, pH adjusted to 7.3 with triethylamine) and 90% buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 3% acetic acid, pH adjusted to 7.3 with triethylamine) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at ambient temperature (38Oku H. Hase S. Ikenaka T. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After sample injection, elution was performed with 100% buffer A for 10 min followed by a linear gradient from 0 to 50% of buffer B for 50 min. Fractions were collected every 2 min, and the elution of labeled glycans was monitored by fluorescence (excitation wavelength, 320 nm; emission wavelength, 400 nm). Fractionated glycans were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS and NSI-MSn. The elution position of pyridylaminated glycans was referenced to the elution of standard isomaltose oligosaccharides and is reported in Glc units. For the assignment of candidate structures, elution positions of Drosophila glycans were compared with the known elution positions of standard glycans using the data base available through the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan (39Takahashi N. Nakagawa T. Fujikawa K. Kawamura Y. Tomiya N. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 40Tomiya N. Awaya J. Kurono M. Endo S. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Exoglycosidase Digestions—Exoglycosidase digestions were performed following protocols provided by the suppliers. For β-galactosidase and α-fucosidase digestions, the substrates were pyridylaminated glycans previously fractionated on a TSK-amide column. Following digestion, products were purified by applying the reaction mixture to a Sep-Pak C18 column, washing the column with water, and eluting glycans with 10% acetonitrile in water. Eluted glycans were dried and resuspended for HPLC analysis on TSK-amide or permethylated for mass spectrometry to verify structure. For α-sialidase digestions, the substrate was fly embryo powder. Following treatment with sialidase, the resulting material was treated with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and PNGase as described above. Following permethylation, released glycan profiles were analyzed by NSI-MS. Permethylation of Glycans—To facilitate analysis by mass spectrometry (MS), portions of released oligosaccharide mixtures were permethylated according to the method of Ciucanu and Kerek (41Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). To compare relative glycan abundances in different samples, released glycans were permethylated with [12C]methyl iodide or [13C]methyl iodide and combined before analysis by MALDI-TOF/MS or NSI-MS. The ratio of peak intensities for differentially labeled glycans, detected in the same spectra, defined the relative abundance of each glycan. To determine whether differences detected initially in relative abundance measurements were artifacts of permethylation efficiency or isotope effects, the methylation reagents were reversed in a second analysis. In these experiments, the same values for the relative abundances between glycan preparations were detected by 12C/13C and by 13C/12C ratios. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization/Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF/MS was performed on an Applied Biosystems Voyager System mass spectrometer in positive linear mode. Permethylated or 2-aminopyridine-labeled glycan solutions were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with matrix (1 μl of glycan solution with 1 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a 20 mg/ml solution in 50% methanol), and 1 μl of the mixture was spotted on the sample plate. The instrument was externally calibrated with permethylated authentic high mannose type glycans from M5N2 to M9N2 (see Fig. 3 and supplemental Tables 1-3 for glycan nomenclature) prepared from ribonuclease B or with a partial dextran hydrolysate in the size range of Glc3-12. Average masses were obtained from spectra summed over 100-200 shots with a 337 nm nitrogen laser. Ions corresponding to individual glycans, which gave signal intensities greater than 3-fold above background, were quantified relative to the sum of the intensities of all candidate glycan ions to give “% total profile” for each glycan. Nanospray Ionization-Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry—For mass analysis by NSI-MSn, permethylated glycans were dissolved in 1 mm NaOH in 50% methanol and infused directly into a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ; Thermo Finnigan) using a nanoelectrospray source at a syringe flow rate of 0.40-0.60 μl/min. The capillary temperature was set to 210 °C, and MS analysis was performed in positive ion mode. For fragmentation by CID in MS/MS and MSn modes 28% collision energy was applied. Spectra generated in support of the reported structures are available upon request from the corresponding author. The systematic nomenclature of Domon and Costello (42Domon B. Costello C.E. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 397-409Crossref Scopus (2392) Google Scholar) was used to guide the depiction of fragmentation derived from MSn spectra. The total ion mapping (TIM) functionality of the XCalibur software package (version 2.0) was utilized to detect and quantify the prevalence of individual glycans in the total glycan profile. Through TIM, automated MS and MS/MS spectra (at 28% collision energy) were obtained in collection windows that were 2.8 mass units in width. Five scans, each 150 ms in duration, were averaged for each collection window. The m/z range from 500 to 2000 was scanned in successive 2.8 mass unit windows with a window-to-window overlap of 2 mass units. The 2.8 mass unit window allowed signals from the naturally occurring isotopes of individual glycans to be summed into a single response, increasing detection sensitivity for minor structures. The 2 mass unit overlap ensured that minor glycans, whose masses placed them at the edge of an individual window, would be sampled in a representative fashion. Although it is possible to obtain MS spectra up to m/z = 4000 on the LTQ, software limitations currently disallow TIM beyond m/z = 2000. Therefore, manual MS/MS was performed to determine whether ions detected in the range m/z = 2000-4000 arose from glycans. Most permethylated oligosaccharides were identified both as singly and as doubly charged species by NSI-MS. TIM peaks for all charge states of a given ion with m/z ≤ 2000 were summed together for quantification. The only singly charged ions detected at m/z > 2000 were assigned to the major structures M8N2, M9N2, and GlcM9N2, all of which were readily apparent and quantified as their doubly charged forms using TIM profiles collected over m/z = 500-2000. Signal intensity for the singly charged forms of M8N2, M9N2, and GlcM9N2 were less than 5% of the signal intensity for their respective doubly charged ions. The singly charged forms of minor glycans with masses predicted to be >2000 Da were not detected above the threshold for quantification. Peaks in TIM scans were quantified if 3-fold or greater above background. Glycan prevalence was calculated as the % total profile where the total profile was taken as the sum of the peak intensities for all quantified glycans. The MS/MS spectra for all TIM peaks were examined for the presence of daughter ions indicative of glycan. A polyhexose detected in the starting material gave rise to a ladder of repeating Δm/z = 204 fragments that overlapped with some N-linked glycan peaks detected by TIM. For peaks containing this contaminant, the MS signal intensity was apportioned to the relevant glycan based on the ratio of the first daughter ion of the glycan to the first contaminant ion measured in MS/MS. Two parameters are used to express the relative contributions of individual glycans in embryo samples. The “prevalence” of a glycan, expressed as % total profile and calculated as described above, normalizes the signal intensity for an individual glycan to the total signal intensity for all glycans from a sample profile. Therefore, this parameter reports the change in the relative contribution a single glycan makes to the total glycan profile for a single sample. The “relative abundance” of a glycan is calculated based on the 12C/13C ratio for differentially permethylated glycans prepared from separate samples that are mixed together before analysis. The amount of each sample to be combined is determined by the recovery of protein in the starting material. Therefore, this parameter reports the fold difference in the absolute amount of a given glycan per mg of protein between two samples. The N-Linked Glycan Profile of the Drosophila Embryo Is Dominated by High Mannose and Monofucosylated, Paucimannose-type Oligosaccharides—Glycans were released from Drosophila embryo proteins enzymatically, by treatment with PNGase, or chemically, by hydrazinolysis. Following enzymatic release and permethylation, mass spectra of unfractionated glycans demonstrated the overwhelming dominance of high mannose structures, ranging in size from M5N2 to GlcM9N2 (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). The three most prevalent structures were M5N2, M9N2, and the paucimannosidic glycan M3N2F. Similar profiles for the major glycans were produced by digestion with PNGaseF or by PNGaseA. Digestions were performed with one or the other enzyme because glycan release by PNGaseF is inhibited for N-linked oligosaccharides that bear Fuc-linked α1-3 to the internal GlcNAc of the chitobiose core, whereas PNGaseA is not restricted by core fucosylation (43Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer T.H.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 44Tretter V. Altmann F. Marz L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Therefore, based on PNGaseF specificity and on HPLC elution of tagged glycans (see below), the dominant, fucosylated paucimannose glycan is assigned as M3N2F6. Chemical release of glycans by hydrazinolysis generated profiles that were indistinguishable from PNGaseF or -A (data not shown), indicating a lack of additional branching or extension on core Fuc residues, as has been described in Caenorhabditis elegans (45Cipollo J.F. Awad A.M. Costello C.E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2606"

https://openalex.org/W2040473505,"p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSKs) integrate upstream signals through two catalytic domains. Autophosphorylation of Ser386 by the regulatory C-terminal kinase domain (CTD) is thought to be essential for activation of the N-terminal kinase domain (NTD), which phosphorylates multiple downstream targets1. We recently reported fmk, an irreversible inhibitor of the CTD of RSK1 and RSK22. Here we describe fmk-pa, a propargylamine variant that has improved cellular potency and a 'clickable' tag for assessing the extent and selectivity of covalent RSK modification. Copper-catalyzed conjugation of an azidoalkyl reporter (the click reaction) revealed that fmk-pa achieves selective and saturable modification of endogenous RSK1 and RSK2 in mammalian cells. Saturating concentrations of fmk-pa inhibited Ser386 phosphorylation and downstream signaling in response to phorbol ester stimulation, but had no effect on RSK activation by lipopolysaccharide. RSK autoactivation by the CTD is therefore context dependent, which suggests that NTD and CTD inhibitors should have distinct physiological effects."
https://openalex.org/W2064146867,"Regulation of serine protease activity is considered to be the sole mechanism for the function of α1-antitrypsin (AAT). However, recent reports of the anti-inflammatory effects of AAT are hard to reconcile with this classical mechanism. We discovered that two key activities of AAT in vitro, namely inhibition of endotoxin-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-α and enhancement of interleukin-10 in human monocytes, are mediated by an elevation of cAMP and activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. As expected with this type of mechanism, the AAT-mediated rise in cAMP and the impact on endotoxin-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-10 was enhanced when the catabolism of cAMP was blocked by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram. These effects were still observed with modified forms of AAT lacking protease inhibitor activity.

Regulation of proteolytic activity by endogenous anti-proteases represents a major mechanism limiting host tissue destruction at the sites of inflammation. α1-Antitrypsin (AAT), 2The abbreviations used are: AAT, α1-antitrypsin; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolyscharide; PKA, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDE4, phosphodiesterase type 4; SLPI, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor.2The abbreviations used are: AAT, α1-antitrypsin; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolyscharide; PKA, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDE4, phosphodiesterase type 4; SLPI, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. the major circulating serine protease inhibitor, was first isolated in 1955 and was so named because of its ability to inhibit trypsin (1Turino G.M.

Acta. 2001; 1535: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is now recognized that AAT, also known as α1-protease inhibitor, is a potent inhibitor of multiple serine proteases with particularly high activity toward the neutrophil serine proteases, neutrophil elastase, and proteinase-3 (3Travis J. Shieh B.H. Potempa J. Tokai J. Exp. Clin. Med. 1988; 13: 313-320PubMed Google Scholar, 4Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the circulating AAT is synthesized by the liver and is released rapidly during the acute phase response to inflammation or infection (5Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 6Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. Thorax. 1998; 53: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Alterations of the AAT molecule that compromise its structure and/or secretion and thereby lead to AAT deficiency are known to predispose the individual to diseases (7Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Clinical expressions of AAT deficiency can be seen in the lung, liver, and the skin, with considerable variability in the severity of disease (8Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 9Hutchison D.C. Am. J. Med. 1988; 84: 3-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In fact, AAT deficiency is the only known genetic risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a chronic inflammatory lung disease characterized by progressive proteolytic destruction of the lung (10Eriksson S. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 34-39PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is generally assumed that the anti-inflammatory effects of AAT are mediated by its anti-protease activity, recent data suggest that other mechanisms may be involved (11Libert C. Van Molle W. Brouckaert P. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5126-5129PubMed Google Scholar, 12Arora P.K. Miller H.C. Aronson L.D.

Our own in vitro studies, using monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), have demonstrated inhibition of TNFα production by native AAT and by AAT chemically modified to abolish its protease inhibitor activity. Furthermore, we have shown that both native and modified forms of AAT enhance LPS-stimulated IL-10 generation (14Janciauskiene S. Larsson S. Larsson P. Virtala R. Jansson L. Stevens T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The data generated with IL-10 was important because it inferred a specific mechanism for the effects of AAT rather than a general depressive effect of AAT on cell function. The aforementioned studies raised the important question as to how AAT might exhibit anti-inflammatory activity independent of protease inhibitor activity. Because the effects of AAT on LPS-stimulated monocytes TNFα and IL-10 were similar to those reported for PDE4 inhibitors (17Martorana P.A. Beume R. Lucattelli M. Wollin L. Lungarella G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 172: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and receptor agonists such as PGE2 (18Nicosia S. Patrono C. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1941-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Chung K.F. Sci. STKE 2005. 2005; : PE47Google Scholar), we hypothesized that AAT may mediate its anti-inflammatory activity through elevation of cAMP. cAMP is ubiquitously found in all mammalian cells and plays a key role in the regulation of many cellular functions (20Houslay M.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Classically, cAMP is thought to exert the majority of its intracellular effects by binding and activating cAMP-dependent PKA, thereby controlling the phosphorylation status and activity of multiple intracellular substrates (21Tasken K. Aandahl E.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 137-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 22Mei F.C. Qiao J. Tsygankova O.M. Meinkoth J.L. Quilliam L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11497-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In inflammatory cells, elevation of cellular cAMP either through activation of multiple membrane receptors or inhibition of cAMP catabolism results in inhibition of LPS-stimulated cytokine and chemokine release and leukocyte recruitment (23Yoshimura T.

This activity forms the mechanistic basis for the action of a number of new generation antiinflammatory drugs (28Barnette M.S. Underwood D.C. Curr. Opin. Pulm.

Here we report that AAT, independently of its proteinase inhibitor activity, increases cAMP levels in monocytes and thereby exerts its anti-inflammatory effects in a model of LPS-mediated inflammation in vitro. AAT Preparations—The α1-antitrypsin (human) Prolastin® (lot 26N3PT2) was donated by Bayer Corp. (Elkhart, IN). The vial of Prolastin® contained 1059 mg of functionally active AAT, as determined by its capacity to inhibit porcine pancreatic elastase. Prolastin® was dissolved in sterile water provided by the manufacturer for injections and stored at +4 °C. Purified human AAT were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem. The purity of the AAT preparations was >97%, and the inhibitory activity was >75%. AAT was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. To ensure the removal of endotoxins, AAT was decontaminated using Detoxi-Gel AffinityPak columns according to instructions from the manufacturer (Pierce). Purified batches of AAT were then tested for endotoxin contamination with the limulus amebocyte lysate endochrome kit (Charles River Endosafe, SC). Endotoxin levels were less than 0.1 enzyme units/mg protein in all preparations used. The protein concentrations of the prepared AAT in the endotoxin-purified batches were determined according to the Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Various AAT preparations were tested in all the experimental models, with the objective of demonstrating that our results are not dependent on the specific properties of one AAT preparation. Noninhibitory Forms of AAT—Temperature-inactivated AAT was produced by incubation at 60 °C for 10 h. The AAT was oxidized by N-chlorosuccinimide (Sigma) in a 25 m excess in a 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8. The buffer was changed to PBS using a centrifugal micro-concentrator (Centricon YM30, Millipore, MA). The temperature-inactivated and -oxidized AATs were tested for their ability to form complexes with pancreatic elastase (EC 3.4.21.36) (Sigma) and to inhibit elastase activity. Samples of inactivated or native AAT were incubated with pancreatic elastase at a 1.2:1 molar ratio for 15 and 30 min, respectively. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer, and the mixtures were analyzed using 7.5% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Temperature-inactivated and oxidized AAT did not form any complexes with elastase. Elastase inhibitory activity was assessed spectrophotometrically (spectrophotometer DU 600; Beckman Instruments). In brief, native, oxidized, or polymerized AAT was incubated with pancreatic elastase at a molar ratio of 1.2:1 for 5 min at room temperature in 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 8. After addition of 25 μl of chromogenic elastase substrate (succinyl-(Ala)3-p-nitroanilide, 1 mg/ml stock solution) to give a total sample volume 300 μl, absorbance was measured at 405 nm for 280 s. The absorbance values used for the calculation of elastase inhibition by AATs were corrected with blanks for buffer plus substrate. Temperature-inactivated and -oxidized AAT had no inhibitory activity. Monocyte Isolation—Human blood monocytes were isolated from buffy coats (total blood was obtained from 65 donors in this study) using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, buffy coats were diluted 1:2 in PBS with addition of 10 mm EDTA and layered on Ficoll. After centrifugation at 400 × g for 35 min at room temperature, the cells in the interface were collected and washed three times in PBS/EDTA. Cell purity and amounts were determined in an Autocounter AC900EO cell counter (Swelabs Instruments AB, Sweden). The granulocyte fractions were less than 5%. Cells were seeded at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1× nonessential amino acids, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, and 20 mm HEPES (Invitrogen). After 1 h, 15 min, nonadherent cells were removed by washing three times with PBS supplemented with calcium and magnesium. Fresh medium was added, and cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 ng/ml, J5 Rc mutant), 10–50 μm rolipram, 10–50 μm forskolin (Sigma) or predetermined concentrations of AAT, separately and in combination for 30 min and 1 and 18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Neutrophil Isolation—Human neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers using Polymorphprep™ (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) as recommended by the manufacturer. In brief, 25 ml of heparin anti-coagulated blood was gently layered over the 12.5 ml of Polymorphprep™ and centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 35 min. Neutrophils were harvested as a low band of the sample/medium interface and washed with PBS, and residual erythrocytes were subjected to hypotonic lysis. The neutrophil purity was more than 95% as determined on an AutoCounter AC900EO. Cytokine Assays—Cell culture supernatants from monocytes treated with LPS alone or in combination with AAT were analyzed to determine TNFα and IL-10 levels by using DuoSet enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay sets (R&D Systems; detection levels 15.6 and 31.2 pg/ml, respectively). Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis— 500 ng of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with the high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real time PCR was performed on cDNA corresponding to 25 ng of total RNA in a 7900HT fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) in a total volume of 25 μl. Samples were diluted 25 times for 18 S rRNA analysis. IL-10 primers were designed to span an intron, and melting curve analysis was performed on the 7900 HT instrument after the run to make sure that the signals were generated from cDNA and not genomic DNA. IL-10 and 18 S rRNA transcript levels were analyzed using the SYBR® Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) with the following primers: IL-10 forward, GGGAGAACCTGAAGACCCTCA and reverse, TGCTCTTGTTTTCACAGGGAAG; 18 S rRNA forward, CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA, and reverse, GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT. Taqman® gene expression assay Hs00174128_m1 was used to quantify TNFα mRNA levels according to the standard protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Fold expression values were calculated versus the sample with the lowest levels of each transcript using the ΔΔCt method after normalization to the internal control 18 S rRNA. Total Cellular cAMP Assay—Total cAMP levels in monocytes (1 × 107 cells/ml) alone, treated with various concentrations of rolipram, forskolin, AAT (0.1–4 mg/ml), or LPS (10 ng/ml) alone, or pretreated with LPS, 10 μm rolipram, or 30 μm forskolin for 1 h following exposure to AAT were determined by the cAMP Direct Biotrak scintillation proximity assay system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, cells alone or with stimulating agents were incubated for the pre-determined time periods and lysed for 5 min. The antiserum, tracer, and scintillation proximity assay were reconstituted with lysis reagent and mixed with the analyzed sample. The antibody-bound cAMP reacts with the scintillation proximity assay reagent that contains anti-rabbit second antibody bound to fluomicrospheres. Any 125I cAMP that is bound to the primary rabbit antibody will be immobilized on the fluomicrosphere, which will produce light. Measurement in a β-scintillation counter enables the amount of fluomicrosphere-bound labeled cAMP to be calculated. The concentration of unlabeled cAMP in a sample is then determined from a standard curve. Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Monocytes were incubated alone, with 30 μm forskolin, or 0.5 mg/ml AAT separately or in combination with 10 μm H89 for different time periods and lysed, and protein was determined using the Bradford method. Equal amounts of analyzed protein were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a semi-dry blot electrophoretic transfer system. Western blot analysis was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-PKA catalytic α/β (pT197) phosphospecific antibodies (BioSource International, Inc.) and polyclonal goat antiactin (I-19) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunocomplexes were visualized with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (1:10,000) (DAKO, A/S, Denmark) and developed using the ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphodiesterase Type 4 (PDE4)-specific Enzymatic Activity Determination—PDE4 activity in the absence and in the presence of 10 μm rolipram (positive control) or 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml AAT was determined using the PDE4 enzymatic assay kit (Fab-Gennix Inc). Ten μl (7.5 μg of protein) of PDE4 enzyme supplied with the kit was incubated with rolipram or various concentrations of AAT at 30 °C for 5 min. The enzyme was incubated in buffer only for total PDE4 activity measure. Freshly prepared PDE-buffered substrate containing 15 μl of [2,8-3H] cAMP ammonium salt (25–40 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the reaction tube and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with shaking. The reaction was terminated by transfer of the tubes to a 100 °C water bath for 3 min. According to the manufacturer's protocol, the cAMP is hydrolyzed by PDE activity into the noncyclic form. The PDE4 enzymatic activity is directly proportional to the adenosine formed. Separation of adenosine from AMP and cAMP was performed according to kit recommendations. The PDE4 activity was calculated by subtracting non-PDE4 activity from total PDE activity. PKA Activity Assay—Monocytes (1 × 107 cells/treatment) alone and treated for 1 h with 0.5 mg/ml AAT or 50 μm forskolin, an activator of PKA (32Sheng T. Chi S. Zhang X. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), were harvested, washed with PBS, and suspended in 0.5 ml of cold extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptide, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were homogenized using cold homogenizer, centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C, and assayed for PKA using the protein kinase A assay kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. [32P]ATP (specific activity 25–40 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The PKA reaction mixture contained 0.2 μCi/μl of [32P]ATP. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of PKA that catalyzed the incorporation of 1 pmol of phosphate from ATP into Kemptide/min/mg protein at 30 °C and pH 7.2. To confirm our findings we also used a nonradioactive PKA assay kit based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that utilizes a synthetic pseudosubstrate and a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the peptide (Calbiochem). Statistical Analysis—The Statistical Package (SPSS for Windows, release 13.0) was used for the statistical calculations. The differences in the means of the experimental results were analyzed for their statistical significance with the one-way analysis of variance with an overall significance level of α = 0.05. The independent two-sample t test was also used. Time-dependent Effects of AAT and AAT/LPS on TNFα and IL-10 Release—TNFα and IL-10 protein and mRNA were measured in monocytes 2, 6, and 18 h after exposure to LPS and AAT, either alone or in combination. At 2 h, both LPS and AAT induced TNFα protein, albeit at very modest levels, whereas AAT alone induced IL-10. Exposure of monocytes to LPS (10 ng/ml) and AAT (0.5 mg/ml) in combination, however, resulted in a more than additive increase in TNFα compared with either agent alone. No significant difference was found between effects of AAT alone and AAT and LPS in combination on IL-10 at 2 h (Fig. 1A). Thus, the effects of combinations of LPS and AAT at 2 h on TNFα protein appeared to be synergistic, whereas those on IL-10 reflected substantially an effect of AAT alone. At 6 h, combination of AAT with LPS resulted in significant inhibition of TNFα protein, whereas IL-10 levels appeared to be enhanced in an additive manner. At 18 h, inhibition of LPS-stimulated TNFα protein by AAT was further enhanced, whereas dramatic increase of IL-10 release was observed.FIGURE 1Release (A) and mRNA expression (B) of TNFα and IL-10 by human monocytes in response to exposure for 2, 6, and 18 h to LPS (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of AAT (0.5 mg/ml). Each bar represents a mean of four independent experiments ± S.E. Each curve is the mean value of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explain further these complex changes in protein levels, we also performed mRNA analysis. At 2 h, we observed a remarkable increase in TNFα mRNA in response to combinations of AAT and LPS with moderate effects of both mediators alone. At 6 and 18 h, there was clear inhibition of LPS-stimulated TNFα RNA by AAT. For IL-10 we observed an increase in mRNA for combinations of AAT and LPS at 2 and 6 h. However, the changes in IL-10 mRNA did not mirror those in protein changes because significant IL-10 protein was observed at 2 h with AAT alone in the absence of detectable mRNA synthesis. The effects of AAT and LPS on IL-10 mRNA levels were transient with lower IL-10 mRNA levels in cells treated with LPS and AAT at 18 h than with LPS alone at this time point (Fig. 1B). AAT Elevates Total Cellular cAMP Levels in LPS-treated Monocytes—Monocytes stimulated with LPS alone for up to 1 h showed no detectable rise in cAMP levels (2.6 ± 0.4 pmol/107 cells in untreated monocytes (n = 10) and 2.45 ± 0.19 pmol/107 in cells pretreated with LPS for 1 h (n = 8)). However, when monocytes were pretreated with LPS for 1 h followed by addition of AAT (0.1–4 mg/ml) for 2 min, cAMP levels increased significantly (82–190%, p < 0.001) compared with controls (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, when monocytes were pretreated with LPS (10 ng/ml, 1 h), the addition of constant concentration of AAT (0.5 mg/ml) at various time points yielded a rapid up-regulation of total cAMP that peaked after 2 min (Fig. 2B). AAT Elevates cAMP Levels Independently of Its Inhibitory Activity—We next examined the effects of AAT and chemically modified forms of AAT, which lack protease inhibitor activity, on monocyte cAMP levels. Monocytes exposed to AAT for 2 min markedly increased their total cAMP levels as compared with control. Maximal cAMP responses to AAT occurred following incubation of cells with 1 mg/ml AAT for 2 min (2.6 ± 0.4 pmol/107 cells in untreated monocytes (n = 10 experiments) and 6.45 ± 1.2 pmol/107 in cells treated with AAT for 2 min (n = 8 experiments), p < 0.001). AAT was then rendered inactive as a proteinase (verified with neutrophil elastase inhibitor) by either oxidation with N-chlorosuccimide or heating to 60 °C for 10 h and tested for its ability to elevate cAMP. As shown in Fig. 3, both oxidized and polymerized forms of AAT triggered cAMP elevation in monocytes with a similar magnitude of response. When human serum albumin was used as a negative control in this experimental model, no effects on cAMP levels were observed (data not shown). Moreover, when secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), another serine protease inhibitor with anti-inflammatory activities, was included for comparison, no effect on cAMP levels was observed (3.2 ± 0.54 pmol/107 cells in untreated monocytes and 3.8 ± 0.6 pmol/107 cells in cells treated with 1 mg/ml SLPI for 2 min (n = 3)). SLPI was further tested at a range of concentrations with cAMP measurements at various time points up to 30 min with no significant effect (data not shown). In addition, to examine whether the effects of AAT on cAMP were cell-specific, the influence of AAT on neutrophil cAMP levels was determined. Under the same experimental conditions, AAT had no effect on neutrophil cAMP levels (data not shown). The Effects of AAT on Cellular cAMP Levels Are Mediated by Activation of Adenylate Cyclase—An important question regarding the AAT-stimulated rise in monocyte cAMP was whether it was because of effects on cAMP synthesis or catabolism. Forskolin and rolipram are substances that increase the concentrations of cellular cAMP by either direct activation of adenylate cyclase or by inhibition of PDE4, a major cAMP-catabolizing enzyme (33Seamon K.B. Daly J.W. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 7: 201-224PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hatzelmann A. Schudt C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 267-279PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of AAT on cAMP levels in combination with forskolin or rolipram by reasoning that a PDE4 inhibitor would enhance the cAMP response to an agent that induces its synthesis but not by an agent that prevents its catabolism, whereas a maximum response to forskolin might be enhanced by inhibition of cAMP catabolism but not by an inducer of adenylate cyclase activity. Monocytes were treated with either 30 μm forskolin or 10 μm rolipram either alone or in combination with AAT before measuring intracellular cAMP levels. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, AAT (0.5 mg/ml) alone induced an ∼3-fold increase in total cAMP levels at 2 min, whereas pretreatment of monocytes with forskolin resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in total cAMP levels. In combination, the effects of forskolin and AAT on cAMP were not additive. This suggests that maximum activation of adenylate cyclase had occurred with AAT. By contrast, pretreatment of the monocytes with rolipram alone resulted in an 87% (p < 0.01) increase in cAMP level elevation and caused a significant augmentation in cAMP levels in response to AAT (52% increase, p < 0.01, n = 3 experiments) compared with rolipram alone (Fig. 4B). Similarly, rolipram increased the forskolin effects on cAMP elevation (from 6.4 ± 0.8 pmol/107 cells in forskolin-treated monocytes to 9.45 ± 1.2 pmol/107 in cells treated with forskolin and rolipram in combination (n = 3 experiments), p < 0.01) (data not shown). To further support the contention that the effects of AAT were due to activation of adenylate cyclase rather than inhibition of cAMP catabolism, we evaluated the effects of SQ22536, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, on AAT-stimulated cAMP. Preincubation of monocytes with 25 μm SQ22536 for 45 min almost totally inhibited the ability of AAT to induce a rise in monocyte cAMP (Fig. 5). This finding together with the data obtained with rolipram and the failure of AAT to directly inhibit purified PDE4 in vitro (in contrast to 10 μm rolipram, which inhibited activity 86%, p < 0.001 (n = 3 experiments)) strongly suggested that the effects of AAT on monocyte cAMP levels were primarily because of activation of adenylate cyclase. AAT Stimulates the Downstream Activation of cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A—To confirm that the inhibitory effects of AAT occurred through the classical cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, the effect of AAT on PKA phosphorylation was evaluated. Both AAT (0.5 mg/ml) and forskolin (as positive control) increased PKA activity 213 and 256% (p < 0.001), respectively, compared with control (Fig. 6A). The effects of AAT and forskolin on PKA activity were confirmed by inhibition with 20 μm H-89. Western blot analysis, using a specific anti-PKA catalytic α/β (pT197) phosphospecific antibody, also confirmed downstream activation of PKA in a manner similar to forskolin (Fig. 6, B and C). As observed earlier when measuring cAMP levels of exposure of monocytes to AAT and forskolin combination had no additive effect on PKA activity (Fig. 6A) and protein levels (Fig. 6C). However, of note was that both AAT and forskolin alone induced a similar level of activation of PKA over 1 h (Fig. 5) despite very different temporal increases in cAMP. The in Vitro Anti-inflammatory Activity of AAT on LPS-stimulated Monocytes Is Mediated by an Elevation in cAMP—To link the rise in cellular cAMP to the anti-inflammatory effects of AAT on TNFα and IL-10, we evaluated the effects of AAT, rolipram, and forskolin, either alone or in combination, on LPS-stimulated monocyte activation after 18 h. In accordance with the data obtained for cAMP, the inhibitory effects of AAT on LPS-induced TNFα release were significantly enhanced when added in combination with rolipram. Furthermore, rolipram also enhanced the release of LPS-induced IL-10 release by AAT (73% p < 0.001) (Fig. 7, A and B). No significant changes in effects of AAT on LPS's induced TNFα release was observed in combination with forskolin (Fig. 8), and forskolin did not enhance the effects of AAT on LPS-stimulated IL-10 release (data not shown).FIGURE 8Effects of AAT and forskolin on"

The cytoplasmic regions of these three proteins interact to form a trimeric, four-helical complex, the generation of which drives fusion of the two opposing bilayers (3Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). This process is regulated by a conserved set of accessory proteins that operate throughout the trafficking pathway. The Sec1p/munc18 (SM) protein family represents one such set of modulators with SM protein mutations characterized by a severe disruption of general secretion or neurotransmitter release (4Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Harrison S.D. Broadie K. van de Goor J. Rubin G.M.

Geuze H.J. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The mammalian SM protein munc18-1 was originally isolated as a syntaxin 1-binding protein that binds to the monomeric form of syntaxin 1, rendering the t-SNARE unable to form the SDS-resistant ternary SNARE complex (8Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 9Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 1 can act as a molecular switch, adopting two structurally distinct forms (10Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In the open form, the SNARE helix does not interact with the N-terminal three-helical regulatory domain (termed Habc) and has been shown to not interact with munc18-1 (10Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In contrast, the closed form of syntaxin 1, in which the N-terminal Habc domain interacts with the SNARE helix, exhibits a high affinity for munc18-1. Association of syntaxin 1 with its SNARE partners to form the ternary SNARE complex, which prevents syntaxin from adopting the closed conformation, has also been shown to preclude munc18-1 binding (11Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, a recent finding by Zilly et al. (12Zilly F.E. Sorensen J.B. Jahn R. Lang T. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e330Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) using lysed cellular membrane sheets provided evidence that munc18-1 may interact with syntaxin 1 when in the binary SNARE complex (a heterodimer of syntaxin and SNAP-25). The interaction of munc18-1 with its cognate syntaxin is in sharp contrast to the specificity of its yeast homologue Sec1p, which binds its cognate syntaxin, Sso1p, in the ternary SNARE complex and not in the monomeric state (13Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This binding specificity has, however, since been questioned (14Scott B.L. Van Komen J.S. Irshad H. Liu S. Wilson K.A. McNew J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Another yeast SM protein, Vps45p, binds to its cognate Golgi syntaxin, Tlg2p, both in the monomeric state and in the ternary SNARE complex (15Bryant N.J. James D.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Nichols B.J. Holthuis J.C. Pelham H.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This interaction can occur through an N-terminal region of Tlg2p with a similar interaction observed for its mammalian Golgi homologue, syntaxin 16 (17Dulubova I. Yamaguchi T. Gao Y. Min S.W. Huryeva I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3620-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A similar ability to bind syntaxin in both monomeric and complexed forms has been observed for the SM protein Sly1p and its cognate syntaxin Sed5p (18Grabowski R. Gallwitz D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Peng R. Gallwitz D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy in binding mode suggests differences in binding sites and recognition motifs of SM proteins and their syntaxin partners. To date, the crystal structures of two SM proteins, munc18-1 and Sly1p (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae), in complex with their cognate SNAREs, have been solved (20Bracher A. Weissenhorn W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6114-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Despite exhibiting high structural homology, munc18-1 and Sly1p appear to interact with their cognate syntaxins, syntaxin 1a and Sed5p, respectively, through independent sites. Munc18-1 binds to the closed conformation of syntaxin 1a with the N-terminal Habc domain folded back on to the helix involved in SNARE complex formation (10Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 22Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), whereas Sly1p binds the N terminus of Sed5p through an independent binding site. The disparate modes of interaction between SM proteins and their cognate syntaxins, observed in different species and for different membrane compartments, are at odds with the conserved role for SM proteins in membrane fusion indicated by genetic experiments (2Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 23Toonen R.F. Verhage M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Importantly, effects exerted by munc18-1 on different stages in the syntaxin lifecycle, from trafficking (24Rowe J. Corradi N. Malosio M.L. Taverna E. Halban P. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), through vesicle docking (25Voets T. Toonen R.F. Brian E.C. de Wit H. Moser T. Rettig J. Sudhof T.C. Neher E. Verhage M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), to the final fusion event itself (26Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), cannot be explained using the current model of the munc18-1-syntaxin 1a interaction. In this study, we analyzed in detail the syntaxin 1-munc18-1 interaction using mutations shown to lock syntaxin 1 in the open conformation (10Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Here we show that munc18-1 binds to an evolutionarily conserved motif at the N terminus of syntaxin 1 in addition to the closed form binding mode. Using quantitative colocalization and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), we show that these two binding modes of syntaxin1 and munc18-1 are spatially segregated in living cells. Furthermore, although the closed form binding mode prevents progress through the SNARE assembly pathway, syntaxin 1 in the open form can progress to the ternary SNARE complex with munc18-1 remaining associated. This is the first demonstration that the major neuronal and neuroendocrine SNARE, syntaxin 1, and its cognate SM protein, munc18-1, can interact through dual modes of binding. Vectors and Cell Culture—Plasmids encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins with syntaxin 1a (amino acids 1–261, cytoplasmic domain), SNAP-25 (amino acids 1–206), and synaptobrevin (amino acids 1–96) were described previously (27Hu K. Carroll J. Fedorovich S. Rickman C. Sukhodub A. Davletov B. Nature. 2002; 415: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28Kweon D.H. Chen Y. Zhang F. Poirier M. Kim C.S. Shin Y.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5449-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding a polyhistidine-tagged munc18-1 (amino acids 1–594) was as described previously (29Graham M.E. Sudlow A.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Generation of N-terminal truncations of syntaxin 1a was performed by PCR and subsequent ligation into HindIII/KpnI and HindIII/XbaI sites of pmCerulean-C1 and PGEX-KG, respectively, or into pTargeT (Promega). Distance between the fusion tag and syntaxin 1a was maintained in all constructs. The (L165A,E166A) mutation was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange II XL kit (Stratagene). An EYFP-munc18-1 fusion was generated using similar standard techniques. Neuroblastoma 2A (N2A) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm l-glutamine, 50 units of penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2, 95% (v/v) air. All transfections were performed using ExGen 500 (Fermentas). Protein Biochemistry—Recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (30Rickman C. Davletov B. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For in vitro binding reactions, 2 μg of GST-syntaxin 1a or SNAP-25 was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated in a total volume of 100 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 (Buffer A) with 3 μg of protein to be tested for binding for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed by low speed centrifugation, and bound protein was eluted in SDS-containing sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. For binding reactions involving munc18-1, GST-fused syntaxin 1a was incubated either with freshly prepared detergent rat brain extract, as described previously (30Rickman C. Davletov B. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), or with freshly prepared detergent bacterial extract containing expressed recombinant His6-munc18-1. Circular dichroism experiments were performed as described previously (31Rickman C. Jimenez J.L. Graham M.E. Archer D.A. Soloviev M. Burgoyne R.D. Davletov B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the measurement of syntaxin 1a affinity for munc18-1, 0.2 pmol of GST-fused syntaxin 1a was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with increasing concentrations of munc18-1 in detergent bacterial extract in a reaction volume of 0.5 ml at 21 °C. The beads were washed three times in buffer A, and bound protein was analyzed by Western immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-munc18-1 antibody (BD Biosciences) and West Dura enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). The chemiluminescent signal was imaged using a cooled 16-bit CCD and quantified using ImageJ. The concentration of munc18-1 in the detergent bacterial extract was measured by purification of munc18-1 and in-gel quantification using Sypro Red (Invitrogen). The calculated intensity volumes were fitted with a variable slope dose-response relationship using Prism (GraphPad). For binding assays using a purified syntaxin 1a-munc18-1 complex, bacterial detergent extracts containing expressed GST-Syx1–261 (or variant) and His6-munc18-1 were mixed. The resulting protein complex was purified sequentially on glutathione-Sepharose resin and Profinity IMAC resin (Bio-Rad). Purity was assessed by Sypro Red in-gel staining to confirm an equimolar stoichiometric ratio (30Rickman C. Davletov B. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy and Image Analysis— All imaging experiments were performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Axiovert confocal laser scanning microscope, equipped with a pulsed excitation source (MIRA 900 Ti:Sapphire femto-second pulsed laser with a coupled VERDI 10-watt pump laser (Coherent). Data were acquired using a 1024 × 1024 pixel image size, using a Zeiss Plan NeoFLUAR 1.4 NA ×63 oil immersion lens or a Zeiss C-Apochromat 1.2 NA ×63 water-corrected immersion objective lens. All imaging was performed using living cells, maintained at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2, 95% (v/v) air. Image data, acquired at Nyquist sampling rates, were deconvolved using Huygens software (Scientific Volume Imaging), and the resulting three-dimensional models were analyzed using NIH ImageJ software. Residual maps were generated by calculating the residual of each voxel from the linear regression fit to the intensities of each channel within each voxel. The resulting residuals are displayed on a color scale from -1 to 1 (with zero residual colored cyan) with brightness corresponding to the combined intensity of the two channels. Cell peripheries were determined using transmitted light imaging combined with confocal data. TCSPC-FLIM Acquisition and Analysis—Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements were made under 800–820 nm two-photon excitation, which efficiently excited cerulean without any detectable direct excitation or emission from EYFP, using a non-descanned detector (R3809U-50) multichannel plate-photomultiplier tube or a fast photomultiplier tube (H7422; both Hamamatsu Photonics UK) coupled directly to the rear port of the Axiovert microscope. TCSPC recordings were acquired for between 10 and 60 s, and mean photon counts were between 105 and 106 cps. Images were recorded at 256 × 256 pixels from a 1024 × 1024 image scan with 256 time bins over a 12-ns period (32Duncan R.R. Bergmann A. Cousin M.A. Apps D.K. Shipston M.J. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 2004; 215: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Off-line FLIM data analysis used pixel-based fitting software (SPCImage, Becker & Hickl). The fluorescence was assumed to follow a multiexponential decay. In addition, an adaptive offset correction was performed. A constant offset takes into consideration the time-independent baseline due to dark noise of the detector and the background caused by room light, calculated from the average number of photons per channel preceding the rising part of the fluorescence trace. To fit the parameters of the multiexponential decay to the fluorescence decay trace measured by the system, a convolution with the instrumental response function was carried out. The optimization of the fit parameters was performed by using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, minimizing the weighted χ-square quantity. This approach can be used to separate the interacting from the non-interacting donor fraction in our Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) systems. The long lifetime component τ2 was determined by control assays with cerulean alone or expressed with (non-interacting) EYFP as described above. This value was subsequently used as a fixed τ2 lifetime for all other experiments. As controls for nonspecific FRET or FRET between green fluorescent proteins that may form dimers spontaneously when overexpressed in cells, we determined the fluorescence lifetimes of cerulean-Syx1–288 alone, cerulean alone, or cerulean-Syx1–288 co-transfected with EYFP (not shown). No FRET was detected in any of these experiments. Likewise, experiments using ceruleanA206K-fused Syx1–288 revealed no self-dimerization between fluorescent proteins. We analyzed the conservation of amino acids in syntaxin 1 homologues from evolutionarily distant species along with Sed5p from S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1A). There is a high degree of similarity between the syntaxin homologues throughout the sequence corresponding to the SNARE helix and head domain of syntaxin. Of note is the additional spike in similarity in the first 15 amino acids. Analysis of the sequence contained in this region demonstrated a high degree of conservation of amino acids with a lysine-aspartate-arginine (KDR) motif absolutely conserved in both Sed5p and the syntaxin homologues. A structural alignment of munc18-1 and Sly1p demonstrates the highly conserved topology of these two proteins despite an overall sequence identity of 18% (Fig. 1B). Highlighted on the bound Sed5p peptide (Fig. 1B) are the residues absolutely conserved in the sequence alignment in Fig. 1A. The conservation of these residues suggested that the N-terminal of syntaxin 1a may be capable of interacting with munc18-1 in a similar manner and that an open mutation of syntaxin 1a (10Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) could still support an interaction with munc18-1. We therefore determined the ability of syntaxin 1a (Syx1–261) and an open mutant of syntaxin (L165A,E166A) (10Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) (Syx 1–261 (Open)) to bind to munc18-1 in rat brain detergent extracts. Both forms of syntaxin readily bound munc18-1 (Fig. 1C). As the crystal structure of the syntaxin 1a-munc18-1 complex (notably excluding the first 26 amino acids of syntaxin) indicates that only closed syntaxin can bind to munc18-1 (21Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that an additional mechanism and site of interaction exists. To determine whether the conserved amino acids found at the syntaxin N terminus are involved in a direct interaction with munc18-1, we generated a series of truncations of syntaxin in both the wild-type and the open mutant forms. These purified proteins were incubated with a bacterial detergent extract containing recombinant His6-munc18-1 (Fig. 1D). Syx1–261 and Syx 1–261 (Open) both readily bound recombinant munc18-1 from bacterial detergent extracts, replicating the observation using detergent brain extracts. The N-terminal truncations of syntaxin 1a had no affect on their ability to bind munc18-1, but importantly, the combination of N-terminal truncation and the open mutations severely diminished munc18-1 interaction. As truncation of the first six amino acids produced a decrease in binding of munc18-1 to open mutants of syntaxin 1a (Fig. 1D), similar to the longer deletions, we concentrated on this short truncation in further experiments. Circular dichroism analysis confirmed that the mutations and truncations incorporated into syntaxin 1a resulted in no major changes to the secondary structure of the proteins (Fig. 1E). Because binding reactions, as used in Fig. 1D, are strongly dependent on the relative concentrations of the interacting partners used, the affinity of munc18-1 for syntaxin and for the mutant forms was measured. Syx1–261, Syx1–261 (Open), and Syx7–261 (Δ6) all had a similar affinity for munc18-1. Only when the open mutation was combined with truncation of the N terminus (Syx7–261 (Open) (Δ6)) was there a significant reduction in the affinity of syntaxin 1a for munc18-1 (Fig. 1F). These in vitro data suggest that syntaxin 1a can interact with munc18-1 through two distinct binding mechanisms. It is unclear, however, whether these binding modes are employed in a cellular context. To address this question, fluorescent fusions of munc18-1 and syntaxin 1a were visualized in living N2A cells. A quantitative approach was used to investigate colocalization of syntaxin 1a and munc18-1. In addition to the merger of the two emission channels, to display areas of coincidence, the intensities of both channels within each voxel were displayed as a frequency histogram and fit by linear regression. From this fit, residuals for each voxel were calculated and displayed as a residual map to highlight areas of covariance (expected if two proteins interact with a defined stoichiometry) within an image. Syntaxin 1a and munc18-1 exhibited a high degree of coincidence and of intensity covariance on the plasma membrane and in intracellular membranes (Fig. 2A). Similarly, Syx7–288 (Δ6) and Syx1–288 (Open) demonstrated a high degree of colocalization with munc18-1. Importantly, however, munc18-1 no longer colocalized with syntaxin when both the N-terminal truncation and the open syntaxin mutations were combined (Syx7–288 (Δ6) (Open)). Munc18-1 is a soluble protein with no localization signals, and as such, its membrane association relies on its interaction with syntaxin 1a (33Schutz D. Zilly F. Lang T. Jahn R. Bruns D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 2419-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); when co-expressed with Syx7–288 (Open) (Δ6), munc18-1 adopted a cytoplasmic localization. As a negative control for random colocalization, unfused munc18-1 and EYFP were co-expressed with cerulean-syntaxin 1a. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis demonstrated no significant difference between cerulean-Syx1–288, -Syx1–288 (Open), and -Syx7–288 (Δ6) covariance with EYFP-munc18-1 (Fig. 2B). However, the combined N-terminal deletion and open mutation of syntaxin 1a (Syx7–288 (Open) (Δ6)) resulted in a large decrease in covariance to a level not significantly different from the negative control. This quantitative analysis of colocalization between mutant proteins in living cells provided evidence for a role of the N terminus of syntaxin 1a in binding to munc18-1. However, colocalization data are limited by the resolution of the microscope (maximally 200 nm) and do not directly indicate interaction. To increase our understanding of each mode of syntaxin 1a binding to munc18-1, we employed FLIM. FLIM quantifies the fluorescence lifetime of a fluorophore, the duration of which is sensitive to the microenvironment it inhabits (32Duncan R.R. Bergmann A. Cousin M.A. Apps D.K. Shipston M.J. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 2004; 215: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, FRET, to an interacting acceptor molecule, dramatically shortens the donor fluorescence lifetime; this effect can be quantified directly in each pixel of an image. Furthermore, the low light levels required for FLIM allowed us to select cells expressing very low levels of exogenous proteins. Using this technique, the fraction of non-interacting and interacting donor fluorescence lifetimes in each pixel can be resolved (Fig. 3, A–D) (32Duncan R.R. Bergmann A. Cousin M.A. Apps D.K. Shipston M.J. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 2004; 215: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This approach revealed that fewer Syx1–288 and munc18-1 molecules interact on the plasma membrane when compared with intracellular locations (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.007, n = 18) and confirmed that Syx1–288 (Open) and munc18-1 interact in cells (Fig. 3F). Surprisingly, FRET (i.e. donor fluorescence lifetime and amplitude ratios) between cerulean-Syx1–288 (Open) and EYFP-munc18-1 was substantially decreased in intracellular membranes when compared with Syx1–288 and munc18-1 (p < 0.001, n = 8; Fig. 3F) with cell surface interactions maintained in evenly distributed puncta. In contrast, cerulean-Syx7–288 (Δ6) showed no decrease in interaction in intracellular membranes but a large reduction in FRET on the cell surface (p < 0.001, n = 8). These effects were additive; cerulean-Syx7–288 (Open) (Δ6) exhibited decreased FRET both intracellularly and on the cell surface (Fig. 3F). Thus, the two binding modes are spatially distinct with syntaxin 1a N-terminal deletion affecting plasma membrane interactions and abolition of syntaxin closed conformation binding affecting predominantly intracellular complexes. Why does deletion of the syntaxin N-terminal amino acids reduce interaction with munc18-1 at the plasma membrane? We have shown that N-terminal binding to munc18-1 is utilized when syntaxin is opened. This being the case, open syntaxin might be able to bind both munc18-1 and the other SNARE(s) simultaneously at the cell surface; loss of N-terminal interaction would thus dissociate munc18-1 in the presence of SNAP-25. To explore this hypothesis, we used highly purified complexes of syntaxin 1a bound to munc18-1. It was thus possible to probe the effect of N-terminal truncation and the open mutation on progression of syntaxin through the SNARE assembly pathway (Fig. 4A). Incubation of Syx1–261/munc18-1 with immobilized SNAP-25 demonstrated that in this form, syntaxin is unable to engage into either the binary SNARE complex or the ternary SNARE complex (Fig. 4A, left panel). The N-terminal truncation of syntaxin did not allow interaction of the Syx7–261 (Δ6)/munc18-1 complex with no SNAP-25 binding detected (Fig. 4A, center panel). However, incorporation of the open mutation into syntaxin allowed Syx1–261(Open)/munc18-1 to interact with SNAP-25 forming both the binary SNARE complex (t-SNARE heterodimer) and the ternary SNARE complex (Fig. 4A, right panel). As a control, munc18-1 alone was incubated with immobilized SNAP-25 (Fig. 4B). As shown previously (11Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), munc18-1 was unable to interact directly with SNAP-25. Importantly, munc18-1 remained bound to syntaxin 1a throughout the SNARE assembly pathway. This SNARE complex-munc18-1 interaction cannot include closed form syntaxin, and we conclude therefore that the N-terminal mode of interaction is essential at the cell surface for this reason. Our data demonstrate that munc18-1 can interact with syntaxin 1a through two discrete modes of binding that are spatially distinct within the cell. The closed form of syntaxin-munc18-1 binding is a structurally constrained state with properties comparable with those previously described for this complex (8Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 21Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). This mode of interaction is of high affinity and occurs primarily, but not exclusively, on intracellular membranes (Figs. 1 and 3). We speculate that this conformation of syntaxin 1a is clamped by munc18-1 to allow the passage of syntaxin through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, preventing ectopic intracellular SNARE complex formation. In addition to this form of binding, we now show that syntaxin 1a and munc18-1 can interact through an evolutionarily conserved motif at the N terminus of syntaxin. It is of note that an early clone of syntaxin 1a (22Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) lacks the conserved N-terminal amino acids identified in Fig. 1 and has since been widely used to examine syntaxin 1a protein-protein interactions. In contrast to a previous report (10Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) using rat brain extracts (as in Fig. 1D), munc18-1 readily binds to a mutation that prevents syntaxin 1a from adopting a closed conformation, exhibiting no reduction in affinity for this interaction (Fig. 1). We are unable to explain this discrepancy, although it should be noted that the mutants used in the NMR studies had a 26-amino acid N-terminal truncation as this gave better spectra (10Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Importantly, the full-length form of this mutant syntaxin rescues the Caenorhabditis elegans unc13 phenotype (34Richmond J.E. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 2001; 412: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), interpreted as circumventing the requirement for Unc13 to dissociate Unc18 and open syntaxin. However, we now show that this mutation permits syntaxin to progress through the SNARE assembly pathway, all the while still associated with munc18-1 (Fig. 4). Little or no information is available to describe the intracellular locations of SM-syntaxin interactions. A recent report found that Vps45p, an SM homologue in S. cerevisiae, can interact in vitro with its cognate syntaxin through an undefined second mode of binding in addition to its well characterized N-terminal interaction (35Carpp L.N. Ciufo L.F. Shanks S.G. Boyd A. Bryant N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 927-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Additionally, the mammalian SM protein munc18-3 binds its partner syntaxin 4 principally through an N-terminal interaction in vitro (36Latham C.F. Lopez J.A. Hu S.H. Gee C.L. Westbury E. Blair D.H. Armishaw C.J. Alewood P.F. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Martin J.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1408-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the authors of this report (36Latham C.F. Lopez J.A. Hu S.H. Gee C.L. Westbury E. Blair D.H. Armishaw C.J. Alewood P.F. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Martin J.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1408-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were unable to exclude that a second mode of binding exists. It is therefore credible that a dual mode of interaction with cognate syntaxins is a conserved feature of the SM protein family. Why have SM proteins evolved multiple functions and binding modes, and how do they control vesicle fusion? We propose that syntaxin 1a is transported to the plasma membrane in a closed conformation with the Habc regulatory head domain interacting with the SNARE helix, bound by munc18-1 (Fig. 4C). This is in agreement with a previously suggested chaper-one role for munc18-1 (24Rowe J. Corradi N. Malosio M.L. Taverna E. Halban P. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and would most closely resemble the binding mode observed in the crystal structure of the syntaxin1a/munc18-1 complex (21Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), although it may also include the additional interaction of munc18-1 with the N terminus of syntaxin 1a. This mode of binding would preclude any aberrant interaction with intracellular or trafficking plasma membrane SNAREs until delivery to the plasma membrane. At the plasma membrane, the syntaxin 1a would change conformation from a closed to an open state under the regulation of an as yet undefined plasma membrane factor (30Rickman C. Davletov B. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Richmond J.E. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10538-10545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this form, munc18-1 binding would occur through the N terminus of syntaxin 1a through a similar interaction as observed in the Sed5p/Sly1p crystal structure (20Bracher A. Weissenhorn W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6114-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This conformational change of syntaxin 1a would permit the subsequent interaction of syntaxin with SNAP-25 to form the binary t-SNARE heterodimer while retaining the interaction with munc18 through the N-terminal mode of binding. This complex may form a scaffold for vesicle docking, a proposed function for munc18-1 (25Voets T. Toonen R.F. Brian E.C. de Wit H. Moser T. Rettig J. Sudhof T.C. Neher E. Verhage M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 38Toonen R.F. Kochubey O. de Wit H. Gulyas-Kovacs A. Konijnenburg B. Sorensen J.B. Klingauf J. Verhage M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3725-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) that cannot be explained adequately using current models. Subsequent triggering of exocytosis would then drive engagement of synaptobrevin with the t-SNARE heterodimer to form the four-helical ternary SNARE complex formation driving membrane fusion. The association of munc18-1 with the ternary SNARE complex through the N terminus of syntaxin 1a can explain the observed effect that munc18-1 can exert on the final fusion step (26Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to expect that the function of munc18-1 here parallels that of sec1p, which apparently stabilizes the yeast exocytic SNARE complex and is required for vesicle fusion (13Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The interaction of munc18-1 with different conformational forms of syntaxin, at spatially distinct sites, can explain the multiple, and somewhat controversial, roles that munc18-1 has been proposed to play in the cell and so help unify thinking on SM protein structure and function."

We searched for chromosomal aberrations that characterize its pathogenesis using 47 different melanoma cell lines and tiling-resolution bacterial artificial chromosome-arrays for comparative genomic hybridization. Major melanoma genes, including BRAF, NRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, CTNNB1, CDK4 and PTEN, were examined for mutations. Distinct copy number alterations were detected, including loss or gain of whole chromosomes but also minute amplifications and homozygous deletions. Most common overlapping regions with losses were mapped to 9p24.3-q13, 10 and 11q14.1-qter, whereas copy number gains were most frequent on chromosomes 1q, 7, 17q and 20q. Amplifications were delineated to oncogenes such as MITF (3p14), CCND1 (11q13), MDM2 (12q15), CCNE1 (19q12) and NOTCH2 (1p12). Frequent findings of homozygous deletions on 9p21 and 10q23 confirmed the importance of CDKN2A and PTEN. Pair-wise comparisons revealed distinct sets of alterations, for example, mutually exclusive mutations in BRAF and NRAS, mutual mutations in BRAF and PTEN, concomitant chromosome 7 gain and 10 loss and concomitant chromosome 15q22.2-q26.3 gain and 20 gain. Moreover, alterations of the various melanoma genes were associated with distinct chromosomal imbalances suggestive of specific genomic programs in melanoma development."
https://openalex.org/W1982642101,"Administration of selenium in humans has anticarcinogenic effects. However, the boundary between cancer-protecting and toxic levels of selenium is extremely narrow. The mechanisms of selenium toxicity need to be fully understood. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, selenite in the millimolar range is well tolerated by cells. Here we show that the lethal dose of selenite is reduced to the micromolar range by the presence of thiols in the growth medium. Glutathione and selenite spontaneously react to produce several selenium-containing compounds (selenodiglutathione, glutathioselenol, hydrogen selenide, and elemental selenium) as well as reactive oxygen species. We studied which compounds in the reaction pathway between glutathione and sodium selenite are responsible for this toxicity. Involvement of selenodiglutathione, elemental selenium, or reactive oxygen species could be ruled out. In contrast, extracellular formation of hydrogen selenide can fully explain the exacerbation of selenite toxicity by thiols. Indeed, direct production of hydrogen selenide with D-cysteine desulfhydrase induces high mortality. Selenium uptake by S. cerevisiae is considerably enhanced in the presence of external thiols, most likely through internalization of hydrogen selenide. Finally, we discuss the possibility that selenium exerts its toxicity through consumption of intracellular reduced glutathione, thus leading to severe oxidative stress."

We have replaced the coding sequence of Atp6p gene with the non-respiratory genetic marker ARG8m. Due to the presence of ARG8m, accumulation of ρ–/ρ0 petites issued from large deletions in mtDNA could be restricted to 20–30% by growing the atp6 mutant in media lacking arginine. This moderate mtDNA instability created favorable conditions to investigate the consequences of a specific lack in Atp6p. Interestingly, in addition to the expected loss of ATP synthase activity, the cytochrome c oxidase respiratory enzyme steady-state level was found to be extremely low (<5%) in the atp6 mutant. We show that the cytochrome c oxidase-poor accumulation was caused by a failure in the synthesis of one of its mtDNA-encoded subunits, Cox1p, indicating that, in yeast mitochondria, Cox1p synthesis is a key target for cytochrome c oxidase abundance regulation in relation to the ATP synthase activity. We provide direct evidence showing that in the absence of Atp6p the remaining subunits of the ATP synthase can still assemble.

In the mitochondrial inner membrane, the F1F0-type ATP synthase produces ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate by using the energy of the transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient generated by the respiratory chain in the course of electron transfer to oxygen. The ATP synthase harbors two major structural domains, a transmembrane component (F0) containing a proton-permeable pore and a peripheral, matrix-localized, catalytic component (F1) where the ATP is synthesized (1Boyer P.D.

Due to its good fermenting capacity the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively used as a genetic system for the study of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (for reviews see Refs. 10Velours J.

Biol. 2005; 80: 95-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As in most eukaryotes, the yeast ATP synthase has a dual genetic origin, nuclear and mitochondrial. The yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase genes (ATP6, ATP9, and ATP8) encode the proton channel subunits a and c (usually referred to in yeast as Atp6p and Atp9p), respectively, and a third F0 subunit (Atp8p) of unknown function. Dozens of mutations in the nuclear ATP synthase genes have provided much information on their protein products (10Velours J. Arselin G. J. Bioenerg.

Mitochondria 1977: Genetics and Biogenesis of Mitochondria. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1977: 161-172Crossref Google Scholar), systematically produced one-hundred times more mutations in respiratory chain subunits (e.g. cytochrome b and Cox1p) than in the mtDNA-encoded ATP synthase subunits. The few isolated mitochondrial ATP synthase mutants were often genetically unstable in the form of ρ–/ρ0 petites, i.e. cells bearing large deletions in the mtDNA (ρ–) or totally lacking mtDNA (ρ0) (14Marzuki S. Watkins L.C. Choo W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 975: 222-230Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Choo W.M. Hadikusumo R.G. Marzuki S. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1986; 852: 133-143Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Those showing moderate mtDNA instability were often leaky mutants exhibiting slow growth on respiratory substrates. It has thus been assumed that the scarcity of mitochondrial ATP synthase gene mutants was due to their inherent genetic instability, and full inactivation of the mitochondrial ATP synthase genes was believed to result in nearly 100% petites (17Contamine V. Picard M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 281-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although frameshift and nonsense mutations in these genes were found, it has been suggested that they are not automatically stringent mutations because of the error-prone character of the mitochondrial translation apparatus (see Ref. 18Somlo M. Clavillier L. Dujon B. Kermorgant M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar for an example of a leaky frameshift mutation in the ATP6 gene). These early reports on yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase mutants, and later on the observation that mutations in nuclear-encoded subunits can also dramatically increase petite production (up to 100%), might have discouraged those who would have been interested in studying the mitochondrial ATP synthase proton channel subunits through the isolation of mutants, which may explain the absence of further mutational studies of these proteins over the last 20 years. Here, we aimed to determine whether yeast cells where ATP6 is completely deleted (i.e. where informational suppression is not possible) can be obtained and maintained in a ρ+ state. To this aim, we have used an approach, developed by Fox and co-workers (19Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), based on the insertion of non-respiratory genes, e.g. ARG8m, into the mtDNA. ARG8m is a mitochondrial version of the nuclear ARG8 gene encoding a mitochondrial protein involved in arginine biosynthesis. When ARG8m is present in ρ+ mtDNA, in a nuclear Δarg8 context and in the absence of external arginine, ρ–/ρ0 cells cannot divide. They should therefore accumulate less rapidly in cultures of mutants with an increased propensity to produce petites, if the systems in charge of the mtDNA are still functional and if retention of ρ+ mtDNA is not detrimental to the cell. In media lacking arginine, a yeast strain in which the entire ATP6 gene coding sequence had been replaced with ARG8m open reading frame, produced only 20–30% ρ–/ρ0 cells. This moderate mtDNA instability created favorable conditions for investigating the consequences of a specific lack of ATP6. Yeast Strains and Media—The S. cerevisiae strains and their genotypes are listed in Table 1. The media used for growth of yeast were: YPGA (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose, and 40 mg/liter adenine); N3 (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) glycerol, and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2); YPGALA (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) galactose, and 40 mg/liter adenine); WO (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) glucose, and other supplements depending on the strain auxotrophic markers); CSMD (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) glucose, and 0.8% (w/v) of a CSM mixture of amino acids and bases (from BIO-101); CSMG (CSMD containing 2% (w/v) galactose instead of glucose); CSMD-R (CSMD medium with a CSM mixture lacking arginine); CSMG-R (CSMG medium with a CSM mixture lacking arginine); CSMD-U (CSMD medium with a CSM mixture lacking uracil); and CSMD-R-U (CSMD medium with a CSM mixture lacking both uracil and arginine). Solid media contained 2% (w/v) agar.TABLE 1Genotypes and sources of yeast strainsStrainNuclear genotypemtDNASourceDFS160Mata leu2Δ ura3-52 ade2-101 arg8::URA3 kar1-1ρ0(19Steele D.F. Butler C.A.

Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR amplification of an atp6::ARG8m DNA cassette with primers 5′-GCtctagaTAATAAGATATAATTATGATTAATTATTTATAAGTTATAGTTTTATAAATTTATAATTATTATGACACATTTAGAAAGAAG and 5′-GCGggatccTTTATTATAGTTTAATACTCCATATGTAAATTATTTTATTTTATAATTTTATTTTATAATTTAAGCATATACAGCTTCG. These primers contained at their 5′-end a sequence (lowercase letters) for restriction, by XbaI and BamHI, respectively, followed successively by regions of homology to ATP6 (capital letters) and ARG8m (capital letters in bold). The regions of homology to ATP6 comprised the 50-bp sequence upstream of the ATP6 initiator codon and the 50-bp sequence downstream of the ATP6 stop codon. The PCR product cut with XbaI and BamHI was cloned into pJM2. This plasmid contains COX2 as a genetic marker for mitochondrial transformation (19Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant plasmid (pMR1) was introduced by co-transformation with the nuclear selectable LEU2 plasmid pFL46 into the ρ0 strain DFS160 by microprojectile bombardment using a biolistic PDS-1000/He particle delivery system (Bio-Rad) as described previously (20Bonnefoy N. Fox T.D. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 381-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial transformants were identified among the Leu+ nuclear transformants by their ability to produce respiring clones when mated to the non-respiring NB40-3C strain bearing a deletion in the mitochondrial COX2 gene (20Bonnefoy N. Fox T.D. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 381-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One mitochondrial transformant (synthetic ρ– called MR1) was crossed to MR6. This latter harbors the mitochondrial genome of wild-type strain FY1679 (entirely sequenced (22Grenson M. Mousset M. Wiame J.M. Bechet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar)), and the nuclear genotype of strain W303-1B modified as follows: (i) the mating type was switched into MATa with a plasmid borne HO gene, (ii) ARG8 was deleted and replaced with HIS3, and (iii) the can1–100 mutation was corrected by recombination with a PCR product bearing the wild-type CAN1 gene. Noteworthy, the CAN1 gene, which encodes a basic amino acids permease, is required for a good arginine uptake by yeast cells grown on synthetic or minimal media and hence for an efficient proliferation of arginine auxotrophic strains on these media (22Grenson M. Mousset M. Wiame J.M. Bechet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The crosses MR1 × MR6 (both are deleted for nuclear ARG8) produced arginine prototrophic clones (called MR10) harboring the expected replacement of ATP6 with ARG8m. Construction of Strain SDC30—The wild-type ATP6 locus, from nucleotide position –316 upstream of the ATP6 initiator codon to nucleotide position +275 downstream of the ATP6 stop codon, was PCR-amplified using strain FY1679 mtDNA as a template and primers 5′-CGggatccGCGGACCCCAAAGGAGGAG and 5′-CGggatccCAGTGGGGAAGGAGTGAGGT. Owing to the presence of a BamHI site at the 5′-end of these primers (lowercase letters), the PCR product was cloned as a BamHI-BamHI fragment into pJM2. The resulting plasmid, pSDC21, was introduced by biolistic transformation into DFS160 mitochondria as described above (DFS160 transformation with pMR1), to give the ρ– synthetic strain SDC30. In Vivo Labeling of Mitochondrial Translation Products—The wild-type strain MR6 and the atp6::ARG8m deletion strain MR10 were grown to early exponential phase (107 cells/ml) in 10 ml of liquid CSMD and CSMD-R media, respectively. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with a low sulfate medium (23Claisse M. Slonimski P.P. Johnston J. Malher H.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 177: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose, supplemented with histidine, tryptophan, leucine, uracil, adenine, and arginine (50 mg/liter each). Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of the same medium, and 1 mm cycloheximide was added. After a 10-min incubation at 28 °C, 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine plus [35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) was added. The cell suspension was further incubated for 10 or 60 min at 28 °C. Mitochondrial membranes were then extracted using the procedure described in a previous study (23Claisse M. Slonimski P.P. Johnston J. Malher H.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 177: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy Analyses of Yeast Cells—For visualization of mitochondria by fluorescence microscopy, the wild-type strain MR6 and the atp6::ARG8m deletion strain MR10 were transformed with the URA3 plasmid pGALCLbGFP bearing a galactose-inducible GFP fused to the pre-sequence of mitochondrial isocitrate synthase (25Okamoto K. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Transformed MR6 and MR10 cells were grown to early exponential phase (107 cells/ml) in liquid CSMD-U and CSMD-R-U media, respectively. The cells were observed in a fully automated Zeiss 200M inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with an MS-2000 stage (Applied Scientific Instrumentation, Eugene, OR), a Lambda LS 175-watt xenon light source (Sutter, Novato, CA), a 100 × 1.4 numerical aperture plan-apochromat objective, and a five-position filter turret. Filter cubes were for Alexa-phalloidin 568: Cy3 (excitation: HQ535/50; emission: HQ610/75; and beam splitter: Q565lp), for live cells GFP: Endow GFP long pass (excitation: HQ470/40, emission: HQ500lp, and beam splitter: Q495lp), and for fixed cells GFP co-localization Narrowband HQ fluorescein isothiocyanate (excitation: HQ487/25, emission: HQ535/40, and beam splitter: Q505lp, Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT). Images were acquired using a CoolSnap HQ camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ). The microscope, camera, and shutters (Uniblitz, Rochester, NY) were controlled by SlideBook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO). For live cell microscopy, 2 μl of the culture was spotted directly onto a glass slide and immediately imaged at room temperature (∼22 °C). For fixed cells imaging, formaldehyde was added (3.7% final) directly in the culture. Phalloidin staining was performed as previously described (26Sagot I. Rodal A. Moseley J. Goode B.L. Pellman D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) with Alexa-phalloidin-568 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). All the pictures are maximum projection of z-stacks acquired with a Z step of 0.3 mm. Freezing and Freeze Substitution for Ultrastructural Analyses of Yeast Cells—The wild-type strain MR6 and atp6::ARG8m deletion strain MR10 were grown to early exponential phase (107 cells/ml) in liquid CSMD and CSMD-R media, respectively. The yeast pellets were placed on the surface of a copper electron microscopy grid (400 mesh) coated with Formvar. Each loop was very quickly submersed in pre-cooled liquid propane and held at –180 °C with liquid nitrogen. The loops were then transferred to a pre-cooled solution of 4% osmium tetroxide in dry acetone in a 1.8-ml polypropylene vial and kept at –82 °C for 48 h (substitution fixation), warmed gradually to room temperature, and washed three times in dry acetone. Specimens were stained for 1 h with 1% uranyl acetate in acetone at 4 °C in a dark room. Following another rinse in dry acetone, the loops were progressively infiltrated with araldite (epoxy resin, Fluka). Ultrathin sections were contrasted with lead citrate. Miscellaneous Procedures—Mitochondrial enzyme assays and membrane potential analyses were performed on isolated mitochondria prepared by the enzymatic method (27Guerin B. Labbe P. Somlo M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), from cells grown in CSMD (MR6 strain) or CSMD-R (MR10). Protein amounts were determined by the procedure of (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 5% SDS. Oxygen consumption rates were measured with a Clark electrode in the respiration buffer (0.65 m mannitol, 0.36 mm EGTA, 5 mm Tris phosphate, 10 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.8) as described previously (29Rigoulet M. Guerin B. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For ATP synthesis rate measurements, mitochondria (0.3 mg.ml–1) were placed in a 2-ml thermostatically controlled chamber at 28 °C in respiration buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 4 mm NADH and 1 mm ADP and stopped by 3.5% perchloric acid, 12.5 mm EDTA. Samples were then neutralized to pH 6.5 by addition of KOH, 0.3 m MOPS. ATP was quantified by luciferin/luciferase assay (ThermoLabsystems) on an LKB bioluminometer. Participation of the F1F0-ATP synthase to ATP production was assessed by oligomycin addition (20 μg/mg of protein). The specific ATPase activity was measured at pH 8.4 using a described procedure (30Somlo M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 5: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Variations in transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) were evaluated in the respiration buffer by measurement of rhodamine 123 fluorescence quenching with a SAFAS Monaco fluorescence spectrophotometer (31Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). BN-PAGE experiments were carried out as described previously (45Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D. Brèthes D. di Rago J.-P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 68Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). CN-PAGE was performed as in a previous study (69Wittig I. Schagger H. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4338-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Cytochrome spectral analysis was performed as in a previous study (70Venar R. Brèthes D. Giraud M.-F. Vaillier J. Velours J. Haraux F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7626-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (32Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies raised against yeast ATP synthase (a gift of J. Velours) were used after dilution 1:10,000 for subunit α; 1:50,000 for subunit β; 1:10,000 for subunits γ, d, e, i, 4 and oligomycin sensitivity-conferred protein; 1:5,000 for Atp6p; 1:7,500 for Atp9p; and 1:500 for subunit h. Polyclonal antibodies against yeast complex III cytochrome b subunit (a gift of T. Langer) were used after dilution 1:2,000. Monoclonal antibodies against Cox1p and Cox2p subunits of complex IV (from Molecular Probes) were used after dilution 1:500 and 1:5,000, respectively. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled antibodies at a 1:10,000 dilution and revealed with the ECL reagent of Amersham Biosciences International. Mitochondrial RNA were extracted by the procedure of a previous study (34Labouesse M. Slonimski P.P. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) from MR6 and MR10 strains grown to exponential phase in CSMD and CSMD-R, respectively. They were separated (10 μg) on a horizontal 1% (w/v) agarose-6% (v/v) formaldehyde gel in MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA). The RNAs were then transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and hybridized with the following DNA probes: p14 (cytochrome b (34Labouesse M. Slonimski P.P. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)), pYGT21 (Cox1p (35Szczepanek T. Lazowska J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3758-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)); pYJL25 (containing the entire 15 S rRNA gene cloned into pUC13, provided by J. Lazowska); aI1 (HindII-MboI fragment of aI1 cloned into pUC13; provided by J. Lazowska); for ATP9, we used as a probe a PCR product amplified from strain FY1679 mtDNA with primers 5′-AATAAGATATATAAATAAGTCC and 5′-GAATGTTATTAATTTAATCAAATGAG; for ATP6, we used as a probe a fragment of the coding sequence (from position 340 to 780) that was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-GTATGATTCCATACTCATTTG and 5′-CTGCATCTTTTAAATATGATGCTG; for ARG8m, we used as probe a fragment (from position 1 to 692 of ARG8m open reading frame) that was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-ATGACACATTTAGAAAGAAGTAGA and 5′-GGTGAAGGTGGTGTATTTCC. Hybridizations were carried out in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5× SSPE, 0.5% SDS, 7% polyethylene glycol 5000, 5× Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml carrier DNA at 42 °C. Mitochondrial DNA for Southern blot analysis was prepared according to a previous study (33di Rago J.-P. Netter P. Slonimski P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3332-3339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from MR6 and MR10 strains grown to exponential phase in CSMD and CSMD-R, respectively. The mtDNA (5 μg) was digested with SwaI or AccI, electrophoresed on a horizontal 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer (Tris acetate 20 mm, 0.5 mm EDTA), and then transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Hybridizations with the ATP6 and ARG8m probes were carried out in 6× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml carrier DNA at 60 °C. The DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime™ II kit and purified on MicroSpin™ G-25 columns from Amersham Biosciences. Construction of a Yeast Strain Where ATP6 Is Replaced with ARG8m—Acetylornithine aminotransferase (Arg8p) is a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein involved in ornithine and arginine biosynthesis (36Jauniaux J.C. Urrestarazu L.A. Wiame J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Heimberg H. Boyen A. Crabeel M. Glansdorff N. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although it is normally synthesized in the cytosol and then imported into mitochondria, Fox and co-workers (19Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have shown that Arg8p can be directly synthesized inside the mitochondrion from a recoded gene, ARG8m, inserted into the mtDNA. In this study we have used ARG8m to delete the ATP6 gene. This gene is co-transcribed on a polycistronic RNA with COX1 and ATP8 and, in some strains, ENS2, which encodes an optional DNA endonuclease, in the order COX1-ATP8-ATP6-ENS2 (38de Zamaroczy M. Bernardi G. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 47: 155-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 39Foury F. Roganti T. Lecrenier N. Purnelle B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 40Nakagawa K. Morishima N. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1977-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Processing of the primary transcript yields two mRNAs containing both ATP8 and ATP6 (and ENS2 if present) and COX1 mRNA (41Simon M. Faye G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 196: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An atp6::ARG8m DNA cassette was constructed to precisely delete and replace the ATP6 coding sequence with the ARG8m open reading frame, in strain MR6 bearing a null allele in nuclear ARG8 gene (see “Materials and Methods”). The atp6::ARG8m isolates (called MR10) were selected by virtue of their capacity to grow on media lacking arginine. As expected, these clones were respiratory growth-deficient (Fig. 1). Several verifications proved that ARG8m was correctly integrated at the ATP6 locus in MR10. Southern blot analyses (Fig. 2A) and PCR reactions (Fig. 2B) on MR10 mtDNA revealed the expected DNA fragments (Fig. 2D). Moreover, MR10 recovered respiratory competence when crossed with SDC30, a ρ– strain containing the wild-type ATP6 gene (Fig. 2C). Influence of the ATP6 Deletion on mtDNA Stability—The influence of the ATP6 deletion on mtDNA stability was evaluated by scoring the number of ρ–/ρ0 petites in MR10 cultures. Two fermentable carbon sources were tested: galactose, which does not elicit catabolite repression, and glucose. In the presence of arginine, where ρ+ mtDNA is not required for MR10 growth, the glucose and galactose cultures contained ∼40 and 80% ρ–/ρ0 petites, respectively (after 20 generations, see Table 2). In the absence of arginine, two times less petites was found, 20% with glucose and 40% with galactose, respectively. This is because once they form MR10 ρ–/ρ0, cells cannot divide without an external source of arginine. We have no explanation for the increase in petite production with galactose.TABLE 2Accumulation of ρ-/ρ0 petites in MR10 culturesMediumρ-/ρ0 in"
https://openalex.org/W2033200059,"Embryonic development requires maternal proteins and RNA. In Caenorhabditis elegans, a gradient of CCCH tandem zinc finger (TZF) proteins coordinates axis polarization and germline differentiation. These proteins govern expression from maternal mRNAs by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that the TZF protein MEX-5, a primary anterior determinant, is an RNA-binding protein that recognizes linear RNA sequences with high affinity but low specificity. The minimal binding site is a tract of six or more uridines within a 9–13-nucleotide window. This sequence is remarkably abundant in the 3′-untranslated region of C. elegans transcripts, demonstrating that MEX-5 alone cannot specify mRNA target selection. In contrast, human TZF homologs tristetraprolin and ERF-2 bind with high specificity to UUAUUUAUU elements. We show that mutation of a single amino acid in each MEX-5 zinc finger confers tristetraprolin-like specificity to this protein. We propose that divergence of this discriminator residue modulates the RNA-binding specificity in this protein class. This residue is variable in nematode TZF proteins, but is invariant in other metazoans. Therefore, the divergence of TZF proteins and their critical role in early development is likely a nematode-specific adaptation. Embryonic development requires maternal proteins and RNA.

Embryogenesis is the process by which a fertilized oocyte transforms into a multicellular organism. Although the zygote contains all of the information required for development, zygotic DNA alone is not sufficient to drive patterning. Somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments, like those used to clone Dolly the sheep, demonstrate that maternal factors present in the oocyte cytoplasm are needed for the initiation of development (1Wilmut I. Schnieke A.E. McWhir J. Kind A.J. Campbell K.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar). These maternal factors are proteins and quiescent mRNAs (2Seydoux G. Braun R.E. Cell. 2006; 127: 891-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar); they coordinate early development prior to the onset of zygotic transcription. In the nematode worm Caenorhabiditis elegans, polarization of the body axes occurs after fertilization and requires several highly conserved maternal factors termed PAR proteins (3Etemad-Moghadam B.

Prior to fertilization, these proteins are uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm. Once the sperm penetrates the oocyte, they localize to opposing cortical domains in a process that requires microtubules derived from the asters of the sperm pronucleus. The PAR network coordinates asymmetric translation of several cell signaling proteins (11Mello C.C. Draper B.W. Priess J.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 95-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Thorpe C.J. Schlesinger A. Carter J.C. Bowerman B.

The PAR proteins are thought to locally deactivate maternal RNA-binding proteins thereby modulating the stability or translation efficiency of maternal mRNAs. Consistent with this hypothesis, posterior localization of PAR-1 promotes anterior localization of two putative RNA-binding proteins, MEX-5 and MEX-6 (14Schubert C.M. Lin R. de Vries C.J.

Development. 2003; 130: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although these proteins are 70% identical, their contributions to development only partially overlap. Disruption of mex-5 causes embryonic death with a terminal phenotype that includes proliferation of muscle (MEX = muscle excess). In contrast, deletion of mex-6 does not affect viability. Two major roles in development have been attributed to MEX-5. First, it controls segregation of the germline from the soma by activating zif-1, which promotes anterior turnover of three germline-specific maternal proteins (POS-1, PIE-1, and MEX-1) (16DeRenzo C. Reese K.J. Seydoux G. Nature. 2003; 424: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The overall result of this pathway is a gradient of MEX-5/6 from anterior to posterior and an opposing gradient of POS-1, PIE-1, and MEX-1 (Fig. 1A). Second, MEX-5 plays a relatively uncharacterized role in maintaining PAR polarity via a feedback loop with PAR-1 (15Cuenca A.A. Schetter A. Aceto D. Kemphues K. Seydoux G. Development. 2003; 130: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear if the two roles are linked at the molecular level. Additionally, there may be other roles for MEX-5 that have not yet been described. For example, residual posterior MEX-5 accumulates on the posterior centrosome and in P-granules, RNA-rich bodies that segregate with and determine the germline lineage (14Schubert C.M. Lin R. de Vries C.J. Plasterk R.H. Priess J.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15Cuenca A.A. Schetter A. Aceto D. Kemphues K. Seydoux G. Development. 2003; 130: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The functional ramifications of this localization are not known. MEX-5, MEX-6, POS-1, PIE-1, and MEX-1 are all CCCH-type tandem zinc finger proteins (Fig. 1B, hereafter TZF). 2The abbreviations used are: TZF, CCCH-type tandem zinc finger; TTP, tristetraprolin; UTR, untranslated region; ARE, AU-rich element; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FP, fluorescence polarization; TCR, temporal control region; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DIC, differential interference contrast.2The abbreviations used are: TZF, CCCH-type tandem zinc finger; TTP, tristetraprolin; UTR, untranslated region; ARE, AU-rich element; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FP, fluorescence polarization; TCR, temporal control region; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DIC, differential interference contrast. This class is typified by tristetraprolin (TTP), a mammalian protein involved in regulating inflammation response by destabilizing TNF-α transcripts (17Varnum B.C. Ma Q.F. Chi T.H. Fletcher B.

The expression pattern of several key maternal transcripts is perturbed in TZF mutants leading to the hypothesis that they directly regulate maternal mRNA stability or translation efficiency (14Schubert C.M.

If so, then the network of maternal RNA regulation in the embryo may be governed by differences in the RNA-binding specificity of each protein. Consistent with this model, TTP is an exquisitely specific RNA-binding protein; it recognizes nonameric UUAUUUAUU sequences present in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of its targets (19Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2004; 279: 27870-27877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). An NMR structure of the mammalian TTP homolog ERF-2 (also known as Tis11D) demonstrates that each finger individually recognizes a UAUU repeat (27Hudson B.P. Martinez-Yamout M.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In contrast, an in vitro interaction between any of the TZF proteins from C. elegans and RNA has not been demonstrated, and as such their mRNA target specificity has not been explored. MEX-5 and MEX-6 diverge from TTP in a few notable ways (Fig. 1B): (i) nine amino acids rather than eight separate the first two cysteines in each zinc finger, (ii) the spacing between fingers is lengthened, and (iii) several highly conserved amino acids that contribute to RNA binding in mammalian TZF proteins are not conserved in MEX-5 and MEX-6. These differences could impact the ability of MEX-5 and MEX-6 to bind to RNA. Moreover, MEX-5 has been shown to interact with ZIF-1 protein in a yeast two-hybrid assay (16DeRenzo C. Reese K.J. Seydoux G. Nature. 2003; 424: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may not regulate this factor at the RNA level. We set out to describe the RNA-binding properties of MEX-5 to probe its role in patterning the anterior-posterior axis. Protein Expression Constructs—Fragments of mex-5 and mex-6 containing the TZF domain (amino acids 236–350 and 250–400, respectively) were amplified from ORFeome clones (Open Biosystems) and subcloned into the vector pMal-c (New England Biolabs). Mutations of pMal-MEX-5-(236–350) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange (Stratagene). Purification of Recombinant Proteins—TZF domains from MEX-5, MEX-6, and mutants thereof were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli JM109 cells as C-terminal fusions to maltose-binding protein. Liquid cultures grown at 37 °C were induced in mid-log phase with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Zinc acetate was added to a final concentration of 100 μm at the time of induction. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science), 100 μm Zn(OAc)2) and lysed by sonication. Soluble protein was purified over an amylose column (New England Biolabs). Fractions containing the fusion protein were pooled and dialyzed into Q buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm Zn(OAc)2) and then further purified over a Hi-trap Q HP column (GE Healthcare). Final purification was achieved by combining fractions containing the protein and dialyzing them into S buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 6.0, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm Zn(OAc)2) before running them over a Hi-trap S HP column (GE Healthcare). Care was taken to minimize the amount of time the protein was exposed to pH 6.0 buffer. Pure fractions as determined by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE were combined and dialyzed into storage buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 100 μm Zn(OAc)2, 2 mm dithiothreitol). After dialysis, the protein concentration was determined using Beers law by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and a calculated extinction coefficient determined using the ProtParam server (28Gasteiger E. Gattiker A. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (3429) Google Scholar). The protein was concentrated to ∼50 μm before storage at 4 °C. Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography—A Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (10 × 300 mm, GE Healthcare) was used to determine the apparent molecular weight of MBP-MEX-5-(236–350) and its mutants. The column was equilibrated on an AKTA FPLC with 2 column volumes of filtration buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1 prior to loading the protein sample. Approximately 50 μl of sample (17 μm) was loaded on to the column and eluted with 1.5 column volumes of filtration buffer. Retention time was determined in relation to standards (Bio-Rad). RNA Labeling Protocol—All of the RNA sequences used in this work were prepared by chemical synthesis and deprotected/lyophylized as the manufacturer directed (Dharmacon or Integrated DNA technologies). Lyophilized samples were resuspended in 300 μl of TE buffer, pH 8.0, and the concentration was measured by determining the absorbance at 260 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient based on the nucleotide content. Fluorescein 5-thiosemicarbazide (Invitrogen) was used to 3′-end label each RNA via the method of Reines and Cantor (29Reines S.A. Cantor C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1974; 1: 767-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A typical 50-μl reaction consisted of 0.5 nmol of RNA, 100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.1, and 5 nmol of NaIO4. After a 90-min incubation at room temperature, the sample was ethanol precipitated with 1 μl of RNase-free glycogen (Invitrogen 20 μg/μl), 5 m NaCl (1/20 the volume), and 2 volumes of 100% ice-cold ethanol. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.1, containing 1 mm fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide. This reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and unreacted label was removed using a Roche G-25 spin column. The labeling efficiency was determined by calculating the ratio of fluorescein absorbance at 490 nm to RNA-fluorescein absorbance at 260 nm. Typical efficiencies were 60–80%. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to measure the binding activity of recombinant MEX-5 and MEX-6 to fluorescein-labeled RNA oligonucleotides. Typical reactions consisted of 2–4 nm labeled RNA equilibrated with varying concentrations of protein in equilibration buffer for 3 h. Equilibration buffer is 0.01% IGEPAL CA630 (a mild detergent used to prevent adhesion of protein and RNA to tubes, microplates, and gel wells), 0.01 mg/ml tRNA (a polyanionic nonspecific binding inhibitor), 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 μm Zn(OAc)2, and 100 mm NaCl. The RNA was heated to 60 °C and allowed to cool to room temperature before use. Immediately prior to loading, one-fifth volume of 30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) bromcresol green was added to each reaction as a dye marker. A 40-μl sample of each reaction (100 μl total) was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel (EMD Biosciences, some lot to lot variability was observed) in 1× TB buffer. The gels were run for 40 min at 120 volts then immediately scanned using a fluor-imager (Fujifilm FLA-5000) with a blue laser at 473 nm. The fluorescence intensity of unbound RNA was determined as a function of protein concentration using ImageGauge software. The data were fit to a sigmoidal dose-response function (Equation 1) to determine the half-maximal saturation point (Kd,app),ϕ=b+(m-b)11+(Kd,appP)n(Eq.1) where ϕ is the fluorescence intensity, m is the maximal signal, b is the minimal signal, P is the protein concentration, and n is the apparent Hill coefficient. It is important to note that Kd,app is not equivalent to the thermodynamic equilibrium dissociation constant for RNA sequences that contain multiple overlapping binding sites. In all cases, the reported value is the average of at least three experiments and the reported error is the standard deviation. Competition assays were performed as above except a constant concentration of subsaturating recombinant MEX-5 was used in the equilibration, whereas varying concentrations of unlabeled competitor RNA were added to the reactions. The apparent dissociation constant of the competitor RNA was determined by a fit of the data to a quadratic solution of the Lin and Riggs equation (30Lin S.Y. Riggs A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 671-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 31Weeks K.M. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10281-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) as described (32Ryder S.P. Williamson J.R. RNA (N.Y.). 2004; 10: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Polarization Assays—Equilibration reactions (100 μl volume) were set up using the same conditions as the electrophoretic mobility shift experiments above in 96-well black plates (Greiner). The apparent fluorescence polarization was determined using a Victor 3 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with fluorescein-sensitive filters and polarizers. A total of five reads were measured for each experiment and the average and standard deviation of the millipolarization value (mP) were calculated for each protein concentration. The data were fit to Equation 1 (where ϕ represents polarization rather than intensity) to extract the apparent dissociation constant. The reported value is the average of at least three experiments and the error is the S.D. Stoichiometric binding experiments were performed as above except the reactions were supplemented with unlabeled RNA to a final concentration of 1.5 μm. The elevated concentration of RNA enables determination of the apparent stoichiometry by measuring the equivalent saturation point. This value was estimated by plotting polarization as a function of molar equivalents of protein to RNA and performing linear fits to pre- and post-saturation data. The equivalence point was determined by the intersection point of the two lines, and separately by a fit of the data to the quadratic equation as described (33Rambo R.P. Doudna J.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6486-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). UTR Sequence Analysis—C. elegans 3′-UTRs were retrieved from Wormbase release WS165. To determine the frequency of each possible octamer sequence in 3′-UTR-space, a Ruby script was written to enumerate each possible octamer and send it to the pattern searching tool PATSCAN (34Dsouza M. Larsen N. Overbeek R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 497-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The PATSCAN output files were analyzed using standard UNIX text processing tools. The total number of occurrences of each class of A-, C-, G-, or U-containing octamers was determined by summing up the number of occurrences of each octamer in that class. The theoretical distribution of each class was determined by a binomial distribution weighted by the fractional proportion of each base in all C. elegans 3′-UTRs. RNAi—C. elegans strains expressing GFP-MEX-5 (JH1448) or GFP-PIE-1 (JH1327) were obtained from the Caenorhabidits Genetics Center and cultured by propagating animals with the roller phenotype. Embryos were harvested from young adult hermaphrodites grown on OP50 food by bleach treatment and then deposited on NGM plates seeded with OP50 or NGM-isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside plates seeded with mex-3 RNAi food (generously provided by Dr. Craig Mello) and cultured as described (35Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos were collected from gravid adult hermaphrodites by dissecting the worms in M9 on a 4% agarose pad with a fine gauge needle. DIC and GFP images were collected with live specimens using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope with ×40 or 100 objectives. MEX-5 and MEX-6 Bind to ARE Repeat Elements—To clarify the role of MEX-5 and MEX-6 in development, we set out to test whether these proteins, like TTP, bind with high affinity and specificity to RNA. A recombinant fragment of each protein comprising the TZF domain was purified from bacteria and tested for the ability to interact with an established TTP binding sequence, the AU-rich element (ARE) of TNF-α mRNA (26Brewer B.Y. Malicka J. Blackshear P.J. Wilson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27870-27877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Two approaches were employed to measure affinity to this RNA: electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and fluorescence polarization (FP) assays. Both methods reveal that MEX-5 and MEX-6 bind to TNF-ARE RNA. The EMSA experiments show that multiple binding sites are present in this sequence. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd,app) of MEX-5 for TNF-ARE RNA is 17 ± 1 nm by EMSA and 14 ± 4 nm by FP (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 1). Similarly, MEX-6 binds to this RNA with an affinity of 4 ± 3 nm by EMSA and 12 ± 3 nm by FP (Fig. 2a). Both proteins are capable of binding to RNA with high affinity. Furthermore, because the EMSA and FP results are nearly equivalent, it is clear that both assays can effectively monitor RNA binding by these proteins.TABLE 1Analysis of MEX-5-TZF binding to RNARNA IDSequenceGene/3′-UTR positionEMSA Kd,appFP Kd,appnmTNF-AREGUGAUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAGTNF-α, 459–47017 ± 114 ± 4ARE13AUUUAUUUAUUUANAaNA, not applicable55 ± 1597 ± 4TCR1UUGUUUUUUCUCCUUUUCUUUAUAACUUGUglp-1, 242–27229 ± 325 ± 7TCR2UUUCUUUAUAACUUGUUACAAUUUUUGAAAglp-1, 256–28537 ± 1831 ± 9TCR3UUACAAUUUUUGAAAUUCCCUUUUUUGACAglp-1, 270–30066 ± 2252 ± 12TCR4UUCCCUUUUUUGACAGGCUUUUAUUACACUGUAAglp-1, 286–31946 ± 1562 ± 11SubACAAUACUUUUUUAUAUCGGGUCCAACCCGUUUAnos-2, 15–4767 ± 1294 ± 2SubBUACAAGCUUUCACAAACAGAUAGUUUAUnos-2, 53–80>1000400 ± 50SubCCCCGUUCAUAGCCUUUAUUGAUUCCAAAUUUnos-2, 88–11868 ± 1178 ± 13SubDCCCAUCUCACACUUUUCUACGGUAUnos-2, 119–143400 ± 60200 ± 20SubEACCAUUUACUUUUUCUGCUAAUAAUCAAUUAUUAAUAnos-2, 144–18062 ± 1270 ± 12TCR2 U-AAAACAAAAACAAGAAACAAAAAAAGAAANA>1000>1000U30UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNA29 ± 623 ± 2U15UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNA150 ± 4140 ± 4C15CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCNA>1000>1000A15GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGNA>1000>1000G15AAAAAAAAAAAAAAANA>1000>1000a NA, not applicable Open table in a new tab TNF-ARE RNA contains several UUAUUUAUU repeat sequences and therefore can bind multiple molecules of TTP (26Brewer B.Y. Malicka J. Blackshear P.J. Wilson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27870-27877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine the affinity of MEX-5 for a shorter RNA variant containing only one TTP site, we repeated the binding analyses with ARE13 RNA (AUUUAUUUAUUUA). The apparent dissociation constant for this sequence is 55 ± 15 nm by EMSA and 97 ± 4 nm by FP (Fig. 2). In contrast, TTP binds to ARE13 RNA with 5–10-fold tighter affinity (26Brewer B.Y. Malicka J. Blackshear P.J. Wilson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27870-27877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Together, the results show that MEX-5 binds to UUAUUUAUU repeat sequences, but with an overall affinity that is weaker than TTP. MEX-5 Binds to Regulatory Elements in glp-1 and nos-2 3′-UTRs—Prior work demonstrates that several factors are aberrantly expressed in mex-5 mutants (14Schubert C.M. Lin R. de Vries C.J. Plasterk R.H. Priess J.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of five proteins (SKN-1, PIE-1, MEX-1, POS-1, and PAL-1) and reduced levels of two others (GLP-1 and MEX-3) result from mex-5 mutation. Furthermore, MEX-5 is required to activate zif-1, which in turn targets TZF proteins for degradation (16DeRenzo C. Reese K.J. Seydoux G. Nature. 2003; 424: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Last, recent studies reveal that MEX-5 is required for anterior degradation of mex-1, nos-2, and pos-1 transcripts (21D'Agostino I. Merritt C. Chen P.L. Seydoux G. Subramaniam K. Dev. Biol. 2006; 292: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Tenlen J.R. Schisa J.A. Diede S.J. Page B.D. Genetics. 2006; 174: 1933-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although the results are consistent with MEX-5 regulating a network of maternal genes, this regulation has not been shown to be a direct result of MEX-5 binding to target mRNAs. Extended UAUU sequence repeats similar to the TNF-ARE are not present in the 3′-UTR of any candidate MEX-5 regulatory target. However, several functional regulatory elements have been identified in the 3′-UTR of glp-1 and nos-2 mRNAs (Fig. 3, A and B). Two translational control elements are present in the 3′-UTR of glp-1 mRNA, a spatial control region, and a temporal control region (TCR) (37Evans T.C. Crittenden S.L. Kodoyianni V. Kimble J. Cell. 1994; 77: 183-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Furthermore, five elements (subA–E) found in the 3′-UTR of nos-2 mRNA coordinate translational silencing, mRNA localization, and 3′-end formation (21D'Agostino I. Merritt C. Chen P.L. Seydoux G. Subramaniam K. Dev. Biol. 2006; 292: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine whether MEX-5 binds these functional elements, we performed EMSA and FP experiments with 30 overlapping nucleotide fragments of the TCR and all five elements from the nos-2 3′-UTR (Fig. 3, Table 1). Surprisingly, MEX-5 binds with high affinity to all of the TCR fragments and three of the elements from nos-2 mRNA (TCR1–4, subA, subC, and subE, Kd,app ∼ 25–100 nm). MEX-5 binds moderately to nos-2 subD (Kd,app = 200 ± 20 nm) and poorly to nos-2 subB (Kd,app 400 ± 50 nm by FP, >1 μm by EMSA). Because a single shifted species is observed with TCR2 RNA, we decided to investigate the stoichiometry of the complex by repeating the FP experiments with elevated TCR2 RNA concentration (Fig. 3, c and d). The apparent stoichiometry is approximately 1 to 1 (equivalence point N is 0.9 ± 1 by a quadratic fit), demonstrating that there is only one binding site in this RNA and that the recombinant protein is nearly 100% active (Fig. 3d). Consistent with these results, analytical gel filtration chromatography reveals that the TZF domain is predominantly monomeric at concentrations well above the apparent dissociation constant for this RNA sequence (17 μm, Kd,app = 31 ± 9 nm, Fig. 3d). Inspection of the RNA fragments reveals that all of the interacting sequences contain a tract of 6–8 uridines within an 8-nucleotide window. This feature is absent in nos-2 subB, suggesting that MEX-5 requires this element to bind. To test this model, a mutant version of the second TCR fragment where all of the uridines are replaced by adenosine was prepared. As expected, this sequence does not bind to MEX-5 (Table 1). The results show that MEX-5 does not require UAUU repeats to bind to RNA with high affinity, and suggest that MEX-5 can bind to sequences harboring an extended uridine tract. MEX-5 Binds to Polyuridine—TTP displays an 80-fold preference for UAUU repeat sequences over polyuridine (26Brewer B.Y. Malicka J. Blackshear P.J. Wilson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27870-27877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data show that MEX-5 binds with high affinity to uridine-rich RNAs lacking canonical ARE motifs. To test whether uridine nucleotides are sufficient to promote MEX-5 binding, EMSA and FP experiments were performed with a 30-nucleotide polyuridine sequence. MEX-5 binds to this RNA with an apparent Kd of 29 ± 6 nm by EMSA and 23 ± 2 nm by FP (Fig. 4A). The"
https://openalex.org/W2086127889,"β-Catenin is a biologically important molecule playing critical roles in both cell adhesion and transcriptional regulation in the Wnt pathway. Here, we show that phospho-β-catenin (phosphorylated at Ser33/37/Thr41), which is reported to be degraded immediately after its phosphorylation, accumulated in the centrosome. Whereas phospho-mimicking mutant, S33/37/T41E-β-catenin, could localize to the centrosome, S33A-β-catenin that lacks the phosphorylation site lost its localization to the centrosome. Phospho-β-catenin localized mainly to mother centrosome during the interphase and was recruited to daughter centrosome in M-phase. Depletion of β-catenin with small interfering RNA or inhibition of its phosphorylation by LiCl treatment caused disruption of radial microtubule (MT) array and retardation of the MT regrowth during the recovery from nocodazole treatment. In addition, these treatments increased the frequency of mono-astral MT reorganization. Furthermore, overexpression of the nonphosphorylatable β-catenin, but not the phospho-mimicking β-catenin, markedly disrupted radial MT array and repressed the MT regrowth. In contrast, phospho-mimicking β-catenin localized to both of the duplicated centrosomes with aberrant larger and denser radial MTs array formation. In addition, some of the cells overexpressing phospho-mimicking β-catenin had multiple centrosomes. Taken together, this study demonstrates a novel role of phospho-β-catenin in MT organization at the centrosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2121859145,"Tenascin C (Tnc) is an alternatively spliced, multimodular extracellular matrix glycoprotein present in the ventricular zone of the developing brain. Pax6-deficient small eye (sey) mouse mutants show an altered Tnc expression pattern. Here, we investigated the expression of Tnc isoforms in neural stem/progenitor cells and their regulation by the paired-box transcription factor Pax6. Neural stem/progenitor cells cultured as neurospheres strongly expressed Tnc on the protein level. The Tnc isoform expression in neural stem/progenitor cells was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and dot blot Southern hybridization. In total, 20 different Tnc isoforms were detected in neurospheres derived from embryonic fore-brain cell suspensions. The Tnc isoform containing the fibronectin type III domains A1A4BD is novel and might be neural stem/progenitor cell-specific. Transient overexpression of Pax6 in neurospheres of the medial ganglionic eminence did not alter the total Tnc mRNA expression level but showed a pronounced regulative effect on different Tnc isoforms. The larger Tnc isoforms containing four, five, and six additional alternatively spliced fibronectin type III domains were up-regulated, whereas the small Tnc isoforms without any or with one additional domain were down-regulated. Thus, Pax6 is a homeodomain protein that also modulates the splicing machinery. We conclude that the combinatorial code of Tnc isoform expression in the neural stem/progenitor cell is complex and regulated by Pax6. These findings suggest a functional significance for individual Tnc isoforms in neural stem/progenitor cells. Tenascin C (Tnc) is an alternatively spliced, multimodular extracellular matrix glycoprotein present in the ventricular zone of the developing brain. Pax6-deficient small eye (sey) mouse mutants show an altered Tnc expression pattern. Here, we investigated the expression of Tnc isoforms in neural stem/progenitor cells and their regulation by the paired-box transcription factor Pax6. Neural stem/progenitor cells cultured as neurospheres strongly expressed Tnc on the protein level. The Tnc isoform expression in neural stem/progenitor cells was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and dot blot Southern hybridization. In total, 20 different Tnc isoforms were detected in neurospheres derived from embryonic fore-brain cell suspensions.

Faissner A. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the literature one does find many different abbreviations for Tenascin C (e.g. TN-C, TN, Ten, Hxb, and TNC). Therefore, we have decided to use the official gene symbol Tnc (2Wain H.M. Lush M. Ducluzeau F. Povey S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as abbreviation for Tenascin C and will according to international standards use Tnc for the mouse protein, TNC for the human protein, and the italicized versions Tnc and TNC for the murine and human gene/mRNA, respectively. Structurally, Tnc consists of several serially arranged protein domains. At the amino terminus it has a cysteine-rich region where six Tnc molecules assemble to the so called hexabrachion (1Joester A. Faissner A. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the mouse, 14.5 EGF-like repeats and in the smallest variant eight constitutive fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains follow. The carboxyl-terminal domain is a fibrinogen-like globe. Tnc is encoded by a single gene, which encodes for several alternatively spliced exons (1Joester A. Faissner A. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The complexity of murine Tnc is dramatically increased by the use of up to six alternatively spliced FnIII domains named A1, A2, A4, B, C, and D, which can be independently inserted between the 5th and 6th constitutive FnIII domain and leads to a large variety of Tnc isoforms (3Joester A. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17144-17151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Theoretically, up to 64 different Tnc isoforms could be generated and 27 of them have been detected during embryonic and early postnatal mouse CNS development (3Joester A. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17144-17151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the cell types responsible for the generation of this Tnc isoform complexity in vivo have not been elucidated. In culture, oligodendrocytes have been shown to preferentially express larger Tnc isoforms, whereas astrocytes are biased toward smaller Tnc isoforms (4Garwood J. Garcion E. Dobbertin A. Heck N. Calco V. ffrench-Constant C. Faissner A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 2524-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, a large complexity of Tnc isoforms exists already before astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are generated during CNS development. Functionally, the alternatively spliced region of Tnc harbors at least two active domains, which stimulate neurite outgrowth of central neurons. The activity of the FnIIID domain alone was reported to depend on interaction with the α7β1 integrin receptor (5Mercado M.L. Nur-e-Kamal A. Liu H.Y. Gross S.R. Movahed R. Meiners S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas the activity of FnIIIBD selectively required interaction with the cell adhesion molecule F3/contactin (6Rigato F. Garwood J. Calco V. Heck N. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6596-6609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tnc is prominently expressed during forebrain development (7Gotz M. Bolz J. Joester A. Faissner A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Yuasa S. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2001; 64: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in the ventricular and subventricular zone (9Gates M.A. Thomas L.B. Howard E.M. Laywell E.D. Sajin B. Faissner A. Gotz B. Silver J. Steindler D.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 361: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Garcion E. Faissner A. ffrench-Constant C. Development. 2001; 128: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where neural stem cells reside (11Temple S. Nature. 2001; 414: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Early on, Tnc is expressed by radial glia cells (12Bartsch S. Bartsch U. Dorries U. Faissner A. Weller A. Ekblom P. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 736-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gotz M. Huttner W.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar) and functions as a modulator of growth factor responsiveness controlling the transition from early to late neural stem cells (14Garcion E. Halilagic A. Faissner A. ffrench-Constant C. Development. 2004; 131: 3423-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tnc is required for normal neural progenitor proliferation as well as for proper differentiation of neurons and oligodendrocytes (10Garcion E. Faissner A. ffrench-Constant C. Development. 2001; 128: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Garcion E. Halilagic A. Faissner A. ffrench-Constant C. Development. 2004; 131: 3423-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). At later developmental stages Tnc expression is largely confined to astrocytes (8Yuasa S. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2001; 64: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) before it becomes down-regulated in the CNS, with the exception of the adult neurogenic stem cell niche (9Gates M.A. Thomas L.B. Howard E.M. Laywell E.D. Sajin B. Faissner A. Gotz B. Silver J. Steindler D.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 361: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The regulation of Tnc expression by growth factors and cytokines has been extensively studied in various cell lines (15Jones P.L. Jones F.S. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and also to some extent in primary glial cultures (4Garwood J. Garcion E. Dobbertin A. Heck N. Calco V. ffrench-Constant C. Faissner A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 2524-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, it has not been investigated whether individual Tnc isoforms are differentially regulated. Furthermore, the relevance of the individual growth factors and cytokines for the expression of Tnc in vivo remains unclear so far. On the other hand, studies of the promoter region of Tnc revealed that transcription factors Evx-1, Brn-2, and Otx2 interact with defined response elements and were shown to regulate Tnc expression (16Jones F.S. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2091-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Copertino D.W. Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1846-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Gherzi R. Briata P. Boncinelli E. Ponassi M. Querze G. Viti F. Corte G. Zardi L. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Nguyen Ba-Charvet K.T. von Boxberg Y. Guazzi S. Boncinelli E. Godement P. Development. 1998; 125: 4273-4282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Again, it has not been investigated if Tnc isoforms are differentially regulated or, if these transcription factors control the expression of Tnc in vivo. The best evidence for regulation of Tnc has been obtained with the paired-box transcription factor Pax6 that, comparable with Tnc, is expressed by radial glia cells in the ventricular zone of the developing cortex (20Gotz M. Stoykova A. Gruss P. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1031-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), becomes down-regulated postnatally, and is maintained in the adult neurogenic stem cell niche (21Hack M.A. Saghatelyan A. de Chevigny A. Pfeifer A. Ashery-Padan R. Lledo P.M. Gotz M. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In the natural Pax6 mouse mutant small eye (sey) Tnc expression is selectively lost in the cortical ventricular zone and reduced in the ventricular zone of the ganglionic eminence during early forebrain development, whereas Tnc expression in cortical astrocytes at later developmental stages appears normal (20Gotz M. Stoykova A. Gruss P. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1031-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Apparently, the expression of Tnc in neurogenic radial glia depends on Pax6, but how Pax6 regulates Tnc expression has not been studied. Here, we investigated the expression of Tnc isoforms in free-floating neurospheres that serve as a widespread model for neural stem/progenitor cells in vitro (22Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). We found that 20 different Tnc isoforms are present in neurospheres. Transient overexpression of Pax6 resulted in a shift from smaller to larger Tnc isoforms, without changing overall Tnc mRNA expression levels. Thus, Pax6 acts as a modulator of alternative splicing and differentially regulates the expression of the various Tnc isoforms in neural precursors implicating that functional differences are encoded in the alternatively spliced Tnc isoforms. Tissue Culture—Neurosphere cultures were performed as described previously (14Garcion E. Halilagic A. Faissner A. ffrench-Constant C. Development. 2004; 131: 3423-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Briefly, timed pregnancy NMRI mice were sacrificed and staged according to Theiler's criteria (23Bard J.L. Kaufman M.H. Dubreuil C. Brune R.M. Burger A. Baldock R.A. Davidson D.R. Mech. Dev. 1998; 74: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). E13 (Theiler stage 21) animals were used for the dissection of the cortex, the lateral ganglionic eminence, and medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). The tissue was digested using 30 units/ml papain (Worthington) in minimal essential medium (Sigma) for 20 min followed by mechanical trituration. The single cell suspension was cultured in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C, 6.0% CO2 with 105 cells/ml in neurosphere medium (DMEM/F-12, 1:1 (Sigma), 200 μg/ml l-glutamine, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, 2% (v/v) B27, (all Invitrogen)) containing 20 ng/ml EGF (Preprotech), 20 ng/ml bFGF (Preprotech), and 0.5 units/ml heparin (Sigma). The obtained neurospheres were passaged and expanded once a week by a 5-min digestion with 0.1% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) followed by trituration. The single cell suspension was replated as described above. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were prepared from the E13 trunk as described previously (24Gotz R. Wiese S. Takayama S. Camarero G.C. Rossoll W. Schweizer U. Troppmair J. Jablonka S. Holtmann B. Reed J.C. Rapp U.R. Sendtner M. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and grown in DMEM, 10% FCS supplemented with 1% penicillin/strepomycin. The astrocytic cell line A7 was grown and maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin as described previously (25Fidler P.S. Schuette K. Asher R.A. Dobbertin A. Thornton S.R. Calle-Patino Y. Muir E. Levine J.M. Geller H.M. Rogers J.H. Faissner A. Fawcett J.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8778-8788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection—Neurospheres of the third passage were incubated in 300 μl of PBS for 20 min and then mechanically triturated using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Using the mouse neural stem cell nucleofector kit and the nucleofector device according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa) 3-5 × 106 cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of pKW10-mPax6 (26Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and 10 μg of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The cells were resuspended in neurosphere medium, which was changed after 24 h and again after 3 days. Neurospheres showing EGFP fluorescence after 6 days were used for RNA isolation (RNeasy mini kit, Qiagen). MEF cultures and the A7 cell line were transfected using the Rotifect kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roth, Germany). Briefly, 20 μl of transfection solution was mixed with 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA and incubated for 20 min at room temperature before addition to 70-90% confluent cultures for 4.5 h in DMEM. After washing, the medium was replaced by DMEM, 5% FCS for 24 h. The transfected cultures where then kept in DMEM, 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin until confluent cultures were harvested for RNA isolation as described above for neurosphere cultures. RT-PCR Analysis—1 μg of total RNA obtained from defined CNS areas of E13.5 sey mice, their wild type littermates, or from the cell cultures detailed above, was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers (first strand cDNA synthesis kit, Fermentas). 1 μl of these cDNAs was used in a 25-μl PCR reaction containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 nmol of each dNTP, 1.25 units of Taq polymerase, and 5 pmol of the appropriate forward and reverse primers. The following oligonucleotide primer pairs were used at the indicated annealing temperatures: Tenascin C (Tnc), 5′-GCTCTAGAGGACTCCTGTACCCATTCC-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCCCAGATTTCGGAAGTTGCT-3′ at 59 °C; Tnc isoforms, 5s, 5′-CGGGATCCGAAATTGATGCACCCAAGGAC-3′, 6as, 5′-CGGAATTCTATGTGATTAGAGTCCCCGAGA-3′ at 57 °C; 5f, 5′-CGCTCGAGCACGTGTGAAGGCATCCACG-3′; 6r, 5′-CGCAAGCTTTATCCTTCGGAGAACCCATGGC-3′ at 59 °C (3Joester A. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17144-17151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); paired box gene 6 (Pax6), 5′-CGGCAGAAGATCGTAGAG-3′, 5′-TCTCGGATTTCCCAAGCAAAGATG-3′ at 56 °C; Integrin α7 (Itga7), 5′-CGTCCGAGCCAACATCACAG-3′, 5′-CCTCTGGATGGTGCCTGTCT-3′ at 60 °C; Integrin β1 (Itgb1), 5′-AAACCTGTGTGCCATTGTGA-3′, 5′-GCACTGTGGGTGAATTGTTG-3′ at 60 °C; F3/contactin (Cntn1), 5′-CCACAGAGGTAGGGGTCAAA-3′, 5′-CATTGGATAGTGCCACAACG-3′ at 60 °C; DSD-1-Proteoglycan/Phosphacan (Ptprz1), 5′-TATGCTACCCCAGAAGCACA-3′, 5′-TCTGCTGGTGGACCAGAATT-3′ at 55 °C; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), 5′-ACTCCACTCACGGCAAATTC-3′, 5′-CCTTCCACAATGCCAAAGTT-3′ at 60 °C; and β-actin (Actb) 5′-TATGCCAACACAGTGCTGTCTGGTGG-3′, 5′-AGAAGCACTTGCGGTGCACGATGG-3′ at 60 °C (27von Holst A. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Michaille J.J. Dhouailly D. Backstrom A. Ebendal T. Rohrer H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All reactions were carried out in a Mastercycler gradient (Eppendorf) starting with a 160-s denaturation step at 94 °C followed by 35-38 cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 30 s at the respective annealing temperature and 30 s elongation at 72 °C. The reaction was followed by a 5-min final elongation step at 72 °C and cooled down to 4 °C. The PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and the bands cut out of the gel and extracted using the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The isolated PCR products were ligated into the vector pCRII-TOPO (TOPO-TA cloning kit, Invitrogen) using the A overhangs that were produced by the Taq polymerase during the PCR. The resulting transformants were checked for Tnc fragments of the expected size by direct lysis of the bacteria with 25 μl of 70% ethanol and PCRed using primers flanking the alternatively spliced region of Tnc. Dot Blot Hybridization Analysis—The positively identified clones were cultured and their plasmids isolated (Qiaprep Spin Miniprep Kit, Qiagen) and dot blotted onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). For this procedure the membrane was prewetted in 10× SSC and up to 50 ng of target sequence in a volume of up to 6 μl was spotted onto the membrane. The loaded DNA was denatured in 500 mm NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl and renatured in 500 mm Tris/HCl, 1.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5. The membranes were baked for 2 h at 80 °C for covalent binding of the DNA. Seven equivalent blots were produced with the same pattern of plasmids. The membrane-bound DNA was hybridized overnight at 72 °C with probes that are specific for the different alternatively spliced FnIII domains of Tnc. The probes were the same as in Ref. 3Joester A. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17144-17151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar. A probe against FnIII domain 6 was used as a negative control because the PCR-amplified fragments should not contain this part of the Tnc molecule. For detection the membranes were blocked in 100 mm Tris/HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) liquid block (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with an alkaline phosphate-coupled anti-fluorescein antibody (1:200 in block buffer, Roche). After washing three times with 100 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4, for 5 min each; twice with 100 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 9.5, for 5 min; and three times with 50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, for 10 min each the detection was carried out with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche). After 5-60 min the reaction was stopped with water. The signals obtained with the specific probes revealed the FnIII domain composition of single bacterial clones. When the composition of the FnIII domains was ambiguous after dot blot hybridization the plasmids were tested via PCR using domain-specific primers. The FnIII domains are highly homologous and, thus, a stringent two-step PCR protocol was applied. Using 10-20 pg of plasmid DNA and the same concentrations of ingredients as outlined above cycling was performed starting with a 160-s denaturation step followed by 33 cycles of 30 s denaturation and annealing and elongation at 72 °C together for 40 s. As positive and negative controls six plasmids were used that contain the single alternatively spliced FnIII domains. Some cloned Tnc isoforms containing plasmids were sequenced to verify the combination of FnIII domains. Immunohistochemistry—For fixation, neurospheres were spun down and resuspended in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde. After 20 min paraformaldehyde was replaced with 15% sucrose for cryoprotection at 4 °C overnight. The neurospheres were transferred to 30% sucrose overnight, embedded in TissueTek (Jung), and stored at -70 °C. Cryosections of 12 μm thickness were prepared using a conventional cryostat (Leica), mounted, and air-dried. After rehydration in PBS (1.7% NaCl) with 10% horse serum for 1 h at room temperature the neurosphere sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with undiluted anti-Pax6 mouse hybridoma supernatant (Developmental Hybridoma Bank) or affinity purified rabbit anti-Tenascin C antibodies (KAF 14) diluted 1:300 in PBS, 0.1% BSA (6Rigato F. Garwood J. Calco V. Heck N. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6596-6609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After three 5-min wash steps with PBS the sections were incubated with a CY3-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:500 in PBS, 0.1% BSA) or a CY2-labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:300 in PBS, 0.1% BSA) for 2 h at room temperature (Dianova). During incubation with the secondary antibody, cell nuclei were labeled with bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258, diluted 1 × 105, Sigma). After three further washes in PBS the sections were embedded in Immumount (Thermo Science) and examined at a fluorescent microscope (Axioplan2, Zeiss). Immunocytochemistry—Electroporated neurosphere-derived cells were plated 1 day after transfection on PORN-coated (10 μg/ml for 1 h at 37°C) dishes for 3 h. These cultures were washed once in PBS and then fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. After permeabilization in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA the cells were immunostained using BLBP (1:1000, Chemicon), GLAST (1:1000, Chemicon), RC2 hybridoma supernatant (1:10, Developmental Hybridoma Bank), Pax6 (undiluted hybridoma supernatant), and GFAP (1:300, DAKO, Denmark). For detection of the 473HD epitope, the cells were live stained with 473HD antibody (1:200) for 20 min at room temperature before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (28von Holst A. Sirko S. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4082-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were detected using the appropriate secondary antibodies from Dianova as outlined above. During incubation with the secondary antibody, cell nuclei were labeled with bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258, diluted 1 × 105, Sigma). After three further washes in PBS the sections were embedded in Immumount (Thermo Science) and examined at a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). For quantification a total of 600-1200 Pax6-positive cells were counted for every marker under each condition in three independent experiments and expressed as mean ± S.D. Western Blot—Protein lysates of E13.5 forebrain tissue or neurospheres that were grown from cortical or striatal cell suspensions of E13.5 telencephalon in the presence of 20 ng/ml EGF or bFGF for 6 days, were obtained as described previously (29von Holst A. Lefcort F. Rohrer H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After determination of the protein content (DC Protein Microassay, Bio-Rad) 10 μg of total protein were loaded per lane onto an 4-12% NuPAGE/BisTris gel (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed at 100 V in MOPS running buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After semi-dry Western blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocking with 5% (w/v) milk powder, the blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the KAF14 antibody (1:5000). Detection was performed by the standard ECL method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) after incubation with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:5000, Dianova) for 2 h at ambient temperature. Tenascin C is a multimodular extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is expressed in neural progenitor cells during early CNS development. Under defined, serum-free conditions neural stem/progenitor cells can be cultivated in the presence of the growth factors EGF or bFGF, which leads to the formation of free-floating cellular aggregates called neurospheres (22Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). We suspected Tnc expression in neurospheres because its mRNA has been detected previously in gene array approaches (30Ramalho-Santos M. Yoon S. Matsuzaki Y. Mulligan R.C. Melton D.A. Science. 2002; 298: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar, 31D'Amour K.A. Gage F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11866-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Indeed, cortical and striatal neurospheres derived from E13.5 single cell suspensions and grown for 6 days in the presence of EGF and bFGF strongly express Tnc on the protein level (Fig. 1). The Western blot analysis revealed that Tnc expression levels are stronger when the neurospheres were grown in bFGF compared with EGF (Fig. 1C). As more than one major Tnc band could be revealed the data indicated the presence of several Tnc isoforms or differentially glycosylated forms of Tnc. This pattern of Tnc expression appeared comparable with the one observed in Western blots of E13.5 forebrain tissues (Fig. 1C). To reveal Tnc isoform expression in neural stem cells, we performed RT-PCR analysis using primers 5s and 6as located at the beginning of the 5th and the end of the 6th constitutive FnIII domain, respectively (Fig. 2A). This strategy leads to the detection of up to seven amplicons in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels corresponding to Tnc isoforms without alternatively spliced FnIII cassettes and Tnc isoforms containing one to six additionally inserted FnIII domains (Fig. 2B). This amplification pattern for Tnc isoforms was confirmed using primers 5f and 6r, which are located at the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 6th constitutive FnIII domain, respectively, and are directly flanking the alternatively spliced region of Tnc (Fig. 2A). This led to the detection of six amplicons representing one to six additional FnIII domains (Fig. 2C). However, with the exception of the Tnc isoform containing all six alternatively spliced FnIII domains this pattern does not resolve which combinatorial code of alternatively spliced FnIII domains are represented in individual Tnc isoforms.FIGURE 2Regulation of Tnc isoform expression by Pax6. A, the schematic representation of Tnc and the localization of the primers used in this study for the amplification of the Tnc isoforms are shown. Tnc is a multimodular protein with a cysteine-rich Tnc assembly domain, 14.5 EGF-like domains, several fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains, and a fibrinogen-like domain. In the shortest variant there are eight constitutive FnIII domains. Up to six additional domains can be inserted between the fifth and sixth domain by alternative splicing. The primer pair 5s, 6as binds to the 5′ end of FnIII domain 5 and the 3′ end of FnIII domain 6 so that the smallest amplicon contains only the constitutive FnIII domains 5 and 6. Every additional domain increased the amplicon size by 273 bp (data shown in B). The primers 5f and 6r bind to the 3′ end of FnIII domain 5 and the 5′ end of FnIII domain 6, respectively. The smallest amplicon therefore contained one of the alternatively spliced domains. Every additional domain increased the amplicon size by 273 bp (data shown in C). B and C, ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels revealing the Tnc isoform pattern in Pax6 overexpressing neurospheres and in non-transfected controls analyzed by RT-PCR are shown using the above primers as indicated. Note that upon Pax6 overexpression in neurospheres the large Tnc isoforms containing four, five, and six alternatively spliced FnIII domains are up-regulated, whereas the small Tnc isoforms without or with one additional domain are down-regulated compared with the non-transfected controls.

This ubiquitin-dependent sorting requires the coordinated function of a number of molecules that are conserved from yeast to mammals and collectively referred to as class E Vps proteins, themselves being either components or associated proteins of the four known ESCRT complexes (ESCRT-0, ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and ESCRT-III) (reviewed in Ref. 3Babst M.

Of the 17 deubiquitinating enzymes present in yeast, Doa4 is the only one that is functionally linked to the MVB pathway as its deletion leads to accumulation of several membrane proteins on the limiting membrane of MVB (9Reggiori F.

Two of the verified deubiquitinating enzymes, associated molecule of SH3 domain of STAM (AMSH) and ubiquitin-specific protease Y (UBPY), appear to function in the mammalian MVB pathway. Despite their distinct catalytic domains (14Naviglio S. Mattecucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G.F.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), AMSH and UBPY share several characteristic features. Both proteins bind to the SH3 domain of STAM, a component of ESCRT-0 (16Kato M. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol.

Cell. 2005; 16: 5163-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Whether these enzymes have critical functions in the MVB pathway remains to be established as knocking down AMSH using siRNA results in moderate enhancement, rather than inhibition, of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation (15McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbe S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 19Bowers K. Piper S.C. Edeling M.A. Gray S.R. Owen D.J. Lehner P.J. Luzio J.P. J. Biol.

In contrast, knocking down UBPY using siRNA leads to inhibition of EGFR degradation as well as decreased levels of Hrs and STAM, which had been shown to be crucial for EGFR down-regulation (19Bowers K.

In the course of a search for molecular partners of the ESCRT-III component CHMP3, the human homologue of yeast Vps24, we found evidence for a strong interaction with AMSH. We determined that the N-terminal portion of AMSH, which does not include the STAM-binding sequence, was necessary for its interaction with CHMP3. Removal of this region or the STAM-binding sequence did not affect the endosomal localization of AMSH. Furthermore, expression of a dominant-negative version of CHMP3, which was not targeted to endosomes and did not affect the endosomal localization of the other ESCRT-III components but was still capable of interacting with AMSH, prevented AMSH from targeting to endosomes; under these conditions, the degradation of activated EGFR was strongly inhibited, although its internalization was normal. As a complementary approach to confirm the role of AMSH on EGFR degradation, we used RNA interference to knock down AMSH and found that although endocytosis of activated EGFR remained normal, its degradation was also inhibited. From these observations, we conclude that AMSH is an important participant in MVB pathway degradation of EGFR and perhaps other ubiquitinated endocytosed proteins as well. Plasmids—Human CHMP3 (BC004419) and CHMP5 (B1914173) cDNAs were purchased from Resgen and Open Biosystems, respectively. They were sequenced and subcloned into the pOZ-N vector (a gift from Dr. Y. Shi, Harvard Medical School), which also encodes the human interleukin-2 receptor. Human AMSH (BC007682) cDNA was purchased from Open Biosystems, sequenced, and subcloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) to create EGFP-AMSH. All deletion mutants of EGFP-AMSH were generated by PCR mutagenesis. The internal deletion of EGFP-AMSH (Δ235–239) was introduced by following the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis strategy (Stratagene). The pmRFP-C1 plasmid was constructed by replacing the EGFP fragment of pEGFP-C1 with two tandem copies of monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) sequence (21Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Various fragments of CHMP3 were amplified by PCR and inserted into pGEX-4T or pmRFP-C1 vectors to generate GST or mRFP fusion proteins. FLAG-Vps4AE228Q and FLAG-CHMP4A were described previously (6Strack B. Calistri A. Craig S. Popova E. Gottlinger H.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 689-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Human CHMP2A (BC 002502), CHMP6 (BC 010108), and CHMP3 cDNAs were purchased from Open Biosystems and subcloned into the pBJ5 vector to create the FLAG-tagged CHMP2A, CHMP3 and CHMP6 constructs, respectively. Purification and Mass Spectrometry Analysis of CHMP-binding Proteins—Purification of CHMP3- or CHMP5-binding proteins was carried out as described previously with the following modifications (22Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 23Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). First, recombinant retroviruses carrying a bicistronic mRNA containing open reading frames of both interleukin-2 receptor and FLAG-HA-tagged human CHMP3 or CHMP5 were produced from 293T cells and were used to transduce HeLa cells. Next, the infected HeLa cells were sorted using magnetic beads conjugated with anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody, and the resulting stable cell lines were propagated in suspension. Cytosol was generated from 4 liters of cells by hypotonic lysis and ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. Finally, the CHMP3- or CHMP5-bound proteins were purified from the cytosol using anti-FLAG M2 and anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) sequentially, and bound proteins were fractionated on a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE as revealed by silver staining. The bands corresponding to the most prominent proteins and from similar regions of the gel but corresponding to the DJ-1 (control) sample were excised, digested with trypsin, and sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The tryptic peptides were separated by reverse-phase using a microcapillary C18 column (125 μm × 18 cm) and analyzed on-line with a hybrid linear ion trap-ion cyclotron resonance Fourier transform instrument (LTQ-FT, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Full MS2 scans were followed by 10 MS/MS spectra corresponding to the 10 most abundant ions. MS spectra were searched using Sequest algorithm, and peptide matches to the data base were filtered to ensure less than 1% false-positives hits. The sequences were AVTITDLR, AEELKAELLK, FQETGFFK, EYTEYNEEK, SLKPGALSNSESIPTIDGLR, NEFTITHVLIPK, MASIYSEEGNIEHAFILYNK, YITLFIEK, QQQLEQEQFHAFEMIR, and NMAIQQELEKEK for AMSH and TAQEHDKRDPVVAYYCR, LYAMQTGMKIDSK, MFLYADNEDR, LYAMQTGMK LMDQLEALKK, ATYIHNCLK LMDQLEALK, YAGSALQYEDVSTAVQNLQ, and QLGDNEAITQEIVGCAHLENYALK for Lip5, respectively. GST Pulldown—Cos7 cells (transfected with FuGENE 6) were used for the pull-down assays. Cells transiently expressing the various EGFP-AMSH proteins were lysed with TGH buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)). The soluble fractions were then mixed with lysates from Escherichia coli expressing various GST-CHMP3 proteins and captured with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) after a 3-h incubation at 4 °C. Beads were collected by low speed centrifugation (1,000 × g for 5 min) and washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline. Beads were boiled, and bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. 10% of total input and 100% of the captured AMSH proteins were revealed by Western blot analysis with anti-EGFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, B2) antibody. The amount of GST and GST-CHMP3 fusion proteins captured by the beads was verified by Coomassie Blue staining. Small Interfering RNA—HeLa cells were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) with either one of two different human AMSH-specific siRNA duplexes (sense 5′-UUACAAAUCUGCUGUCAUUUU-3′ (15McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbe S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) or sense 5′-GGUAGCACAACAGAAGCAGUU-3′ purchased from Dharmacon) 24 h after seeding at ∼30% confluency. The effects of AMSH depletion on EGFR internalization and degradation were followed 3 days after transfection with the single cell-based assay described below. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cos7 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde after 10–12 h, and processed for immunofluorescence staining (24Massol R.H. Larsen J.E. Fujinaga Y. Lencer W.I. Kirchhausen T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3631-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Antibodies were purchased from Sigma (anti-FLAG M2), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (anti-EEA1), and Genentech (anti-EGFR 13A9) or received as a gift from V. Horejsi (anti-CD63). Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Fluorescent images were obtained with a ×100 objective lens using a fluorescent Zeiss microscope configured with a spinning disk confocal head or with a ×40 objective lens using an upright fluorescent Zeiss microscope including a spherical aberration correction system under control of SlideBook 4 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc) for the degradation and internalization experiments. EGFR Degradation Assay—His6-tagged human EGF was expressed in E. coli and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. HeLa cells transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides or Cos7 cells transfected with plasmid constructs encoding for mRFP, mRFP-CHMP3-(151–220), and mRFP-CHMP3-(151–222) in a 12-well format were serum-starved for 2 h at 72 or 12 h after transfection. The cells were then incubated with 250 ng/ml EGF at 37 °C for 5 min or 2 h followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (room temperature) and immediate fixation. Cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline including 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with the EGFR antibody 13A9 (dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and 1% bovine serum albumin) followed by a goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-647 secondary antibody. The total fluorescence signal within each cell was quantified using Slidebook 4 by masking out the fluorescent signals corrected by the background. 50–60 cells were analyzed for each experimental condition. EGFR Internalization Assay—HeLa or Cos7 cells were transfected and starved as described for the EGFR degradation assay. The cells were then incubated with 50 μg/ml anti-EGFR antibody (13A9) at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of 250 ng/ml EGF (25Burke P. Schooler K. Wiley H.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1897-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with Alexa Fluor-594 goat anti-mouse antibody (25Burke P. Schooler K. Wiley H.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1897-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Image analysis was done following the same procedure used for the EGFR degradation assay. 30–40 cells were analyzed for each experimental condition. AMSH Specifically Interacts with CHMP3—We used a double epitope tag purification approach combined with mass spectrometry to identify proteins interacting with CHMP3 and CHMP5, the human homologues of yeast Vps24 and Vps60, respectively (26Ward D.M.

Both CHMP3 and CHMP5 proteins were tagged at their N termini with the FLAG and HA epitopes placed in tandem and stably expressed in HeLa cells. The cells were disrupted by hypotonic lysis followed by a low speed spin to remove the nuclear fraction. The analysis was performed on the high speed supernatant fraction corresponding to the cytosol since most of CHMP3 and CHMP5 are cytosolic (Fig. 1A). The most abundant proteins eluted from the FLAG/HA antibody-conjugated beads had SDS-PAGE mobilities corresponding to ∼32–35 kDa; these proteins were CHMP3 and CHMP5, as confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–6). CHMP3 co-purified with an ∼50 kDa protein, identified as human AMSH based on 10 matching peptide sequences (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). AMSH is a STAM-binding deubiquitinating enzyme (15McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbe S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 29Tanaka N. Kaneko K. Asao H. Kasai H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Takeshita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol.

CHMP5 co-purified with an ∼38 kDa protein, identified as human Lip5 from the sequence match of nine peptides (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). The interactions of CHMP5-Lip5 and of their yeast counterparts Vps60-Vta1 were reported recently and thus were not pursued further (26Ward D.M. Vaughn M.B. Shiflett S.L. White P.L. Pollock A.L.

As a negative control for specificity of this purification approach, we analyzed the eluate from cells stably expressing double-tagged cytosolic DJ-1 (reviewed in Ref. 32Pankratz N. Foroud T. NeuroRx. 2004; 1: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), an oncogene that links to Parkinson disease and modulates oxidative stress, and verified that AMSH and Lip5 specifically associate with CHMP3 and CHMP5, respectively (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). The interaction of epitope-tagged CHMP3 with endogenous AMSH was subsequently confirmed in a pull-down experiment using bacterially expressed GST-CHMP3 and cytosolic extracts from Cos7 cells transiently expressing EGFP-AMSH. As expected, EGFP-AMSH was detected only in association with GST-CHMP3 but not with GST alone (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–3 and 13–15). Thus, this assay allowed us to map the binding region for CHMP3 on AMSH using a series of deletion mutants of EGFP-AMSH (Fig. 1D). The N-terminal portion of AMSH-(1–239) bound CHMP3 as efficiently as the full-length AMSH-(1–424) (Fig. 1C, lanes 4–6). In contrast, smaller fragments (1–127 and 1–102) displayed weaker or undetectable associations (Fig. 1C, lanes 7–12). Truncations of the N-terminal portion of AMSH (102–424 and 127–424) failed to interact with GST-CHMP3, indicating that the first 127 residues of AMSH are essential for association with CHMP3 (Fig. 1C, lanes 19–24). Moreover, the interaction with STAM was dispensable for the AMSH-CHMP3 association as the deletion mutant Δ235–239 lacking the STAM-binding site (16Kato M. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37481-37487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) bound CHMP3 as efficiently as the full-length AMSH (Fig. 1C, lanes 16–18). The Simultaneous Interactions of AMSH with CHMP3 and STAM Are Not Essential for Its Endosomal Localization—We first confirmed that brief expression (10–12 h) in Cos7 cells of EGFP-AMSH resulted in the same distribution to endosomes, the plasma membrane, cytosol, and the nucleus (Fig. 2A), as shown previously in HeLa cells (15McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbe S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). EGFP-AMSH colocalized with early endosomes marked with EEA1, as reported previously (15McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbe S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), but not to late endosomes labeled with CD63 (Fig. 2A). We next examined the contribution of association with STAM and with CHMP3 to the endosomal localization of AMSH, judging by the extent of colocalization between various EGFP-AMSH mutants and EEA1 (Fig. 2B). The AMSH fragment lacking the residues required for STAM association (EGFP-AMSH Δ235–239) (17Kaneko T. Kumasaka T. Ganbe T. Sato T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Tanaka N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48162-48168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was targeted to early endosomes. Likewise, the AMSH fragment lacking the binding site for CHMP3 (EGFP-AMSH 127–424) was also recruited to EEA1-labeled endosomes. Taken together, these results confirmed that binding to STAM or to CHMP3 is not sufficient for the endosomal targeting of AMSH (33Nakamura M. Tanaka N. Kitamura N. Komada M. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CHMP3-(151–222) Disrupts the Endosomal Localization of AMSH—Having demonstrated that mutations in AMSH preventing its association with either STAM or CHMP3 were not sufficient to mislocalize AMSH from endosomes, we sought another approach to alter the endosomal targeting of AMSH by overexpressing a truncated cytosolic form of CHMP3 (CHMP3-(151–222)) that still interacts with AMSH. As a control, we used CHMP3-(151–220) that fails to interact with AMSH (34Zamborlini A. Usami Y. Radoshitzky S.R. Popova E. Palu G. Göttlinger H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We first compared the intracellular localization of EGFP-AMSH in Cos7 cells when co-expressed with CHMP3-(151–220) or CHMP3-(151–222) fused with two copies of mRFP (Fig. 3A). In the presence of overexpressed mRFP-CHMP3-(151–220), EGFP-AMSH retained a punctate endosomal pattern, partially localized to the EEA1 compartment, presumably due to recruitment by endogenous full-length CHMP3, STAM, and clathrin. In contrast, in the presence of overexpressed mRFP-CHMP3-(151–222), EGFP-AMSH lost its punctate pattern and became cytosolic. Expression of an ATPase-defective version of the mammalian Vps4A, Vps4E228Q, induces the formation of enlarged hybrid organelles called class E compartments in which various ESCRT proteins are accumulated as their recycling is dependent on the ATPse activity of Vps4 (35Babst M.

AMSH was also trapped in the class E compartments in the presence of CHMP3-(151–220) but remained cytosolic and excluded from these enlarged organelles in the presence of CHMP3-(151–222) (Fig. 3B). As an essential control for these experiments, we demonstrated that overexpression of the CHMP3 fragments did not affect the endosomal targeting of other ESCRT-III components. This was done by expression of either one of the truncated CHMP3 fragments together with FLAG-tagged full-length CHMP2A, CHMP3, CHMP4A, or CHMP6 and Vps4E228Q (used here to facilitate visualization). As shown in the examples in Fig. 3C, targeting of the four ESCRT-III components to the class E compartment was not affected. Therefore, CHMP3-(151–222) acted as a dominant-negative mutant and specifically prevented AMSH from localizing to endosomes (Fig. 3A) or to the endosome-originated class E compartment (Fig. 3B). Mislocalization or Depletion of AMSH Inhibits EGFR Degradation but Not Internalization—Although the substrate specificity of AMSH is unknown, its endosomal localization suggests that it might play a role in the MVB pathway to facilitate the sorting and degradation of internalized receptors such as EGFR. Thus, we used a single cell imaging assay (26Ward D.M. Vaughn M.B. Shiflett S.L. White P.L. Pollock A.L. Hill J. Schnegelberger R. Sundquist W.I. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

In control cells expressing mRFP only, in which AMSH was properly targeted to endosomes, EGFR was internalized normally (Fig. 4, right panel), and about 67% of total EGFR was degraded following 2 h of stimulation with EGF (weak punctate signal of internalized EGFR in Fig. 5A, right panel and the corresponding quantification in Fig. 5B). EGFR was internalized (Fig. 4) and degraded (Fig. 5) to a similar degree in cells expressing CHMP3-(151–220), which did not affect the endosomal localization of AMSH (Fig. 3A). In contrast, expression of CHMP3-(151–222), which causes the uncoupling of AMSH from endosomes (Fig. 3A), dramatically reduced EGFR degradation (Fig. 5), although the internalization was not affected (Fig. 4). The amount of EGFR present at the cell surface prior to EGF treatment was the same in all conditions (Fig. 4, left panels), showing that expression of the CHMP3 constructs and the mislocalization of AMSH was of no consequence for the traffic of EGFR to the cell surface.FIGURE 5Overexpression of CHMP3-(151–222) inhibits EGFR degradation. A, Cos7 cells were serum-starved for 2 h and treated with EGF (250 ng/ml) for either 5 min or 2 h at 12 h after transfection.

The statistical significance was calculated using the Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is possible, however, that a mechanism different from endosomal mistargeting of AMSH is responsible for the effects just described. To complement the mislocalization studies, we used an RNA interference-based approach to examine the effects of AMSH depletion on the internalization and degradation of activated EGFR using the single cell imaging assay (Fig. 6). Degradation (Fig. 6A, right panels, and 6B, corresponding quantification) but not internalization (Fig. 6A, middle panels) of EGFR was strongly inhibited in cells transfected for 3 days with either one of two different siRNA oligonucleotides specific for AMSH, These observations provide further evidence pointing toward an important role of AMSH in mediating EGFR degradation through the MVB pathway. Our work provides further evidence for an interaction recently described between the deubiquitinating enzyme AMSH and CHMP3 (39McCullough J. Row P.E. Lorenzo O. Doherty M. Beynon R. Clague M.J. Urbe S. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 160-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), a component of the ESCRT-III complex. We also found that failure to target AMSH to endosomes by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant form of CHMP3, which can still bind AMSH but does not localize to endosomes, impairs the degradation of internalized EGFR. This observation suggests that removal of ubiquitin by AMSH either from components of the ESCRT machinery or from internalized EGFR is important for receptor down-regulation. Presumably, AMSH also has a similar role for other membrane proteins that are degraded through the MVB pathway. The AMSH-CHMP3 interaction provides a direct link between a mammalian deubiquitinating enzyme and the ESCRT-III complex. In contrast, the yeast deubiquitinating enzyme Doa4 that is functionally associated with the MVB pathway is linked only indirectly with the ESCRT-III complex. In that case, the direct contact is between Doa4 and Bro1, a protein whose association with endosomes depends on the ESCRT-III protein Snf7 (yeast orthologue of mammalian CHMP4) (40Luhtala N. Odorizzi G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). There seem to be at least three ways by which targeting of AMSH to endosomes is achieved. AMSH can interact with STAM (17Kaneko T. Kumasaka T. Ganbe T. Sato T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Tanaka N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48162-48168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Tanaka N. Kaneko K. Asao H. Kasai H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Takeshita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19129-19135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), CHMP3 (Ref. 39McCullough J. Row P.E. Lorenzo O. Doherty M. Beynon R. Clague M.J. Urbe S. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 160-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar and this work), and clathrin (39McCullough J. Row P.E. Lorenzo O. Doherty M. Beynon R. Clague M.J. Urbe S. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 160-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Some form of coordinated interactions is required, however, since AMSH is found in endosomes containing clathrin but does not appear to colocalize with other clathrin-containing structures at the plasma membrane or within the perinuclear region (Ref. 15McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbe S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar and this work). Targeting of AMSH to early endosomes (Fig. 3A) requires its N-terminal region (Fig. 3B), which includes binding sites for CHMP3 and for STAM, whose endosomal localization in turn depends on its association with Hrs (41Mizuno E. Kawahata K. Okamoto A. Kitamura N. Komada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 135: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because the AMSH-STAM or AMSH-CHMP3 interactions alone can still support endosomal targeting, removal of either one of these interactions cannot be used to study the effect of endosomal mislocalization on AMSH function (Fig. 2B). Thus, the strategy pursued here of mislocalizing AMSH is by the squelching effect of overexpressing a truncated mutant of CHMP3 that can still interact with AMSH but prevents its endosomal localization. For this approach to be valid, however, it was essential to show that the endosomal localization of other ESCRT-III components remains normal upon overexpression of the CHMP3 fragment (Fig. 3C). We discovered that overexpression of CHMP3-(151–222), which interacts with AMSH, acted as a dominant-negative mutant for the endosomal localization of AMSH, presumably by forming a complex with AMSH that prevents it from being targeted to endosomes (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, overexpression of CHMP3-(151–222) inhibited EGFR degradation without affecting its internalization (Figs. 4 and 5). In contrast, overexpression of the slightly smaller CHMP3-(151–220) had no detectable effect on the endosomal localization of AMSH or on EGFR degradation (Figs. 3A and 4, A and B). It is possible that overexpression of CHMP3-(151–222), but not CHMP3-(151–220), sequesters other binding partners of CHMP3 besides AMSH, such as Vps4 (42Scott A. Gaspar J. Stuchell-Brereton M.D. Alam S.L. Skalicky J.J. Sundquist W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13813-13818Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), which might result in the inhibition of EGFR degradation. We believe, however, that this is not the case since Vps4E228Q remained associated with the endosomal class E compartment it generates when expressed together with either CHMP3-(151–220) or CHMP3-(151–222) (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, endosomal localization of AMSH seems to be important for efficient down-regulation of EGFR. It has been established that human immunodeficiency virus-1 engages the ESCRT system for budding and release of the viral particles from the plasma membrane (4Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W.

Overexpression of CHMP3 capable of binding AMSH or of an AMSH mutant unable to remove ubiquitin strongly prevents viral budding, indicating that like degradation of activated EGFR, these virus-associated processes also depend on the correct interaction of CHMP3 with AMSH (34Zamborlini A. Usami Y. Radoshitzky S.R. Popova E. Palu G. Göttlinger H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19140-19145Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 43Agromayor M. Martin-Serrano J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23083-23091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our results concerning the role of endosomal AMSH on EGFR degradation are at variance with the moderate acceleration in receptor degradation previously observed by knocking down AMSH using siRNA (15McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbe S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 19Bowers K. Piper S.C. Edeling M.A. Gray S.R. Owen D.J. Lehner P.J. Luzio J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5094-5105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The results from our RNA interference experiments, using two different siRNAs specific for AMSH, is a strong inhibition on EGFR degradation. Perhaps one explanation for the differences can be ascribed to the longer post-transfection period (72 versus 48 h) used by us to ensure maximum depletion of AMSH. Our observations do not address whether endosomal AMSH acts directly on cargoes, on components of the ESCRT machinery, or on both. UBPY is another mammalian STAM-binding deubiquitinating enzyme targeted to endosomes. It was recently shown that changes in the expression level of UBPY but not of AMSH affects the ubiquitination level of EGFR, suggesting that EGFR is not a substrate of AMSH (18Mizuno E. Iura T. Mukai A. Yoshimori T. Kitamura N. Komada M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5163-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). STAM appears to be a substrate for the deubiquitinating activity of AMSH, however, as expression of an enzymatically inactive form of AMSH (D348A) increased the amount of ubiquitinated STAM and enhanced the association of AMSH with endosomes (15McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbe S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 39McCullough J. Row P.E. Lorenzo O. Doherty M. Beynon R. Clague M.J. Urbe S. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 160-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains a possibility that the mislocalization of AMSH attained during our experiments slows down the deubiquitination of STAM and thereby accelerates its own degradation and prevents EGFR degradation. Indeed, knocking down of UBPY expression results in accelerated degradation of STAM and inhibition of EGFR degradation (20Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12618-12624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In summary, AMSH interacts with a least three distinct components of the MVB pathway, STAM, CHMP3, and clathrin. Proper endosomal localization of AMSH is required for efficient EGFR degradation but not for its internalization. Presumably, other membrane proteins, also using ubiquitin as a sorting signal to enter the MVB pathway, are similarly dependent on AMSH for their degradation. Addendum—When this manuscript was in preparation, the CHMP3-AMSH interaction was independently reported by McCullough et al. (39McCullough J. Row P.E. Lorenzo O. Doherty M. Beynon R. Clague M.J.

Chloroplasts perform oxygenic photosynthesis in algae and plants and have evolved by endosymbiosis from cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts have two distinct membrane systems, the double envelope surrounding the organelle and an internal membrane system named thylakoids. The envelope membrane represents the interface between the cytoplasm and chloroplast stroma, whereas the thylakoid membrane separates the stroma and the lumenal space. Altogether ∼800 membrane proteins have been identified by proteomics in the envelope and thylakoid membranes of Arabidopsis thaliana (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ephritikhine G. Ferro M. Rolland N.

As expected, the main function for the identified envelope proteins was transport of ions and metabolites, whereas photosynthesis was attributed to most of the identified thylakoid proteins.

I and II, the cytochrome b6 f complex, and the proton-translocating ATP synthase. These photosynthetic complexes contain not only proteins but also pigments and other cofactors. Their assembly, activity, and removal require a large number of auxiliary, regulatory, and transport proteins (3Vothknecht U.C. Westhoff P. Biochim. Biophys.

Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands2001: 153-175Google Scholar). Many biochemical reports pointed to the existence of transport activities in the thylakoid membrane, such as calcium transport (5Ettinger W.F. Clear A.M. Fanning K.J. Peck M.L. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1379-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), copper transport (6Shingles R. Wimmers L.E. McCarty R.E.

Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). No hydrophobic proteins related to the above-mentioned transport activities were identified in the previous proteomic works on Arabidopsis thylakoid membranes (for a review, see Ref. 2van Wijk K.J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2004; 42: 963-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, genetic strategies are required for identification and elucidation of their role in optimal function of the thylakoid. ATP is produced during the light-dependent photosynthetic reactions on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane. Besides its utilization during CO2 fixation in the stroma, ATP drives many energy-dependent processes in thylakoids, including protein phosphorylation, folding, import, and degradation. Alternatively, ATP is transported across the membrane into the lumenal space and converted to GTP by a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, NDPK3 (10Spetea C. Hundal T. Lundin B. Heddad M. Adamska I. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There are also several recent indications for the presence of phosphorylated proteins in the thylakoid lumen of green algae and plants, as provided by mass spectrometry analyses (12Wagner V. Gessner G. Heiland I. Kaminski M. Hawat S. Scheffler K. Mittag M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Rinalducci S. Larsen M.R. Mohammed S. Zolla L. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The transport of ATP across the thylakoid membrane proceeds via a nucleotide-binding protein of 36.5 kDa (10Spetea C. Hundal T. Lundin B. Heddad M. Adamska I. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This protein is homologous to the bovine mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), which is the most studied member of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF, Prosite PS50920). The structure of the bovine AAC was solved by x-ray crystallography at 2.2 Å of resolution in the presence of carboxyatractyloside (14Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trezeguet V.

In this work we provide computer-based and experimental evidence that the product of the Arabidopsis At5g01500 gene is a thylakoid ATP/ADP carrier (TAAC). In a previous proteomic study this protein was concluded to be localized in the chloroplast (inner) envelope (18Ferro M. Salvi D. Brugiere S. Miras S. Kowalski S. Louwagie M. Garin J. Joyard J.

Here we demonstrate a major thylakoid and a minor envelope location for the TAAC protein. Our studies also show that TAAC is readily expressed in Arabidopsis dark-grown seedlings and appears to be needed for both synthesis of photosynthetic complexes during greening and for their recycling during senescence and stress.

For localization using immunogold, Arabidopsis cv. Wassilewskaja was grown on soil. For transient expression studies, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) plants were grown on Murashige Skoog medium at 100 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 and 24 °C under a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod. Arabidopsis (cv. Wassilewskaja) seeds of the T-DNA insertion line FLAG 443D03 (taac mutant, supplemental Fig. S1A) were obtained from PublicLines at Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique. For screening of homozygous mutant plants, genomic DNA isolated from wild type (WT) and the taac mutant was analyzed by two sets of PCR reactions using gene-specific forward 5′-AGAACAACGTGTCGTCGAATC-3′ and reverse 5′-CAACACCATTCTTTCCAAAAGG-3′ primers and the T-DNA left border 5′-TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG-3′ primer (supplemental Fig. S1B). Homozygoty was confirmed in the next generation. Structural Analyses—Homology and orthology searches using BLAST were performed in MIPS, TIGR, and Cyanobase. Prediction of intracellular location and membrane topology were performed using TargetP, the PPDB data base, and a package of programs at ARAMEMNON website. The amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW. A structural homology model of the Arabidopsis TAAC protein was built from its amino acid sequence by use of several local structure and fold recognition methods at the MetaServer (20Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The established structure of the protein with the highest scores (bovine AAC; PDB code 1okc A) was used as template, and the comparison was done using the Swiss-Model program (21Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). The calculated three-dimensional model was obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the 3D-Jury sequence alignment. Analysis of the TAAC structural model was performed by use of the DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer program and also by use of Insight II software (Version 2005) on the Octane work station by Silicon Graphics. The structural model shown (Fig. 1D) was produced by use of the latter. Transient Expression of a TAAC-GFP Fusion Construct and Microscope Analysis—The entire coding region of the TAAC gene was amplified by PCR using an Arabidopsis CD4–14 cDNA library (22Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldmann K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the expression vector pDR303. In the resulting pNL1500 plasmid the TAAC sequence was fused in-frame to the 5′-end of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence and placed under the control of the transcriptional 35S promoter from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV35S). This plasmid was introduced into tobacco leaf protoplasts by electroporation. After 24 h of incubation in darkness, protoplasts were imaged using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The detailed protocols for construct design, protoplast isolation, electroporation, and microscope analysis are described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Chloroplast Membrane Preparations—Arabidopsis chloroplasts were prepared (23Eshaghi S. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and lysed in 50 mm Tricine/KOH (pH 7.6) and 5 mm MgCl2 (Tricine buffer) for 10 min on ice. Thylakoids and envelope membranes were purified from the lysate by centrifugation at 113,000 × g for 1 h on sucrose step gradient (0.6, 0.93, 1.2, and 1.5 m sucrose). Thylakoids were collected at the 1.2/1.5 m interface, diluted with Tricine buffer, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Envelope membranes were collected at the 0.93/1.2 m interface, diluted with Tricine buffer, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min (to discard thylakoid vesicles) followed by 150,000 × g for 30 min. The thylakoids and envelope membranes were finally resuspended in Tricine buffer supplemented with 0.3 m sucrose. Chlorophyll (Chl) and protein concentrations were determined as described (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar, 25Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4534) Google Scholar). For topology studies, thylakoid membranes (0.2 mg of Chl ml-1) were treated with 1 m NaCl or 0.1 or 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice in darkness followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min. Both supernatants and pellets were analyzed by Western blotting. Protein Analysis—SDS/PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described (26Spetea C. Hundal T. Lohmann F. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6547-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). An anti-TAAC antibody was produced in rabbit against a peptide corresponding to the last 15 residues at C terminus of the Arabidopsis protein and purified by affinity chromatography (Innovagen, Lund, Sweden). Where indicated, antibodies against the 110-kDa protein of the translocon of the chloroplast inner envelope membrane (TIC110, a gift from Prof. J. Soll), a light-harvesting Chl a/b-binding protein of PSII (Lhcb2, Agrisera, Umeå, Sweden), and an anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) were also used. Immunogold Electron Microscopy—Arabidopsis rosette leaves were thinly diced and fixed overnight. After blocking in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, the grids were incubated with the anti-TAAC antibody followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit serum conjugated with colloidal gold particles, staining, and electron microscopy as earlier described (27Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1980; 12: 381-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Detailed protocols are given under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Cloning, Heterologous Expression, and Purification of a Recombinant TAAC Protein—All DNA manipulations, including PCR, restriction digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, ligation, and transformation into Escherichia coli (E. coli) DH5α, were performed by standard procedures (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor1989Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis TAAC gene was PCR-amplified with oligonucleotides designed to exclude the first 177 base pairs of the gene (corresponding to the predicted transit peptide), cloned, and recombined as a fusion construct with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by Xpress epitope and a C-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKD-DDDK) into a pTrcHisB plasmid for expression in E. coli. Such a set-up has previously been employed to purify another membrane-embedded protein (29Lagerstedt J.O. Voss J.C. Wieslander A. Persson B.L. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The detailed protocols are given under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Uptake of Radioactive ATP and ADP into E. coli Cells—For uptake experiments cells transformed with the TAAC-expressing plasmid (or control expression plasmid) were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β,d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 6 h in Terrific Broth medium supplemented with 10 mm malate and 10 mm pyruvate (17Haferkamp I. Hackstein J.H.P. Voncken F.G.J. Schmit G. Tjaden J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3172-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Uptake experiments were carried out according to Haferkamp et al. (17Haferkamp I. Hackstein J.H.P. Voncken F.G.J. Schmit G. Tjaden J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3172-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Tjaden et al. (30Tjaden J. Schwoppe C. Mohlmann T. Quick P.W. Neuhaus H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9630-9636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Cells (30 μl, 100 μg μl-1) were incubated in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 μm [α-32P]ATP (500 mCi/mmol; 1 μCi = 37 kBq, Amersham Biosciences) or [α-32P]ADP, prepared according to Tjaden et al. (30Tjaden J. Schwoppe C. Mohlmann T. Quick P.W. Neuhaus H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9630-9636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) at 30 °C for the indicated time periods. Where indicated, the uptake experiments were carried out in the presence of 2.5 mm various nonlabeled nucleotides. For determination of the transport affinity (Km) and the maximal rate (Vmax), uptake of a range of concentrations (0–250 μm) of [α-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ADP was carried out in E. coli cells preincubated or not with 100 μm m-chlorocarbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (CCCP) for uncoupling. The cells were thereafter quickly filtrated through a 0.45-μm filter (Pall, New York) under vacuum and washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffer. The radioactivity retained on the filters was quantified in 3.5 ml of water using scintillation spectrometry. Back exchange experiments were carried out essentially as previously described (17Haferkamp I. Hackstein J.H.P. Voncken F.G.J. Schmit G. Tjaden J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3172-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Tjaden J. Schwoppe C. Mohlmann T. Quick P.W. Neuhaus H.E. J. Biol.

The detailed protocol is provided under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Uptake of Radioactive ATP into Thylakoids and Assay of NDPK Activity—Arabidopsis thylakoids (30 μl, 0.3 μg of Chl μl-1) were incubated in Tricine buffer containing 10 μm [α-32P]ATP in darkness at 22 °C for the indicated periods of time. In some experiments the uptake was carried out using 0–50 μm [α-32P]ATP or in the presence of 1 mm nonlabeled nucleotides. The thylakoids were washed twice and recovered by rapid centrifugation (45 s, 13,000 × g), and their radioactivity was counted in 1 ml of water. Control experiments in the presence of 10 mm nonlabeled ATP indicated 10% nonspecific binding. This value was substracted from all measured activities. Back exchange experiments were performed essentially as described for E. coli. Details are given under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” NDPK activity was assayed as the amount of [γ-32P]GTP produced from 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (12.5 Ci/mmol) and 1 mm GDP, as described (10Spetea C. Hundal T. Lundin B. Heddad M. Adamska I. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from frozen Arabidopsis tissues using TRIzol® and Plant RNA Purification Reagent (Invitrogen) or RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts (5–10 μg) of RNA were separated on a 1.2% (w/v) denaturating formaldehyde/agarose gel and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Applied Science) (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor1989Google Scholar). The TAAC probe was obtained by PCR amplification of a 430-bp fragment using the At5g01500 cDNA as template and the digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled deoxynucleotide mixture (Roche Applied Science). The following PCR primers were used: forward, 5′-GGCACCGCTTGACCGAATAA, and reverse, 5′-AAGCGAAGGACCTAGACCGTTGTA. Hybridization was carried out according to the instructions in the DIG-Nonradioactive Nucleic Acid Labeling and Detection System (Roche Applied Science). Structural Analyses of the TAAC Protein—Similarity search with the amino acid sequence of the bovine AAC against the Arabidopsis protein data base combined with prediction of transit peptides revealed six plastid MCF members, which is in line with previously published data (31Weber A.P. Schwacke R. Flugge U.I. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2005; 56: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Among them, the product of the At5g01500 gene (MIPS code for TAAC) with a putative carrier function corresponded in size to the previously reported nucleotide thylakoid transporter (10Spetea C. Hundal T. Lundin B. Heddad M. Adamska I. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The coding region of the At5g01500 gene obtained by screening of an Arabidopsis cDNA library (22Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldmann K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar) confirmed the exon assignment in the MIPS data base. In the same data base five expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were found for Arabidopsis TAAC, indicating that the gene is transcriptionally active. The encoded Arabidopsis TAAC protein contains 415 amino acids and an N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide (amino acids 1–59), as indicated by TargetP (score 0.764, RC3) (Fig. 1A). Using advanced bioinformatics analysis for intra-chloroplast protein sorting (32Sun Q. Emanuelsson O. van Wijk K.J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a low cysteine content (0.07%) and a negative GRAVY index (-0.079) were determined (data extracted from PPDB) that are in favor of a thylakoid rather than envelope location for this putative protein. Nevertheless, it was annotated as an envelope protein due to its high hydrophobicity, high isoelectric point, and putative carrier function (18Ferro M. Salvi D. Brugiere S. Miras S. Kowalski S. Louwagie M. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 325-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Notably, two proteomic studies disagree on the envelope localization of the At5g01500 gene product (18Ferro M. Salvi D. Brugiere S. Miras S. Kowalski S. Louwagie M. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 325-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 33Kleffmann T. Russenberger D. von Zychlinski A. Christopher W. Sjolander K. Gruissem W. Baginsky S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 354-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The mature form shows 28% identity (43% similarity) to the bovine AAC protein (bAAC). The TAAC termini are 50 (N) and 30 (C) residues, respectively, longer than the corresponding regions in bAAC and are rich in both positively and negatively charged residues (Fig. 1A). The presence of a five-glycine repeat in the middle of the N terminus indicates that this region may undergo large conformational changes that could regulate TAAC activity. A ring of four well conserved positively charged residues (Lys-22, Arg-79, Tyr-186, and Arg-279 in bAAC) was proposed to act as a selectivity filter for adenine nucleotides in all AACs (14Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 34Nury H. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Pebay-Peyroula E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 713-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The alignment (Fig. 1A) shows that these residues are also conserved in TAAC (Lys-130, Arg-186, Tyr-282, Lys-369), suggesting a possible substrate preference for adenine nucleotides. As was found in all MCF members, TAAC contains three repeated homologous regions, with highly conserved consensus sequences (Fig. 1B). The unique AAC signature (RRRMMM) in the third repeat region is only partially conserved in TAAC (RRqMql, where the lowercase letters indicate nonconserved residues), as in the case of two other AACs (34Nury H. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Pebay-Peyroula E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 713-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The relevance of this signature for binding and/or transport of adenine nucleotides is not clearly understood. Nevertheless, the detailed analysis of the bovine AAC x-ray structure indicated that only the first two arginines (also conserved in TAAC) interact with carboxyatractyloside (34Nury H. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Pebay-Peyroula E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 713-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Various software tested at the ARAMEMNON website indicated zero to six transmembrane domains (TMDs) for the TAAC protein. The reason for this large variability is the presence of many charged residues as well as conserved prolines in the putative TMDs of this type of transport protein, unusual features for which various software is more or less sensitive, as suggested previously (32Sun Q. Emanuelsson O. van Wijk K.J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Six TMDs have been revealed in the crystal structure of the bovine AAC (14Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have used the alignment with the bovine carrier (Fig. 1A) as basis for the presence of six TMDs in the TAAC structure (Fig. 1B). In the folding model of the TAAC protein (Fig. 1C), the TMDs are connected by three loops on the stromal side and two loops on the lumenal side. The stromal loops contain amphipatic helices (h12, h34, and h56, Fig. 1B). For the mitochondrial AAC, the N and C termini are in the intermembrane space, and the adenine nucleotide-binding site is on the matrix side of the membrane, where ATP is synthesized. Taking into account that in chloroplasts ATP is synthesized on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane and is transported from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen (10Spetea C. Hundal T. Lundin B. Heddad M. Adamska I. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the N and C termini of the TAAC protein are expected to be located on the lumenal side of membrane (Fig. 1C). The TAAC amino acid sequence was analyzed for structural homologues at the MetaServer (20Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). As expected, substantial structural similarities to the bovine AAC (PDB 1okc A) were identified, and a highly significant 3D-Jury homology score (140.2) was provided. The presented structural homology model of TAAC (Fig. 1D) is limited to amino acid residues 110–384, excluding the large N and C termini, which have no correspondence in the bovine AAC. Like the bovine protein, the overall structure is ba"
https://openalex.org/W2079523831,"CD30 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily whose expression is up-regulated on anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cells. Many different outcomes of CD30 stimulation have been reported, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and activation of the prosurvival transcription factor, NF-kappaB, although this last activity is much less well defined in ALCL cells. In order to better understand the signaling properties of CD30 in cancer, we established a system for the stimulation of CD30 with its physiological ligand. Using this system, CD30 was stimulated on ALCL and HL cells, and the subsequent CD30 signaling properties were characterized. We show that a fraction of ALCL cells rapidly underwent apoptosis following CD30 stimulation, whereas HL cells were unaffected. The surviving ALCL cells exhibited robust activation of both the canonical and alternative NF-kappaB pathways as measured by nuclear translocation of RelA, p50, RelB, and p52, and this culminated in the transactivation of classical NF-kappaB-responsive genes. With prolonged CD30 stimulation, ALCL cells underwent cell cycle arrest that correlated with expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(waf1). Furthermore, p21(waf1) expression and cell cycle arrest were found to depend predominantly on the canonical NF-kappaB pathway, since it was reversed by RNA interference-mediated suppression of RelA. In contrast, suppression of the p100/p52 NF-kappaB subunit had little effect on p21(waf1). These data reveal that in ALCL cells, in contrast to other cell types, CD30 stimulation elicits p21(waf1)-mediated arrest through the canonical but not the alternative NF-kappaB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2057456232,"Previously, we reported that the paralogous zinc-finger proteins – CTCF and brother of the regulator of imprinted sites (BORIS), directly contribute to transcriptional regulation of NY-ESO-1 in lung cancer cells. To further examine mechanisms that mediate expression of this cancer-testis gene, we performed software-guided analysis of the NY-ESO-1 promoter region, which revealed several potential Sp1-binding motifs. Sequential 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine/depsipeptide FK228 treatment markedly induced BORIS expression and enhanced nuclear translocation of Sp1 in lung cancer cells. Transient transfection assays using promoter–reporter constructs, as well as gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that NY-ESO-1 promoter activity coincided with occupancy of the proximal Sp1-binding site in lung cancer cells. Mutations within the Sp1 recognition sequence specifically eliminated binding of Sp1 to this motif in vitro, and markedly diminished NY-ESO-1 promoter activity in vivo. siRNA-mediated inhibition of Sp1 expression decreased NY-ESO-1 promoter activity, whereas knock down of CTCF expression augmented NY-ESO-1 transcription in lung cancer cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that Sp1 physically interacts with BORIS but not with CTCF in vivo. Collectively, these findings suggest that BORIS recruits Sp1 to mediate de-repression of NY-ESO-1 during pulmonary carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2009691874,"A chemical biology approach identifies a beta 2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) agonist ARA-211 (Pirbuterol), which causes apoptosis and human tumor regression in animal models. β2AR stimulation of cAMP formation and protein kinase A (PKA) activation leads to Raf-1 (but not B-Raf) kinase inactivation, inhibition of Mek-1 kinase and decreased phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 levels. ARA-211 inhibition of the Raf/Mek/Erk1/2 pathway is mediated by PKA and not exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC). ARA-211 is selective and suppresses P-Erk1/2 but not P-JNK, P-p38, P-Akt or P-STAT3 levels. β2AR stimulation results in inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, induction of apoptosis in vitro and tumor regression in vivo. β2AR antagonists and constitutively active Mek-1 rescue from the effects of ARA-211, demonstrating that β2AR stimulation and Mek kinase inhibition are required for ARA-211 antitumor activity. Furthermore, suppression of growth occurs only in human tumors where ARA-211 induces cAMP formation and decreases P-Erk1/2 levels. Thus, β2AR stimulation results in significant suppression of malignant transformation in cancers where it blocks the Raf-1/Mek-1/Erk1/2 pathway by a cAMP-dependent activation of PKA but not EPAC."

https://openalex.org/W2044063668,"A regulated pattern of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation is essential for normal development of the mammary gland. An increase in NF-kappaB activity has been implicated in breast cancer. We have generated a novel transgenic mouse model to investigate the role of the alternative NF-kappaB pathway in ductal development and identify possible mediators of tumorigenesis downstream of p100/p52. By overexpressing the NF-kappaB p100/p52 subunit in mammary epithelium using the beta-lactoglobulin milk protein promoter, we found that transgene expression resulted in increased overall NF-kappaB activity during late pregnancy. During pregnancy, p100/p52 expression resulted in delayed ductal development with impaired secondary branching and increased levels of Cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the mammary gland. After multiple pregnancies the p100 transgenics exhibited a ductal thickening accompanied by small hyperplastic foci. In tumors from mice expressing the polyoma middle T oncoprotein (PyVT) in the mammary gland, increased levels of p100/p52 were present at the time of tumor development. These results show that increased p100/p52 disrupts normal ductal development and provides insight into the mechanism by which this may contribute to human breast cancer."

It has been thought that half-ABC transporters with one nucleotide-binding domain and one membrane-spanning domain (MSD) likely work as dimers, whereas full-length transporters with two nucleotide-binding domains and two or three MSDs function as monomers. In this study, we examined the oligomeric status of the human full-length ABC transporter ABCC1/MRP1 using several biochemical approaches. We found 1) that it is a homodimer, 2) that the dimerization domain is located in the amino-terminal MSD0L0 (where L0 is loop 0) region, and 3) that MSD0L0 has a dominant-negative function when coexpressed with wild-type ABCC1/MRP1. These findings suggest that ABCC1/MRP1 may exist and function as a dimer and that MSD0L0 likely plays some structural and regulatory functions. It is also tempting to propose that the MSD0L0-mediated dimerization may be targeted for therapeutic development to sensitize ABCC1/MRP1-mediated drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy.

Although it has recently been argued that the amino-terminal end (33 amino acids) may form a U-shaped structure and function as a gate (15Chen Q. Yang Y. Li L. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol.

Zhang J.-T. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Cancer Agents. 2004; 4: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the human half-ABC transporter ABCG2 has been shown recently to exist mainly as a homododecamer (17Xu J. Liu Y. Yang Y. Bates S. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19781-19789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may function as a oligomer with 12 subunits. Previous studies using radiation inactivation of human erythrocytes (18Soszynski M. Kaluzna A. Rychlik B. Sokal A. Bartosz G. Arch. Biochem.

In this study, we examined the oligomeric status of human ABCC1 using multiple approaches, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFO)-PAGE, nondenaturing PAGE, gel filtration chromatography, sucrose density gradient sedimentation, chemical cross-linking, and co-immunoprecipitation. We demonstrate that human ABCC1 is a homodimer and that MSD0L0 is essential and sufficient for homodimerization of human ABCC1. Although coexpression of MSD0L0 inhibits the LTC4 transport activity of full-length ABCC1 possibly by forming a heterodimer with the full-length molecule, the carboxyl-terminal core domain lacks dimerization activity and does not inhibit the LTC4 transport function of full-length ABCC1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—PFO and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) were purchased from Oakwood Products, Inc., and Pierce, respectively.

All other reagents were molecular biology grade and were purchased from Sigma or Fisher.Engineering Human ABCC1 Constructs—pcDNA3.1(+)-MRP1WT encoding human wild-type ABCC1 was constructed previously (20Yang Y. Chen Q. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44268-44277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The constructs encoding full-length ABCC1 with a FLAG or HA tag at its carboxyl terminus were engineered by amplifying a 754- or 763-bp fragment of ABCC1 using a forward primer (nucleotides 4012–4029 of human ABCC1 cDNA) with an EcoRI site (underlined) (5′-GTGGAATTCCGGAACTAC-3′) and a reverse primer with a NotI site (underlined) and a FLAG tag (italic) (5′-CCGCGGCCGCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCACCAAGCCGGCGTCTTTGGC) or an HA tag (italic) (5′-CCGCGGCCGCTCAGAGGCTAGCATAATCAGGAACATCATACGGATACACCAAGCCGGCGTCTTTGGC-3′). The PCR products were then digested with EcoRI and NotI to generate a 746-bp (FLAG) or 755-bp (HA) fragment, which was subsequently cloned into pcDNA3.1(+)-MRP1WT digested with EcoRI and NotI, resulting in pcDNA3.1(+)-ABCC1F-FLAG or pcDNA3.1(+)-ABCC1F-HA. To generate the human carboxyl-terminal core structure of ABCC1 with a FLAG tag at its carboxyl terminus, the 746-bp fragment from the PCR was inserted into previously constructed pcDNA3.1(+)-MRP1CORE (20Yang Y. Chen Q. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44268-44277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) digested with EcoRI and NotI, resulting in pcDNA3.1(+)-ABCC1CORE-FLAG. To generate construct pcDNA3.1(+)-ABCC1281N encoding the first 281 amino acids of human ABCC1, pcDNA3.1(+)-MRP1WT (20Yang Y. Chen Q. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44268-44277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and NotI and blunted with Klenow fragment. The DNA fragments were then self-ligated, resulting in pcDNA3.1(+)-ABCC1281N. Translation of ABCC1281N terminates at a stop codon in the vector, resulting in the addition of 9 amino acids (RPLESRGPV) following Asp281 of human ABCC1, as described previously (21Gao M.

All constructs were confirmed by double-strand DNA sequencing.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Membrane Preparations—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To establish stable ABCC1F-HA clones, 5 μg of pcDNA3.1(+)-ABCC1F-HA were transfected into HEK293 cells in 100-mm cell culture dishes using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days following transfection, 10% of the transfected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. The G418-resistant cells were cloned using cloning cylinders and propagated for further experiments.For transient transfection, 15 μg of pcDNA3.1(+)-ABCC1F-FLAG, pcDNA3.1(+)-ABCC1281N, or pcDNA3.1(+)-ABCC1CORE-FLAG were transfected into HEK293 cells that did or did not express ABCC1F-HA in 150-mm dishes using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested for preparation of cell lysates or membrane vesicles as described previously (20Yang Y. Chen Q. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol.

Liu Y. Yang Y. Bates S. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19781-19789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 5 μg of plasma membranes in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 150 mm NaCl were mixed with an equal volume of 2× PFO extraction sample buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 200 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.25–8% PFO) or 2 × SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 200 mm DTT, and 4% SDS) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 11,000 ×g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants were loaded onto freshly prepared 7.5% Tris/glycine-polyacrylamide gel without SDS. Electrophoresis was performed at 100 V at 4 °C using a running buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% PFO. The proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes, and human ABCC1 was detected using monoclonal antibody MRPr1. The signal was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody and the ECL system.Nondenaturing PAGE—Nondenaturing PAGE was performed as described previously (17Xu J. Liu Y. Yang Y. Bates S. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19781-19789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼10 μg of plasma membranes in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 150 mm NaCl were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Triton X-100 extraction sample buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 2% Triton X-100, and 200 mm DTT) or 2× SDS sample buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 11,000 ×g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants were then loaded onto precast 4–15% gradient Tris/glycine-polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was performed at 80 V at room temperature with a running buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 8.3) and 192 mm glycine, followed by transfer to PVDF membranes for Western blot analysis as described above.Sucrose Density Gradient Sedimentation—Plasma membranes (100 μg) were first extracted with 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm DTT, and 1% PFO or 2% SDS) as described above. The extracts were then loaded onto a 10–30% (w/v) continuous sucrose gradient containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% PFO or SDS. Sedimentation was performed with a Beckman SW 41 rotor at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, separation by SDS-PAGE, transfer to PVDF membranes, and detection of ABCC1 by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody MRPr1 as a probe. Protein markers (thyroglobulin (669 kDa), laminin (400 and 200 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa)) were separated and fractionated under the same conditions and detected by Coomassie Blue staining of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel of each fraction.Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography was perform using anÁKTA purifier system with a Superose 6 HR column as described previously (17Xu J. Liu Y. Yang Y. Bates S. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19781-19789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of plasma membranes were first extracted with PFO or SDS in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 100 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature and then subjected to centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were injected into the column equilibrated with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% PFO or SDS). Fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The retention of human ABCC1 was determined by separation of each fraction by SDS-PAGE and transfer to PVDF membranes, followed by detection of ABCC1 by Western blot analysis. Protein markers (laminin (400 and 200 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa)) were separated using the ÁKTA purifier system under the same conditions and detected using the UV detector of theÁKTA purifier system.Chemical Cross-linking—A stable HEK293 cell clone expressing human ABCC1 (20Yang Y.

Crude membranes were prepared as described previously (20Yang Y. Chen Q. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44268-44277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), followed by separation by SDS-PAGE in the absence or presence of 100 mm DTT before transfer to PVDF membranes and Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody MRPr1 as a probe.Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described previously (17Xu J.

Cell. 2003; 14: 3942-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100). The cell lysate was cleared of insoluble materials by centrifugation and used for immunoprecipitation. For inhibition of glycosylation, tunicamycin treatment was performed prior to lysate preparation as described previously (20Yang Y. Chen Q. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44268-44277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (1.5 mg) were first precleared by incubation with 1 μg of normal mouse IgG at 4 °C for 4 h, followed by the addition of 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads (50% slurry) and incubation at 4 °C for 3 h with rotation and centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The cleared supernatants were then incubated with 10 μg of anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody at 4 °C with rotation for 2 h before mixing with 50 μl of protein G-agarose slurry. The mixtures were further incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with rotation, followed by centrifugation to collect precipitates, which were then washed five times with lysis buffer and used for Western blotting.[3H]LTC4 Transport Assay—ATP-dependent transport of [3H]LTC4 into inside-out plasma membrane vesicles was measured using a rapid filtration method as described previously (20Yang Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of membrane vesicles were incubated at 25 °C for 2 min in 25 μl of transport buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 0.02% sodium azide (pH 7.4)) containing 4 mm ATP or AMP, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 50 nm [3H]LTC4 (0.01 μCi) and mixed with 1 ml of ice-cold transport buffer, followed by filtration under vacuum through a glass-fiber filter (type GF/B, Whatman). Filters were immediately washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold transport buffer and then dried before measurement of radioactivity by scintillation counting.RESULTSPFO Extraction and PFO-PAGE Analyses of Human ABCC1—To investigate the oligomeric status of human ABCC1, we first employed PFO-PAGE. PFO is a mild ionic detergent that does not break the noncovalent interactions between protein subunits of an oligomer at appropriate concentrations and therefore permits extraction and determination of the oligomeric status of membrane proteins by PFO-PAGE. This method has been used successfully to study the oligomeric status of several membrane proteins (17Xu J. Liu Y. Yang Y. Bates S. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol.

Chen Q. Zhang J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44268-44277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, PFO at concentrations of 0.5% and above can effectively extract human ABCC1 from membranes. When the PFO-extracted human ABCC1 proteins were separated by PFO-PAGE, most migrated with an estimated molecular mass of ∼569 kDa at low concentrations (e.g. 0.5%) of PFO (Fig. 2B). The SDS-extracted ABCC1 proteins migrated with an estimated molecular mass of ∼258 kDa and were assumed to be monomers (Fig. 2B and Table 1). Thus, most of the ABCC1 proteins extracted with 0.5% PFO migrated likely as dimers (Table 1). However, more monomeric ABCC1 proteins were apparent when higher concentrations (e.g. 4%) of PFO were used for extraction (Fig. 2B), suggesting that higher concentrations of PFO can dissociate ABCC1 into monomers.FIGURE 2Analysis of human ABCC1 by PFO-PAGE and nondenaturing PAGE. A, PFO extraction. Membranes isolated from HEK293 cells expressing human wild-type ABCC1 were extracted with PFO at various concentrations, followed by centrifugation. All supernatant (lanes 1–6) and pellet (lanes 7–12) fractions were then solubilized in SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. B, PFO-PAGE. Supernatants from membranes extracted with various concentrations of PFO were first separated by PFO-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis. A fraction extracted with SDS was also used as a control (lane 5). C, nondenaturing PAGE.

Open table in a new tab To determine that the formation of dimeric ABCC1 was not due to the use of PFO, the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 was used for extraction, followed by nondenaturing PAGE and Western blot analysis. ABCC1 extracted with SDS was used as a control. As shown in Fig. 2C, Triton X-100-extracted ABCC1 migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 534 kDa, whereas SDS-extracted ABCC1 migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 289 kDa. Assuming that ABCC1 extracted with SDS migrated as a monomer, we conclude that the ∼534-kDa ABCC1 protein extracted with Triton X-100 is likely a dimer (Table 1).Analysis of Human ABCC1 by Sucrose Density Gradient Sedimentation—Sucrose density gradient sedimentation was also used to determine the size of human ABCC1. ABCC1 was first extracted from membranes with PFO or SDS as a control and then subjected to sucrose density gradient sedimentation, followed by fractionation, trichloroacetic acid precipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), ABCC1 extracted with PFO was detected between fractions 7 and 11 with a peak in fraction 9, with an estimated molecular mass of 319 kDa. On the other hand, ABCC1 extracted with SDS was detected between fractions 15 and 16 (Fig. 3C), with an estimated average molecular mass of 132 kDa (Fig. 3D). Thus, the majority of ABCC1 proteins extracted with PFO likely exist as dimers, assuming that ABCC1 proteins extracted with SDS behave as monomers (Table 1).FIGURE 3Analysis of human ABCC1 by sucrose density gradient sedimentation. Membrane proteins (100 μg) were extracted with PFO (A) or SDS (C), and the soluble fractions were layered on top of continuous sucrose gradients, followed by centrifugation, fractionation, trichloroacetic acid precipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ABCC1 in each fraction was quantified by measuring the intensity of the Western blot using Scion software and plotted against the fraction number. The marker proteins thyroglobulin (TG), catalase (CA), bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PFO and β-galactosidase (BG) and laminin (LA) in SDS were analyzed under the same conditions as those described for ABCC1. The apparent molecular masses of ABCC1 in PFO (B) and SDS (D) were estimated based on the linear regression of the fractionation of the molecular mass markers.

As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), human ABCC1 extracted with PFO eluted in fractions with retentions of 8–14 ml. The two peak fractions with retentions of 10 and 12.5 ml had estimated molecular masses of 412 and 202 kDa, respectively. On the other hand, ABCC1 extracted with SDS eluted between fractions of 9.5–11 ml, with an estimated molecular mass of 189 kDa at the peak (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, the two peak fractions of ABCC1 extracted with PFO are likely dimeric and monomeric forms, respectively (Table 1).FIGURE 4Analysis of human ABCC1 by gel filtration chromatography.

https://openalex.org/W2084513598,"Tumor growth is influenced by interactions between malignant cells and the tumor stroma. Although the normal host microenvironment is nonpermissive for neoplastic progression, tumor-reactive stroma, characterized by the presence of activated fibroblasts, promotes neoplastic growth and metastasis. Secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular glycoprotein that is capable of inhibiting the growth of several different types of cancer. Recently, we reported that SPARC also impairs the growth of xenografts comprised of 293 cells. In this study, we show that in addition to enhancing stroma formation, SPARC prevents fibroblast activation in 293 xenografts, suggesting that the anti-cancer effects of SPARC may be due, at least in part, to the formation of tumor stroma that is not supportive of tumor growth. In vitro, 3T3 fibroblasts cocultured with SPARC-transfected 293 cells remain negative for α-smooth muscle actin, whereas wild-type 293 cells induce fibroblast activation. Moreover, activation of 3T3 cells and primary fibroblasts by transforming growth factor β is blocked by SPARC treatment. We also demonstrate that SPARC significantly increases basic fibroblast growth factor-induced fibroblast migration in vitro, indicating that it may recruit host fibroblasts to the tumor stroma. Taken together, our results suggest that in addition to blocking angiogenesis, SPARC may inhibit tumor growth by promoting the assembly of stroma that is non-permissive for tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W1985441886,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the Tec non-receptor tyrosine kinase family that is involved in regulating B cell proliferation. To better understand the enzymatic mechanism of the Tec family of kinases, the kinetics of BTK substrate phosphorylation were characterized using a radioactive enzyme assay. We first examined whether autophosphorylation regulates BTK activity. Western blotting with a phosphospecific antibody revealed that BTK rapidly autophosphorylates at Tyr551 within its activation loop in vitro. Examination of a Y551F BTK mutant indicated that phosphorylation of Tyr551 causes a 10-fold increase in BTK activity. We then proceeded to characterize the steady state kinetic mechanism of BTK. Varying the concentrations of ATP and S1 peptide (biotin-Aca-AAAEEIY-GEI-NH2) revealed that BTK employs a ternary complex mechanism with KmATP = 84 ± 20 μm and KmS1 = 37 ± 8 μm. Inhibition studies were also performed to examine the order of substrate binding. The inhibitors ADP and staurosporine were both found to be competitive with ATP and non-competitive with S1, indicating binding of ATP and S1 to BTK is either random or ordered with ATP binding first. Negative cooperativity was also found between the S1 and ATP binding sites. Unlike ATP site inhibitors, substrate analog inhibitors did not inhibit BTK at concentrations less than 1 mm, suggesting that BTK may employ a “substrate clamping” type of kinetic mechanism whereby the substrate Kd is weaker than Km. This investigation of BTK provides the first detailed kinetic characterization of a Tec family kinase.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) 2The abbreviations used are: BTK, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; SH3, Src homology 3. is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays an essential role in B cells and other hematopoietic cell types (1Desiderio S.

The importance of BTK is evident from the fact that mutations in BTK cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a human disease that causes defects in both B cell maturation and mature B cell function (5Vihinen M.

A BTK point mutation in mice results in a similar, albeit milder, B cell deficiency known as X-linked immunodeficiency (7Rawlings D.J. Saffran D.C. Tsukada S. Largaespada D.A. Grimaldi J.C. Cohen L.

The indispensable requirement of BTK for B cell function in humans makes BTK a promising target for treatment of inflammatory diseases that involve inappropriate B cell activation. The BTK-mediated signaling events that link B cell receptor ligation to downstream signaling have been well characterized (8Dal Porto J.M. Gauld S.B. Merrell K.T. Mills D. Pugh-Bernard A.E. Cambier J. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 599-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 9Gauld S.B. Dal Porto J.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1641-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Upon ligation of the B cell receptor, Src family kinases associated with the receptor, such as Lyn, are the first enzymes activated. This activation results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues that become docking sites for other kinases including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Once recruited, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to form phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate. Formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate then recruits BTK to the plasma membrane via interaction with its pleckstrin homology domain. Upon recruitment to the membrane, BTK is activated via phosphorylation. BTK proceeds to phosphorylate several downstream substrates, including phospholipase Cγ2, causing further signal propagation. Hence, recruitment and activation of BTK (together with Lyn, Syk, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and other molecules) transduces the initial signal of B cell receptor ligation further downstream, resulting in elevation of intracellular Ca2+ followed by alterations in gene expression. In addition to its pleckstrin homology domain, BTK has several other domains that can mediate protein-protein interactions. These include a Tec homology domain, a Src homology 3 domain (SH3), a Src homology 2 domain, and a C-terminal kinase domain. The role of these other domains in BTK activation is not yet well understood. However, the domain structure of BTK is conserved among members of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases, which also includes Tec, Itk, Bmx, and Txk (10Lewis C.M. Broussard C. Czar M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Smith C.I. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Mohamed A.J. Nore B.F. Vihinen M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Each member of the Tec kinase family demonstrates a different pattern of gene expression, but all are known to play a role in signaling mechanisms involving Ca2+ as a second messenger (12Takesono A. Finkelstein L.D. Schwartzberg P.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Berg L.J. Finkelstein L.D. Lucas J.A. Schwartzberg P.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 549-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Although its role in B cell signaling is well established, the mechanism of BTK enzymatic activation and substrate phosphorylation has yet to be described. BTK has several known sites of phosphorylation including Tyr551 within the activation loop and Tyr223 within the SH3 domain (14Kurosaki T. Kurosaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15595-15598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M. Fluckiger A.C. Witte O.N.

Little quantitative information is available regarding how phosphorylation of these residues is linked to alterations in enzymatic activity. Furthermore, little is known about the mechanism of the BTK substrate phosphorylation reaction, including the kinetic parameters and the order of substrate binding. In this study, we report the first quantitative, kinetic characterization of the BTK substrate phosphorylation mechanism. A 33P-based filtration assay was first developed to monitor BTK peptide phosphorylation, and this assay was utilized to understand the significance of BTK autophosphorylation for catalysis. It was ascertained that BTK rapidly autophosphorylates at Tyr551 within the activation loop and that autophosphorylation increases BTK activity 5–10-fold. The steady state kinetic mechanism of BTK was also characterized. We found that BTK displays a sequential (i.e. ternary complex) kinetic mechanism and that modest negative communication occurs between the ATP and substrate peptide binding sites. These findings provide the first detailed kinetic description of a Tec family kinase and may be useful for characterizing inhibitors of BTK for therapeutic benefit (17Vassilev A.O. Uckun F.M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 1757-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Vassilev A.O. Tibbles H.E. DuMez D. Venkatachalam T.K. Uckun F.M. Curr. Drug Targets. 2006; 7: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—All experiments were performed with His-tagged, full-length human BTK. The BTK gene was cloned into vector PVL 1392 for expression using baculovirus. For protein expression, Sf9 cells were grown to a density of 1.0 to 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in SF900 medium at 27 °C. Cells were infected with recombinant virus at 0.5 multiplicity of infection and were harvested 3 days post-infection by centrifugation at 1000 × g. For purification of BTK, infected Sf9 cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 0.5 μl/ml Benzonase nuclease (Novagen, San Diego, CA), 1 complete protease tablet/50 ml of buffer) at 400 ml of lysis buffer/5 liters of cell pellet. Cells were then lysed with a single pass through a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corporation, Newton, MA) at <11,000 psi on ice. Lysed material was then centrifuged at 25,000 × g using a Beckman JA14 rotor, and the supernatant was retained. Material was applied to a pre-equilibrated His trap FF crude column (GE Healthcare). Columns were washed with several column volumes of Buffer A (50 mm Hepes pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm imidazole), washed again with Buffer A with 40 mm (rather than 20 mm) imidazole, then eluted with Buffer B (Buffer A with 400 mm imidazole). Fractions were pooled and applied to a Superdex 200 26/60 column pre-equilibrated in Superdex 200 buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol). Pure fractions were retained and concentrated in an Amicon stirred cell to 2.2 mg/ml final protein and stored at –80 °C. BTK Y551F was constructured using the QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and was expressed and purified in the same manner as wild type BTK. BTK Enzyme Assay—We developed an assay to monitor BTK product formation based on the incorporation of 33PO4 from [33P]ATP into a biotin-tagged substrate peptide. The peptide was subsequently isolated from unreacted [33P]ATP using streptavidin-coated beads. The standard experimental protocol was as follows. In each well of a 96-well V bottom plate (Greiner, Monroe, NC), assay buffer (8 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 8 mm glycerol 2-phosphate, 200 μm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol) was combined to 40 μl with a mixture of substrates dissolved in assay buffer such that the final concentrations were 1 μCi of [33P]ATP, 3–540 μm ATP, and 1–180 μm S1 peptide substrate (biotin-Aca-AAAEEIYGEI-NH2) (see Fig. 1). To initiate the reaction, 10 μl of BTK was added to a final concentration of 10 nm. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was then stopped by transferring 25 μl of sample to a 96-well 1.2-μm hydrophilic polyvinylidene difluoride filter plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA) containing 10% streptavidin-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline plus 50 mm EDTA. Filter plates were washed 3 times with 2 m NaCl, then twice with 2 m NaCl with 1% phosphoric acid, and then with H2O. Plates were allowed to dry and microscint-20 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) was added. The [33P]phosphoproduct was detected by a top-count scintillation counter. The enzyme activity was calculated for each data point as described. The corrected number of counts in each well was determined by subtracting the background counts (obtained from an experiment performed in the absence of S1) from the measured counts. This value was then divided by the total number of counts that were originally present in the solution (determined by spotting and counting an equivalent volume of unwashed sample on a filter plate) and multiplied by the concentration of ATP in solution to give the concentration of phosphorylated product formed. To obtain the enzyme velocity, this value was divided by the reaction time of the experiment. Time Course Experiments and Km Determination—When a time course of BTK product formation was determined, the experimental conditions were as described above with the concentration of ATP and S1 100 and 50 μm, respectively. The velocity at each enzyme concentration was determined using linear least squares methods. If BTK was preincubated with Mg2+/ATP prior to time course experiments, the preincubation conditions were assay buffer with 100 μm ATP and 50 nm BTK on ice for 15 min. For determination of the Km for ATP of BTK and BTK Y551F, the ATP concentration was varied at quarter-log scale from 3 to 540 μm. The velocity data were fit using nonlinear least squares methods to the Michaelis-Menten equation,v=Vmax[S]Km+[S](Eq.1) where v is the measured reaction velocity, Vmax is the maximal velocity, Km is the Michaelis constant, and [S] is the substrate concentration. All data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). BTK Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, 250 nm BTK or BTK Y551F was incubated in assay buffer in either the presence (+) or absence (–) of 100 μm ATP for 1 or 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by adding a 1:1 solution of loading dye plus 50 mm EDTA. After gel electrophoresis, samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blot was first blocked in TBST buffer (25 mm Tris pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% Blotto for 1 h. Samples were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBST with 5% bovine serum albumin and either 1:500 monoclonal anti-phospho-Tyr551 BTK (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) or 1:1000 polyclonal anti-BTK (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Blots were washed 3 times in TBST, incubated 1 h in TBST plus 1:8000 either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed 3 times in TBST, and developed using ECL Plus reagents (GE Healthcare). Two-substrate Analysis—For the two-substrate analysis, ATP and S1 were varied in a matrix at quarter-log intervals from 30 to 540 μm and 10 to 180 μm, respectively. The data were evaluated and analyzed using the following procedure. First, to ascertain if the data displayed the expected Michaelis-Menten behavior, double reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[S1] or 1/[ATP] were generated at constant values of ATP or S1, respectively. If the expected linearity of these plots was observed, data were assumed to be of high quality and the untransformed data were then fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1) to ascertain apparent Vmax and Km values for each substrate concentration. The entire data set of velocity values was then globally fit to equations describing either a ternary complex (i.e. sequential) or a ping-pong enzymatic mechanism. The equation for a ternary complex mechanism is given by,v=Vmax[ATP][S1][ATP][S1]+[ATP]Km,S1+[S1]Km,ATP+Km,ATPKa,S1(Eq.2) where KmS1 and Km,ATP are Michaelis constants of S1 and ATP, respectively, at saturating concentrations of the other substrate, and Ka,S1 is the association constant of S1 for free BTK. Here the α factor, a measure of communication between substrate sites, is given by the ratio of the Michaelis constant to dissociation constant as follows,α=Km,S1Ka,S1=Km,ATPKa,ATP(Eq.3) where Ka,ATP is the dissociation constant of ATP for free BTK. It can be observed from Equation 3 that the final term in the ternary complex equation involving Km,ATP and Ka,S1 can alternatively be expressed in terms of Km,S1 and Ka,ATP. The equation for the ping-pong enzymatic mechanism is given by Equation 4.v=Vmax[ATP][S1][ATP][S1]+[ATP]Km,S1+[S1]Km,ATP(Eq.4) The goodness-of-fit of the data to each of the models was evaluated by the reduced value of the absolute sum of squares. Substrate Inhibition Analysis—In experiments with BTK inhibitors, the inhibitors were preincubated with BTK for 10 min at room temperature in assay buffer prior to addition of substrates to initiate the reaction. Data sets of velocity versus substrate at different inhibitor concentrations were then analyzed individually with the Michaelis-Menten equation to ascertain an apparent Km and Vmax under each condition. Reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/S were generated at each inhibitor concentration and examined for linearity to confirm the quality of the data. The pattern of the reciprocal plot data at multiple inhibitor concentrations was then examined to provide an initial idea regarding the mechanism of inhibition. Following this initial analysis, entire data sets were globally fit using nonlinear, least-squares methods to ascertain the best fit parameters for each experiment. Data sets were globally fit to either a kinetic model of competitive inhibition,v=Vmax[S]Km(1+[1]/Ki1)+[S](Eq.5) a model of uncompetitive inhibition,v=Vmax[S]Km+[S](1+[1]/Ki2)(Eq.6) or a general model of mixed (noncompetitive) inhibition.v=Vmax[S]Km(1+[1]/Ki1)+[S](1+[1]/Ki2)([Eq.7]+) In these equations, Ki1 and Ki2 are the inhibition constants for inhibitor binding to either the enzyme alone (Ki1) or the enzyme-substrate complex (Ki2) and [I] is the inhibitor concentration. Goodness-of-fit to each model was evaluated by examining the reduced sum of squares of the entire global fit. For the staurosporine versus ATP and ADP versus ATP experiments, it was found that a competitive model (Equation 5) was sufficient to describe the data. The remaining data sets did not fit a simple competitive or simple uncompetitive model and demonstrated a significantly better fit with a mixed, noncompetitive inhibition model (Equation 7). A Lag-phase in BTK Product Formation—A kinetic assay to monitor BTK enzymatic activity was developed that involved capture of phosphorylated S1 substrate peptide on streptavidin-coated beads (see supplemental Fig. S1 and “Experimental Procedures”). The first question addressed using this assay was whether product formation was linear with time. An examination of the reaction time course with BTK revealed that product formation was not linear but rather occurred with a distinct lag phase (Figs. 2 and 3). Because a lag phase is frequently found in protein kinases that require autophosphorylation for maximal activity (19Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), it was examined whether preincubation of BTK with Mg2+/ATP prior to the enzyme assay would produce a linear time course. Following preincubation with Mg2+/ATP, product formation was indeed linear through 25 min (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the activity of the enzyme was found to be 3-fold greater following preincubation (Table 1). These findings suggest that BTK can autophosphorylate and that autophosphorylation of BTK might increase enzymatic activity.FIGURE 3BTK autophosphorylation at Tyr551 results in an increase in enzyme activity. A, Western blot of BTK using a Tyr551 phosphospecific antibody (top) and a BTK antibody (bottom) as a loading control. BTK (or BTK Y551F) was incubated in either the absence (–) or presence (+) of 100 μm ATP for either 1 or 5 min prior to Western blot analysis.

The correlation coefficients (r) are as follows: BTK No Preinc: r = 0.980; BTK Y551F No preinc: r = 0.985; BTK Y551F Preinc: r = 0.999. Solid lines represent the linear best fit to the data.

Open table in a new tab Another experiment that was conducted in this initial characterization of BTK activity was an examination of how the reaction rate varied with enzyme concentration (supplemental Fig. S2). Reaction time courses of both 10 and 30 min were collected at BTK concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 nm. The rate of BTK product formation was found to increase linearly with increasing enzyme concentration (supplemental Fig. S2). Phosphorylation of Tyr551 Enhances BTK Activity—We next sought to ascertain if autophosphorylation is responsible for enhancing BTK activity following preincubation with Mg2+/ATP. BTK has several phosphorylation sites that have been proposed to be functionally important including Tyr223 within the SH3 domain and Tyr551 within the activation loop of the kinase domain (14Kurosaki T. Kurosaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15595-15598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M. Fluckiger A.C. Witte O.N. Kinet J.P. Science. 1996; 271: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 16Park H. Wahl M.I. Afar D.E. Turck C.W. Rawlings D.J. Tam C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Immunity. 1996; 4: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Attention was focused on Tyr551. Using a phospho-Tyr551-specific antibody, BTK autophosphorylation at Tyr551 was probed using Western blotting. BTK incubated for 1 min with Mg2+/ATP reacted strongly with the antibody, whereas untreated BTK did not (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). A longer, 5-min Mg2+/ATP incubation produced a level of phosphorylation that was greater than the 1-min reaction (Fig. 3A, lane 4), indicating that the Tyr551 phosphorylation reaction is not complete at 1 min. The antibody is specific for phospho-Tyr551 because a BTK mutant, BTK Y551F, did not react to the antibody after Mg2+/ATP incubation (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Is phosphorylation of Tyr551 responsible for the enhanced BTK activity observed following preincubation with Mg2+/ATP? To address this question, we studied the BTK Y551F mutant. BTK Y551F was found to have enzymatic activity at a level 10-fold lower than preactivated BTK (Fig. 3B, Table 1). Hence, phosphorylation of Tyr551 is important to formation of the high activity state of BTK. BTK Y551F that was preincubated with Mg2+/ATP demonstrated identical enzymatic behavior as untreated BTK Y551F (Fig. 3B, Table 1). Hence, BTK Y551F does not appear to phosphorylate any residues that significantly increase its activity, suggesting that Tyr551 is the sole BTK autophosphorylation site responsible for the high activity state. To further characterize the effect of the Y551F mutation on BTK, we compared the Km for ATP of wild type BTK with that of BTK Y551F (supplemental Fig. S3A). It was found that the ATP Km values for untreated and preactivated wild type BTK are 106 ± 23 and 90 ± 15 μm, respectively. Hence, preactivation has little effect on the ATP Km. Furthermore, the Km values for untreated and preactivated BTK Y551F are 176 ± 36 and 124 ± 17 μm, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3A). These findings indicate that the decreased enzyme activity of BTK Y551F is unlikely attributable to a defect in ATP binding. We also determined that the Km for S1 peptide was essentially identical for untreated BTK, preactivated BTK, and BTK Y551F (supplemental Fig. 3B). Finally, we calculated the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) with respect to ATP of BTK and BTK Y551F (supplemental Fig. S3A). The catalytic efficiency of preactivated wild type BTK (3.7 ± 0.2 mm–1 s–1) was 10-fold greater than BTK Y551F (0.47 ± 0.03 mm–1 s–1). Two-substrate Kinetic Analysis—To better understand the catalytic mechanism of BTK, we next performed a two-substrate kinetic analysis where the initial reaction velocity was determined at varying concentrations of both substrates, S1 peptide and ATP. These experiments were undertaken for several reasons: 1) to determine the Km value for S1 as well as ATP, 2) to establish whether the reaction mechanism occurred via a ternary complex of BTK, S1, and ATP (i.e. sequential mechanism), and 3) to examine the degree of communication between the two substrate binding sites. The results of a representative experiment are shown in double-reciprocal form in Fig. 4 and in Michaelis-Menten form in supplemental Fig. S4. Fitting the entire data sets to a ternary complex model (Equation 2) as well as a ping-pong mechanism model (Equation 3) revealed that a ternary complex model provided a much better description of the data, which was expected given the intersecting line pattern in the double-reciprocal plots (Fig. 4). A pingpong mechanism, in which S1 and ATP would not bind BTK simultaneously, would have instead produced a parallel line pattern. The best fit parameters to the ternary complex model (Table 2) indicated that the Km for S1 was 37 ± 8 μm, whereas the ATP Km was 84 ± 20 μm. Vmax was 84 ± 7 nm/min, which corresponds to a turnover rate of 8.4/min. The α factor, a measure of the degree of interaction between substrate sites (21Copeland R.A. Evaluation of Enzyme Inhibitors in Drug Discovery. John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, NJ2005Google Scholar, 22Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1975Google Scholar), was found to be 3.1 ± 1.6. This value indicates a negative effect of ATP binding on S1 binding and vice versa (21Copeland R.A. Evaluation of Enzyme Inhibitors in Drug Discovery. John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, NJ2005Google Scholar, 22Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). In these experiments, it should be noted that S1 was studied at concentrations lower than 200 μm because inhibition was observed at higher substrate concentrations.TABLE 2Kinetic constants from the 2 substrate kinetic analysisSubstrateKmKaVmaxαμmnm/minATP84 ± 2026 ± 2384 ± 73.1 ± 1.6S137 ± 812 ± 1184 ± 73.1 ± 1.6 Open table in a new tab Investigation of the Steady State Kinetic Mechanism Using Substrate Analog Inhibitors—We next sought to better understand the order of binding of ATP and S1 to BTK (i.e. whether either ATP or S1 was required to bind first or whether substrate binding was random). To accomplish this, studies were undertaken that examined the mechanism of inhibition (competitive, noncompetitive, or uncompetitive) of substrate analog inhibitors. The first experiments focused on the ATP binding site using the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (Fig. 1). Here, either ATP or S1 was varied at six concentrations centered at their respective Km values, whereas staurosporine was varied from 3 to 1000 nm in half-log intervals. Following preliminary analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”), the reaction rates were fit to models of pure competitive inhibition (Equation 5), pure uncompetitive inhibition (Equation 6), or a general model of noncompetitive inhibition (Equation 7) to ascertain the mechanism of inhibition. From this analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”), staurosporine was found to show competitive inhibition versus ATP and noncompetitive inhibition versus S1. Representative data are shown in double-reciprocal form in Fig. 5 and Michealis-Menton form in supplemental Fig. S5. This analysis accurately reproduced the Km values of ATP and S1 determined in the two-substrate analysis (Table 3) and ascertained that the Ki for staurosporine is 0.036 ± 0.009 μm when ATP is the varied substrate. Varying the S1 concentration revealed that staurosporine binds 3-fold more potently to free BTK (ki1 = 0.015 ± 0.005 μm) than the BTK-S1 complex (ki2 = 0.042 ± 0.011 μm) (Table 3).

High Pax4 expression was reported in human insulinomas indicating that deregulation of the gene may be associated with tumorigenesis. We report that rat insulinoma INS-1E cells express 25-fold higher Pax4 mRNA levels than rat islets. In contrast to primary beta-cells, activin A but not betacellulin or glucose induced Pax4 mRNA levels indicating dissociation of Pax4 expression from insulinoma cell proliferation. Short hairpin RNA adenoviral constructs targeted to the paired domain or homeodomain (viPax4PD and viPax4HD) were generated. Pax4 mRNA levels were lowered by 73 and 50% in cells expressing either viPax4PD or viPax4HD. Transcript levels of the Pax4 target gene bcl-xl were reduced by 53 and 47%, whereas Pax6 and Pdx1 mRNA levels were unchanged. viPax4PD-infected cells displayed a twofold increase in spontaneous apoptosis and were more susceptible to cytokine-induced cell death. In contrast, proliferation was unaltered. RNA interference-mediated repression of insulin had no adverse effects on either Pax4 or Pdx1 expression as well as on cell replication or apoptosis. These results indicate that Pax4 is redundant for proliferation of insulinoma cells, whereas it is essential for survival through upregulation of the antiapoptotic gene bcl-xl."
https://openalex.org/W2092649712,"It is well accepted that high levels of high density lipoproteins (HDL) reduce the risk of atherosclerosis in humans. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and apoA-II are the first and second most common protein constituents of HDL. Unlike apoA-I, detailed structural models for apoA-II in HDL are not available. Here, we present a structural model of apoA-II in reconstituted HDL (rHDL) based on two well established experimental approaches: chemical cross-linking/mass spectrometry (MS) and internal reflection infrared spectroscopy. Homogeneous apoA-II rHDL were reacted with a cross-linking agent to link proximal lysine residues. Upon tryptic digestion, cross-linked peptides were identified by electrospray mass spectrometry. 14 cross-links were identified and confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Infrared spectroscopy indicated a beltlike molecular arrangement for apoA-II in which the protein helices wrap around the lipid bilayer rHDL disc. The cross-links were then evaluated on three potential belt arrangements. The data clearly refute a parallel model but support two antiparallel models, especially a “double hairpin” form.

Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the most abundant protein in HDL (at about 1 mg/ml in plasma) and clearly modulates many HDL atheroprotective functions. By contrast, there is much less known about the second most abundant protein, apoA-II. The average apoA-I/apoA-II molecular ratio in human plasma is 2:1, hinting that such an abundant protein should have important physiological functions. Murine studies with either human or mouse transgenes showed that apoA-II overexpression creates a more atherogenic lipoprotein profile (1Warden C.H. Hedrick C.C. Qiao J.H. Castellani L.W. Lusis A.J.

On the other hand, apoA-II knock-out mice exhibited dramatically decreased HDL cholesterol levels (5Allayee H. Castellani L.W. Cantor R.M. de Bruin T.W. Lusis A.J. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1262-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, these studies have not provided a clearly recognized function for apoA-II. There is evidence that a small amount of HDL in human plasma contains apoA-II as its only protein constituent (6Bekaert E.D. Alaupovic P. Knight-Gibson C. Norum R.A. Laux M.J. Ayrault-Jarrier M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, this apoA-II-only HDL (LpA-II-HDL) dominates in patients with Tangier disease, presumably compensating for the lack of apoA-I in HDL (6Bekaert E.D. Alaupovic P. Knight-Gibson C. Norum R.A. Laux M.J. Ayrault-Jarrier M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that nascent LpA-II-HDL and LpA-I-HDL may fuse to form mature HDL particles in plasma (7Clay M.A. Pyle D.H. Rye K.A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9019-9025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Hime N.J. Drew K.J. Wee K. Barter P.J. Rye K.A. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, most circulating apoA-II is present in LpA-I/A-II mixed HDL particles. There is growing evidence that one role of apoA-II may be to modulate apoA-I structure, potentially modulating HDL function. Structural studies on LpA-I/A-II particles suggest that apoA-II can cause profound conformational changes in apoA-I (9Durbin D.M. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31333-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Boucher J. Ramsamy T.A. Braschi S. Sahoo D. Neville T.A. Sparks D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). One functional study compared the hydrolysis rates of LpA-I, LpA-II, and LpA-I/A-II HDL by endothelial lipase, an important enzyme in physiological regulation of HDL levels (11Jahangiri A. Rader D.J. Marchadier D. Curtiss L.K. Bonnet D.J. Rye K.A. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 896-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The lipid hydrolysis rate was found to be highest in the mixed particles but lower in LpA-I reconstituted HDL (rHDL) and almost undetectable in LpA-II particles. The fact that apoA-II facilitates hydrolysis of lipids in mixed particles but not in A-II rHDL suggests that apoA-II can affect apoA-I conformation to stimulate endothelial lipase activation. Unfortunately, little information exists on the structural interactions between apoA-I and apoA-II, and understanding of apoA-II structure has not kept pace with recent advancements for apoA-I (12Davidson W.S. RG D.S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In human plasma, almost all apoA-II exists as a homodimer, consisting of a single S-S bridge formed across the Cys residue at position 6 of each polypeptide (13Gillard B.K. Chen Y.S. Gaubatz J.W. Massey J.B. Pownall H.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Monomeric apoA-II is 77 residues long with three assigned putative amphipathic helices. ApoA-II was recently crystallized with the lipid surrogate, β-octyl glucoside (BOG) (14Kumar M.S. Carson M. Hussain M.M. Murthy H.M.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11681-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The resulting structure indicated that the apoA-II·BOG complex was composed of eight apoA-II homodimers winding around themselves in a circular spiral-like arrangement in a head-to-tail manner. However, the relationship of this structure to physiological lipid-containing particles is not clear. ApoA-II-containing rHDL particles containing 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) have been subjected to limited proteolysis analyses (15Massey J.B. Hickson-Bick D.L. Gotto Jr., A.M. Pownall H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The data indicate that lipid-bound apoA-II is more resistant to proteolysis than the lipid-free form and has an entirely different cleavage pattern, indicating significant conformational changes. However, the conformational details of apoA-II structure in native-like HDL particles are not known. In this study, we used two independent and powerful approaches to gain structural information on apoA-II in native-like HDL particles. The results indicate that apoA-II adopts a “belt-like” orientation similar to that proposed for apoA-I and apoE (16Koppaka V. Silvestro L. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Axelsen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14541-14544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Schneeweis L.A. Koppaka V. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Axelsen P.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12525-12534Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We propose one of the first detailed models for the three-dimensional arrangement of apoA-II in rHDL particles. ApoA-II Purification and Preparation of rHDL Particles— Human apoA-II isolation and purification from normolipidemic subjects was carried out as reported previously for apoA-I (9Durbin D.M. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31333-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1562-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In brief, after HDL isolation by ultracentrifugation and delipidation, fractions corresponding to apoA-II and apoA-I were collected from a Q-Sepharose fast flow anionic exchange column. The isolated proteins were then passed over a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) prior to the particle reconstitution reaction. The Bio-bead/cholate removal method was used for the preparation of rHDL particles of apoA-II, as has been reported for apoA-I (19Davidson W.S. Hilliard G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27199-27207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20Silva R.A. Hilliard G.M. Li L. Segrest J.P. Davidson W.S.

The dimeric (i.e. physiological) form of apoA-II was used. Phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphatidylcholine (POPC; Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL) was used as the sole lipid component in particle reconstitution (Table 1). Particles that are designated as A-I-POPC-rHDL and A-II-POPC-rHDL were reconstituted with starting molar ratios of 1:78 apoA-I/POPC and 1:58 apoA-II/POPC, respectively (Table 1). The rHDL particles that were subjected to infrared spectroscopic analysis were prepared, incorporating the anionic analog of POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-l-serine), in a 1:9 molar ratio with POPC as required by the technique (Table 1). These particles, which contain 10 mol % of anionic lipids are designated as A-I-POPC/PS-rHDL and A-II-POPC/PS-rHDL and were prepared with 1:78 and 1:58 starting protein to total lipid ratios (Table 1). Once prepared, the rHDL was repurified using a tandem gel filtration column setup (Superdex 200 and Superose 6; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.8) to remove any unreacted lipids and proteins.TABLE 1Compositional analysis of rHDL particlesrHDLaIn cases where both lipids were used, the POPC/PS molar ratio is 9:1.Protein/PL (start)Protein/PL (final)bFinal protein/phospholipid (PL) ratios are based on Lowry and the phosphorus assays on purified rHDL particles (33).Hydrodynamic diameter (Å)cAverage apparent particle diameters were calculated based on migration distance on a native gel (PAGE) using three independent particle preparations.

Open table in a new tab Determination of Number of Protein Molecules per rHDL Particle—The cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodimide hydrochloride dissolved in water at 10 mg/ml (Pierce) was added to A-I-POPC-rHDL and A-II-POPC-rHDL in phosphate-buffered saline at a 1 mg/ml protein concentration. The protein/cross-linker molar ratios used were either 1:50 or 1:500. The sample solutions were incubated at 4 °C for 24 h and then subjected to PAGE analysis. Cross-linking and Tryptic Digestion of ApoA-II—Freshly prepared bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) cross-linker (6.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.8) (Pierce) was added to homogeneous A-II-POPC-rHDL with 1 mg/ml protein concentration, at a protein/BS3 molar ratio of 1:10. The BS3 solution preparation and the addition to the protein were performed within 1 min to minimize hydrolysis of the cross-linker, as was described previously (20Silva R.A. Hilliard G.M. Li L. Segrest J.P. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8600-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Silva R.A. Hilliard G.M. Fang J. Macha S. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. The samples were lipid-extracted using standard chloroform/methanol extraction procedures. The cross-linked protein was resolubilized in 3 m guanidine in 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate, dialyzed into 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM-10; Millipore Corp., Bradford, MA). The protein samples were digested using 2.5% (w/w) sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) and incubating at 37 °C for ∼12 h, followed by a second aliquot of trypsin at the same ratio for an additional 2 h. The samples (50 μg protein aliquots) were lyophilized and stored at –20 °C until used in the mass spectrometry analysis. Tryptic Peptide Analysis by Nanoliquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry—Peptide mass detection was carried out on an Applied Biosystems MDS Sciex QStar® XL mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray ion source following separation of the peptides on nanoflow high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) from LC Packings. Five pmol of the peptides generated from trypsin digestion of the cross-linked apoA-II were injected onto a C18 Trap cartridge (from LC Packings; 300-μm inner diameter and 1-mm length) and washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.1% formic acid in water flowing at 20 μl/min for 20 min. This was followed by elution of the peptides onto a C18 nanoanalytical column (75-μm inner diameter and 15-cm length from LC Packings) for separation using a gradient of acetonitrile from 5 to 40% at a flow rate of 250 nl/min over 90 min. The gradient was generated using solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile in HPLC grade water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% water, 10% isopropyl alcohol in acetonitrile). Under these conditions, most peptide masses were well separated as seen by the total ion chromatogram. The mass spectrometer was set to acquire MS and MS/MS data in an automated fashion using the information-dependent acquisition functionality of the Analyst® QS software. Each MS spectrum acquired in 1 s was followed by acquisition of four MS/MS spectra at 3 s each of the four most intense ions after satisfying the dynamic exclusion criteria. The dynamic exclusion criteria allowed for generating an exclusion list of peptide masses already fragmented for a period of 60 s with a mass tolerance of 100 ppm for match of peptide mass. Upon completion of the liquid chromatography/MS/MS run, a peptide mass list was generated using the Applied Biosystems Analyst QS 1.1 software. The mass list was subjected to analysis by GPMAW (ChemSW, Inc.) to assign putative sequence identity of individual peptides with or without a modification by a cross-linker (19Davidson W.S. Hilliard G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27199-27207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20Silva R.A. Hilliard G.M. Li L. Segrest J.P. Davidson W.S.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The putative amino acid sequence identity of the interpeptide cross-linked masses were assigned by mass mapping of experimental masses with a theoretically constructed list of all possible intra-/inter-molecularly cross-linked masses for apoA-II (19Davidson W.S.

A map was considered positive if the experimental and theoretical masses came within 10 ppm with the correct number of Lys residues available for the cross-linker formation (19Davidson W.S. Hilliard G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27199-27207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This deviation is a considerable improvement compared with our previous cut-off of 50 ppm (19Davidson W.S. Hilliard G.M. J. Biol.

Particle Characterization by CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra of rHDL particles that contained POPC only, POPC/PS, and free proteins (apoA-II and apoA-I) in 5 mm standard Tris buffer were measured on a J-810 spectrometer (Jasco, Easton, MD). A homemade demountable cell composed of two UV CaF2 windows separated by a 100-μm Teflon spacer clamped in a brass holder was used in the sample measurements. Such a set up for the cell was required due to the use of a relatively high protein concentration of 0.225 mg/ml. A scan rate of 20 nm/min and a bandwidth of 0.2 nm with a time response of 2 s were used to obtain CD spectra as an average of eight scans. The final spectra were obtained by subtracting a background spectrum of the same buffer. The fractional secondary structure of the proteins in solution was estimated from the CD spectra by use of the SELCON 3 method, which is part of the CD-Pro software package (23Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Studies—Fluorescence measurements of POPC, POPC/PS rHDL particles, and free proteins (apoA-II and apoA-I) were performed on a Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ) on 0.225-mg/ml samples in a 1-mm quartz cuvette. The excitation wavelengths were 275 nm (Tyr excitation for apoA-II) and 295 nm (Trp excitation for apoA-I). The emission spectra for both were recorded from 300 to 450 nm. In all experiments, a background spectrum of the buffer was subtracted from the corresponding sample spectra. Infrared Spectroscopy—Polarized attenuated total internal reflection Fourier transform infrared (PATIR-FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on A-II-POPC/PS-rHDL and A-I-POPC/PS-rHDL. We included an rHDL particle as a positive control that had been analyzed previously (16Koppaka V. Silvestro L. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Axelsen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14541-14544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The control particle contained apoA-I with DMPC/1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphor-l-serine). The protein/total lipid ratio for these particles (A-II-DMPC/PS-rHDL) was 1:78 with 10% 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphor-l-serine) in the lipid mixture as for other particles that were subjected to PATIR-FTIR analysis. The PATIR-FTIR measurements were carried out using a Bio-Rad FTS-6000 spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector. The instrument was interfaced to a lipid film balance by means of a horizontal 50 × 10 × 2-mm germanium crystal internal reflection element. A lipid monolayer composed of 80 mol % DMPC and 20 mol % 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphor-l-serine) was spread at room temperature at the air-water interface in the film balance and applied flat onto the crystal. Adsorption of the HDL particles and their horizontal orientation was facilitated by Ca2+ ions in the buffer bridging the anionic lipid in the monolayer (20 mol %) and in the complexes (10 mol %) (16Koppaka V. Silvestro L. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Axelsen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14541-14544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). All spectra were collected in the rapid scan mode as 512 co-added interferograms, with a resolution of 2 cm–1, scanning speed of 20 MHz, triangular apodization, and one level of zero filling. Base-line spectra were recorded immediately prior to the addition of 20 μg of protein in the form of lipoprotein complexes to the continuously stirred buffer subphase composed of 30 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, in D2O at pD 7.4. From the polarized absorption spectra, dichroic ratios were evaluated using integrated areas of characteristic absorption bands as determined by linked analysis of sets of parallel and perpendicular spectra. These dichroic ratios were then converted to order parameters S(Rz) as described (16Koppaka V. Silvestro L. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Axelsen P.H. J. Biol.

An order parameter of S = 1.0 indicates a uniform orientation perpendicular to the membrane surface, whereas a value of S =–0.5 indicates a uniform orientation parallel to the membrane.

Generation and Characterization of A-II-POPC-rHDL Particles—We hypothesized that apoA-II, like apoA-I, adopts a specific conformation in discoidal rHDL and therefore exhibits sequence-specific interactions with itself and with other apoA-II molecules on the particle (19Davidson W.S.

We elected to generate apoA-II-containing rHDL particles that contain POPC, a synthetic lipid with an acyl chain composition commonly found in cellular membranes and lipoproteins. At a starting ratio of 58 mol of POPC to 1 mol of apoA-II, we were able to reconstitute A-II-POPC-rHDL that exhibited a slightly larger hydrodynamic diameter than previously well characterized A-I-POPC-rHDL (Fig. 1A) (20Silva R.A.

Despite our best efforts, we were unable to eliminate a minor secondary band, which ran a few Å smaller than the major band at ∼102 Å. The number of protein molecules per particle was determined by cross-linking with 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride, which can bridge an acidic amino acid (Asp or Glu) with a Lys residue (28Pliszka B.

When cross-linked at a high ratio of protein to 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride, the A-II-POPC-rHDL sample exhibited a single band of ∼70 kDa corresponding to the mass of four dimeric apoA-II molecules (Fig. 2).

We refer to each polypeptide constituent of this molecule as a “strand.” were apparent, indicating incomplete cross-linking. No other condition yielded molecular weight bands higher than four cross-linked molecules of apoA-II. A similar analysis for an A-I-POPC-rHDL particle yielded the expected 2 molecules of apoA-I per particle (Fig. 2). Component analysis on the rHDL (after isolation from unreacted protein and lipid) indicated that the A-II-POPC-rHDL contained ∼190 POPC molecules/particle compared with ∼156 POPC molecules for A-I-POPC-rHDL (Table 1). The increased lipid in the apoA-II particle probably accounts for its larger apparent diameter (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 2SDS-PAGE analysis of cross-linked A-I-POPC-rHDL and A-II-POPC-rHDL particles. The number of protein molecules per rHDL particle was determined by cross-linking the particles with 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride in a 1:50 protein/cross-linker ratio (lanes 1 and 4) and at a 1:500 ratio (lanes 2 and 5).

A molar ratio of 1:10 protein/cross-linker was used based on previous work demonstrating that linkages formed under these conditions occur within a single rHDL particle but not between two rHDL particles (19Davidson W.S.

In theory, there can be four types of cross-links for apoA-II, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Type I intrapeptide cross-links occur between two Lys residues within the same tryptic peptide. Type II joins two peptides from the same apoA-II monomer but separated by at least one tryptic cleavage site. Type III joins two peptides within the same dimeric apoA-II molecule but on different strands. Type IV joins two peptides from different apoA-II molecules. We identified five Type I intrapeptide cross-links (Table 2"

Recently, it has been found that amyloid fibrils are, in general, amenable to the magic angle-spinning solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance methods, providing a general view of the atomic level structure in which β-strands are stacked in a parallel and registered manner (4Ritter C.

Although the efficient fibrillation of intact β2-m requires seeding, K3 forms fibrils spontaneously. Furthermore, K3 formed two types of fibrils (known as f218 and f210) differing in the amounts of β-sheet and morphology (18Yamaguchi K. Takahashi S. Kawai T. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 952-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Yamaguchi K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The f210 fibrils are remarkably long with a thin and homogeneous morphology, whereas the f218 fibrils are short and thick and apparently heterogeneous. f210 fibrils may provide an excellent model with which to study the rheology of amyloid fibrils. In this paper, we have shown that circular dichroism (CD) and linear dichroism (LD) are useful for detecting the flow-induced alignment fibrils. By analyzing the flow-induced LD, we address the structure and viscoelastic properties of amyloid fibrils. Proteins and Amyloid Fibrils—Recombinant human β2-m was expressed and purified using the Escherichia coli expression system as described previously (20Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). K3 was obtained by digestion of β2-m with lysyl endopeptidase (Achromobacter protease I) as reported previously (16Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). β2-m amyloid fibrils were formed by the fibril extension method as reported previously (20Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), in which the fragmented fibrils were extended by the monomeric proteins. First, a solution of monomeric β2-m at 25 μm (0.3 mg ml-1) in 50 mm glycine buffer (pH 2.5) and 100 mm NaCl was prepared, and then β2-m seeds (sonicated amyloid fibrils) were added to the monomeric solution to a final concentration of 0.42 μm (5 μg ml-1). Hereafter, the concentration of seeds or fibrils is expressed in terms of molar concentration of monomers, because the size of seeds or fibrils was difficult to define. This solution was incubated overnight at 37 °C. f210 and f218 fibrils were formed by the fibril extension method established by Yamaguchi et al. (18Yamaguchi K. Takahashi S. Kawai T. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 952-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To make f210 fibrils, K3 peptide was first dissolved in 10 mm NaOH at 1 mm and then diluted 10-fold in 20% (v/v) 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and 11 mm HCl to a concentration of 100 μm. The final concentration of HCl was adjusted to 10 mm, 1 mm NaCl was produced by neutralization, and f210 seeds were added to the monomeric solution to a final concentration of 3 μm (7.5 μgml-1). To make f218 fibrils, K3 peptide was dissolved directly in 20% (v/v) 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and 10 mm HCl at a final concentration of K3 of 100 μm without seeds. The peptide solutions were incubated overnight at 25 °C. Amyloid fibrils were extended without agitation, and the conformational change was monitored by far-UV CD spectroscopy. CD and LD Measurements—Standard CD measurements without flow were performed with a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C. Far-UV CD spectra were measured using a cell with a light path of 1 mm, and the concentration of amyloid fibrils was 25 μm. The results were expressed as the mean residue ellipticity (θ) (deg cm2 dmol-1). To perform the CD measurements under flow, we installed a quartz flow cell with a light path of 2 mm (Fig. 1A). Temperature was not controlled, and the measurements were at room temperature. The concentrations of amyloid fibrils were 5.1 and 103 μm for the far- and near-UV CD measurements, respectively. Using a tubing pump, the fibril solution was circulated at a flow rate of 1.16 ml min-1 during the measurements. In the vertical cell setting, the solution was flowed from bottom to top. We confirmed that the flow-induced signals of K3 fibrils are not caused by the high photomultiplier voltage under flow (data not shown). We also confirmed that globular monomer proteins do not exhibit the flow-induced signal change (see supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, flow-induced signals were observed with other CD spectropolarimeters (data not shown), confirming that the observation was not caused by an artifact of the machine's calibration. LD measurements were performed with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with an LD mode, using a quartz flow cell with a light path of 2 mm at room temperature (Fig. 1A). In the far-UV LD measurements, the concentrations of f210, f218, and β2-m fibrils were 5.1, 5.0, and 2.5 μm, respectively. In the near-UV LD measurements, the concentrations of f210, f218, and β2-m fibrils were 103, 100, and 25 μm, respectively. The results were expressed as the molar absorption coefficient ϵ (cm-1 m-1). Electron and Atomic Force Microscopy Measurements—The sample solutions were diluted 20-fold with distilled water. These diluted samples were spread on copper grids (400 mesh) covered by carbon-coated collodion film and allowed to stand for 1 min. After the removal of excess solution with filter paper, the grids were negatively stained with a 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution. After staining for 1 min, the solution on the grids was removed with filter paper and dried. These samples were examined with a JEOL-100CX transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Atomic force microscopy images were obtained using a NanoScope IIIa (Digital Instruments/Veeco) as described previously (18Yamaguchi K. Takahashi S. Kawai T. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 952-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ultrasonication Analysis—Fragmentation of amyloid fibrils was carried out by ultrasonicating 1-ml aliquots of a 103 μm f210 fibril stock solution using a Microson sonicator (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY) at an intensity level of 2 and with repeated 20-s pulses on ice. The number of pulses was 0, 1, 10, 20, and 30. Sedimentation velocity measurements of fragmented fibrils were performed with a Beckman-Coulter Optima XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge as described previously (21Kihara M. Chatani E. Sakai M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). CD Measurement of f210 Fibrils under Flow—When we measured the far- and near-UV CD spectra of f210 fibrils, we noticed that the signal intensities fluctuated under certain conditions, suggesting that the flow critically affects the spectra. To characterize the effects of the flow, we measured the CD spectra under flow by installing a flow cell into the spectropolarimeter (Fig. 1A). Without a flow, f210 fibrils exhibited a CD spectrum with a minimum of ∼210 nm and strong negative ellipticity, as was reported previously (18Yamaguchi K. Takahashi S. Kawai T. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 952-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), probably reflecting the highly ordered cross-β structure (Fig. 1B). When the solution was flowed vertically (β = 90°), the spectrum changed to that with a maximum of ∼196 nm and an immense positive ellipticity. In contrast, when f210 fibrils were flowed horizontally (β = 0°), the spectrum shifted to the opposite direction (Fig. 1B). The difference spectrum obtained by subtracting the spectrum without flow indicated that the induced CDs have the same intensity but with the opposite sign (Fig. 1D). A flow-induced CD signal was also observed in the near-UV region (Fig. 1C). Without flow, the f210 fibrils, containing Tyr26, Phe22, and Phe30 as aromatic groups, exhibited a unique near-UV spectrum (18Yamaguchi K. Takahashi S. Kawai T. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 952-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). When the solution was flowed vertically, the CD spectrum exhibited two positive peaks at 279 and 285.5 nm with strong ellipticities (Fig. 1C). When the solution was flowed horizontally, two negative peaks were observed, exactly the mirror image of the spectrum under vertical flow (Fig. 1E). We confirmed that these flow-induced signals were not caused by an artifact of the machine's calibration (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Fig. S1). It is likely that the flow-induced LD contributed to the apparent CD signals (22Davidsson Å. Nordén B. Seth S. Chemical Physics Letters. 1980; 70: 313-315Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). LD Measurements of f210 Fibrils under Flow—LD had been used to investigate the orientation of absorbing chromophores within elongated molecules (23Marrington R. Seymour M. Rodger A.

Although chiral compounds generate CD signals, oriented compounds either intrinsically or during the measurements often exhibit LD signals. LD is defined by the difference in absorption of linearly polarized lights in parallel (A|) and perpendicular (A⊥) to an orientation axis, given by the following.LD=A∥-A⊥(Eq.1) With the machine we used, the plane of parallel polarized light was set to be horizontal, and that of perpendicularly polarized light was vertical (Fig. 1A). Thus, when the flow induced the alignment of fibrils in line with the direction of the flow, the sign of the LD signal was expected to be converted when the direction of flow was rotated by 90°. We performed the far-UV LD measurements with the rotation of the flow cell every 45° (Fig. 2, A and C). When the solution was flowed horizontally (β = 0°), an LD spectrum with a maximum at 198.5 nm was observed. When the solution was flowed vertically (β = 90°), a spectrum with a minimum at 198.5 nm was observed. When the solution was flowed in oblique directions (β = 45 or 135°), no significant spectrum was obtained; the absorption of polarized light parallel to an orientation axis was the same as that of perpendicularly polarized light, leading to the compensated LD spectrum. As for near-UV LD spectra, the sign of the LD signal was converted from positive to negative when the direction of flow was rotated by 90° (Fig. 2B), the same as the far-UV LD. These results are consistent with Equation 1, indicating that the flow-induced CD signals were indeed caused by the aligned f210 fibrils. In the subsequent LD experiments, we used the flow in the vertical direction (β = 90°), because it was easier to make a stable flow. We then examined the dependence of LD signals on the flow rate (Fig. 2F). With an increase of the flow rate, the LD signal at 198.5 nm increased up to 1 ml min-1 and then gradually decreased. Considering this flow rate dependence, we performed the CD and LD measurements at a flow rate of 1.2 ml min-1, where the LD signal was maximal. The largest molar absorption coefficient was ∼50–60 × 103 cm-1 m-1 on average. However, we observed significant variation (∼30–80 × 103 cm-1 m-1) depending on fibril preparations, suggesting that the length of fibrils, which was difficult to control precisely, critically affects the LD amplitude (see below). The results indicated that, although the flow induces the alignment of f210 fibrils and consequently LD, it saturates at a certain flow rate, and moreover, a flow rate that is too high decreases LD. Probably, at high flow rates, the breaking of fibrils by shearing forces or induction of turbulence decreased the degree of alignment. f210 fibrils often exhibited a relatively small LD (∼10 × 103 cm-1 m-1) even without flow, suggesting that f210 fibrils tended to align when the solution was introduced into the flow cell with a 2-mm light path (Fig. 2F). Orientation of Functional Groups in Fibrils—The far-UV absorption spectrum of f210 fibrils is composed of two amide chromophores at 198 and 216 nm, which were fitted by Gaussian functions (supplemental Fig. S2). The chromophores at 198 and 216 nm were assigned to a net amide π-π* transition moment and net n-π* transition moment of carbonyl groups of the backbone, respectively (24Dafforn T.R. Rajendra J.

For each peptide bond, the electric dipole transition moment of the amide π-π* transition (μπ-π*) is directed approximately along the NO direction, whereas the magnetic dipole transition moment of the amide n-π* transition (mn-π*) is directed along the carbonyl bond (Fig. 2G) (29Woody R.W. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 25-67Crossref Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the β-sheet, net π-π* transition moments of carbonyl groups at 198 nm are known to be parallel to the C=O bond axis or perpendicular to β-strands in the plane of the β-sheet (24Dafforn T.R.

In contrast, net n-π* transition moments are not fixed and of low intensity (24Dafforn T.R. Rajendra J. Halsall D.J. Serpell L.C. Rodger A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 404-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Dafforn T.R. Rodger A. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The negative sign of the LD band at 198.5 nm for the vertical flow (Fig. 2A, β = 90°) means that perpendicularly polarized light is absorbed more than parallel polarized light (A| < A⊥). Thus, the observed negative LD at 198 nm indicates that net π-π* transition moments are aligned in line with the direction of flow, in agreement with the expectation that the elongated fibrils are oriented to the direction of flow. A similar suggestion was also reported based on the flow-induced far-UV LD spectrum of amyloid β-(1–42) (24Dafforn T.R. Rajendra J. Halsall D.J. Serpell L.C. Rodger A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 404-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Dafforn T.R. Rodger A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A quantitative estimate of the orientation of the fibrils can be made by reduced LD (LDr),LDr=LDA=32S(3cos2α-1)(Eq.2) where A is the absorption of the fibrils, S is the orientation factor that defines the efficiency of the fibril orientation (S = 1 and 0 for perfect and random orientations, respectively), and α is the angle that the transition moment makes with the orientation axis (23Marrington R.

The reduced LD spectrum indicated a dominant peak at 198.5 nm with LDr =-0.28 (Fig. 2D). Although α should be near to 0°, the exact value is unknown. Thus, we plotted the correlation between S and α (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that the orientation factor of f210 fibrils is ∼0.09–0.1. A similar discussion can be applied to the near-UV LD. Although the Phe side chain also has two transition moments at 210 and 260 nm, the LDr spectrum with two minima at 279 and 285 nm suggests that the Lb transition moment of Tyr26 contributes most to the observed LDr (Fig. 2E). The observed negative LDr means that perpendicularly polarized light is absorbed by the Lb transition moment more than parallel polarized light (A| < A⊥). Because the direction of flow is vertical, the overall Lb transition moment is polarized parallel to the direction of the fibril axis as illustrated in Fig. 2H. To address the side chain conformation, the relation between S and α at LDr =-0.3 was plotted, as was the case of the main chain net π-π* transition moment (supplemental Fig. S3). Although we can define neither S nor α values, it is reasonable to expect that the orientation factor S of the side chain is smaller than those of the π-π* transition moment of carbonyl groups (S = 0.09∼0.1), suggesting that α of the Lb transition moment is in the region of α < 20° (supplemental Fig. S3). Correlation between the Flow-induced Alignment and Length of Fibrils—We found that ultrasonication treatment decreases the LD signal (Fig. 3A). For the samples with 20 and 30 pulses of ultrasonication (20 s for each pulse), no LD signal was detected. Sedimentation velocity measurements showed that, although the original f210 fibrils have a broad distribution of the sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) above 35, ultrasonication pulses break the fibrils, producing fragmented short fibrils without producing monomers (data not shown). Electron microscopy images confirmed the ultrasonication-dependent fragmentation, leading to fibrils of ∼500 nm (Fig. 3, C–E). On the other hand, the CD spectrum was independent of ultrasonication pulses showing that the total amount of β-sheet did not depend on the treatment (Fig. 3B). In Equation 2, because α is invariable, the orientation factor S decreases as fragmentation proceeds. Thus, as with other rod-like polymers, flow-induced orientation critically depends on fibril length. From electron microscopy images, it is assumed that a length of >500 nm is required to exhibit the flow-induced alignment and, consequently, the LD signal. Intriguingly, in a study with DNA, it was reported that the order of 1000 base pairs (∼340 nm in length, the same as the length of K3 fibrils) is required to exhibit significant flow LD (27Rodger A. Nordén B. Circular Dichroism and Linear Dichroism. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar). To examine the generality of the flow-induced alignment, we measured the LD in flow of β2-m mature fibrils at pH 2.5 and f218 fibrils in 20% (v/v) 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol at pH ∼2.0. These fibrils showed far-UV CD spectra typical of a β structure (Fig. 4A). Although the LD signal of β2-m fibrils was stronger than that of f218 fibrils, it was much weaker than that of f210 fibrils in both far- and near-UV regions (Fig. 4, B and C). We observed no flow-induced CD signal for these samples. In apparent length, the order of fibrils is f210 fibrils > β2-m fibrils > f218 fibrils (Fig. 4, D–F), confirming that the length is a dominant factor determining the flow-induced LD. Although the conditions are non-physiological, the results presented here indicate that LD will become a unique approach to addressing the rheological and structural features of amyloid fibrils. The responses of fibrils to the flow should depend on morphology, including length, width, viscoelastic properties, and interfibrillar interactions. Clarifying these features will be important for understanding how in vivo the intrinsically linear amyloid fibrils interact with each other to eventually form characteristic and organized lateral or radial clusters such as senile amyloid plaques (1Dobson C.M.

The sensitivity of flow-induced LD or CD was not high for relatively short and thick fibrils such as β2-m mature fibrils and K3 f218 fibrils. However, it will be possible to increase the sensitivity by tuning the flow cell (24Dafforn T.R. Rajendra J. Halsall D.J. Serpell L.C. Rodger A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 404-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or manipulating the solvent conditions, and then, either with CD or LD, the flow-induced alignment might become an important method for sensitively detecting and characterizing amyloid fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W2152573097,"Benzene polyphosphates containing phosphate groups on one ring are Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase inhibitors when evaluated against type-I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase. A novel biphenyl derivative, biphenyl 2,3',4,5',6-pentakisphosphate, with five phosphate groups on two rings was synthesized: It inhibited the activity of two inositol 5-phosphatases: type I and SHIP2 with Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as substrate. The inhibition was competitive with respect to the substrate. IC50 value measured in rat hepatocytes, which contains the native Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase, was in the micromolar range at 1.0 microM Ins(1,4,5)P3 as substrate. Biphenyl 2,3',4,5',6-pentakisphosphate did not affect the activity of Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase A in the 5-100 microM range. Surprisingly, experimental evidence supports an effect of biphenyl 2,3',4,5',6-pentakisphosphate at the level of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. Finally, when injected into rat hepatocytes, the analog affected the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in a positive or negative way depending on its concentration. At very high concentrations of the analog, Ca2+ oscillations were even suppressed. These data were interpreted as a dual effect of the biphenyl 2,3',4,5',6-pentakisphosphate on cytosolic [Ca2+] increases: an activation effect through an increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 level via Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase inhibition and an inhibitory effect, which was exerted directly on the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. Thus, our data show for the first time that the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in response to a Ca2+-mobilizing agonist can be controlled by inhibitors of type-I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W2071704623,"The amplified region of chromosome 19q13.1-13.2 has been associated with several cancers. The well-characterized oncogene AKT2 is located in this amplicon. Two members of the same gene family (SERTAD1 and SERTAD3) are also located within this region. We report herein the genomic structure and potential functions of SERTAD3. SERTAD3 has two transcript variants with short mRNA half-lives, and one of the variants is tightly regulated throughout G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. Overexpression of SERTAD3 induces cell transformation in vitro and tumor formation in mice, whereas inhibition of SERTAD3 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) results in a reduction in cell growth rate. Furthermore, luciferase assays based on E2F-1 binding indicate that SERTAD3 increases the activity of E2F, which is reduced by inhibition of SERTAD3 by siRNA. Together, our data support that SERTAD3 contributes to oncogenesis, at least in part, via an E2F-dependent mechanism."

The S configuration, (S,S)-AdoMet, is the only form that is produced enzymatically as well as the only form used in almost all biological methylation reactions. Under physiological conditions, however, the sulfonium ion can spontaneously racemize to the R form, producing (R,S)-AdoMet. As of yet, (R,S)-AdoMet has no known physiological function and may inhibit cellular reactions. In this study, we found two Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzymes that are capable of recognizing (R,S)-AdoMet and using it to methylate homocysteine to form methionine. These enzymes are the products of the SAM4 and MHT1 genes, identified previously as homocysteine methyltransferases dependent upon AdoMet and S-methylmethionine, respectively. We found here that Sam4 recognizes both (S,S)- and (R,S)-AdoMet, but that its activity is much higher with the R,S form.

Of the large number of metabolites that are produced and used by biological systems, many are unstable, degrading into forms that may have reduced function or that may be toxic. One pathway of small molecule degradation and cellular recognition has been described recently. Here, trans-aconitate formed spontaneously from the citric acid cycle intermediate cis-aconitate results in the inhibition of at least two steps in the cycle (7Lauble H. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 437-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Rebholz K.L. Northrop D.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). trans-Aconitate is then recognized by a specific yeast methyltransferase; the methyl ester formed has reduced inhibitory properties (9Cai H.

Second to ATP, it is probably the most widely used cofactor in nature (12Lu S.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 13Cantoni G.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 435-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Not only does it serve as the primary methyl donor, but it also functions as an amino, adenosyl, and ribosyl donor (11Fontecave M. Atta M. Mulliez E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 243-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). It also plays a role in the formation of adenosyl radicals (14Jarrett J.T. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and as a precursor of polyamines (15Urdiales J.L. Medina M.A. Sanchez-Jimenez F. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2001; 13: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). AdoMet has been shown to be unstable in cells, forming a variety of degradation products. Internal cyclization can form homoserine lactone and 5′-methylthioadenosine; hydrolysis at the glycosidic bond can form adenine and S-pentosylmethionine; and racemization at the sulfonium ion can form the R,S diastereomer (16Wu S.E. Huskey W.P. Borchardt R.T. Schowen R.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2828-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Creason G.L. Madison J.T. Thompson J.F.

We have been particularly interested in this latter reaction because pathways for the utilization or metabolism of this diastereomer have not been described. As biosynthesized, AdoMet is in the S,S configuration, where the first S corresponds to the stereochemistry at the sulfonium ion and the second to that at the α-carbon (19Cornforth J.W. Reichard S.A.

Soc. 1959; 81: 3975-3980Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The S,S form appears to be the biologically active species (21Cannon L.M. Butler F.N. Wan W. Zhou Z.S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Bentley R. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2005; 34: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and a number of methyltransferases have been shown to use it exclusively (20De La Haba G. Jamieson G.A. Mudd S.H. Richards H.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959; 81: 3975-3980Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Cannon L.M. Butler F.N. Wan W. Zhou Z.S. Anal.

However, the instability of the sulfonium center results in spontaneous racemization under biological conditions to form (R,S)-AdoMet (Fig. 1) (20De La Haba G. Jamieson G.A. Mudd S.H. Richards H.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959; 81: 3975-3980Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). If only the S,S form is used, and the R,S form is constantly produced by racemization, the levels of biologically inactive (R,S)-AdoMet should build up over time in cells. This material may not only take up precious cell space, but may also be toxic (24Borchardt R.T. Wu Y.S. J. Med. Chem. 1976; 19: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Beaudouin C. Haurat G. Laffitte J.A. Renaud B. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 928-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The racemization of AdoMet may also be a factor in its pharmacology when used as a nutritional supplement (SAMe) (26Bottiglieri T. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 76: 1151S-1157SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). These preparations generally contain from 20 to 40% of the R,S form (27Hanna G.M. Pharmazie. 2004; 59: 251-256PubMed Google Scholar), and there is uncertainty at present about the relative contribution of each form to the therapeutic effect and whether there may be any toxicity associated with the R,S form. There is some indirect evidence to suggest that (R,S)-AdoMet can be metabolized in cells. Based on steady-state calculations for cells at physiological temperature and pH, the ratio of (R,S)- to (S,S)-AdoMet has been calculated as 19:81 (18Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4444-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the R,S form is undetectable in soybean extracts (17Creason G.L. Madison J.T. Thompson J.F. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 1151-1155Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the R,S/S,S ratio in mouse liver (18Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4444-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and rat brain (25Beaudouin C. Haurat G. Laffitte J.A. Renaud B. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 928-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) has been measured as 3:97. Thus, there appears to be a mechanism(s) that keeps the intracellular (R,S)-AdoMet levels low. We were thus interested in an older report that suggested that (R,S)-AdoMet might be utilized by a yeast methyltransferase (23Zappia V. Zydek-Cwick C.R. Schlenk F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 178: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this work, homocysteine methyltransferase activity was observed at twice the rate when an S,S/R,S mixture of AdoMet was used compared with that seen with the S,S form at an equal total concentration (23Zappia V. Zydek-Cwick C.R. Schlenk F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 178: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that there are at least two homocysteine methyltransferase enzymes present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (28Neuhierl B. Thanbichler M. Lottspeich F. Bock A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5407-5414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 29Thomas D. Becker A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40718-40724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These are encoded by the SAM4 and MHT1 genes and utilize AdoMet and S-methylmethionine, respectively, as methyl donors (29Thomas D. Becker A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40718-40724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether either of these enzymes was responsible for the utilization of (R,S)-AdoMet seen initially (23Zappia V. Zydek-Cwick C.R. Schlenk F. Biochim. Biophys.

Homocysteine methyltransferases function to make methionine, which is then the precursor of AdoMet. The source of the methyl group can be N5-methyltetrahydrofolate, S-methylmethionine, or betaine (12Lu S.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 29Thomas D. Becker A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Biol.

If AdoMet itself were used as the donor, the reaction would appear to be a futile cycle, resulting in the hydrolysis of 3 ATP eq (Fig. 2). However, such a “futile cycle” could be justified if the AdoMet-dependent homocysteine methyltransferase utilized the R,S form rather than the S,S form. In this scenario, the inactive R,S form, resulting from the unwanted racemization of the S,S form, would be converted to methionine, which could in turn be converted to the active S,S form of AdoMet. Such a mechanism could explain the low cellular levels of (R,S)-AdoMet observed (17Creason G.L. Madison J.T. Thompson J.F. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 1151-1155Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 18Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4444-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Beaudouin C. Haurat G.

In this work, we demonstrate that Sam4 and Mht1 in S. cerevisiae are both in fact capable of using (R,S)-AdoMet as a methyl donor. Sam4 has a higher specificity for (R,S)- than for (S,S)-AdoMet, and Mht1 uses (R,S)-AdoMet in exclusion of the S,S form. Thus, these two enzymes may work to prevent the accumulation of (R,S)-AdoMet within cells. Preparation and Purification of (R,S)- and (S,S)-[3H]AdoMet— S-Adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (referred to throughout as [3H]AdoMet; 1 mCi/ml, 79.0 Ci/mmol, in dilute HCl/ethanol (9:1, v/v) at pH 2–2.5; GE Healthcare) was diluted 10-fold in 0.1 m HCl and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was incubated for 8 days at 37 °C, resulting in an R,S-enriched [3H]AdoMet sample, whereas the other was kept at –80 °C. An aliquot (100 μl) of each preparation was then fractionated with a cationexchange HPLC column (Whatman Partisil SCX, 10-μm bead diameter, 4.6 mm, inner diameter, × 250 mm) using a method similar to that described previously (18Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4444-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, the column was equilibrated and eluted with 80% buffer A (0.7 ml of concentrated NH4OH added to 1000 ml of 20% acetonitrile in H2O and brought to pH 3.0 with 88% acetic acid) and 20% buffer B (buffer A adjusted to 50 mm (NH4)2SO4 and then to pH 3.0 with concentrated sulfuric acid). The column was eluted at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 254 nm, and 500-μl fractions were collected. An aliquot (50 μl) of each fraction was mixed with 2 ml of fluor (Safety-Solve, Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL) to measure radioactivity. The fractions corresponding to the R,S peak of the incubated sample and to the S,S peak of the non-incubated sample were each pooled, divided into 200-μl aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. [3H]AdoMet concentrations were calculated using a specific activity of 79,000 cpm/pmol provided by the manufacturer. NMR Analysis of AdoMet Stereochemistry—AdoMet (chloride salt; purity of ∼70% with 1 mol/mol H2O and 4.6% methanol; Sigma) was dissolved in 0.1 m HCl. One aliquot was incubated at 37 °C for 160 h, whereas the other was not incubated. Both were then dried and dissolved in D2O to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. The 1H NMR spectrum for 500 μl of each sample was determined using a Bruker ARX400 spectrometer operating at 400.13 MHz as described previously (27Hanna G.M. Pharmazie. 2004; 59: 251-256PubMed Google Scholar). Isoaspartyl Protein Methyltransferase Assay—Human recombinant l-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase (0.13 μg, specific activity of 20,990 pmol/min/mg of protein) was incubated with 0.016 pmol of either (R,S)- or (S,S)-[3H]AdoMet in the presence or absence of 3.5 nmol of the isoaspartyl-containing peptide KASA(isoD)LAKY (California Peptide Research, Inc., Napa, CA). The reaction was buffered in 50 mm BisTris-HCl (pH 6.4) in a final volume of 40 μl. After incubation for 45 min at 37 °C, methylation of the peptide was determined as described previously (30Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19396-19406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast Strains—Table 1 lists the yeast strains used in this study. The sam4– and mht1– single knock-out mutant strains were generated by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/yeast_deletion_project/available.html) and purchased from Invitrogen. The sam4–/ mht1– double knock-out strain was created by mating the MATα strain of sam4– with the MATa strain of mht1– and selecting for cells able to grow on lysine- and methionine-deficient plates. The resulting diploid strain was induced to sporulate, and the haploid spores containing both gene deletions were identified by screening on kanamycin plates for the non-parental ditype. The deletion of both the SAM4 and MHT1 genes was confirmed by PCR analysis using flanking TAG1 and TAG2 primers (www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/yeast_deletion_project/PCR_strategy.html).TABLE 1Yeast strainsStrainGenotypeSourceBY4741MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0SGDPaStrains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Invitrogen.mht1- (BY4741)BY4741, Δyll062c::KanrSGDPaStrains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Invitrogen.BY4742MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0SGDPaStrains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Invitrogen.sam4- (BY4742)BY4742, Δypl273w::KanrSGDPaStrains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Invitrogen.mht1- (BY4742)BY4742, Δyll062c::KanrSGDPaStrains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Invitrogen.sam4-/mht1-MATα Δypl273w::Kanr Δyll062c::Kanr LYS+ MET+This studya Strains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Invitrogen.

Briefly, a single colony was inoculated in 6 ml of YPD medium (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose) and incubated overnight with shaking at 30 °C. One ml of the culture was then transferred to 250 ml of YPD medium and grown to an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm. Cells were pelleted at 5000 × g for 5 min and washed twice with 5 ml of water. The cell pellet volume was estimated, and 2 volumes of lysis buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1 volume of baked zirconium beads (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) were added. Cells were then lysed via six cycles of alternate 1-min periods of vortexing and incubating on ice. The lysate was removed from the beads and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then divided into aliquots of 500 μl and kept at –80 °C until needed. The total protein concentration for each lysate was determined using the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after precipitation in 10% trichloroacetic acid and using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Arabidopsis seed extract prepared as described previously (33Villa S.T. Xu Q. Downie A.B. Clarke S.G. Physiol.

Homocysteine Methyltransferase Assays—A modification of the method of Shapiro et al. (37Shapiro S.K. Yphantis D.A. Almenas A. J. Biol.

Unless indicated otherwise, 0.2 pmol of purified (R,S)- or (S,S)-[3H]AdoMet was incubated with or without the specified amount of dl-homocysteine (Sigma) in 0.15 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) with ∼0.1 mg of extract protein in a total volume of 200 μl. The temperature of incubation was dependent on the type of extract used: 37 °C for mouse; 30 °C for yeast, Drosophila and C. elegans; and 40 °C for Arabidopsis. At the end of each reaction incubation, [3H]methionine was separated from [3H]AdoMet by cation-exchange chromatography on Dowex 50WX8-400 columns (0.5 cm, inner diameter, × 2 cm; Sigma). Prior to use, the Dowex resin was washed alternately with 1 m HCl and 1 m NaOH, each step being separated by an H2O wash. This washing sequence was repeated a second time, after which the resin was finally equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). After the reaction mixtures were allowed to flow through the columns, the columns were eluted with 2 ml of H2O, and the total effluent was collected in scintillation vials, mixed with 15 ml of Safety-Solve fluor, and counted on a Beckman LS6500 counter. The amount of [3H]methionine produced was calculated from this radioactivity using a specific activity of 79,000 cpm/pmol. Preparation of (R,S)- and (S,S)-[3H]AdoMet—In preparing (R,S)-AdoMet, we took advantage of the fact that (S,S)-AdoMet can spontaneously racemize to the R,S form in vitro under physiological conditions to produce an S,S/R,S mixture that is roughly 50:50 (16Wu S.E.

In Fig. 3, we compare the 1H NMR spectra of a commercial preparation of AdoMet with and without incubation to induce racemization, which was performed at pH 1.0 to minimize the formation of other AdoMet degradation products such as methylthioadenosine and homoserine lactone (18Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4444-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Clear peaks associated with the methyl group of AdoMet were found at 2.93 ppm in (S,S)-AdoMet and at 2.89 ppm in (R,S)-AdoMet (27Hanna G.M. Pharmazie. 2004; 59: 251-256PubMed Google Scholar). Under our conditions, we obtained a 49:51 mixture that was close to the equilibrium distribution. We then used these conditions to generate (R,S)-[3H]AdoMet from a preparation of (S,S)-[3H]AdoMet (Fig. 4). We were able to cleanly separate the isotopically labeled R,S and S,S forms by cation-exchange HPLC (Fig. 4) (cf. Ref. 18Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4444-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To confirm the identity of the labeled (R,S)- and (S,S)-AdoMet samples obtained from the HPLC purification, we tested their ability to serve as substrates for a typical AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase that would be expected to use the S,S form. Fig. 5 shows that the human recombinant l-isoaspartyl protein repair methyltransferase uses purified (S,S)-[3H]AdoMet essentially to completion (94%), whereas no use is made of purified (R,S)-[3H]AdoMet.FIGURE 4Purification of (S,S)- and (R,S)-[3H]AdoMet.

We found that this was the case; after 60 min of incubation, we could quantitatively convert (R,S)-[3H]AdoMet to a neutral species consistent with [3H]methionine (Fig. 6). We found a similar result for (S,S)-[3H]AdoMet, indicating that both diastereomers could be utilized as methyl donors for yeast homocysteine methyltransferases. Control reactions in the absence of homocysteine revealed little or no methylation activity (Fig. 6), confirming the specificity of the assay. We also confirmed that the product was [3H]methionine in each case by co-chromatography of the product with a methionine standard by thin-layer chromatography using silica plates and a solvent system of n-butyl alcohol/acetic acid/water (4:1:1) (data not shown). Two homocysteine methyltransferases have been described in yeast, the products of the SAM4 and MHT1 genes (29Thomas D. Becker A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40718-40724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, we measured the contribution of each of these enzymes to (R,S)-AdoMet utilization. When extracts of a sam4– knock-out strain were incubated with (S,S)-[3H]AdoMet, we found no homocysteine-dependent methyltransferase activity (Fig. 6), suggesting that (S,S)-AdoMet utilization in homocysteine methylation in yeast is limited to the Sam4 enzyme. On the other hand, homocysteine-dependent methyltransferase activity with (R,S)-[3H]AdoMet, although decreased, was still present (Fig. 6). This result provides the first direct evidence that the “degraded” R,S form of AdoMet may be utilized in a specific methyltransferase reaction. This result also suggests that, although Sam4 is responsible for most of the (R,S)-AdoMet-dependent homocysteine methyltransferase activity, there is at least one additional activity present that can utilize the R,S diastereomer, but not the S,S diastereomer, of AdoMet for methionine synthesis. We thus proceeded to determine whether Mht1 is responsible for all or part of the Sam4-independent homocysteine methyltransferase activity. We first analyzed activity in an extract of an mht1– deletion strain. We detected little change in activity with either (R,S)- or (S,S)-[3H]AdoMet, confirming the major role of the Sam4 enzyme. We then prepared a sam4–/ mht1– double knock-out strain. Extracts of this strain were found to be incapable of catalyzing homocysteine methylation with either (R,S)- or (S,S)-[3H]AdoMet (Fig. 6). This experiment demonstrates that the utilization of (R,S)-AdoMet for methionine synthesis in the sam4– extract is due to the Mht1 protein.

https://openalex.org/W1986413607,"Lung cancer including non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) represents a leading cause of cancer death in Western countries. Yet, understanding its pathobiology to improve early diagnosis and therapeutic strategies is still a major challenge of today's biomedical research. We analyzed a set of differentially regulated genes that were identified in skin cancer by a comprehensive microarray study, for their expression in NSCLC. We found that ferm domain containing protein 3 (FRMD3), a member of the protein 4.1 superfamily, is expressed in normal lung tissue but silenced in 54 out of 58 independent primary NSCLC tumours compared to patient-matched normal lung tissue. FRMD3 overexpression in different epithelial cell lines resulted in a decreased clonogenicity as measured by colony formation assay. Although cell attachment capabilities and cell proliferation rate remained unchanged, this phenotype was most likely owing to induced apoptosis. Our data identify FRMD3 as a novel putative tumour suppressor gene suggesting an important role in the origin and progression of lung cancer."

Using an RNA interference approach, we found that Nicalin and NOMO became unstable in the absence of the respective binding partner, suggesting that complex formation has a stabilizing effect. Overexpression of Nicalin resulted in an increase in NOMO, whereas endogenous Nicalin was reduced below the detection limit. Both effects were shown to occur at a post-transcriptional level. Thus, NOMO is most likely produced in excess amounts and either stabilized by Nicalin or rapidly degraded. In contrast, Nicalin levels are limited independently of NOMO. We, therefore, propose that Nicalin controls the assembly and stability of the Nicalin-NOMO complex.

An extensively studied example is γ-secretase, a membrane protein complex with an unusual proteolytic activity (1Wolfe M.S.

We have recently identified Nicalin, a Nicastrin-like protein that also contains an aminopeptidase-like domain (10Haffner C. Frauli M. Topp S. Irmler M. Hofmann K. Regula J.T. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similar to Nicastrin, point mutations at critical positions within this domain exclude a proteolytic activity. Nicalin was found to be part of a high-molecular-weight membrane protein complex unrelated to γ-secretase (10Haffner C. Frauli M. Topp S. Irmler M. Hofmann K. Regula J.T. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C.

No interactions between Nicalin and γ-secretase components could be observed, and in vivo binding studies identified a novel ∼130-kDa membrane protein, which we termed NOMO (Nodal modulator), as a major Nicalin-binding partner. A functional analysis of Nicalin and NOMO in the zebrafish model system using gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches resulted in phenotypes similar to those described for Nodal signaling mutants (10Haffner C. Frauli M. Topp S. Irmler M. Hofmann K. Regula J.T. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nodals are secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily required very early in vertebrate embryogenesis for the development of the three germ layers and the formation of the major body axes (12Schier A.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 589-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of Nicalin and NOMO resulted in partial cyclopia, a phenotype caused by a reduction in Nodal signaling (13Schier A.F. Shen M.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Moreover, a knockdown of NOMO led to defects typical for enhanced Nodal activity. Finally, a block in Nodal signaling induced by the established Nodal inhibitor Lefty could be reversed by the down-regulation of NOMO, demonstrating a genetic interaction between these two proteins. We, therefore, concluded that Nicalin and NOMO act as antagonists of the Nodal signaling pathway (10Haffner C. Frauli M. Topp S. Irmler M. Hofmann K. Regula J.T. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).We have now analyzed Nicalin and NOMO biochemically and show that they are part of a endoplasmic reticulum-located membrane protein complex with a size of 200-220 kDa. Assembly of the complex results in the stabilization of Nicalin and NOMO and represents a major mechanism in controlling their expression levels. Whereas Nicalin is sufficient for NOMO stabilization, its own expression is limited independently of NOMO. We, therefore, propose that Nicalin is the rate-limiting factor for the Nicalin-NOMO complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—The rabbit polyclonal anti-Nicalin antibody Ncl-2221 has been described previously (10Haffner C.

The rabbit polyclonal anti-NOMO antibody NOMO-900 was generated against amino acids 526-799 of human NOMO2 fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP-NOMO-900). The obtained antiserum (Immunoglobe, Himmelstadt) was affinity-purified by high pressure liquid chromatography using N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HiTrap columns (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with MBP-NOMO-900 according to the manufacturer's instructions and used 1:1000 for immunoblotting. The following other antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassa, VA), polyclonal anti-Nicastrin (N1660, Sigma), and polyclonal anti-calnexin (Stressgen).Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) and T-REx-293 (293TR) cells (Invitrogen), human cervix HeLa cells, and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen); human liver HepG2 cells and human breast MCF-7 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (ATCC) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine; human epidermoid A431 and human pancreatic PANC-1 cells (obtained from M. Dauer and A. Eigler) were cultured in advanced RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and stable cell clones were selected using either zeocin (200 μg/ml) or blasticidin (10 μg/ml). The expression of Nicalin or NOMO in T-REx-293 cells was induced with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Cycloheximide treatment of HEK293T cells was performed at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml.Glycosylation Analysis and Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Membrane protein lysates were prepared by hypotonically lysing cells in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mix (Sigma), pelleting cell membranes from the post-nuclear supernatant fraction for 30 min at 16,000 × g and solubilizing them in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1× protease inhibitor mix. After pelleting the insoluble components for 10 min at 16,000 × g, the protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Deglycosylation experiments were carried out on membrane protein lysates (∼25 μg) containing 0.1% SDS using 1 unit of N-glycosidase F or 10 milliunits of endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science) for 16 h at 37 °C. SDS and blue native-PAGE as well as immunoblotting were performed as described previously (8Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Quantification of the immunoblot signals was carried out using the FluorChem 8900 detection system (AlphaInnotech).Subcellular Fractionation—Cells from four 10-cm dishes were harvested in homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m saccharose, 1× protease inhibitor mix (Sigma)) and lysed by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer followed by passage 10 times through a 23-gauge needle. After preparation of a post-nuclear supernatant, cell membranes were pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h, resuspended in homogenization buffer, loaded onto a 2.5-30% discontinuous Optiprep (Sigma) gradient, and run for 2.5 h at 200,000 × g. 1-ml fractions were collected, and 25-μl aliquots loaded onto an SDS gel.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, fixed 20 min with phosphate-buffered saline/3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized 20 min with phosphate-buffered saline/0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin. Antibody incubations were performed for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline using a humid chamber. For detection, Alexa 488- and Alexa 594-coupled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used, and after mounting the samples in Mowiol (Hoechst), they were analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescent microscope.RNA Interference—For the construction of plasmids expressing Nicalin- and NOMO-specific short hairpin RNAs, the following oligonucleotides were used: NOMO-2a, 5′-GAAAAAGTCGGACGTGGAGATCAACTCTCTTGAAGTTGATCTCCACGTCCGAC-3′; NOMO-2s, 5′-GTCGGACGTGGAGATCAACTTCAAGAGAGTTGATCTCCACGTCCGACTTTTTCTGCA-3′; Ncl-1531a, 5′-GAAAAAGCAAGTGATGAATGCGTACTCTCTTGAAGTACGCATTCATCACTTGC-3′; Ncl-1531s, 5′-GCAAGTGATGAATGCGTACTTCAAGAGAGTACGCATTCATCACTTGCTTTTTCTGCA-3′ (purchased from Thermo Electron, Ulm). After denaturation, oligonucleotides were annealed in 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 60 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min at 37 °C and subcloned into the BSENU6 vector (14Xia X.G. Zhou H. Ding H. Affar el B. Shi Y. Xu Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e100Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using PmeI and PstI restriction sites. Knockdown efficiency was evaluated by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with the shRNA-expressing BSENU6 vectors and the psiCHECK2 plasmid (Promega) either expressing a luciferase-Nicalin or luciferase-NOMO fusion mRNA and measuring luciferase activity. Stable cell clones were generated by co-transfection of the short hairpin RNA-encoding BSENU6 vector with pcDNA4/TO/Myc-His and selection with zeocin (Invitrogen). For the generation of the RNA interference (RNAi)-resistant Nicalin rescue construct, silent mutations were introduced into the Nicalin cDNA by PCR using the partially overlapping primers Ncl-RNAi-mutF (5′-AGCAGGTCATGAACGCCTATAGAGTCAAGC-3′) and Ncl-RNAi-mutR (5′-CTATAGGCGTTCATGACCTGCTTCAGCTGG-3′). Full-length Nicalin containing the mutations was subcloned into the pcDNA6 vector (Invitrogen) which provides a blasticidin resistance. A NOMO rescue construct was generated in an analogous manner using the primer NOMO-mutF (5′-AGTCCGACGTCGAAATTAATTACTCGCTCATCGAG-3′) and NOMO-mutR (5′-CGAGTAATTAATTTCGACGTCGGACTTGACGAAGC-3′).Real-time PCR—Total RNA from HEK293T cells and stably transfected cell lines were isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), and 4 μg were used for the synthesis of cDNA using oligo(dT) primers and the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). 1/40 of the cDNA was used for a SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) real-time PCR reaction (40 cycles with 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 65 °C) on a Bio-Rad IQ5 machine using the following primers: for total Nicalin, 5′-ACCACCTGAGCCGCTACCTGAA-3′ and 5′-GACGGCCGGCTTGACTCTGT-3′; for endogenous Nicalin, 5′-CTCCGACTGCAGGGTCTGATGT-3′ and 5′-TGGGCTGGGAGAAGAGGAGTG-3′; for total NOMO, 5′-AGCGGTGGGCCAGAACGACT-3′ and 5′-ACATCCCGGCAGCAATCCAC-3′. Reactions were performed in triplets, and the obtained CT values normalized to β-actin expression by the comparative CT method.RESULTSNicalin and NOMO Are Components of a 200-220-kDa Membrane Protein Complex—The human genome contains three NOMO genes, NOMO1, NOMO2, and NOMO3, which are located as tandem repeats on chromosome 16. All three are expressed according to cDNA data base entries, and their coding regions have identical lengths with amino acid identities between 99.5 and 99.8% (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, these genes almost certainly encode functionally identical proteins, and we, therefore, refer to them collectively as NOMO. The NOMO2 transcript can undergo alternative splicing, which results in the generation of an mRNA lacking a ∼330-bp exon and encoding a NOMO variant with an extended carboxyl terminus (NOMO-L). In a Northern blot analysis, we had detected only a single NOMO mRNA species of ∼4.5 kb (10Haffner C. Frauli M. Topp S. Irmler M. Hofmann K. Regula J.T. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which most likely corresponds to the long NOMO transcripts. Thus, NOMO-L, which is encoded by the shorter transcript, might represent a rare NOMO isoform.To detect endogenous NOMO protein, we generated a polyclonal antibody (NOMO-900) directed against a fragment of the large NOMO amino-terminal domain. NOMO-900 and the Nicalin antibody Ncl-2221 (10Haffner C. Frauli M. Topp S. Irmler M. Hofmann K. Regula J.T. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were used to analyze NOMO and Nicalin protein levels in various human cell lines. Whereas Ncl-2221 recognizes a ∼60-kDa protein under denaturing conditions, NOMO-900 labels a band of ∼130 kDa (Fig. 1A), which is in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of NOMO after cleavage of its putative signal peptide (131.5 kDa). Both proteins were present in varying amounts in all of the cells examined, and their levels were found to be highly proportional. This result is consistent with our previously published Northern blot analysis, which had also shown ubiquitous expression and similar expression patterns in human tissues (10Haffner C. Frauli M. Topp S. Irmler M. Hofmann K. Regula J.T. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We next performed blue native-PAGE to examine the native molecular weights of Nicalin and NOMO. Immunoblot analysis of membrane proteins from HEK293T cells with either the Ncl-2221 or the NOMO-900 antibody resulted in the specific labeling of a single band of 200-220 kDa (Fig. 1B). This not only demonstrated that Nicalin and NOMO exist in a high-molecular-weight form but, together with our co-precipitation data (10Haffner C. Frauli M. Topp S. Irmler M. Hofmann K. Regula J.T. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), strongly suggested that they are components of the same membrane protein complex. Because no bands of lower molecular weight were detected, Nicalin and NOMO monomers might exist only at low abundance.Nicalin and NOMO Localize to the Endoplasmic Reticulum—Nicalin and NOMO are predicted to represent type I transmembrane proteins containing N-glycosylation sites within their large amino-terminal domains (10Haffner C. Frauli M. Topp S. Irmler M. Hofmann K. Regula J.T. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To analyze their glycosylation status, which might provide an indication of their localization within the secretory pathway, we used sugar-cleaving enzymes. Treatment of HEK293T cell lysates with N-glycosidase F resulted in a small but reproducible reduction in Nicalin and NOMO molecular weights, demonstrating the presence of N-linked carbohydrates (Fig. 2A). Because N-glycosylation occurs co-translationally in the lumen of the ER, the amino termini of Nicalin and NOMO cannot reside in the cytoplasm, which is in agreement with the topology predictions. Treatment with endoglycosidase H resulted in similar molecular weight shifts (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that the N-linked carbohydrates are of the high-mannose type; i.e. they have not undergone Golgi-specific modifications. This suggested that Nicalin and NOMO represent proteins of the early secretory pathway.FIGURE 2Nicalin and NOMO localize to the ER. A, Nicalin and NOMO contain N-linked, high mannose carbohydrates. HEK293T cell lysates were treated with N-glycosidase F or endoglycosidase H and submitted to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Both treatments resulted in a slight reduction in the molecular weights of Nicalin and NOMO, demonstrating the presence of high mannose carbohydrates. B, immunofluorescence microscopy pictures of HEK293T cells stably overexpressing Nicalin (top panels) or Nicalin and NOMO (bottom panels). Nicalin shows a punctate/tubular staining that largely overlaps with the staining of the ER marker calnexin. NOMO shows a very similar distribution and a high degree of colocalization with Nicalin. Scale bars, 10 μm. C, Nicalin and NOMO co-fractionate with ER membranes. Membranes from HEK293T cells were subjected to density gradient centrifugation, and the collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The four bottom fractions are enriched in ER membranes as shown by the presence of immature (i) Nicastrin and calnexin. Nicalin and NOMO could only be detected in these four fractions but not in the top fractions containing mature (m) Nicastrin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined the subcellular localization of Nicalin and NOMO in HEK293T cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Endogenous levels of both proteins were too low to be detected, and therefore, cells overexpressing Nicalin and NOMO were used. Nicalin as well as NOMO immunoreactivities were found in a widespread tubular compartment that was identified as ER by staining for calnexin, an ER-resident protein (Fig. 2B). To analyze the localization of endogenous Nicalin and NOMO, we performed a fractionation of cellular membranes using density gradient centrifugation followed by immunoblot detection. ER membranes were enriched in the bottom four gradient fractions as demonstrated by the presence of calnexin and immature Nicastrin (Fig. 2C). Nicalin and NOMO immunoreactivities could only be detected in these four fractions. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the Nicalin-NOMO complex localizes to the ER membrane.Nicalin and NOMO Expression Levels Are Mutually Regulated—The expression of γ-secretase components is tightly controlled by complex assembly (3De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The high proportionality of Nicalin and NOMO expression levels in wild-type cells (see Fig. 1A) raised the question of whether they are regulated in a similar manner. To analyze Nicalin and NOMO expression levels in the absence of the respective complex partner, we used RNA interference (RNAi) in HEK293T cells. Clonal cell lines stably expressing Nicalin- or NOMO-specific short hairpin RNAs were generated, and efficient silencing was demonstrated by immunoblotting. Surprisingly, the knockdown of Nicalin caused a strong reduction of NOMO and vice versa, suggesting that Nicalin and NOMO are mutually dependent (Fig. 3A). This was supported by the observation that, in cell clones with a less efficient Nicalin knockdown, the reduction of NOMO was also incomplete (supplemental Fig. 2). The expression of other membrane proteins was not altered, demonstrating the specificity of the observed effects (Fig. 3A). Next, we generated a cell line in which the Nicalin knockdown was rescued by expressing an RNAi-resistant Nicalin mRNA encoding Myc-tagged Nicalin, which has a slightly higher molecular weight, allowing its separation from endogenous Nicalin. Immunoblotting revealed that, in addition to Nicalin, NOMO expression was also restored in these cells (Fig. 3B). Moreover, analysis of clones with varying rescue efficiencies showed that the extent of NOMO restoration always closely followed that of Nicalin, corroborating the idea that their expression is tightly linked. To further show that this linkage is reciprocal, NOMO expression was rescued in NOMO knockdown cells in an analogous manner (Fig. 3C). Again, Nicalin and NOMO protein levels were restored in parallel, demonstrating a mutual dependence. To examine whether this increase in protein levels is accompanied by an enhanced interaction between Nicalin and NOMO, we performed immunoprecipitation of Nicalin-Myc from two Nicalin rescue cell clones with different expression levels. In the high expression clone (Fig. 3B, #2), higher amounts of NOMO were co-precipitated than in the low expressing clone (Fig. 3B, #1). This suggested that an increase in cellular Nicalin/NOMO levels results in enhanced complex formation.FIGURE 3Nicalin and NOMO protein levels are mutually dependent. A, immunoblot of HEK293T wild-type (wt) cells and single cell clones stably expressing Nicalin-specific (Ncl KD) or NOMO-specific (NOMO KD) short hairpin RNAs. Expression levels of the targeted protein as well as the respective binding partner were strongly reduced. No significant changes are observed in the expression of mature (m) and immature (i) Nicastrin and calnexin. B, rescue of the Nicalin knockdown by stable transfection of Nicalin knockdown cells with an RNAi-resistant construct encoding Myc-tagged Nicalin. Nicalin as well as NOMO expression is restored as shown by immunoblotting of cell lysates from wild-type cells, Nicalin knockdown cells (Ncl KD), and various Nicalin knockdown rescue (Ncl KD rescue) cell clones. Note that expression levels in different clones are highly proportional. This proportionality is also observed in Nicalin-Myc immunoprecipitates (IP) from clones #1 and #2. C, rescue of the NOMO knockdown by stable introduction of an RNAi-resistant NOMO expression construct. Immunoblotting of cell lysates from wild-type, NOMO knockdown (NOMO KD), and NOMO knockdown rescue (NOMO rescue) cells shows restoration of both NOMO and Nicalin expression levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The use of a strong promoter to rescue Nicalin expression in knockdown cells led to clones with Nicalin levels severalfold higher than in wild-type cells (Fig. 3B, clones #2 and #9). In these clones, NOMO levels were similarly increased, suggesting that Nicalin might control NOMO expression. We sought to verify these results and generated cell lines stably overexpressing Myc-tagged Nicalin (293T/Ncl) or Myc-tagged NOMO (293T/NOMO). As in the cells with rescued Nicalin expression, an increase in NOMO levels was detected in 293T/Ncl cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, 293T/NOMO cells showed no change in endogenous Nicalin (Fig. 4A, asterisk), suggesting that cellular Nicalin levels are limited independently of NOMO. This limitation was also apparent in 293T/Ncl cells, which show strongly reduced levels of endogenous Nicalin (Fig. 4A). A similar phenomenon has been described in detail for the γ-secretase component presenilin and termed “replacement” (15Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the expression of γ-secretase and the Nicalin-NOMO complex might be subject to similar regulatory mechanisms. No replacement of endogenous NOMO was observed in cells expressing a Myc-tagged version of the long isoform NOMO-L (Fig. 4A). Thus, only cellular expression levels of Nicalin (but not of NOMO) appear to be limited.FIGURE 4Exogenous Nicalin elevates NOMO and replaces endogenous Nicalin. A, immunoblot analysis of HEK293T cells stably overexpressing Myc-tagged Nicalin (293T/Ncl), untagged NOMO (293T/NOMO), or Myc-tagged NOMO-L (293T/NOMO-L). In 293T/Ncl cells, endogenous Nicalin (labeled with an asterisk), which migrates faster than the Myc-tagged variant, is reduced below the detection limit, and NOMO expression is up-regulated. In contrast, Nicalin levels are unchanged in NOMO-overexpressing cells. In 293T/NOMO-L cells, endogenous NOMO, which can be separated from Myc-tagged NOMO-L by its lower molecular weight (clearly seen in the short exposure lane) is not reduced. B, Nicalin and NOMO protein levels are regulated predominantly post-transcriptionally. Real-time PCR was performed with cDNA samples from wild-type HEK293T cells, Nicalin knockdown cells (Ncl KD), the Nicalin rescue cell clone #9 (Ncl KD rescue), NOMO knockdown cells (NOMO KD) and Nicalin-overexpressing (293T/Ncl) cells. Primer pairs were designed to detect total Nicalin (Ncl), total NOMO (NOMO), or endogenous Nicalin containing 3′-untranslated region sequences (Ncl UTR). Samples were run as triplicates, and the obtained Ct values were normalized to a β-actin control reaction. Mean values of two experiments are shown as fold change relative to HEK293T cells on a logarithmic scale. In Nicalin and NOMO knockdown cells, only the mRNA of the target gene (but not that of the binding partner) is reduced. Nicalin knockdown rescue cells, which express equally elevated levels of Nicalin and NOMO protein, contain ∼50-fold more Nicalin mRNA than NOMO mRNA. In 293T/Ncl cells, Nicalin mRNA is increased >300-fold over NOMO mRNA, despite similar protein levels. At the same time, endogenous Nicalin mRNA is reduced only ∼2.4-fold, in contrast to the much stronger reduction on the protein level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nicalin and NOMO Expression Is Regulated on a Post-transcriptional Level—To examine whether the observed effects on Nicalin and NOMO expression are due to transcriptional or post-transcriptional events, Nicalin and NOMO mRNA levels were determined using real-time PCR. In Nicalin knockdown cells, Nicalin mRNA was reduced ∼7-fold (Fig. 4B), in good agreement with the reduction on the protein level. NOMO mRNA in these cells was increased 1.5-fold, in contrast to the reduction in protein expression. Similarly, in NOMO knockdown cells, NOMO mRNA was reduced ∼7-fold, whereas Nicalin mRNA even showed a 3.3-fold increase. Thus, the reduction of Nicalin or NOMO protein levels upon silencing of the respective binding partner occurs by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Similar results were obtained with cell lines overexpressing Nicalin, which contain strongly increased amounts of NOMO protein (see Figs"
https://openalex.org/W1988153215,"Geminin has been proposed to coordinate cell cycle and differentiation events through balanced interactions with the cell cycle regulator Cdt1 and with homeobox transcription factors and chromatin remodeling activities implicated in cell fate decisions. Here we show that Geminin is cleaved in primary cells and cancer cell lines induced to undergo apoptosis by a variety of stimuli. Geminin targeting is mediated by caspase-3 both in vivo and in vitro. Two sites at the carboxyl terminus of Geminin (named C1 and C2) are cleaved by the caspase, producing truncated forms of Geminin. We provide evidence that Geminin cleavage is regulated by phosphorylation. Casein kinase II alters Geminin cleavage at site C1 in vitro, whereas mutating phosphorylation competent Ser/Thr residues proximal to site C1 affects Geminin cleavage in vivo. We show that truncated Geminin produced by cleavage at C1 can promote apoptosis. In contrast, Geminin cleaved at site C2 has lost the ability to interact with Brahma (Brm), a catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, while binding efficiently to Cdt1, indicating that targeting of Geminin during apoptosis differentially affects interactions with its binding partners."
https://openalex.org/W2115145070,"Phage libraries displaying linear or disulfide-constrained peptides often yield weak binders, upon screening against a target, and must be optimized to improve affinity. The disadvantages of libraries based on larger complex proteins, such as single chain antibodies, have stimulated interest in the development of smaller nonimmunoglobulin protein scaffolds. A promising candidate is the Trp cage motif, a 20-residue C-terminal sequence of exendin-4. Amino acid substitution within the Trp cage resulted in a 20-mer peptide recognized as an ultrafast cooperative folding miniprotein, with ideal characteristics for the discovery of small structured nonimmunoglobulin motifs having a stable tertiary structure. Although we were unable to display the Trp cage on M13 phage, successful display was achieved using the lytic T7 phage. Interestingly, mutations were observed at a frequency dependent on display valency. A Trp cage library designed with randomized amino acids at seven solvent-exposed positions was developed from 1.6 × 109 primary clones in T7Select10-3b. DNA sequencing of 109 library clones revealed 38% mutants and 16% truncations by TAG codons at randomized positions. Amino acid frequencies were largely within expected bounds and DIVAA analysis revealed that the library had an average diversity of 0.67. Utility of the library was demonstrated by identification of HPQ containing Trp cage miniproteins, which bound streptavidin, and AAADPYAQWLQSMGPHSGRPPPR, which bound to human bronchial epithelial cells. A high complexity library based on the Trp cage miniprotein has demonstrated potential for identifying novel cell and protein binding peptides that could be used for the delivery of therapeutic molecules or as target-specific therapeutic agents.

Since the development of phage display technology (1Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3145) Google Scholar), it has been widely used for the screening of random combinatorial peptide libraries in drug discovery initiatives (2Lowman H.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 401-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). When peptides are displayed as unconstrained linear molecules, they can adopt numerous conformations, very few of which may represent stable conformations. Panning with these unconstrained peptides against targets of interest usually leads to the isolation of peptides with low binding affinity. Reducing the conformational freedom of the displayed peptides is necessary to decrease entropy and increase the binding affinity (3Ladner R.C. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 426-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 4Uchiyama F. Tanaka Y. Minari Y. Tokui N. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2005; 99: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Constrained libraries have often achieved a reduction in conformational freedom by incorporating a pair of cysteine residues at both ends of linear peptides, resulting in disulfide bridges that form peptide loops yielding cyclic peptide libraries reported to increase binding affinity (5Giebel L.B. Cass R.T. Milligan D.L. Young D.C. Arze R. Johnson C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15430-15435Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and stability in biological fluids (6Nakamura G.R. Starovasnik M.A. Reynolds M.E. Lowman H.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9828-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The use of defined protein scaffolds for the generation of random libraries has the potential to increase binding affinity further by providing a more rigid conformation (7Ladner R.C. Ley A.C. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Examples of folded protein scaffolds that have been used for peptide display include the zinc finger motif, which has been used to construct a degenerate library for the isolation of peptides that bind to DNA and RNA (8Rebar E.J. Pabo C.O. Science. 1994; 263: 671-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 9Friesen W.J. Darby M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and Kunitz domains, which have been used as a scaffold for libraries designed for the discovery of improved serine protease inhibitors (10Dennis M.S. Herzka A. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25411-25417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have evaluated another protein that has potential to serve as a scaffold for the generation of a random peptide library, exendin-4, a 39-amino acid peptide isolated from the saliva of the Gila monster, Heloderma suspectum. NMR studies of exendin-4 (11Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Prickett K.S. Andersen N.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13188-13200Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) showed that residues 21–38 of the C terminus form a stable tertiary structure designated a Trp cage motif. The Trp cage is a hydrophobic cluster with Trp-25 buried in a central location, where it is shielded from solvent exposure. The residues that form the cage around Trp-25 include multiple proline residues (Pro-31, and prolines 36–38) where the proline rings are located on both faces of the indole ring of Trp-25 and the Phe side chain completes the hydrophobic cluster. Further studies aimed at developing a miniprotein (a stable self-folding peptide with a minimum number of amino acids) showed that the C-terminal 20 amino acids of exendin-4 (RLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS) are adequate for forming the Trp cage. In addition, amino acid substitution experiments resulted in optimization of Trp cage folding (estimated by NMR chemical shift deviations, the presence of long range nuclear Overhauser effect, the absence of cis/trans isomerization around proline residues, and NH exchange protection) from 40 to >95% in water at physiological pH. Analysis of the conformation of the optimized Trp cage in the presence of 30% trifluoroethanol, a known helix-inducing solvent, resulted in a minimal increase in helical content. Moreover, this construct is fairly stable with a Tm of 43.5 °C (12Andersen N.H. Barua B. Fesinmeyer R.M. Neidigh J. Lebl M. Houghton R.A. Peptides: The Wave of the Future. American Peptide Society, Springer, New York2001: 406-408Google Scholar, 13Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Andersen N.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The optimized Trp cage miniprotein TC5b (NLYIQWLKDGGPSSGRPPPS) has been extensively studied, because it is an ultrafast, cooperatively folding system (14Qiu L. Pabit S.A. Roitberg A.E. Hagen S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 12952-12953Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Within the optimized Trp cage sequence, there are several positions where the substitution of amino acids does not compromise folding of the miniprotein. Some of those positions are solvent-exposed, making them ideal for the display of random amino acids in a highly diverse library. This report describes the construction and characterization of a peptide library of high complexity based on the 20-amino acid Trp cage miniprotein TC5b with seven randomized positions displayed on bacteriophage T7.

T7 phage was enumerated using the plaque assay method on LB 2The abbreviations used are: LB, Luria-Bertani; pfu, plaque-forming units; cfu, colony-forming units; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PEG, polyethylene glycol; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. solid medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) as needed. Phage lysates were prepared following the instructions in the T7Select System manual (Novagen, San Diego, CA), which typically resulted in titers of 1010–1011 pfu/ml. Phage were purified and concentrated from centrifuged lysates (12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) by the addition of one-sixth volume of 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 2.5 m NaCl (PEG/NaCl) and incubating on ice for at least 60 min or overnight at 4 °C. Precipitated phage were pelleted by centrifugation as above. The phage pellet was resuspended in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and reprecipitated with one-sixth volume of PEG/NaCl on ice for 15–60 min, centrifuged, resuspended in TBS, and stored at 4 °C. Preparation of Phage DNA for Sequencing—Well-isolated phage plaques were punched out of solid media and resuspended in 100 μl of TE(10mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Host bacteria were grown to a density of 2 × 108 cfu/ml, and 2.5 μl of the phage suspension was added to 1 ml of the bacterial culture ina17 × 100-mm tube followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 h with shaking. Then 1 μl of Nuclease mix containing RNase A and DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) was added, and incubation was continued for 15 min at 37 °C without shaking. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (16,000 × g, 10 min). A 900-μl volume of the supernatant was recovered and transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube containing 200 μl of PEG/NaCl and placed at 4 °C overnight. Precipitated phage were collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min), resuspended in 100 μl of TE, and disrupted by extraction with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (1:1) and then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge (16,000 × g, 1 min). The aqueous phase was recovered, extracted with an equal volume of chloroform, and centrifuged for 4 min. The aqueous phase was recovered again, and one-tenth volume of 3 m sodium acetate was added. Alternatively, the phage were disrupted by resuspension in 100 μl of iodide buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 4 m NaI). Phage DNA was precipitated by the addition of 250 μl of ethanol with incubation for 10 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min). The DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried briefly under vacuum, and resuspended in 20–30 μl of TE. DNA Sequencing/Oligonucleotide Synthesis—T7 DNA was submitted to Retrogen (San Diego, CA) for automated DNA sequencing by an ABI 3730 DNA analyzer using the primer T7-125 (5′-TGCGTGACTTGGCTCTGGAG-3′). A protocol model was constructed for sequence analysis using Teranode software (Teranode Corp., Seattle, WA), which also served as a sequence data base. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Retrogen, using standard phosphoramidite chemistry. Insertion of DNA Sequences Encoding TC3b or TC5b into T7Select Vectors—Oligonucleotide pairs were designed to encode the Trp cage TC3b and TC5b miniproteins (Table 1). Each oligonucleotide, 5′-phosphorylated (5′p), was resuspended in TE to 200 pmol/μl before annealing. Oligonucleotide TC3b (+)(5′p-AATTTATTTATCGAATGGCTCAAAAATGGTGGTCCTTCCAGTGGTGCTCCTCCCCCTTCCTAA-3′) was annealed with TC3b (-)(5′p-AGCTTTAGGAAGGGGGAGGAGCACCACTGGAAGGACCACCATTTTTGAGCCATTCGATAAATA-3′), and TC5b (+) (5′p-AATTCGGCAGCTGCGAATTTGTATATTCAGTGGCTTAAGGATGGTGGTCCTTCGTCGGGGCGGCCTCCGCCAAGTTAAA-3′) was annealed with TC5b (-)(5′p-AGCTTTTAACTTGGCGGAGGCCGCCCCGACGAAGGACCACCATCCTTAAGCCACTGAATATACAAATTCGCAGCTGCCG-3′) by combining 25 μl of each of the appropriate oligonucleotides in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), the mixtures were heated to 95 °C in a heat block for 5 min and allowed to cool at room temperature for 2 h in the block. The annealed oligonucleotides were ligated to the arms of T7Select 415-1b, 10-3b, or 1-1b and packaged in vitro using the T7 Select Cloning kit according to the manufacturer's directions. Packaged phage were amplified by growth in liquid media with the appropriate host. Oligonucleotide insertion was confirmed by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Amino acid sequence of Exendin-4 and Trp cage miniproteinsExendin-4 (residues 20–39)RLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPSTC3bNLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPSTC5bNLYIQWLKDGGPSSGRPPPS Open table in a new tab Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized by solid phase Fmoc chemistry on Tentagel amide resin using a Rainin Symphony synthesizer. Coupling steps were performed using 5 eq of 2-(6-chloro-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminium hexafluorophosphate and Fmoc amino acid (NovaBiochem, San Diego, CA) with an excess of N-methylmorpholine for 40 min. Fmoc removal was accomplished by treating the peptide resin with 20% piperidine (Aldrich) in dimethylformamide (Burdick and Jackson, Morristown, NJ) for two 10-min cycles. Upon completion of the entire peptide, the Fmoc group was removed with piperidine and washed extensively with dimethylformamide. The peptides were cleaved from the resin by the addition of 10 ml of trifluoroacetic acid (Aldrich) containing 2.5% water and 2.5% triisopropylsilane (Aldrich) followed by gentle agitation at room temperature for 2 h. The resulting crude peptide was collected by trituration with ether followed by filtration. The crude product was dissolved in Millipore water and lyophilized to dryness. The crude peptide was taken up in 15 ml of water containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and 3 ml of acetic acid and loaded onto a Zorbax RX-C8 reversed-phase column (22-mm inner diameter × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size) through a 5-ml injection loop at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The purification was accomplished by running a linear AB gradient of 0.1% B/min for 180 min, where solvent A is 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water and solvent B is 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The purified peptides were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry. Peptides were purified to greater than 95% purity as determined by reversed-phase HPLC. Production of Antibody AB167—The TC5b miniprotein was synthesized with the addition of a cysteine residue at the N terminus to allow conjugation of keyhole limpet hemocyanin and designated PN0522 (NH2-CNLYIQWLKDGGPSSGRPPPS-amide). The keyhole limpet hemocyanin-PN0522 conjugate was used to produce protein G-purified antibodies from New Zealand White rabbits by Orbigen (San Diego, CA). Phage ELISAs—For the detection of Trp cage TC5b, purified phage were diluted in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), distributed 100 μl/well to a 96-well Maxisorp™ plate (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY), and allowed to bind for 1 h. All incubations were done at room temperature with slow orbital shaking. After phage binding, the wells were washed three times with 400 μl of DPBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% BSA (wash buffer) and then blocked with 200 μl of wash buffer for 1 h. A 100-μl volume of primary antibody (AB167 diluted 1:500 in wash buffer) was applied and allowed to bind for 1 h and then washed five times as above. Secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:1000 in wash buffer) was applied in 100 μl, incubated for 1 h, washed, and developed with OptEIA reagents (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. Means were compared using Student's t test. Phage binding to 16HBE14o- cells was analyzed using confluent cells grown with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 complete medium in 96-well collagen-coated plates (BD Biosciences) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were washed with DPBS, and phage diluted in DPBS containing 1% BSA (DPBSBSA) were applied in 100 μl. Bound phage were detected using primary antibody (mouse IgG T7 tail fiber monoclonal antibody diluted 1:2000 in DPBS-BSA) and secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:5000 in DPBS-BSA) followed by detection with OptEIA reagents as above. Western Analysis of Phage Displaying TC5b—Purified phage were denatured by boiling in Tris/glycine SDS sample buffer (2×) with 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples containing 1011 pfu/ml in 10 μl were loaded into wells of a 1-mm 4–20% Tris/glycine gel and electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 150 V (constant voltage) in Tris/glycine SDS running buffer. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 1.5 h at room temperature and blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h. The membrane was probed with antibody AB167 diluted 1:2500 for 2 h at room temperature, followed by three 5-min washes with TBS-T. Bound antibody was detected by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:5000 for 1 h at room temperature followed by four 10-min washes and development with SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions. MagicMark™ XP Western protein standards were used for size references. Construction of the Trp Cage Library—The Trp cage library was constructed in the T7Select 10-3b vector using oligonucleotide T-3 (-)(5′-CATGTTCAAGCTTGTTAMNNGGGGGGAGGACGACCAGAMNNAGGACCMNNMNNMNNTAACCACTGMNNGTAMNNATCTGCTGCTGCCGAATTCGGGGCATGTG-3′) as a template (where M represents equal molar amounts of A and C, and N is equal molar amounts of A, C, G, and T) and T-3 (+)(5′-CACATGCCCCGAATTCGGCA-3′) as a primer. The template and primer were annealed by combining 310 pmol of T-3 (-) and 820 pmol of T-3 (+) in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) to a final volume of 50 μl, the mixture was heated to 95 °C in a heat block for 5 min, and the block was allowed to cool at room temperature for 2 h. The primer was extended by combining 310 pmol of annealed template-primer, dNTP mixture (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), REact 2 buffer (Invitrogen), and Klenow fragment (10 units) in a total volume of 250 μl for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by incubation at 65 °C for 15 min followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The extended duplexes were double digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and the cleavage products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 20% TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) gel. The desired band was excised and extracted by shaking overnight in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS at room temperature. Gel fragments were removed by centrifugation, and the DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation before being resuspended in TE. The extracted inserts were ligated into arms of T7Select®10-3b and packaged in vitro using the T7Select® cloning kit according to the manufacturer's directions, and primary clones were enumerated. Ligation and packaging was repeated until greater than 109 primary clones were generated and amplified. The amplified clones were pooled, treated with Nuclease mix at 37 °C for 15 min and centrifuged (8000 × g, 10 min) to remove cell debris. Phage were concentrated by adding solid PEG 8000 to 10% (w/v), incubation overnight at 4 °C, centrifugation (10,400 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and resuspension in 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA. For further purification, the concentrated phage were layered on top of a CsCl density block gradient consisting of 1.5 ml of 62%, 3.0 ml of 41%, 3.0 ml of 31%, and 3.0 ml of 20% CsCl in TE and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm (150,000 × g) in a Beckman SW28.1 rotor at 25 °C for 98 min. The phage band was recovered by side puncture and dialyzed against three changes of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgSO4. Construction of a Suppressor Host Strain for T7Select—Plasmid pAR5403 was isolated from BLT5403 using a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. E. coli strain C600 ATCC 23724 was made competent for transformation by inoculating LB broth with a 1% inoculum of fresh overnight culture and incubating at 37 °C with shaking until the cell density reached A600 = 0.3. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (480 × g, 10 min), resuspended in ice-cold 0.1 m CaCl2, recentrifuged, and resuspended in one-fiftieth volume of ice-cold 0.1 m CaCl2. Transformation was accomplished by combining 200 μl of competent cells with 2 μl of pAR5403 (200 ng/μl), incubating on ice for 30 min, heat shocking at 42 °C for 90 s, and then placing on ice for 2 min. Transformants were selected by inoculating 100 μl of heat-shocked cells into 3 ml of molten top agar, which was then spread onto LB solid medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Plasmid DNA was prepared from transformants by QIAprep Spin Miniprep and examined after electrophoresis (65 V for 2 h) through a 10 × 15-cm 0.6% SeaKem LE (Cambrex, Rockland, ME)-agarose gel in TBE running buffer followed by staining with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). Stability of Primary Clones—BLT5403 grown to A600 = 0.85 (1 × 108 cfu/ml) was split into three aliquots and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.02 with a total of 4 × 107 pfu of either mutant, nonmutant, or both mixed in a 1:1 ratio. The infected cultures were incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 3 h or until lysis was complete and progeny were enumerated. Progeny phage plaques were randomly selected and suspended in 100 μl of TE to elute phage. Lysates were prepared by infecting 1-ml cultures of midlog BLT5403 with 10 μl of each eluate and concentrated with PEG/NaCl, and phage DNA was extracted for sequencing. One-step Growth Experiment—Based on the one-step growth experiment described by Edgar (15Edgar R.S. Burdette W.J. Methodology in Basic Genetics. Holden-Day, Inc., San Francisco1963: 19-36Google Scholar), BLT5403 was grown in LB broth at 37 °C to a density of 2 × 108 cfu/ml and centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended in half the original volume with LB broth and enumerated by the spread plate method to determine input cells. 0.5 ml of resuspended cells at 4 × 108 cfu/ml were placed in a 17 × 100-mm tube and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and then phage infection was initiated by adding 0.5 ml of the appropriate phage stock adjusted to 4 × 109 pfu/ml to provide a multiplicity of infection of 10, and incubation was continued. At 5 min postinfection, 2 μg of T7 tail fiber monoclonal antibody was added to neutralize unadsorbed phage. At 10 min postinfection, the cell and phage mixture was diluted 104-fold into LB broth contained in a 250-ml growth flask, and incubation was continued with vigorous shaking. At 15 min postinfection, 1.0 ml was removed from the growth flask, mixed with 1 ml of LB broth containing 2–3 drops of CHCl3, and vortexed. The unadsorbed phage were enumerated. At 20 min postinfection, 1.0 ml was removed from the growth flask for determination of infected cells (total pfu - unadsorbed pfu). At 90 min postinfection, 2–3 drops of CHCl3 were added to the growth flask, and progeny phage were enumerated. Streptavidin Panning—A 96-well Maxisorp™ plate was coated with 200 ng/well streptavidin (2 ng/μl) for at least 1 h and blocked with 1% BSA in DPBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (DPBS-BT) for 1 h and then rinsed three times with 200 μl of DPBS-BT. The crude Trp cage library (i.e. before CsCl purification) was panned against streptavidin-coated wells by applying 1.2 × 109 pfu that were allowed to bind for 1 h at room temperature followed by six washes with 200 μl of DPBS-BT. Bound phage were eluted with 1% SDS for 10 min and amplified with BLT5403. The lysate was centrifuged, and 10 μl of the phage supernatant was used for the next round of panning. After three rounds of panning, well isolated plaques of eluted phage were selected for DNA sequencing. Panning against Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells—Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-) at low passage were seeded into 24-well collagen-coated plates (BD Biosciences) and allowed to grow at 37 °C in 5% CO2 to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To prepare the cells for panning, the medium was removed and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with no serum (F12i) and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Then the F12i was removed and replaced with 500 μl/well of 1% BSA in DPBS and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Just before panning, the DPBS was removed, and the cells were rinsed with 500 μl of TBS. A 50-μl aliquot of the naive T7Select Trp cage library was combined with 160 μl of TBS and added to the cells followed by incubation at 4 °C for 60 min with gentle rocking. The unbound portion of the phage library was removed by 25 washes with 500 μl of TBS. Bound phage were eluted by adding 200 μl of a BLT5403 culture grown to A600 = 1.0 in M9LB followed by incubating at room temperature for 15 min. Eluted phage were added to 20 ml of the BLT5403 culture and amplified by incubation at 37 °C for 2–3 h until cell lysis was observed. The amplified phage was concentrated with PEG/NaCl and resuspended in 200 μl of DPBS. Subsequent rounds of panning were performed using 20 μl of concentrated phage from the previous round. In the second round, unbound phage were removed by washing with TBS containing 0.1% Tween, and in the third round TBS with 0.3% Tween was used. After three rounds of panning, well-isolated plaques of eluted phage were selected for DNA sequencing. Display of Trp Cage Miniproteins on Bacteriophage T7 Is Associated with a Valency-dependent Increase in Peptide Mutation—The T7Select system, which is designed to display peptides with a free C terminus on the surface of bacteriophage T7 by fusion to the phage capsid protein (gp10B), was used to display Trp cage miniproteins (Table 1) that were based on sequences from Neidigh (13Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Andersen N.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Initial work designed to test the feasibility of displaying the Trp cage miniprotein was performed with Trp cage version TC3b, and later work focused on the further optimized version TC5b because it has better folding characteristics. Three T7Select vectors were used, each one varying by the average number of capsid fusion proteins displayed per phage: 415-1b (average copy number = 415), 10-3b (average copy number = 5–15), and 1-1b (average copy number = 0.1–1). In order to determine if Trp cage TC3b could be displayed on bacteriophage T7, oligonucleotides TC3b (+) and TC3b (-) were annealed and inserted into the three T7Select vectors. After in vitro packaging and amplification, several well-isolated plaques were selected and analyzed by DNA sequencing. The deduced amino acid sequences revealed a high frequency of mutants (7 of 8 clones) when TC3b was expressed in the 415-1b vector and a low frequency of mutants in the"

The DNA-unwinding element of the human c-myc replication origin is essential for replicator activity and is a target of the DNA-unwinding element-binding protein DUE-B in vivo. We present here the 2.0Å crystal structure of DUE-B and complementary biochemical characterization of its biological activity. The structure corresponds to a dimer of the N-terminal domain of the full-length protein and contains many of the structural elements of the nucleotide binding fold. A single magnesium ion resides in the putative active site cavity, which could serve to facilitate ATP hydrolytic activity of this protein. The structure also demonstrates a notable similarity to those of tRNA-editing enzymes. Consistent with this structural homology, the N-terminal core of DUE-B is shown to display both d-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase activity and ATPase activity. We further demonstrate that the C-terminal portion of the enzyme is disordered and not essential for dimerization. However, this region is essential for DNA binding in vitro and becomes ordered in the presence of DNA.

During each division of somatic cells DNA replication is regulated so that the genome is copied in its entirety only once (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev.

The classical replicon hypothesis states that the initiation of DNA replication at replication origins is controlled by initiator protein binding at regulatory sites called replicators and has served as a useful description for prokaryotic replication (3Jacob F. Brenner S. Cuzin F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 329-348Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, a concise description of eukaryotic replication is complicated by the fact that eukaryotic chromosomes contain multiple origins of replication and the replicator sequences controlling them do not share easily recognizable conserved sequences (4Gilbert D.M.

Transposition of a 2.4-kb c-myc origin fragment to an ectopic site in the HeLa genome promotes bidirectional DNA replication initiation at the site of insertion, confirming its function as a chromosomal replicator (13Liu G.

This 2.4-kb region contains an AT-rich region comprising three matches to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ARS consensus sequence and a ∼40-bp DUE zone of predicted helical instability, also termed the far upstream element or FUSE (27Michelotti G.A. Michelotti E.F. Pullner A. Duncan R.C. Eick D. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2656-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), which has been shown to be sensitive to single strand-directed reagents in vitro and in vivo (19Berberich S. Trivedi A.

Leffak, unpublished information. implying that a DUE is essential for chromosomal replication origin activity. In addition to a region of easily unwound DNA, replication origins frequently contain binding sites for auxiliary factors that recruit constituents of the replication complex. Yeast one-hybrid studies utilizing the DUE from the c-myc origin as bait identified a 24-kDa polypeptide capable of specifically engaging the DUE in vivo (28Ghosh M. Kemp M. Liu G. Ritzi M. Schepers A. Leffak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5270-5283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and in vitro in the presence of other nuclear proteins (29Casper J.M. Kemp M.G. Ghosh M. Randall G.M. Vaillant A. Leffak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13071-13083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This protein, termed DUE-B, is conserved in bacteria, yeasts, and eukaryotes with homologs identified in rodents, amphibians, and fish. Recombinant DUE-B purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells is a homodimer that co-purifies with ATPase activity (29Casper J.M. Kemp M.G. Ghosh M. Randall G.M. Vaillant A. Leffak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13071-13083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, short interfering RNA-mediated knock down of DUE-B delays entry into S phase and promotes cell death. Moreover, immunodepletion of DUE-B from Xenopus egg extracts inhibits DNA replication and addition of purified, recombinant DUE-B expressed in HeLa cells restores replication activity to these extracts, emphasizing the interspecies conservation of DUE-B function (29Casper J.M.

These observations provide strong evidence that DUE-B is involved in the initiation of DNA replication. To gain further insights into the function of DUE-B in DNA replication, we have solved the three-dimensional crystal structure of the recombinant protein to a resolution of 2.0 Å and, guided by our crystal structure, have carried out further biochemical characterization of DUE-B. Homodimerization of DUE-B is mediated by an extensive set of interactions that result in the formation of a continuous β-sheet structure between the two monomers. The C-terminal residues that are involved in mediating interactions with target DNA are largely disordered in the crystal, in agreement with results from limited proteolysis experiments. The three-dimensional structure of DUE-B reveals notable similarity to the overall domain structures of both d-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylases and the archaea-specific editing domain of threonyl-tRNA synthetase (30Ferri-Fioni M.L.

Purification and Crystallization—Recombinant human DUE-B containing a C-terminal His6 tag (rDUE-B) was purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells (29Casper J.M. Kemp M.G. Ghosh M. Randall G.M. Vaillant A. Leffak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13071-13083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after infection the cells were lysed and DUE-B purified by Ni+2-NTA resin affinity chromatography (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions containing >95% pure rDUE-B (200 mm imidazole eluate) were identified by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Protein was concentrated and buffer exchanged into 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol by centrifugal filtration (Millipore). Immediately prior to crystallization, protein samples were exchanged into a buffer composed of 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, by ultrafiltration. Crystals suitable for diffraction studies were obtained by the hanging drop method by mixing 2 μl of protein (6 mg/ml) with 2 μl of a well solution (200 mm KCl, 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000) and equilibrating against the latter solution at 12 °C. For cryo-crystallography, crystals were serially transferred into the precipitant solution containing incremental concentrations of glycerol up to a final concentration of 30% and flash-cooled by plunging directly into liquid nitrogen. Native diffraction data were collected at an insertion device synchrotron source using an ADSC CCD detector (Beamline 17-ID, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL) at 100 K. Data were indexed and scaled using HKL2000 (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar) to a limiting resolution of 2.0 Å. A derivative data set was collected at 100 K from crystals soaked in 1 mm ethylmercuric phosphate using a RAXIS IV++ image plate detector system to a limiting resolution of 3.0 Å.

Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Although the resultant electron density was not readily interpretable, solvent flattening and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging (36Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) between the multiple copies of DUE-B in the crystallographic asymmetric unit allowed for an initial trace of the protein main chain atoms. Multiple rounds of 2- and 4-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging (36Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), followed by cycles of manual rebuilding and crystallographic refinement using REFMAC5 (37Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13868) Google Scholar), allowed assignment of the first 151 amino acids of each of the four monomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Refinement against the 2.0 Å synchrotron data yielded a final model with a working R factor of 20.4% and a free R factor of 23.7%. The final model contains the first 151 amino acid residues for each DUE-B monomer, 379 water molecules, and 4 magnesium ions. The refined coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data bank with accession number 2OKV. Enzyme Assays—Protease digestions of DUE-B were performed with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or V8 protease at 1:20–1: 400 w:w protease:DUE-B. Aminoacylation of Escherichia coli tRNA was performed as described by Soutourina et al. (38Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11626-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to minimize contamination by l-aspartic acid. A 500-μl reaction containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm ATP, 1% glycerol, 0.6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 μm d-[3H]aspartic acid (PerkinElmer), 25 μm E. coli tRNA (Sigma), and 1250 units of mixed E. coli tRNA synthetases (Sigma) was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. After overnight precipitation with ethanol at -20 °C, the supernatant was lyophilized, resuspended in water, and used again in an aminoacylation reaction at 37 °C for 90 min with an additional 12.5 nmol E. coli tRNA and 1250 units of E. coli tRNA synthetase. The reaction was extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and used fresh in deacylation reactions. E. coli tRNA (Sigma) aminoacylated with d-[3H]aspartate was incubated in a 50-μl reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, and 500 fmol of the indicated form of recombinant DUE-B. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min before addition of glycogen and precipitation with ethanol at -20 °C overnight. After centrifugation the supernatant was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. To assay for ATPase activity, reactions containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm unlabeled ATP, 100 nm [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer), and the indicated amount of recombinant DUE-B were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to 50 mm and frozen by dropping into liquid N2. An aliquot of each reaction was spotted on a polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cellulose TLC plate (Selecto Scientific) that was developed in 0.8 m acetic acid/0.8 m LiCl and analyzed using a PhosphorImager. To assay for DUE-B dimer stability, rDUE-B was mixed with Xenopus egg extract for 40 min at room temperature. The mixture was subsequently incubated with Ni+2-NTA-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Recombinant forms of DUE-B containing or lacking the C terminus were used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine DNA binding. The DNA probe was generated using PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP with primers amplifying a 123-bp region of the c-myc replicator. Preparation of the protease-resistant DUE-B core by trypsin digestion (1:100 w:w trypsin:DUE-B) was as described, except the reaction volume was 10 μl and contained 25 pmol DUE-B. After 1 h at 37 °Ca 0.5-μl aliquot was removed for SDS-PAGE analysis, and the remaining reaction mixture was brought up to 15 μl with TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) (0.5×), NaCl (50 mm), loading dye (1× final concentration; Promega), and 25 fmol 32P-labeled PCR product. Samples were then loaded on a 4% native polyacrylamide (0.5× TBE) gel that had been pre-run for 30 min at room temperature. The gel was run at 100 V for 50 min at room temperature, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. Details of Overall Topology—We have solved the crystal structure of human DUE-B to 2.0 Å resolution using non-crystallographic symmetry averaging of phases determined from a mercurial derivative (Table 1). Although mass spectrometric analysis of dissolved crystals of DUE-B documents that crystals contain the full-length polypeptide encompassing all 209 residues, interpretable electron density is only visible for the first 151 amino acids. Predictive analysis and limited proteolysis studies (see below) are consistent with the view that the final 58 amino acid residues are unstructured in the absence of additional ligands. The N-terminal 151 residues of DUE-B fold into a compact domain of the α/β class of proteins (Fig. 1a). Residues Lys-2 through Val-15 form a long, extended β strand (β1) that is sharply bent at residue Thr-9. Two β strands, encompassing residues Glu-18 through Ile-23 (β2) and residues Gly-26 through Gly-32 (β3), form the core of the β-sheet structure. Residues Gln-39 through Asn-51 form helix α1, followed by the next strand (β4) of the sheet structure created by Glu-73 through Ser-78. This is followed by a second long helix (α2) encompassing residues Thr-99 through Thr-116. Residues Ile-122 through Asp-124 form a short β strand (β5). The long, final β strand (β6), created by residues Met-131 through Glu-146, with a kink at residue Gly-139, completes the structure of this domain of DUE-B (see Fig. 2 for a secondary structure annotation of the DUE-B monomer).FIGURE 2Structure-based sequence alignment. Multiple sequence alignment of the primary sequence of human DUE-B (with the corresponding secondary structure elements annotated above the sequence) with the sequences of eukaryotic homologs. Residues implicated to be involved in catalysis are shown as cyan diamonds, and the juncture sensitive to protease or chemical cleavage is shown with orange stars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Solution studies show that DUE-B is a homodimer (29Casper J.M. Kemp M.G. Ghosh M. Randall G.M. Vaillant A. Leffak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13071-13083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and this dimeric interaction is observed in the crystal structure. Within the asymmetric unit, there are four copies of the DUE-B monomer. Pairs of monomers form tight interacting dimer, yielding two copies of the DUE-B homodimer in the asymmetric unit. Each homodimer buries a total of 2295 Å2 of surface area. The dimer interface is created mainly by intermolecular interactions between strandβ6 residues Met-131 through Gly-139 from each monomer to create an antiparallel β-sheet structure that extends across the homodimer interface (Fig. 1b). The primary sequence of human DUE-B shows strong evolutionary conservation of sequences found in higher and lower eukaryotes and in bacteria (Fig. 2). The topological arrangement of the DUE-B monomer bears many of the structural elements of polypeptides that contain nucleotide binding motifs (Fig. 3). Structure-based comparison of DUE-B with the ATP-binding protein MJ0577 (1MJH) (39Zarembinski T.I. Hung L.W. Mueller-Dieckmann H.J. Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim R. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15189-15193Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) yields a root mean square deviation of 3.7 Å over 79 residues (Fig. 3b). A structural comparison with liver alcohol dehydrogenase demonstrates that the DUE-B N-terminal domain structure is similar to half of the canonical Rossman fold (Fig. 3c). A superposition of 62 α carbon atoms common to DUE-B and alcohol dehydrogenase (1A4U) (40Benach J. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 383-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) yields a root mean square value of 3.7 Å. Given the observation that recombinant DUE-B possesses the ability to hydrolyze ATP (29Casper J.M. Kemp M.G. Ghosh M. Randall G.M. Vaillant A. Leffak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13071-13083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), it is quite likely that the structural similarity between the N-terminal domain of DUE-B and these proteins extends to its function as a nucleotide binding motif, as illustrated below. Stability of the DUE-B Dimer— DUE-B isolated from Xenopus egg extract (xDUE-B), HeLa nuclei, or human recombinant DUE-B expressed in insect cells (rDUE-B) is in the form of a homodimer (29Casper J.M. Kemp M.G. Ghosh M. Randall G.M. Vaillant A. Leffak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13071-13083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When rDUE-B was mixed with Xenopus egg extract and reisolated by binding to Ni+2-NTA-agarose, rDUE-B did not co-isolate with xDUE-B (Fig. 4a), implying that the rDUE-B and xDUE-B dimers do not disproportionate in vitro. Similarly, rDUE-B did not dimerize with HeLa DUE-B when mixed in vitro with HeLa nuclear extracts (not shown). In contrast, when His6-tagged human DUE-B was expressed in HeLa cells and purified by Ni+2-NTA-agarose, the ectopic and endogenous forms of DUE-B co-isolated in extracts from cells arrested in G1, S, or M phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 4b). These results suggest that the DUE-B heterodimers and, by extension, DUE-B homodimers formed in vivo are stable over the cell cycle. The crystal structure of DUE-B suggests that the C-terminal portion of the protein is not involved in dimerization. To test this directly, a C-terminal truncation mutant missing amino acids 148–209 was expressed in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4c, the truncated form of DUE-B efficiently dimerized with the endogenous wild type protein. Taken together, these results show that DUE-B dimers are stable in vivo and in vitro and that the dynamic C-terminal region is not essential for dimerization. Protease Sensitivity of the DUE-B C Terminus and DNA Binding—The C-terminal portion of DUE-B (amino acids 152–209) is not visible in the crystal structure and is predicted to be dynamically disordered (41Iakoucheva L.M. Kimzey A.L. Masselon C.D. Bruce J.E. Garner E.C. Brown C.J. Dunker A.K. Smith R.D. Ackerman E.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 560-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 42Romero P. Obradovic Z.

Workshop Genome Inform. 1999; 10: 30-40PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion of His6-tagged human DUE-B (rDUE-B) purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells produced a resistant core of ∼17 kDa, close to the predicted size of the monomeric N-terminal domain visible in the DUE-B crystal (Fig. 5a). Protease digestion removed the C-terminal His6 tag during production of the resistant core (Fig. 5b), and formic acid cleavage of full-length DUE-B between Asp-156 and Pro-157, or formic acid treatment of trypsin-digested DUE-B, resulted in a product of closely similar size to that of the protease-resistant core (Fig. 5c), demonstrating that it is the C terminus that is removed by proteolysis. Disordered regions of DNA-binding proteins often become ordered upon DNA binding (42Romero P. Obradovic Z. Dunker A.K. Appl. Bioinformatics. 2004; 3: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Incubation of rDUE-B with a 54- or 123-bp DNA fragment containing the DUE (29Casper J.M. Kemp M.G. Ghosh M. Randall G.M. Vaillant A. Leffak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13071-13083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) resulted in the resistance of the full-length protein to protease digestion (Fig. 6a). Comparative time course digestions of DUE-B in the absence and presence of DNA (Fig. 6b) revealed a significant (4- to 5-fold) delay in susceptibility to digestion in the presence of the polynucleotide ligand. Consistent with the lack of sequence specificity of purified DUE-B binding (29Casper J.M. Kemp M.G. Ghosh M. Randall G.M. Vaillant A. Leffak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13071-13083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the DUE was not essential for resistance to trypsin digestion, as poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) fully protected DUE-B and mixed E. coli tRNAs moderately protected DUE-B against trypsin digestion (not shown). By contrast, a 54-nt single-stranded oligonucleotide containing one strand of the DUE or a 21-nt oligonucleotide from the DUE/ARS segment did not afford significant protection against digestion (Fig. 6c). Because DUE-B was isolated by virtue of its binding to the c-myc DUE in vivo and selectively binds a double-stranded DNA fragment containing the DUE in vitro in the presence of HeLa nuclear extract (29Casper J.M. Kemp M.G. Ghosh M. Randall G.M. Vaillant A. Leffak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13071-13083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the observation that double-stranded DNA preferentially protects the C terminus of DUE-B against protease suggests that in the presence of in vivo binding partners DUE-B may recognize some feature of incipiently unwound DNA prior to actual strand separation. Purified full-length rDUE-B is able to bind double-stranded DNA without sequence specificity in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (29Casper J.M. Kemp M.G. Ghosh M. Randall G.M. Vaillant A. Leffak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13071-13083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6d, to test whether the C terminus of DUE-B is necessary for DNA binding, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay was repeated using the protease-resistant DUE-B core, the C-terminal truncation mutant, or the trypsin-treated C-terminal truncation mutant (which is resistant to trypsin digestion, as expected from the results of Fig. 5). Full-length rDUE-B was able to form a stable complex with the double-stranded DNA probe whereas neither the protease-resistant core nor the C-terminal truncation mutant bound to the probe, implying that the C terminus is necessary for binding of purified DUE-B to DNA. Structural Similarities to tRNA-editing Enzymes—Human DUE-B shows strong evolutionary conservation with tRNA-binding proteins in yeasts and metazoans. The overall conformation of the N-terminal 151-amino acid domain of DUE-B bears significant similarity to the nucleotide binding Rossman fold found in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (44Park S.G.

https://openalex.org/W2063900982,"Restoration of cell volume in the continued presence of osmotic stimuli is essential, particularly in hepatocytes, which swell upon nutrient uptake. Responses to swelling involve the Ca2+-dependent activation of K+ channels, which promote fluid efflux to drive volume recovery; however, the channels involved in hepatocellular volume regulation have not been identified. We found that hypotonic exposure of HTC hepatoma cells evoked the opening of 50 pS K+-permeable channels, consistent with intermediate conductance (IK) channels. We isolated from rat liver and HTC cells a cDNA with sequence identity to the coding region of IK1. Swelling-activated currents were inhibited by transfection with a dominant interfering IK1 mutant. The IK channel blockers clotrimazole and TRAM-34 inhibited whole cell swelling-activated K+ currents and volume recovery. To determine whether IK1 underwent volume-sensitive localization, we expressed a green fluorescent protein fusion of IK1 in HTC cells. The localization of IK1 was suggestive of distribution in lipid rafts. Consistent with this, there was a time-dependent increase in colocalization between IK1 and the lipid raft ganglioside GM1 on the plasma membrane, which subsequently decreased with volume recovery. Pharmacological disruption of lipid rafts altered the plasma membrane distribution of IK1 and inhibited volume recovery after hypotonic exposure. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that IK1 regulates compensatory responses to hepatocellular swelling and suggest that regulation of cell volume involves coordination of signaling from lipid rafts with IK1 function.

As a metabolically active organ, the liver is subjected to physiological stimuli that elicit dynamic alterations in cell volume. For example, after meals, hepatocytes swell as a consequence of Na+-coupled amino acid uptake and insulin-stimulated changes in cation permeability (1Haussinger D. Prog. Liver Dis. 1996; 14: 29-53PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dunkelberg J.C. Feranchak A.P. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In response to swelling, plasma membrane K+ and Cl- channels open to promote electrolyte and fluid efflux, which restores cell volume toward its resting state. This serves to prevent a degree of swelling that would jeopardize cellular integrity and organ level function. Although volume-sensitive channels have been deemed to be of critical importance to hepatocyte physiology, their fundamental characteristics have remained elusive. We and others have shown a role for Ca2+ in channel activation. Hepatocellular swelling stimulates intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and Ca2+ influx (3Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol.

These observations support the hypothesis that swelling-induced increases in membrane K+ permeability that are necessary for hepatocellular volume recovery are mediated by Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Two families of Ca2+-activated K+ channels have been linked to cell volume regulation in epithelia: intermediate/small conductance (IK/SK), 3The abbreviations used are: IK, intermediate conductance K+ channels; GM1, [Gal(β1→3)GalNAc(β1→4){NeuAc(α2→3)}Gal(β1→4)Glc(β1→1) ceramide]; SK, small conductance K+ channels; BK, large conductance K+ channels; PI, phosphatidylinositol; SES, standard extra cellular solution; CTXB, cholera toxin B subunit; GFP, green fluorescent protein; dn, dominant negative; MβCD, methyl β-cyclodextrin.3The abbreviations used are: IK, intermediate conductance K+ channels; GM1, [Gal(β1→3)GalNAc(β1→4){NeuAc(α2→3)}Gal(β1→4)Glc(β1→1) ceramide]; SK, small conductance K+ channels; BK, large conductance K+ channels; PI, phosphatidylinositol; SES, standard extra cellular solution; CTXB, cholera toxin B subunit; GFP, green fluorescent protein; dn, dominant negative; MβCD, methyl β-cyclodextrin. and large conductance (BK) K+ channels, and consistent with this, IK, SK, and BK channel genes have been found to be expressed in these tissues (9Roman R.

We and others have shown functional evidence of 10 pS Ca2+-activated K+ channels and expression of the SK isoforms SK2 and SK3 in hepatocytes (9Roman R. Feranchak A.P. Troetsch M. Dunkelberg J.C. Kilic G. Schlenker T. Schaack J. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G116-G122PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lidofsky S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This would support a potential role for SK channels in hepatocellular volume regulation. On the other hand, alanine uptake, which elicits hepatocellular swelling, has been shown to evoke the opening of 30–90 pS K+ channels (15Bear C.E. Petersen O.H. Pflugers Arch. 1987; 410: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the IK channel blocker clotrimazole, but not the SK channel blocker apamin, attenuates hepatocellular swelling-induced K+ efflux (16Junankar P.R. Karjalainen A. Kirk K. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2004; 14: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These findings support a potential role for IK channels in hepatocellular volume regulation. Others have reported that alanine evokes the opening of BK (200 pS) channels in hepatocytes (17Pon D.C. Hill C.E. J. Cell Physiol. 1997; 171: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In liver, immunolabeling studies have suggested that IK1 protein (also known as SK4, KCa3.1, and KCNN4) is predominantly expressed in bile duct epithelia (18Thompson-Vest N. Shimizu Y. Hunne B. Furness J.B. J. Anat. 2006; 208: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); however, volume recovery has been found to be predominantly mediated by SK2 channels in those cells (9Roman R. Feranchak A.P. Troetsch M. Dunkelberg J.C. Kilic G. Schlenker T. Schaack J. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G116-G122PubMed Google Scholar). In colonic epithelia, IK has been suggested to be important in volume recovery after swelling (10Wang J. Morishima S. Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C77-C84Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar); however, in liver there is little apparent hepatocellular IK1 immunoreactivity detected (18Thompson-Vest N. Shimizu Y. Hunne B. Furness J.B. J. Anat. 2006; 208: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Given these findings, it is not clear at the molecular level which type of K+ channel governs volume regulatory responses in hepatocytes. To address this issue, we have used complementary approaches to define the characteristics of K+ channels involved in hepatocellular volume regulation. Here we report that: IK1 is expressed in rat liver and HTC rat hepatoma cells, the properties of swelling-activated K+ channels are consistent with those of IK1 channels, and such channels are inhibited by a dominant interfering mutant of IK1. Moreover, we have found that cell swelling induces transient association at the plasma membrane of IK1 channels with lipid rafts. Disruption of lipid raft integrity leads to altered plasma membrane localization of IK1 and inhibits volume recovery. Taken together, these findings suggest that IK1 channels regulate cell volume in hepatocytes and raise the possibility that lipid rafts may coordinate swelling-activated fluid efflux with other events that participate in cell volume control. Cell Culture and Reagents—HTC rat hepatoma cells, a well characterized model for the study of hepatocellular volume regulation (3Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1997; 273: G849-G853PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were used ∼18–24 h after plating. The acetoxymethyl ester of calcein, Alexa 555-labeled cholera toxin B, and Alexa 647-labeled phalloidin were from Molecular Probes. All other reagents were from Sigma unless specifically noted. Molecular Cloning and Cell Transfection—mRNA was isolated from the livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats, and a cDNA pool was prepared essentially as described previously (14Barfod E.T. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C836-C842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the full-length coding sequence of rat IK1 (also known as SK4) were used (ATGGGCGGGGAGCTGGTGACT and CTATGTGGCTTCCTGGATGGG) to amplify the cDNA using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). A 1278-nucleotide PCR product was cloned, and both strands of the rat liver IK1 product were analyzed by automated sequencing (Vermont Cancer Center DNA Analysis Facility). Dominant negative constructs of SK3 and IK1 were made using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), designing primers so that the signature K+ channel pore motif, GYG, was altered to AAA (24Kuzhikandathil E.V. Oxford G.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Dominant negative SK3 (dnSK3) and dominant negative IK1 (dnIK1), and their parent forms were subcloned in-frame into enhanced GFP fusion vectors (Clontech) on both the amino and carboxyl ends of enhanced GFP and confirmed by sequencing. HTC cells were transfected with these fusions using Amaxa nucleofector technology, and expression of all fusions was visible by fluorescence microscopy, except that of IK1 with enhanced GFP fused to its carboxyl terminus, which was not visible and thus not used. Cells transfected with GFP fusions of the ion channels were analyzed by fluorescence imaging or by patch clamp recording after 24 h. Immunofluorescence and Image Analysis—Transfected cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and treated essentially previously described (19Barfod E.T. Moore A.L. Melnick R.F. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25548-25557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Live labeling of cells with Alexa 555-cholera toxin subunit B (1 μg/ml) was performed for 30 min at 4 °C to allow the toxin to bind to the lipid raft marker, ganglioside GM1, without substantial internalization or raft clustering. In selected experiments, cells were treated as above and then incubated with fresh isotonic or hypotonic media for 5 min prior to fixation to promote raft coalescence. Unless otherwise specified, all experiments were performed at room temperature. The isotonic medium (SES) contained: 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The hypotonic medium was identical to SES except that the concentration of NaCl was reduced to 84 mm. In studies involving lipid raft disruption, pretreatment with drugs was performed at 37 °C. Because hepatocytes are particularly sensitive to methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (25Nyasae L.K. Hubbard A.L. Tuma P.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2689-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), cells were treated for 30 min with 10 mm MβCD. In parallel experiments, cells were treated with filipin complex (freshly made in dry Me2SO at 6 μg/ml) for 30 min. Image quantification was performed with deconvolved DeltaVision files (soft-WoRx version 3.5.0 from Applied Precision), using Volocity 3 software (Improvision) to calculate the overlapping voxels in three-dimensional projections of cell peripheries. Measurement of Membrane Currents—Single channel and whole cell currents were measured by patch clamp recording techniques as previously described, with the exception that the microscope was fitted for fluorescence imaging (3Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Lidofsky S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7115-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For studies that involved expression of fluorescent fusion proteins, transfected cells were identified by visualization of the green fluorescence of GFP. The isotonic bathing solution was SES, and the pipette solution contained 10 mm NaCl, 130 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.30). Cell swelling was evoked by perfusion with a hypotonic solution identical to SES except that the concentration of NaCl was reduced to 98 mm. For single channel recordings, inward currents at the resting membrane potential (approximately -55 mV) represent the opening of K+-permeable channels under the experimental conditions employed, because there is no net Cl- flux at the resting membrane potential in these cells (26Fitz J.G. Sostman A.H. Middleton J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G677-G684PubMed Google Scholar). For whole cell recordings, K+ currents were measured at a holding potential of 0 mV, and Cl- currents were measured at a holding potential of -80 mV (3Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Currents were measured under basal conditions, and hypotonic currents were defined as the maximal current within 10 min after hypotonic exposure. To control for variations in cell size, currents were normalized to cell capacitance and expressed as current density. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Measurement of Cell Volume—Cell volume was measured two ways: in calcein-loaded cells via laser scanning confocal microscopy as previously described (3Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and in suspended cells via Multisizer 3 Coulter Counter measurement (20Bodily K. Wang Y. Roman R. Sostman A. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Lidofsky S.D. Roman R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G849-G853PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Values were normalized to basal volume. For the first method, cell swelling was elicited by exposure to a hypotonic solution, identical in composition to SES, except that the NaCl concentration was 84 mm. In the second method, cells were suspended as follows. For studies involving the effects of channel blockers, cells were lifted off the plate by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 20 min with or without the appropriate drugs, resuspended in SES with or without the appropriate drugs for 10 min more at 37 °C with rocking, and then added to a stirred sample holder on a Multisizer 3 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter). Samples (0.5 ml) with a minimum cell number of 1500 per measurement in the size range of interest (10–30 μm diameter) were aspirated and measured at 0.5- to 1-min intervals. After 1 or 2 min, SES without NaCl, with or without drug, was added to bring the concentration of NaCl to 84 mm (hypotonic), and samples continued to be aspirated and measured for at least 20 min. For studies involving lipid raft disruption, the method for preparation of cells in suspension was modified, because cells lifted using phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of lipid raft-disrupting drugs exhibited basal cell volumes that were markedly lower than those of controls (see “Results”). Thus, for these studies, cells were briefly trypsinized (1 min), rocked in serum-containing media for 20 min at 37 °C, centrifuged, and brought up in SES with or without MβCD (10 mm) and rocked for an additional 15 min at 37 °C prior to analysis. The rate of cell volume recovery after swelling (%/min) was calculated from the equation below, where Vmax is the relative maximum cell volume after swelling, V20 is the relative cell volume 20 min after hypotonic exposure, and m is the linear regression coefficient of the recovery curve between Vmax and V20 as follows: rate = (m/(Vmax - 1)) × 100. Statistics—All results are presented as means ± S.E., where n represents the number of cells or groups of cells. Comparisons were made with same-day controls with the use of unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test, as appropriate, and p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Hepatocellular Swelling Activates IK Channels—We and others have shown that K+ channels activated by hepatocellular swelling are Ca2+-dependent (3Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Junankar P.R. Karjalainen A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40324-40334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Khalbuss W.E. Wondergem R. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 962-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7Roman R.M. Bodily K.O. Wang Y. Raymond J.R. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based upon the properties of known Ca2+-activated K+ channels identified in hepatocytes, it could be hypothesized that volume-sensitive K+ channels are SK, IK, or BK channels. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed single channel recordings in cell-attached membrane patches. Using a KCl-rich pipette solution (see “Experimental Procedures”), single channel activity was not detectable under isotonic conditions (data not shown). However, within 3–5 min after hypotonic exposure, inward single channel currents were observed at the resting membrane potential in 5 of 10 cell-attached patches (Fig. 1). The channels exhibited a unitary conductance of ∼50 pS with very weak inward rectification. Single channels reversed polarity at ∼45 mV positive to the resting membrane potential, consistent with K+ permeability under the experimental conditions employed (26Fitz J.G. Sostman A.H. Middleton J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G677-G684PubMed Google Scholar). These findings support the concept that hepatocellular swelling evokes the opening of IK channels. Effect of IK Channel Blockade on Swelling-activated Membrane Currents—To further delineate the nature of swelling-activated K+ channels, we examined the effect of the IK channel blockers clotrimazole and TRAM-34 (27Wulff H. Miller M.J. Hansel W. Grissmer S. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8151-8156Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) on membrane currents evoked by hypotonic challenge. We found that clotrimazole (10 μm) and TRAM-34 (1 μm) markedly attenuated swelling-activated K+ currents but did not significantly affect swelling-activated Cl- currents (Fig. 2). By contrast, apamin (300 nm), which inhibits SK channels (14Barfod E.T. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C836-C842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and tetraethylammonium (5 mm), which inhibits BK but not IK channels at the concentration employed (28Herrera G.M. Nelson M.T. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Hayashi M. Kunii C. Takahata T. Ishikawa T. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C635-C646Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), did not affect swelling-activated currents (Fig. 2). These findings add further support to the concept that IK channels are activated by hepatocellular swelling. Molecular Identification of IK1 in Liver and HTC Cells—The functional properties of swelling-activated IK channels appear to be identical to those of the K+ channel protein IK1 (30Ishii T.M. Silvia C. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11651-11656Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 31Neylon C.B. Lang R.J. Fu Y. Bobik A. Reinhart P.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: e33-e43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether IK1 was expressed in both HTC cells and native liver, reverse transcribed mRNA was amplified with primers derived from the rat brain IK1 sequence. The sequenced products identified multiple forms in both rat liver and HTC cells. Primers from the 5′- and 3′-ends were subsequently used to amplify from rat liver mRNA, and a 1278-bp product, the sequence of which encoded a protein with high sequence similarity to other entries in GenBank™ was cloned. This nucleotide sequence is over 99% identical to rat SK4 cloned from colon (core nucleotide data base NM_023021) and varies by only three nucleotides. These nucleotide differences result in a change of only one amino acid in the S5 region; phenylalanine 213, is changed by the sequence differences to leucine. This is unlikely to have functional consequences, as a smooth muscle rat IK1 channel, and human and mouse forms of the channel also have leucine at this position (31Neylon C.B. Lang R.J. Fu Y. Bobik A. Reinhart P.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: e33-e43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with hepatocellular expression of IK1. IK1 Contributes to Swelling-activated K+ Currents—If IK1 channels participate in hepatocellular volume regulation, it would be predicted that reduction of functional IK1 channels would lead to attenuation of swelling-activated K+ currents. To test this, we expressed in HTC cells a dominant negative mutant of IK1 (dnIK1), in which the canonical pore sequence GYG was changed to AAA. We then examined the influence of dnIK1 expression on membrane currents following hypotonic challenge. In comparison with controls (vector alone), cells expressing dnIK1 exhibited a significant reduction in swelling-activated K+ currents but not Cl- currents (Fig. 3). To exclude the possibility that the effects of dnIK1 expression resulted from interference with other Ca2+-activated K+ channels, we tested the effects of a dominant negative mutant of SK3 (dnSK3), an SK channel isoform that we have previously identified in hepatocytes and HTC cells (14Barfod E.T. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C836-C842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in swelling-activated K+ currents in cells that expressed dnSK3, compared with vector-transfected controls (Fig. 3). These observations support the concept that IK1 channels respond to hepatocellular swelling and contribute to volume recovery. Volume-sensitive Localization of IK1—We have recently shown that critical proteins required for early signaling events in volume recovery appear to be translocated to the cell membrane upon hepatocellular swelling (19Barfod E.T. Moore A.L. Melnick R.F. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25548-25557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether IK1 localization was altered in response to cell swelling. Because antibodies that recognize IK1 in immunofluorescence applications are not yet available, we constructed amino-terminal GFP fusions of the IK1 gene (GFP-IK1) and, as a control, a GFP fusion of the closely related SK3 gene (GFP-SK3), in mammalian expression plasmids. We first confirmed that these constructs exhibited functional properties expected for IK1 and SK3. Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells transiently transfected with GFP-IK1 and with GFP-SK3 exhibited Ca2+-activated K+ currents that were blocked by TRAM-34 and apamin, respectively (see supplemental Fig. S1). We then performed fluorescence imaging studies in transiently transfected HTC cells. Under isotonic conditions, GFP-IK1 was found in discontinuous puncta or in small protrusions on the plasma membrane (Fig. 4). After 1 min of hypotonic exposure, intense GFP-IK1 signal could be found in small patches at the periphery often protruding from the cell surface. By contrast, GFP-SK3 appeared to associate with ruffling lamellipodia at the cell periphery (Fig. 4). By 10 min after cell swelling, both GFP-IK1 and GFP-SK3 signals were largely diminished in cells, and there appeared to be substantially less K+ channel protein on the plasma membrane. Intriguingly, although there was substantial overlap between peripheral GFP-SK3 and actin signals, there was little between GFP-IK1 and actin. Thus, in response to cell swelling, GFP-IK1 appeared to be clustered in the plasma membrane in a time-dependent manner, and it exhibited different plasma membrane and cytoskeletal association from that of the closely related GFP-SK3. The volume-sensitive localization of GFP-IK1 was suggestive of spatially controlled ion channel occupancy in the plasma membrane. Among the mechanisms that could be responsible for this are association with lipid rafts, plasma membrane microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, and signaling molecules such as Src (32Simons K. Ehehalt R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), which are key cell volume regulators (19Barfod E.T. Moore A.L. Melnick R.F. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25548-25557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are thought to form primarily as structures too small to be detected by fluorescence microscopy (33Meder D. Moreno M.J. Verkade P. Vaz W.L. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34Kusumi A. Suzuki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 234-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, in cells polarized by stimulation, lipid rafts can coalesce into structures that can be detected by fluorescence methods (35Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Lacalle R.A. Keller P. Labrador J.P. Martinez A.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6211-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 36Kindzelskii A.L. Sitrin R.G. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4681-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts isolated from the plasma membrane in polarized hepatocytes have been detected with fluorescently labeled cholera toxin subunit B (CTXB), which binds to the lipid raft component, ganglioside GM1 (37Mazzone A. Tietz P. Jefferson J. Pagano R. LaRusso N.F. Hepatology. 2006; 43: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, because lipid rafts have been implicated in volume control in selected cell types (38Caprin"
https://openalex.org/W1967216078,"Stabilization of an enzyme while maintaining its activity has been a major challenge in protein chemistry. Although it is difficult to simultaneously improve stability and activity of a protein by amino acid substitutions due to the activity-stability trade-off, backbone cyclization by connecting the N and C termini with a linker is promising as a general method of stabilizing a protein without affecting its activity. Recently, we created a hyperactive, methionine- and cysteine-free mutant of dihydrofolate reductase from Escherichia coli, called ANLYF, by introducing seven amino acid substitutions, which, however, destabilized the protein. Here we show that ANLYF is stabilized without a loss of its high activity by a novel backbone cyclization method for unprotected proteins. The method is based on the in vitro cyanocysteine-mediated intramolecular ligation reaction, which can be conducted with relatively high efficiency by a simple procedure and under mild conditions. We also show that the reversibility of thermal denaturation is highly improved by the cyclization. Thus, activity and stability of the protein can be separately improved by amino acid substitutions and backbone cyclization, respectively. We suggest that the cyanocysteine-mediated cyclization method is complementary to the intein-mediated cyclization method in stabilizing a protein without affecting its activity. Stabilization of an enzyme while maintaining its activity has been a major challenge in protein chemistry. Although it is difficult to simultaneously improve stability and activity of a protein by amino acid substitutions due to the activity-stability trade-off, backbone cyclization by connecting the N and C termini with a linker is promising as a general method of stabilizing a protein without affecting its activity. Recently, we created a hyperactive, methionine- and cysteine-free mutant of dihydrofolate reductase from Escherichia coli, called ANLYF, by introducing seven amino acid substitutions, which, however, destabilized the protein. Here we show that ANLYF is stabilized without a loss of its high activity by a novel backbone cyclization method for unprotected proteins. The method is based on the in vitro cyanocysteine-mediated intramolecular ligation reaction, which can be conducted with relatively high efficiency by a simple procedure and under mild conditions. We also show that the reversibility of thermal denaturation is highly improved by the cyclization. Thus, activity and stability of the protein can be separately improved by amino acid substitutions and backbone cyclization, respectively. We suggest that the cyanocysteine-mediated cyclization method is complementary to the intein-mediated cyclization method in stabilizing a protein without affecting its activity. Development of strategies for improving both conformational stability and biological activity of natural proteins is a central issue in biochemistry and biotechnology and has a great impact on industrial and biomedical applications. Many structure-based and directed evolution strategies have successfully been used to improve stability or activity of proteins (1Arnold F.H. Adv.

However, stabilization of an enzyme while maintaining its activity has been difficult, because mutations at the active site make the enzyme more stable but less active, according to the activity-stability trade-off (3Eijsink V.G.

Mutations outside of the active site may improve the stability of an enzyme while maintaining its activity, but such mutations can be found by screening of a large library of enzyme variants (11Miyazaki K. Wintrode P.L. Grayling R.A. Rubingh D.N. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), by multiple amino acid substitutions (12Van den Burg B. Vriend G.

Thus, stabilization of an enzyme while maintaining its activity has been a difficult task if single or multiple amino acid substitutions are considered. One of the promising methods for stabilizing a protein without affecting its activity is backbone cyclization by connecting the N and C termini with an appropriate linker. Previous efforts of backbone cyclization by chemical ligation (15Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Camarero J.A. Muir T.W.

Chem. 2002; 96: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have succeeded in stabilizing proteins with the biological activities unchanged when a linker connecting the N and C termini was properly designed. Theoretical studies have predicted that backbone cyclization stabilizes a protein by reducing the conformational entropy of the unfolded state and thereby increasing the Gibbs free energy difference between the unfolded and the native states (26Flory P.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 5222-5235Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 27Poland D.C. Scheraga H.A. Biopolymers. 1965; 3: 379-399Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 28Anfinsen C.B. Scheraga H.A.

Biol. 2003; 332: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In accord with this, naturally occurring circular proteins are reported to be highly stable (31Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19068-19075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 32Gonzalez C. Langdon G.M. Bruix M. Galvez A. Valdivia E. Maqueda M. Rico M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Sci. 2002; 27: 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Moreover, backbone cyclization can be applied to many natural proteins, because most proteins have the N and C termini close in proximity in the native structure (34Thornton J.M. Sibanda B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, backbone cyclization is a good candidate for a general method of protein stabilization without affecting its activity. The backbone cyclization methods by chemical ligation mostly use stringent conditions that could damage proteins (15Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and are limited to relatively small proteins or peptides (15Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Camarero J.A. Pavel J. Muir T.W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1998; 37: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Introduction of disulfide bonds at the N- and C-terminal regions may destabilize a protein due to steric constraints in the folded conformation (20Arai M. Kataoka M. Kuwajima K. Matthews C.R. Iwakura M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 35Betz S.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1551-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Consequently, the most widely used method to cyclize proteins is intein-mediated cyclization. Intein is an element essential for protein splicing. The splicing mechanism consists of the excision of an intervening polypeptide sequence, the intein, from a protein precursor, accompanied by the concomitant joining of the flanking polypeptide sequences, the exteins, by a peptide bond (36Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 37Xu M.Q. Evans Jr., T.C. Methods. 2001; 24: 257-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Several methods have been developed to use engineered inteins to cyclize large proteins as well as small peptides in vitro and in vivo (21Camarero J.A. Muir T.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5597-5598Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Scott C.P. Abel-Santos E. Wall M. Wahnon D.C. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13638-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 23Camarero J.A. Fushman D. Sato S. Giriat I. Cowburn D. Raleigh D.P. Muir T.W. J. Mol.

However, fusion of a target protein with the intein sometimes leads to misfolding of the protein, resulting in a low expression or inclusion body formation (38Blaschke U.K. Silberstein J. Muir T.W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 478-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Sydor J.R. Mariano M. Sideris S. Nock S.

Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 43: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, the efficiency of cleavage of the target protein from the fusion is dependent on the target sequence and the residues adjacent to the cleavage site (37Xu M.Q. Evans Jr., T.C. Methods. 2001; 24: 257-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, one nonnative residue (mostly Cys and rarely Ser and Thr) remains in the sequence of the final product as a part of the linker connecting the N and C termini. The presence of a reactive Cys residue may lead to undesirable intermolecular disulfide formation, reduce the reversibility of thermal denaturation, and make the protein susceptible to oxidation. Here, we present a novel backbone cyclization method of unprotected proteins and peptides. This method is based on the cyanocysteine-mediated intramolecular ligation reaction and enables efficient and mild in vitro chemical cyclization of a folded, unprotected protein, avoiding its undesired misfolding or destruction. We have previously found an interesting reaction route involving chemical cleavage at a cysteine residue attached to the C terminus of a protein (44Takenawa T. Oda Y. Ishihama Y. Iwakura M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 45Ishihama Y. Ito O. Oda Y. Takenawa T. Iwakura M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 3415-3418Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The cleavage reaction, studied extensively by Catsimpoolas and Wood (46Catsimpoolas N. Wood J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1790-1796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Jacobson et al. (47Jacobson G.R. Schaffer M.H. Stark G.R. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6583-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), occurs at the peptide bond of a cyanocysteine residue formed by cyanylation of an SH group using 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (48Degani Y. Patchornik A. J. Org. Chem. 1971; 36: 2727-2728Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 49Degani Y. Patchornik A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The reaction occurs under mild conditions and is highly efficient. Cyanylation of the SH group of the cysteine residue causes the carbonyl carbon at an X-cyanocysteinyl linkage to become susceptible to an attack by an OH– acting as a nucleophile (hydrolysis; route 1) (44Takenawa T. Oda Y. Ishihama Y. Iwakura M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cyanocysteine residue can be converted to a dehydroalanine residue by a β-elimination reaction (route 2). The use of a primary amine as a nucleophile results in the formation of an amide bond (aminolysis) both intramolecularly (route 3) and intermolecularly (route 4) (45Ishihama Y. Ito O. Oda Y. Takenawa T. Iwakura M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 3415-3418Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 50Sota H. Hasegawa Y. Iwakura M. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2019-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 51Iwakura M. Nakamura D. Takenawa T. Mitsuishi Y. protein. Eng. 2001; 14: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The route 3 reaction is quite appealing, because it allows the formation of an amide bond between the C terminus of the protein and the N-terminal α-amino group, if the N and C termini are in close proximity in the native structure (Fig. 2). Such head-to-tail cyclization by the cyanocysteine-mediated α-carbon activation reaction is promising because of the success in the intermolecular aminolysis using the route 4 reaction (45Ishihama Y. Ito O. Oda Y. Takenawa T. Iwakura M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 3415-3418Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 50Sota H. Hasegawa Y. Iwakura M. Anal.

It is noteworthy that this method can remove the cysteine residue, whereas one nonnative residue, mostly Cys, remains in the sequence of the final product in the intein-mediated cyclization method. Moreover, the latter method requires the attachment of at least 100 amino acid residues, corresponding to the miniintein sequence (52Mathys S. Evans T.C. Chute I.C. Wu H. Chong S. Benner J. Liu X.Q. Xu M.Q. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 231: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), to the target protein as well as a short linker between the N and C termini, whereas our method requires only the attachment of a linker.FIGURE 2A strategy for backbone cyclization using the cyanocysteine-mediated ligation reaction. A, a distance between the N-terminal α-amino group and the C-terminal carboxyl group of ANLYF is 15 Å. B, the extensions of Ala-(Gly)n – 3-and-(Gly)2-Cys-Ala sequences are attached to the N- and C termini, respectively, by protein engineering. n denotes the linker length between the N and C termini. C, the Cys residue at the C-terminal extension is cyanylated by 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (NTCB). D, in an alkaline environment, the -Cys-Ala residues at the C terminus are excised, and then the peptide bond is spontaneously formed between the Gly residue preceding the cyanylated Cys residue and the N-terminal Ala residue, resulting in the circular protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate the feasibility of our cyclization method for protein stabilization without affecting its biological activity, we used dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR 2The abbreviations used are: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; ANLYF, a M1A/M16N/M20L/M42Y/C85A/M92F/C152S variant of DHFR; linear ANLYF-Gn, ANLYF with the N- and C-terminal extensions of Ala-(Gly)n – 3-and-(Gly)2-Cys-Ala residues, respectively (n = 6–8); circular ANLYF-Gn, ANLYF with the C and N termini cross-linked by the linker of the -Gly-Gly-Ala-(Gly)n – 3-sequence (n = 6–8); CPP, carboxypeptidase P; DHF, dihydrofolate; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; Lys-EP, Achromobacter protease I (lysine-specific endopeptidase); SVD, singular value decomposition; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; ANLYF, a M1A/M16N/M20L/M42Y/C85A/M92F/C152S variant of DHFR; linear ANLYF-Gn, ANLYF with the N- and C-terminal extensions of Ala-(Gly)n – 3-and-(Gly)2-Cys-Ala residues, respectively (n = 6–8); circular ANLYF-Gn, ANLYF with the C and N termini cross-linked by the linker of the -Gly-Gly-Ala-(Gly)n – 3-sequence (n = 6–8); CPP, carboxypeptidase P; DHF, dihydrofolate; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; Lys-EP, Achromobacter protease I (lysine-specific endopeptidase); SVD, singular value decomposition; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.; EC 1.5.1.3) from Escherichia coli as a model protein (Fig. 3).

DHFR catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate and is an essential enzyme required for normal folate metabolism in prokaryotes and eukaryotes by maintaining tetrahydrofolate levels needed to support the biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and amino acids (54Blakley R.L. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pteridines. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 191-253Google Scholar). Furthermore, DHFR is a clinically important enzyme not only because it is a target of a number of antifolate drugs, such as methotrexate and trimethoprim but also because it can be used to produce an anticancer drug, l-leucovorin (64Uwajima T. Oshiro T. Eguchi T. Kuge Y. Horiguchi A. Igarashi A. Mochida K. Iwakura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, we have created a methionine- and cysteine-free mutant of DHFR (M1A/M16N/M20L/M42Y/C85A/M92F/C152S), called ANLYF, by introducing seven amino acid substitutions according to the quasi-additive adaptive walking method (65Iwakura M. Maki K. Takahashi H. Takenawa T. Yokota A. Katayanagi K. Kamiyama T. Gekko K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13234-13246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ANLYF has a high activity, with the maximum velocity (kcat) 7.6 times higher than that of the wild type and is resistant to oxidation (65Iwakura M. Maki K. Takahashi H. Takenawa T. Yokota A. Katayanagi K. Kamiyama T. Gekko K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13234-13246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, ANLYF is destabilized compared with the wild-type DHFR by 1.6 kcal/mol. Here we show that this hyperactive mutant of DHFR can be stabilized by backbone cyclization using the cyanocysteine-mediated ligation method without a loss of its high activity. The results indicate that activity and stability of the protein can be separately improved by amino acid substitutions and backbone cyclization, respectively. Chemicals—Methotrexate-agarose affinity resin was obtained from Sigma. DEAE-Toyopearl 650S was from Tosoh Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Restriction enzymes, T4-DNA ligase, Taq polymerase, carboxypeptidase P (CPP), and Achromobacter protease I (lysine-specific endopeptidase (Lys-EP)) were obtained from TaKaRa-Bio, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). The polyacrylamide gradient gel (10–20%) was purchased from Daiichi Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—The hyperactive, methionine- and cysteine-free DHFR, ANLYF, has been constructed previously (65Iwakura M. Maki K. Takahashi H. Takenawa T. Yokota A. Katayanagi K. Kamiyama T. Gekko K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13234-13246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 66Aita T. Iwakura M. Husimi Y.A. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The addition of the N- and C-terminal extensions was carried out by standard PCR methods (67Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Purification of DHFR variants was carried out mainly by methotrexate affinity chromatography after adequate prepurification steps from cell-free extracts as described (68Iwakura M. Furusawa K. Kokubu T. Ohashi S. Shimura Y. Tsuda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE and were stored as precipitates in saturated ammonium sulfate solution at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the mutants was determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficients obtained by the method of Gill and von Hippel (69Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). Cyanylation and Cyclization of Proteins—The stored, precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The collected protein was dissolved in a small volume of buffer A (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 5 mm EDTA) to make a protein concentration of ∼0.3 mm and was purified by gel filtration. Prior to the chemical modification, the protein was treated with 1 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature for at least 1 h and subsequently dialyzed against buffer A to remove dithiothreitol. The protein was then treated with a 100-fold molar excess of 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid in buffer A for 2 h at room temperature. The cyanylation of the C-terminal Cys residue took place at this step (Fig. 2C). Then the pH of the protein solution was raised by gel filtration and dialysis using the 100 mm borate buffer (pH 9.0) in order to accelerate the cyanocysteine-mediated reaction. The reaction products were applied to the DEAE-Toyopearl 650S column to isolate the cyclized protein at neutral pH (see Fig. 4B). Cyclization of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) (see Figs. 4 and 5).FIGURE 5A, expected Lys-EP digestion pattern for linear and circular ANLYF-G6. Expected mass of the fragments is shown. Numbering of the residues is the same as the wild-type DHFR. B, elution profile of the reverse-phase HPLC for the Lys-EP digestion products of linear and circular ANLYF-G6 measured by LC/MS. The observed molecular mass of each peak is shown. The fragment corresponding to each peak was assigned by comparing the expected and the observed molecular masses.

The path length of a sample cell was 1 and 10 mm for the far- and near-UV regions, respectively. Protein concentrations were 5.5 and 55 μm for the far- and near-UV CD measurements, respectively. The mean residue ellipticity (MRE) was calculated using the following equation, MRE=Θ/(C×D×NA)(Eq. 1) where Θ represents the ellipticity in millidegrees, and C, D, and NA are the molar protein concentration, the path length of the sample cell in mm, and the number of residues in the protein, respectively. Enzyme Assay—The activity of DHFR was determined spectrophotometrically at 15 °C by following the disappearance of NADPH and DHF at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 11,800 m–1 cm–1) (70Hillcoat B.L. Nixon P.F. Blakley R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 21: 178-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained 50 μm DHF, 100 μm NADPH, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, MTEN buffer (50 mm 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid, 25 mm tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane, 25 mm ethanolamine, and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.0)) (71Morrison J.F. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5499-5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and the enzyme in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of DHF. Urea-induced Unfolding Transition—The urea-induced equilibrium unfolding transition was monitored in buffer B by the CD ellipticity at 220 nm using an Aviv 62 DS spectropolarimeter. The path length of a sample cell was 2 mm. Protein concentration was 5.5 μm. The urea-induced equilibrium unfolding transition was also measured on an Aviv ATF 105 automated titrating differential/ratio spectrofluorometer from 0 to 7 m urea at an interval of 0.2 m at 15 °C. The transition of linear ANLYF-G7 was measured on an Aviv 14 DS spectrophotometer. The path length of a sample cell was 1 cm. Protein concentration was 2 μm. At each urea concentration, fluorescence or absorption spectrum was measured by scanning from 450 to 300 nm or from 340 to 250 nm, respectively. The excitation wavelength for fluorescence was 292 nm. The bandwidths for the excitation and emission were 2 nm. The series of urea-dependent spectra F(λ, ci) taken in a set of n urea concentration slices {ci} were analyzed using the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm by constructing a data matrix Dm,i, in which the ith column (Dm)i is given by the spectrum F(λm, ci) at a series of m wavelengths (63Arai M. Iwakura M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 337-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The SVD algorithm then expresses this in the following form, D=UWV(Eq. 2) where U represents an m × n matrix, W is a diagonal n × n matrix of singular values sorted in decreasing order, and V is an n × n matrix whose elements measure the proportion of each Ui basis vector attributable to each of the singular values (72Press W.H.

https://openalex.org/W2052544824,"The forkhead associated (FHA) domain-containing protein Smad nuclear interacting protein 1 (SNIP1) has multiple cellular functions, including the ability to interact with DNA-binding transcription factors and transcriptional coactivators. Moreover, we have demonstrated previously that SNIP1 regulates cyclin D1 expression and promoter activity. Here, we identify a new function for SNIP1 as a regulator of ATR checkpoint kinase-dependent pathways in human U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells: SNIP1 is required for p53 induction in response to ultraviolet light treatment and selectively regulates the phosphorylation of known ATR target proteins, including p53, Chk1 and the histone variant H2AX. These activities are independent of its ability to regulate cyclin D1 expression. Significantly, SNIP1 is also required for ATR-dependent functions of the human p14(ARF) tumour suppressor, including its ability to modulate the activity of the RelA(p65) NF-kappaB subunit. This, together with its other described functions, suggests that SNIP1 could have an important role during tumorigenesis and cancer therapy."

In this study, we solved the crystal structure of the HY5 LZ domain and show that the peculiarities in the primary sequence yield unusual structural characteristics. For example, the HY5 LZ domain exhibits a bipartite charge distribution characterized by a highly negative electrostatic surface potential in its N-terminal half and a nearly neutral potential in its C-terminal half. The LZ N-terminal region also contains two consecutive putative trigger sites for dimerization of the coiled coils. In addition, two buried asparagines at a positions 19 and 33 in the HY5 LZ domain display distinct modes of polar interaction. Whereas Asn19 shows a conformational flip-flop, Asn33 is engaged in a permanent hydrogen bond network. CD spectropolarimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments performed with versions of the HY5 LZ domain containing mutations in the a positions yielded further evidence that position a amino acid residues are crucial for achieving an oligomeric state and maintaining stability. However, a low correlation between position a amino acid preference, core packing geometry, and rotamer conformations suggests that the oligomeric state of the LZ domain is not governed entirely by known structural properties.

A major challenge that faces protein chemists is the ability to predict the three-dimensional structures of proteins from their primary amino acid sequences. Because of its simplicity and periodicity, the coiled-coil motif is an ideal model system with which to investigate properties of the protein folding process. In terms of biological function, the coiled coil is one of the most common structural motifs and participates in many cellular processes through the formation of protein-protein interactions.Among coiled-coil proteins, the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) 3The abbreviations used are: bZIP, basic leucine zipper; LZ, leucine zipper; WT, wild-type; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; SeMet, selenomethionine; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CLZ, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Cleucine zipper-like. 3The abbreviations used are: bZIP, basic leucine zipper; LZ, leucine zipper; WT, wild-type; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; SeMet, selenomethionine; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CLZ, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Cleucine zipper-like. proteins play crucial roles in the regulation of transcription. These proteins bind to their cognate DNA elements through their basic regions as they dimerize via their leucine zipper (LZ) domains. The LZ domain consists of an α-helix that contains a series of leucine residues on one face. Two LZ α-helices intertwine to produce a dimeric structure with a slight superhelical twist (1Cohen C. Parry D.A. Proteins. 1990; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The LZ domain consists of n heptad sequence repeats, designated (abcdefg)n (2McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), where positions a and d create the interface between two LZ strands by engaging in hydrophobic interactions, and positions e and g flank the dimer interface by forming electrostatic interactions. The various amino acid positions of the LZ heptad repeat have been shown to play unique roles in determining the specificity (homo- or heterodimer) (1Cohen C. Parry D.A.

Compared with those of human bZIP proteins, the primary structures of A. thaliana LZ domains show unique characteristics, including longer heptad repeats and abundant Asn residues in position a (13Deppmann C.D. Acharya A. Rishi V. Wobbes B. Smeekens S. Taparowsky E.J. Vinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3435-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these unique properties might specify LZ dimers in ways that differ from mammalian bZIP proteins. Dimerization of A. thaliana LZ domains was predicted to be specified by the unique distribution of Asn residues in position a, not by electrostatic interactions between positions e and g in human LZ motifs (13Deppmann C.D. Acharya A. Rishi V. Wobbes B. Smeekens S. Taparowsky E.J. Vinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3435-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).The Arabidopsis bZIP protein HY5 is a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis (14Oyama T. Shimura Y. Okada K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2983-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). HY5 is constitutively nuclear localized to be involved in light regulation of the transcriptional activity of promoters containing the G-box light-responsive element (15Chattopadhyay S. Ang L.H. Puente P. Deng X.W. Wei N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Interaction of HY5 with G-box elements is expected to be mediated by the C-terminal region of the protein, which contains a bZIP domain. The HY5 LZ domain shares common structural features with other Arabidopsis LZ motifs such as the presence of two Asn residues in position a (13Deppmann C.D. Acharya A. Rishi V. Wobbes B. Smeekens S. Taparowsky E.J. Vinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3435-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, HY5 displays some primary structural features that differ from those of other Arabidopsis bZIP proteins: major occupation by leucines of the hydrophobic residues (three of four) of position a and localized distribution of the charged and polar residues in the first three heptad repeats. Thus, we hypothesized that classical notions of dimerization specificity and stability might not apply to HY5 LZ dimers. To investigate the structural basis for the conformational integrity of the HY5 LZ homodimer, we determined its crystal structure at 2.0 Å and characterized the functions of position a amino acids using CD spectropolarimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation. This is the first LZ structure among the Arabidopsis LZ motifs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis—N-terminally acetylated synthetic peptides were purchased from Peptron, Inc. (Daejeon, South Korea). The molecular mass and purity of each peptide were verified by mass spectrometry and analytical high performance liquid chromatography.Cloning and Mutagenesis—To obtain the wild-type (WT) LZ domain of HY5 (amino acids 111-150), PCR was performed using, as a template, the A. thaliana gene that encodes fulllength HY5. PCR fragments generated from the HY5 gene were inserted into the pGEX4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) between the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites.For the production of mutant LZ domains, mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were introduced by PCR using, as a template, the WT LZ domain-containing pGEX4T3-based vector described above. PCR was followed by digestion with DpnI to digest the methylated parental plasmid. The resulting DNA was transformed into XL10 competent cells. All mutant plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Peptide Expression and Purification—The WT and mutant versions of the HY5 LZ domain were overexpressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and grown in LB medium. When the cells reached A600 = 0.8 - 1.0, recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After further incubation for 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 0.1 m NaCl and frozen at -70 °C. When the cell suspensions were thawed, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added, and the cells were disrupted by sonication. The resulting cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 1 h; the clarified supernatants were filtered using 0.45-μm filters (Sartorius AG); and the HY5 LZ domain-GST fusion proteins were purified using a GST affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). After removal of the GST protein by thrombin digestion, the resulting proteins were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex-75 fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) in 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4). The elution flow rate was 1 ml/min. The resulting eluents were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore Corp.). The final protein preparations used in this study were shown to be pure by Tricine/SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1280 cm-1m-1 for each HY5 LZ peptide.The selenomethionine (SeMet)-containing WT HY5 LZ domain was prepared from E. coli strain BL21 grown in M9 medium (16Jansson M. Li Y.C. Jendeberg L. Anderson S. Montelione B.T. Nilsson B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) supplemented with 2 mm MgSO4, 0.4% (w/v) glucose, and 0.1 mm CaCl2. When this culture reached A600 ∼ 0.8 at 37 °C, 100 mg each of Leu, Ile, Val, Thr, Phe, and Lys and 50 mg of l-(+)-SeMet (Sigma) were added per liter of growth medium. The culture was incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C, and the cells were then induced to express the recombinant proteins by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Protein production was allowed to proceed for 4 h at 37 °C, after which the proteins were purified as described above. When the SeMet-containing version of the WT HY5 LZ domain was purified, 5 mm dithiothreitol was added to the buffers used for a native sample preparation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry demonstrated >95% substitution of one Met residue with SeMet.CD Spectropolarimetry—CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectrometer with ∼100 μm protein samples in 5mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) or 5 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) at the Mokpo National University Central Laboratory (Mokpo, South Korea) or at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Ochang, South Korea). A cuvette with a 1-mm path length was used. Each spectrum is the result of the averaging of five consecutive scans. A separate spectrum was generated for the buffer alone, and this spectrum was subtracted from spectra taken in the presence of protein. For thermal denaturation profiles, ellipticity at 222 nm (which allowed us to inspect the peptide backbone region) was measured for each protein construct over a linear temperature gradient of 5-90 °C at a constant scan rate of 1 °C/min. The reversibility of the thermal denaturation was determined by monitoring the return of the CD signal at 222 nm upon cooling from 90 to 5 °C immediately after the thermal unfolding experiments. The thermal transitions were >95% reversible for all recombinant proteins except HM12 and HM13 in 5 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0). The helicity was estimated with the following equation: % α-helicity = (-([θMRW]222 + 2340)/30,300) × 100 (where [θMRW]222 is the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm) (17Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar).Sedimentation Equilibrium—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments with the WT and mutant versions of the HY5 LZ domain was performed at 20 °C in a ProteomeLab XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) using a An-60 Ti rotor and 6-channel centerpieces in the Mokpo National University Central Laboratory. All peptides were dissolved in buffer containing 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) or 5 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0). Samples with an initial A280 of ∼0.13 (∼100 μm) were centrifuged at 30,000 and/or 35,000 rpm. Radial absorbance scans for 10 replicates were collected in continuous scan mode at 280 or 275 nm with a step size of 0.001 cm and a time interval of 4 h. Global fitting of data sets was performed with the program UltraScan Version 8.0 (18Demeler B. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, London2005: 210-229Google Scholar).Crystallization—WT HY5 LZ crystals were grown at 23 °C by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method, mixing 7.5 mg/ml peptide with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 0.1 m BisTris (pH 6.0), 0.1 m MgCl2, and 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystals were equilibrated in cryoprotectant buffer containing reservoir buffer plus 20% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The crystals belong to space group C2, with a = 48.4 Å, b = 24.5 Å, c = 76.3 Å, α = γ = 90°, and β = 100°.Data Collection and Structure Determination—The diffraction data were collected at the 4A and 6B beam lines of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory and processed using the HKL package (see Table 1). The three-dimensional structure was determined by combining the three-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set from an SeMet-containing crystal and by single isomorphous replacement analysis using the SeMet crystal as a derivative. Two ordered selenium sites were identified from remote and native data sets using the program SAPI (19Hao Q. Gu Y.X. Yao J.X. Zheng C.D. Fan H.F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1274-1276Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Phasing and density modifications were carried out using MLPHARE (20Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering. Science and Engineering Research Council, Daresbury, United Kingdom1991: 80-86Google Scholar) and RESOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). Ninety percent of the amino acid residues were placed by the automatic modeling procedure of RESOLVE. Iterative cycles of manual model building and refinement were carried out using the programs O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

All non-glycine amino acid residues were located in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot calculated with the refined model.TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics for the SeMet-containing HY5 LZ domainNativeSeleniumData collectionSpace groupC2C2Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)48.3, 24.5, 76.548.4, 24.5, 76.3α, β, γ90.0°, 100.0°, 90.0°90.0°, 100.0°, 90.0°PeakInflectionRemoteWavelength1.127140.978800.978950.97114Resolution (Å)2.02.12.12.1RsymaThe highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.9.5 (39.2)5.6 (11.1)5.7 (11.0)5.8 (11.6)I/σI12.845.546.045.0Completeness (%)aThe highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.97.7 (87.8)97.5 (95.4)97.5 (96.5)97.4 (98.1)Redundancy2.94.34.64.8RefinementResolution (Å)20.0-2.0No. reflections (works/test)5059/621Rwork/Rfree24.3/29.6No. atomsProtein694Water102B-factorsProtein36.6Water47.9r.m.s.bRoot mean square. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.007Bond angles1.24°a The highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.b Root mean square. Open table in a new tab RESULTSOverall Structure of the HY5 LZ Homodimer—A peptide corresponding to the LZ fragment (residues 111-150) of Arabidopsis HY5 with additional N-terminal Gly and Ser residues was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. The HY5 LZ crystals belong to space group C2 and contain two monomers in the asymmetrical unit with a dimer formed around the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis. The HY5 LZ crystal structure was determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion methods using a peptide containing SeMet. Diffraction data were collected to 2.0 Å from crystals of both the SeMet-containing and native peptides. The structure was refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 24.3% with Rfree = 29.6% over a resolution range of 20.0 to 2.0 Å (Table 1). The current structure includes 42 residues (Fig. 1A) as well as 102 water molecules. The root mean square deviations of bond lengths and bond angles from the idea values were 0.007 Å and 1.24°, respectively (Table 1).The HY5 LZ domain consists of a parallel, two-stranded, α-helical coiled coil (Fig. 1B) with a diameter of ∼18 Å and a length of ∼60 Å. The two α-helices wrapped around one another with a left-handed superhelical twist. Residues 3-41 form an α-helix that makes a 23.9° crossing angle. Because there are just 3.5 residues/α-helical turn, each strand contained 11 turns. The average backbone dihedral angles for the helical region (residues 3-41) are -66.5 ± 8.6° for φ and -40.0 ± 10.0° for ψ. These values are similar to but differ slightly from those measured for the yeast Gcn4-p1 (-63 ± 7° for φ and -42 ± 7° for ψ) (7O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T.

Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar), the dimer interface is formed by the side chains of residues at positions a and d of one monomer and those at positions a′ and d′ of the other (Fig. 1C). This classical intertwined packing has been observed in the Gcn4-p1 (7O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T.

Interhelical electrostatic interactions are formed between an amino acid in position g of a heptad repeat in one helix (gi) and the following amino acid in position e of a heptad repeat in the other helix (ei′+5) of an LZ domain (29Krylov D.

In addition to the expected interhelical salt bridges between residues in positions e and g, intrahelical salt bridges were also predicted to form between the residues in positions c and g: Glu7-Arg11, Glu21-Lys18, and Glu21-Arg25 for strand A and Glu21-Lys18 and Glu21-Arg25 for strand B (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Electrostatic interactions of the HY5 LZ homodimer.

Solid and dashed gray lines indicate electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged residues and hydrogen bonds, respectively. Boxed amino acid residues are within the putative trigger sites. The intrahelical hydrogen bond between Leu8 and Glu9 in strand B was omitted for simplicity.

All positively charged residues and some negatively charged residues that interact with positive charges are labeled. Surface potentials were calculated using GRASP (59Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B.

Specifically, in the first three repeats, all of the residues in positions c and e are negatively charged, whereas all of the residues in positions b and g are either positively charged or polar. Because of the localized charge distribution along each helix, 8 of 10 intra/interhelical ion pairs occur in the N-terminal half of the HY5 LZ domain. Accordingly, the occurrence of a negative charge-rich region in the N-terminal half of the helix gives rise to a highly negative electrostatic surface potential, whereas the C-terminal half shows low electrostatic potential (Fig. 2B). Electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged residues provide local charge compensation in three different regions around the positively charged residues Arg11, Lys18/Arg25, and Arg37, which correspond to the N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains of the helix, respectively. Of six positively charged residues in one strand, two are not involved in electrostatic interactions because of their positions in the helix and the orientation of their side chains. Specifically, the side chain of Lys13 stretches out to the exterior of the helix, thus avoiding the formation of a salt bridge with neighboring negatively charged residues, whereas Lys41 is not positioned near any negatively charged residues, thus rendering Lys41 incapable of forming an ion pair. Despite the net charge of +1 for the complete HY5 LZ domain, localized charge distributions allow the negatively charged N-terminal half of the helix to be distinguishable from the C-terminal half. This is the first LZ domain that shows such a localized charge distribution and thus a bipartite electrostatic surface potential.In general, charges are sufficiently delocalized such that repulsive interactions do not interfere with the conformation (folding and orientation) of LZ domains (7O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 32Mittl P.R. Deillon C. Sargent D. Liu N. Klauser S. Thomas R.M. Gutte B. Grutter M.G. Proc.

In the case of the HY5 LZ domain, however, a highly localized negative electrostatic potential seems to lead to unfavorable electrostatic repulsion in its N-terminal half. It is noteworthy that the negative charge-rich region in the"
