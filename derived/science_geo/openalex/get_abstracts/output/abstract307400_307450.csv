Both digital and analog computers are useful in constructing accurate pictures of the types that do not occur."
https://openalex.org/W1981520208,"This study provides a clear example of female-mimicking behavior by males in insects and evaluates quantitatively the adaptive significance of this behavior, which is poorly understood in many other organisms. Males of Hylobittacus apicalis provide females with a prey arthropod during copulation. Some males mimic female behavior when interacting with males that have captured nuptial prey, resulting in males stealing prey which they will use for copulation. Males that pirate prey copulate more frequently and probably incur fewer predation-related risks."
https://openalex.org/W2093553539,The composition and morphology of magnetite in CI carbonaceous meteorites appear incompatible with a nebular origin. Mineralization on the meteorite parent body is a more plausible mode of formation. The iodine-xenon age of this material therefore dates an episode of secondary mineralization on a planetesimal rather than the epoch of condensation in the primitive solar nebula.

https://openalex.org/W2056122984,"A nepheloid layer has been observed by optical means in the lower part of the water column on the continental slope and rise. By sampling it has been found to be a suspension of lutite, apparently in sufficient quantity to induce downslope flow. Sediment transported in the nepheloid layer may be a major component of deep-sea sediment bodies."
https://openalex.org/W1965249105,"Precipitation in and around St. Louis was investigated to study urban influences on summer precipitation conditions. Prerain winds were used to define the ""downwind area"" where influences would be greatest, and wind-sorted rains were combined into monthly and summer totals. Seventy-five percent of the 16 rain patterns revealed a rainfall maximization downwind of the city, and the rainfall in the downwind area was 22.7 percent more than the rainfall upwind of St. Louis where no urban influences existed. Various statistical tests of the summer rainfall distribution reveal the downwind rainfall to be significantly greater than elsewhere and supportive of other findings that St. Louis increases rainfall."
https://openalex.org/W2058501046,"Physiographic and stratigraphic evidence supports the regional correlation of two volcanic ash layers with extinct Mount Mazama at Crater Lake, Oregon, and Glacier Peak in the northern Cascade Range of Washington. A radiocarbon age of 12,000 ± 310 years confirms geological evidence that ash derived from the Glacier Peak eruption is substantially older than ash from the Mazama eruption of 6600 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W1984067538,"The initial ratios of neodymium-143 to neodymium-144 in kimberlites ranging in age between 90 x 10(6) to 1300 x 10(6) years from South Africa, India, and the United States are different from the corresponding ratios in the minerals of peridotite inclusions in the kimberlites but are identical to the ratios in the basaltic achondrite Juvinas at the times of emplacement of the respective kimberlite pipes. This correlation between the kimberlites and Juvinas, which represents the bulk chondritic earth in rare-earth elements, strongly indicates that the kimberlite's source in the mantle is chondritic in rare-earth elements and relatively primeval in composition."
https://openalex.org/W2001320093,"Isotope-selective photodissociation of the volatile complex uranyl hexafluoroacetylacetonate . tetrahydrofuran [UO(2)(hfacac)(2) . THF] has been achieved with both a continuous-wave and a pulsed carbon dioxide laser. The photodissociation was carried out in a low-density molecular beam under collisionless conditions. Transitions of the laser are in resonance with the asymmetric O-U-O stretch of the uranyl moiety, a vibrational mode whose frequency is sensitive to the masses of the uranium and oxygen isotopes. Unimolecular dissociation is observed mass spectrometrically at an extremely low energy fluence, with no evidence of an energy fluence or intensity threshold. The dissociation yield increases nearly linearly with increasing energy fluence. At constant fluence the dissociation yield is independent of contact time between the radiation field and the molecule, indicating that the decomposition is driven by laser energy fluence and not laser intensity. The oxygen and uranium isotope selectivities measured in these experiments are nearly those predicted by the ratio of the linear absorption cross sections for the respective isotopes. Thus, essentially complete selectivity is observed for oxygen isotopes, while a selectivity of only about 1.25 is measured for the uranium isotopes. A model presented to describe these results is based on rapid intramolecular vibrational energy flow from the pumped mode into a limited number of closely coupled modes."
https://openalex.org/W2001233305,The thermal stability of siderite (FeCO(3)) was studied by two independent methods in which the oxygen fugacity of the gas phase was controlled by equilibration with graphite. Both series of experiments indicate that siderite decomposes stably to magnetite + graphite between 455 degrees and 465 degrees C at 500 to 2000 bars PCO2 + P(CO).
https://openalex.org/W1988945810,"The origin of the dolomite which occurs beneath the atolls of Funafuti, Kita-daitō-jima, and Eniwetok in the Pacific Ocean can be explained by the reaction of hypersaline brines with transported or buried reef skeletal material. Dolomitization could have taken place at the sediment surface in shallow restricted back-reef lagoons and tidal flats or below the surface by reflux action. Measurements of oxygen isotopes in samples of dolomite can be interpreted as indicating an origin from evaporated, isotopically-heavy sea water."
https://openalex.org/W2075743147,Considerable evidence of diverse kinds has accumulated during the last 6 years indicating that some or possibly most of the stone meteorites come from the moon. Included in these may well be the carbonaceous chondrites of the Orgueil type and this indicates that contamination of the moon with terrestrial water has occurred. This statement does not depend on the carbonaceous matter being of biotic origin. Models for the origin of the moon are consistent with the hypothesis that some contamination of this kind occurred. This conclusion is possible regardless of whether the meteorites come from the moon or not.
https://openalex.org/W2071016997,"The long-chain nature of the polymer molecule, together with the usual broad distribution of molecular lengths, makes it kinetically very unlikely that the molecule will achieve, on crystallization, its thermodynamically most stable form. Under most crystallization conditions a large portion of the polymer molecules crystallize into folded-chain crystals. Only a small fraction of the molecules of lower molecular weight, initially rejected from the growing folded-chain crystals, succeed in achieving the stable, fractionated, extended-chain crystalline form. The physical properties of the resulting polycrystalline structure are very strongly dependent upon the amount and kind of molecular folding which has occurred. In general, folded-chain crystals are tough and ductile and tend to produce low modulus and high elongation, whereas extended-chain crystals are brittle and tend to have higher modulus."
https://openalex.org/W1972902645,"Soft x-ray contact microscopy, utilizing single-shot exposures of ∼60 nanoseconds duration in polymethyl methacrylate, has been realized with a resolution of 300 angstroms. The radiation spectrum is intense in the ""window"" between 23 and 44 angstroms where water is transparent compared to biological materials, and therefore permits viewing of wet samples."
https://openalex.org/W1988092674,"Organically preserved algal microfossils from the Ringwood evaporite deposit in the Gillen Member of the Bitter Springs Formation (late Precambrian of central Australia) are of small size, low diversity, and probable prokaryotic affinities. These rather primitive characteristics appear to reflect the stressful conditions that prevailed in a periodically stagnant, hypersaline lagoon. This assemblage (especially in comparison with the much more diverse assemblages preserved in the Loves Creek Member of the same formation) illustrates the potential utility of Proterozoic microbiotas for basin analysis and local stratigraphic correlation and demonstrates the need to base evolutionary considerations and Precambrian intercontinental biostratigraphy on biotas that inhabited less restricted environments."
https://openalex.org/W2089659370,"The 3- to 4-micron spectra of Mars, recorded with the 200-inch telescope in 1958, were reexamined in order to ascertain whether the minima at 3.58 and 3.69 microns are due to telluric HDO molecules. Solar spectra obtained at Denver and water vapor abundances derived from radiosonde flights during the observing period were used. There seems to be a correlation between the intensities of the 3.58- and 3.69-micron features and the amount of telluric water vapor in the optical path. An important corollary is that there is no evidence for attributing these spectral features to Mars."
https://openalex.org/W1972093138,"Sulfur is the fourth most important plant nutrient. It is shown that as much as 40% of plants, accumulated sulfur is derived from SO/sub 2/ absorbed directly from the air. It is argued that if sulfur emission from coal burning power plants in the Tennessee Valley is curbed by pollution abatement procedures, the total value of crops grown in the region could be reduced by more than $300 million per year."
https://openalex.org/W2072801962,"Pathological effects of Ditylenchus dipsaci and Meloidogyne hapla are related to the disturbance of the auxin balance in the host by the nematode. The parasites produce an auxin inactivator, apparently enzymatic, that enables Ditylenchus dipsaci to stunt host stem apices and Meloidogyne hapla to reduce its galling potential."
https://openalex.org/W2023423345,Interaction between the fold surfaces of polymer crystals can be strong enough to concentrate any mismatch in orientation into a network of dislocations. Direct observation of these networks by diffraction contrast electron microscopy yields strong evidence in favor of polymer crystallization by a regular chain-folding mechanism.
https://openalex.org/W1966427910,"Measurements of the concentrations of 20 fission products in a sample of rain collected at Fayetteville, Arkansas, on 26 October 1964, yielded two ""mass-yield"" curves; one for fresh debris from the Chinese nuclear explosion, and another for older debris. The former curve resembled the mass-yield curve for neutron-induced fission of uranium-235."
https://openalex.org/W1978137313,"Widespread volcanism on Jupiter's satellite Io, if it occurred over the age of the solar system, would quickly reduce the inventory of most common volatiles needed to drive such volcanism. One exception is the volatile element sulfur. It is therefore postulated that sulfur is the driving volatile for Ionian volcanism. Its presence is consistent with a carbonaceous-chondrite-like bulk composition for the original material that formed Io 4.5 billion years ago. The ubiquity of sulfur on Io today demonstrates the importance of this element in the processes that formed its surface."
