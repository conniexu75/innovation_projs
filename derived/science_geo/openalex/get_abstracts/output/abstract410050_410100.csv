https://openalex.org/W2069519394,"Senescent cells accumulate in tissues with age, but it is not known whether they actually cause age-related dysfunction or whether their removal is beneficial. Using a mouse model with a transgene named INK-ATTAC, which allows for the inducible elimination of cells carrying the senescence biomarker p16Ink4a, Baker et al. demonstrate that life-long removal of senescent cells delays the onset of age-related phenotypes. Furthermore, late-life clearance attenuated the progression of already established age-related disorders. This indicates that senescent cells do cause age-related phenotypes and that their removal can prevent or delay age-related tissue dysfunction. Advanced age is the main risk factor for most chronic diseases and functional deficits in humans, but the fundamental mechanisms that drive ageing remain largely unknown, impeding the development of interventions that might delay or prevent age-related disorders and maximize healthy lifespan. Cellular senescence, which halts the proliferation of damaged or dysfunctional cells, is an important mechanism to constrain the malignant progression of tumour cells1,2. Senescent cells accumulate in various tissues and organs with ageing3 and have been hypothesized to disrupt tissue structure and function because of the components they secrete4,5. However, whether senescent cells are causally implicated in age-related dysfunction and whether their removal is beneficial has remained unknown. To address these fundamental questions, we made use of a biomarker for senescence, p16Ink4a, to design a novel transgene, INK-ATTAC, for inducible elimination of p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells upon administration of a drug. Here we show that in the BubR1 progeroid mouse background, INK-ATTAC removes p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells upon drug treatment. In tissues—such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and eye—in which p16Ink4a contributes to the acquisition of age-related pathologies, life-long removal of p16Ink4a-expressing cells delayed onset of these phenotypes. Furthermore, late-life clearance attenuated progression of already established age-related disorders. These data indicate that cellular senescence is causally implicated in generating age-related phenotypes and that removal of senescent cells can prevent or delay tissue dysfunction and extend healthspan."

https://openalex.org/W2067847775,"Measles virus is an aerosol-transmitted virus that affects more than 10 million children each year and accounts for approximately 120,000 deaths. Although it was long believed to replicate in the respiratory epithelium before disseminating, it was recently shown to infect initially macrophages and dendritic cells of the airways using signalling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1; also called CD150) as a receptor. These cells then cross the respiratory epithelium and transport the infection to lymphatic organs where measles virus replicates vigorously. How and where the virus crosses back into the airways has remained unknown. On the basis of functional analyses of surface proteins preferentially expressed on virus-permissive human epithelial cell lines, here we identify nectin-4 (ref. 8; also called poliovirus-receptor-like-4 (PVRL4)) as a candidate host exit receptor. This adherens junction protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily interacts with the viral attachment protein with high affinity through its membrane-distal domain. Nectin-4 sustains measles virus entry and non-cytopathic lateral spread in well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial sheets infected basolaterally. It is downregulated in infected epithelial cells, including those of macaque tracheae. Although other viruses use receptors to enter hosts or transit through their epithelial barriers, we suggest that measles virus targets nectin-4 to emerge in the airways. Nectin-4 is a cellular marker of several types of cancer, which has implications for ongoing measles-virus-based clinical trials of oncolysis."

https://openalex.org/W2031626699,"Non-mammalian vertebrates have an intrinsically photosensitive iris and thus a local pupillary light reflex (PLR). In contrast, it is thought that the PLR in mammals generally requires neuronal circuitry connecting the eye and the brain. Here we report that an intrinsic component of the PLR is in fact widespread in nocturnal and crepuscular mammals. In mouse, this intrinsic PLR requires the visual pigment melanopsin; it also requires PLCβ4, a vertebrate homologue of the Drosophila NorpA phospholipase C which mediates rhabdomeric phototransduction. The Plcb4−/− genotype, in addition to removing the intrinsic PLR, also essentially eliminates the intrinsic light response of the M1 subtype of melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (M1-ipRGCs), which are by far the most photosensitive ipRGC subtype and also have the largest response to light. Ablating in mouse the expression of both TRPC6 and TRPC7, members of the TRP channel superfamily, also essentially eliminated the M1-ipRGC light response but the intrinsic PLR was not affected. Thus, melanopsin signalling exists in both iris and retina, involving a PLCβ4-mediated pathway that nonetheless diverges in the two locations. Contraction of the mammalian iris in response to light has been thought to require neuronal circuitry connecting the retina to the brain. Now King Yau and colleagues report the surprising observation that in a wide variety of mammals, the eye's pupil is intrinsically photosensitive. Iris muscles isolated from nocturnal mammals such as mice — but not from primates — contract when exposed to light through the action of a melanopsin-based signalling pathway that partially overlaps with its retinal counterpart. Previously, the intrinsic pupillary reflex was thought to be an exclusive property of lower vertebrates such as fish, amphibians and birds."
https://openalex.org/W2025514182,"Many natural products contain a C = C double bond through which various other derivatives can be prepared; the stereochemical identity of the alkene can be critical to the biological activities of such molecules. Catalytic ring-closing metathesis (RCM) is a widely used method for the synthesis of large unsaturated rings; however, cyclizations often proceed without control of alkene stereochemistry. This shortcoming is particularly costly when the cyclization reaction is performed after a long sequence of other chemical transformations. Here we outline a reliable, practical and general approach for the efficient and highly stereoselective synthesis of macrocyclic alkenes by catalytic RCM; transformations deliver up to 97% of the Z isomer owing to control induced by a tungsten-based alkylidene. Utility is demonstrated through the stereoselective preparation of epothilone C (refs 3-5) and nakadomarin A (ref. 6), the previously reported syntheses of which have been marred by late-stage, non-selective RCM. The tungsten alkylidene can be manipulated in air, delivering the products in useful yields with high stereoselectivity. As a result of efficient RCM and re-incorporation of side products into the catalytic cycle with minimal alkene isomerization, desired cyclizations proceed in preference to alternative pathways, even under relatively high substrate concentration."

https://openalex.org/W2158358182,"The environmentally present group of chemical phthalates, or phthalate esters, has been recognized as a rising threat to public health, including cancer. While most studies have addressed the estrogenic effects of phthalates in malignancies of the breast and the prostate, little is known about their role in the etiology of hormone-independent cancer. Here we show that treatments with the phthalates n-butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) at 1 μM induced proliferation (BBP, 3.2-fold; DBP, 3.2-fold), migration (BBP, 2.6-fold; DBP, 2.6-fold), invasion (BBP, 2.7-fold; DBP, 3.1-fold), and tumor formation (EC(50): BBP, 0.12 μM; DBP, 0.22 μM) in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). We further demonstrate that phthalates stimulated the cell surface aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and triggered the downstream cyclic AMP (cAMP)-PKA-CREB1 signaling cascade. The pathway led to increased expression of HDAC6, which facilitated nuclear assembly of the β-catenin-LEF1/TCF4 transcriptional complex and transactivation of the c-Myc oncogene. This nongenomic pathway emanated from the phthalate-induced AhR promoted tumorigenesis of ER-negative breast cancer. Collectively, our findings revealed a novel oncogenic mechanism of phthalates in breast cancer independent from their estrogenic activities."
https://openalex.org/W2063043143,"TDP-43 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein with multicellular functions. As a pathosignature protein of a range of neurodegenerative diseases, TDP-43 is also the major component of the polyubiquitinated inclusions in the pathological cellular samples of these diseases. In normal cells, TDP-43 is processed and degraded by both autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome systems. We have found, by microarray hybridization and RT-PCR analyses, that the level of the mRNA encoding the major autophagy component Atg7 is decreased upon depletion of TDP-43 by RNAi knockdown. This decrease of the Atg7 mRNA level could be rescued by overexpression of an siRNA-resistant form of TDP-43, and it appears to be the result of destabilization of the Atg7 mRNA, to which TDP-43 could bind through its RNA recognition motif 1 domain. Furthermore, depletion of TDP-43 with the consequent loss of the Atg7 mRNA/ATG7 protein causes impairment of the autophagy and facilitates the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins as well as the autophagy/ubiquitin-proteasome system substrate p62 in the cells. These data demonstrate the function of TDP-43 as a maintenance factor of the autophagy system, and they suggest the existence of a feedback regulatory loop between TDP-43 and autophagy.

Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3584-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is a highly conserved and abundantly expressed protein among the mammals and invertebrates (2Wang H.Y. Wang I.F. Bose J.

Shen C.K. J. Neurochem. 2008; 105: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Multiple cellular functions have been implicated to be regulated by TDP-43, which consist of but are not restricted to transcriptional repression, RNA processing including splicing, biogenesis of miRNAs, and even translation (reviewed in Refs. 6Wang I.F.

Some of these regulations have been shown to be mediated through the two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) and the C-terminal glycine-rich, prion-like GQN domain (6Wang I.F. Wu L.S. Shen C.K.

Studies have also established that an intact GQN domain, which recruits additional heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNPs), is also necessary for the splicing activity of TDP-43 (2Wang H.Y.

More recently, TDP-43 has been identified as the major pathological signature protein of patients with the frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (10Arai T. Hasegawa M. Akiyama H. Ikeda K. Nonaka T. Mori H. Mann D. Tsuchiya K. Yoshida M. Hashizume Y. Oda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In particular, the metabolism of TDP-43 in the diseased cells of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are misregulated, resulting in the generation of polyubiquitinated, phosphorylated, and caspase-3-cleaved species concentrated in the ubiquitinated inclusions (UBIs) in the cytoplasm and, to a much lesser extent, in the nucleus. Often accompanied with formation of the cytoplasmic UBIs is depletion of the nuclear TDP-43 (10Arai T. Hasegawa M. Akiyama H. Ikeda K. Nonaka T. Mori H. Mann D. Tsuchiya K. Yoshida M. Hashizume Y.

Neurol. 2010; 6: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). A causative role of TDP-43 in the pathogenesis of these diseases is substantiated genetically by the identification of >30 different mutations in its C-terminal GQN domain (reviewed in Ref. 13Pesiridis G.S. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: R156-R162Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of misregulation of the TDP-43 metabolism remains to be examined. Also unclear are the exact roles of TDP-43 in the pathogenesis of diseases with TDP-43(+)UBIs. Both loss-of-function of TDP-43 and gain-of-cytotoxicity, e.g. as caused by the TDP-43(+)UBIs, have been suggested to facilitate the disease initiation as well as propagation (reviewed in Refs. 6Wang I.F. Wu L.S. Shen C.K. Trends Mol. Med. 2008; 14: 479-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Adv.

Regarding the scenario of pathogenesis by loss-of-function of TDP-43, it is interesting to note that knock-out of TDP-43 expression in mice and/or Drosophila could result in defects of early embryonic developments, impairment of the motor function, and decrease of learning ability (15Wu L.S. Cheng W.C. Hou S.C. Yan Y.T. Jiang S.T. Shen C.K. Genesis. 2010; 48: 56-62PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sephton C.F. Good S.K. Atkin S. Dewey C.M. Mayer 3rd, P. Herz J. Yu G. J. Biol.

These studies, among others, have evidenced the importance of TDP-43 in development and/or neuronal function, but they do not provide clues to the role of this protein in TDP-43 proteinopathies on the molecular level. With respect to the metabolism of TDP-43, it is interesting to note that the homeostatic concentration of TDP-43 in normal cells is tightly regulated in vivo, as evidenced by the similar cellular amounts of TDP-43 in between wild type ES cells and mutant ES with knock-out of TDP-43 expression from one of the two alleles (15Wu L.S. Cheng W.C. Hou S.C. Yan Y.T. Jiang S.T. Shen C.K. Genesis. 2010; 48: 56-62PubMed Google Scholar). Similar observation was also made in analysis of transgenic TDP-43 mice, in which the TDP-43 amounts were similar between the heterozygous and homozygous transgenic mice (20Tsai K.J. Yang C.H. Fang Y.H. Cho K.H. Chien W.L. Wang W.T. Wu T.W. Lin C.P. Fu W.M. Shen C.K. J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 1661-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Significantly, TDP-43 has been shown recently to bind and enhance the degradation of its own mRNA (21Ayala Y.M. De Conti L. Avendaño-Vázquez S.E. Dhir A. Romano M. D'Ambrogio A. Tollervey J. Ule J. Baralle M. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2011; 30: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This negative feedback loop provides one route through which the TDP-43 protein could auto-regulate its own cellular concentration. In this work, we present evidence that function of the autophagy system, which is responsible for processing and degradation of the TDP-43 protein, is maintained in part through TDP-43 binding to and stabilization of the mRNA encoding one of the essential components of autophagy. Plasmids encoding FLAG-TDP-43 and FLAG-TDP-43 (ΔRRM1) have been described previously (22Bose J.K. Wang I.F. Hung L. Tarn W.Y. Shen C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28852-28859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding an siRNA-resistant form of TDP-43, TDP-43R, and its derivative lacking the RRM1 motif, TDP-43R (ΔRRM1), were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the third bases of three individual codons in the siRNA-1 target sequence of the corresponding wild type cDNAs. Neuro2A, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, was cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. NSC34, a motor neuron-like cell line (23Cashman N.R. Durham H.D. Blusztajn J.K. Oda K. Tabira T. Shaw I.T. Dahrouge S. Antel J.P. Dev.

Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections of the plasmid DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were performed in six-well dishes with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The RNAi oligonucleotides targeting the Tdp-43 mRNA (siRNA-1, 5′-GGAUCUGAAAGACUAUUUC-3′ (sense); siRNA-2, 5′-CCAAUGCUGAACCUAAGCA-3′ (sense) (25Iguchi Y. Katsuno M. Niwa J. Yamada S. Sone J. Waza M.

(Sequences are available on request.) It should be noted here that ∼50% of the Neuro2A cells transfected with the Tdp-43 RNAi oligonucleotide, but not those transfected with the scRNA oligonucleotide, died at 72 h post-transfection. This toxic effect of Tdp-43 siRNA oligonucleotides on the viability of Neuro2A cells was also noted and reported by Iguchi et al. (25Iguchi Y. Katsuno M. Niwa J. Yamada S. Sone J. Waza M. Adachi H.

For the rescue experiments, the different rescuing plasmids were transfected into Neuro2A cells after 24 h of the RNAi oligonucleotide transfection. Samples were collected at 36 h after the second transfection and analyzed. To induce autophagy, serum starvation of the cells was done for 15 h after RNAi oligonucleotide treatment for 48 h. RNA IPs were performed as described previously (22Bose J.K. Wang I.F. Hung L. Tarn W.Y. Shen C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28852-28859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The poly(A)+ RNAs were used for labeling by biotin according to the standard GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Each of the six sets of labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to a mouse genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). The data treatment and statistical analysis were carried out by using GeneSpring software (version 11.5, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Antibodies used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining included anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), rabbit anti-TDP-43 (GeneTex), rabbit anti-ATG7 (Sigma), rabbit anti-LC3 (Sigma), guinea pig anti-p62 (Progen), and mouse anti-ubiquitin (Millipore). Total proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and hybridized with different antibodies in 5% nonfat milk. For ubiquitin and p62 blot analysis, the total proteins were extracted in the urea buffer as described previously (19Lin M.J. Cheng C.W. Shen C.K. PLoS One. 2011; 6e20371 Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) before gel electrophoresis. Neuro2A cells were transfected either with the scRNA oligonucleotide or siRNA-1 oligonucleotide for 48 h. Actinomycin D (Sigma) was then added into the cell culture medium (5 μg/ml), and cell samples were collected at 3-h intervals. Total RNAs were isolated and analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels, and the intensity of the DNA bands were quantitated using an Alpha Imager 2200 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). The trend lines were drawn using Microsoft Excel software. The p values were calculated by Student's t test. Neuro2A cells grown on coverslips were transfected with either the scRNA oligonucleotide or the siRNA-1 oligonucleotide for 48 h. MG132 was added into the culture medium and incubated for overnight. Separately, untransfected Neuro2A cells were also treated with 10 μm MG132 (Sigma) or 10 mm 3-MA (Sigma) for overnight. For staining, the cells were first washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The coverslips were blocked with 10% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with anti-TDP-43 (1:500; GeneTex) and anti-ubiquitin (1:500; Millipore) diluted in 1% donkey serum at 4° C overnight. The coverslips were washed in PBS three times and incubated with the secondary antibodies for 2 h. The slips were mounted using VectaShield (Vector Laboratories), and the images were scanned in a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. The confocal data were quantitated using the MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). For electron microscopy analysis, the cells were fixed by immersion in a mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2.5% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer. Post fixation was performed in 1% osmium tetraoxide followed by an overnight immersion in 1% uranylacetate dissolved in 50 mm maleate buffer. Standard procedures for dehydration and embedding in spur resin were employed, and thin sections were examined in a TECNI Sprit TWIN FEI electron microscope. To investigate the function of TDP-43 in neuronal cells, we first carried out RNAi knockdown experiments in Neuro2A cells, which is a mouse neuroblastoma cell line (27Olmsted J.B. Carlson K. Klebe R. Ruddle F. Rosenbaum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1970; 65: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The Neuro2A cells were transfected either with scRNA oligonucleotide or with siRNA-1 oligonucleotide, and the total RNAs were isolated and subjected to microarray analysis using the Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array. The TDP-43 knockdown efficiency was >90% in three independent experiments that we carried out. The raw data of the microarray hybridization were analyzed with the GeneSpring software (version 11.5), and a total of 221 differentially expressed genes were identified with a cut-off value of ∼1.5-fold change (p value ≤ 0.05) in cells treated with the siRNA-1 oligonucleotide in comparison with cells treated with the scRNA oligonucleotide. Validation by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of 10 randomly chosen genes indicated that the credibility of the microarray array data stood at 60%. Interestingly, among the genes the expression of which were affected upon TDP-43 knockdown was Atg7 (autophagy-related 7), a gene essential for autophagy and involved in the maintenance of cellular metabolism under physiological conditions (28Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). However, the mRNA levels of other ATG genes, including Atg3, Atg5, and Atg12, did not change in our microarray hybridization analysis. 4J. K. Bose, unpublished data. As shown by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in Fig. 1A, the Atg7 mRNA level was significantly down-regulated, by ∼3-fold, upon treatment of the cells with siRNA-1 oligonucleotide, as shown (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2, left upper panel). The level of the Atg7 mRNA in Neuro2A cells was also decreased upon transfection with the siRNA-2 oligonucleotide that was also capable of knocking down TDP-43 (compare lanes 1 and 2, left panel of Fig. 1B). The down-regulation of ATG7 was also confirmed at the protein level in TDP-43-depleted cells (compare lanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 1A, lower left panel, and Fig. 1B, right panel). To examine whether the decrease of the level of Atg7 mRNA upon TDP-43 knockdown was a general phenomenon, the siRNA-1 was transfected into another two cell lines, NSC34 and NIH3T3, and the Atg7 mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR at 48 h post-transfection. As shown in Fig. 1C, the Atg7 mRNA level was down-regulated in both types of cells treated with siRNA-1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 1 and 3, respectively). To further analyze the lowering of the level of ATG7 by RNAi knockdown of TDP-43, we carried out rescue experiment in which the siRNA-1 oligonucleotide was co-transfected with plasmids overexpressing the siRNA-1-resistant forms of TDP-43, TDP-43R and TDP-43R (ΔRRM1), which lacked the RNA-binding motif RRM1. As seen in Fig. 2, exogenous expression of the full-length TDP-43R (Fig. 2, lane 3), but not TDP-43R (ΔRRM1) (Fig. 2, lane 4), could rescue, albeit not complete, the siRNA-1-induced lowering of the level of either the level of ATG7 protein (Fig. 2A, lane 2) or the Atg7 mRNA (Fig. 2B, lane 2). This data further excluded the possibility of an off-target effect by the siRNA-1 oligonucleotide. The reduction of the amounts of both the Atg7 mRNA and ATG7 protein upon knockdown of TDP-43 could be regulated at the level of transcription, RNA metabolism, or protein processing. In view of the existence of the two RRMs in the TDP-43 polypeptide, we first examined whether TDP-43 could bind to the Atg7 mRNA. RNA IP experiments were performed using total lysates prepared from Neuro2A cells transfected with pEF-FLAG, pEF-FLAG-TDP-43, and pEF-FLAG-TDP-43 (ΔRRM1), respectively. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TDP-43 or anti-FLAG, and the RNAs contained within the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1A, use of anti-TDP-43 enriched Atg7 mRNA in the immunoprecipitate (supplemental Fig. 1A, top panel, compare lanes 2 and 3). In parallel, RNA IP showed that FLAG-TDP-43 could interact with Atg7 mRNA but not FLAG-TDP-43 (ΔRRM1) (supplemental Fig. 1B, top panel, compare lanes 3 and 4). The data of FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 and supplemental Fig. 1 indicated that TDP-43 interacted with the Atg7 mRNA and also maintained its steady-state level. Furthermore, the RRM1 motif was required for this interaction and the rescue effect. Following the observation of binding of TDP-43 to Atg7 mRNA, we first elucidated the time course of the decrease of the Atg7 mRNA level by knockdown of TDP-43. For this, total RNAs were isolated from Neuro2A cells transfected with scRNA oligonucleotide or siRNA-1 oligonucleotide at 12, 18, 24, and 48 h post-transfection and subjected to semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, the down-regulation of Atg7 mRNA became visible at 18 h, and it was most evident at 48 h post-transfection. We then compared the stability of the endogenous Atg7 mRNAs in cells treated with the scRNA oligonucleotide and the siRNA-1 oligonucleotide, respectively. For this, the cells were treated with the oligonucleotides for 48 h and then incubated with 5 μg/ml of ActD. RNAs were isolated from the cells at different time intervals of ActD incubation and analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3B, TDP-43 depletion led to a decrease, by ∼6 h, of the half-life of the endogenous Atg7 mRNA. Thus, it appeared that under normal cellular conditions, the homeostatic concentration of Atg7 was maintained in part through stabilization of its mRNA as mediated by TDP-43. Because loss of ATG7 led to the impairment of autophagy (29Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar, 30Komatsu M. Waguri S. Chiba T. Murata S. Iwata J. Tanida I. Ueno T. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Nature. 2006; 441: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2874) Google Scholar), we tested whether the TDP-43-mediated down-regulation of ATG7 also had a similar effect on autophagy. For this, we first probed the total lysates prepared from control and TDP-43 knockdown cells with antibody against LC3, or microtubule-associated protein light chain 3, the amounts of which reflected the relative autophagic activity in the cells (31Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). As shown in the Western blot of Fig. 4A, RNAi knockdown of TDP-43 in cells cultured in complete medium led to a significant decrease of the amount of LC3-II (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 1 and 3). A decrease of LC3-II upon TDP-43 knockdown was also observed when the serum-free medium was used to culture cells and induce autophagy (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 6 and 8 with lanes 5 and 7). The changes in the patterns of LC3-I and LC3-II on the Western blots were in striking similarity to those occurred in cells with knockdown of ATG7 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that TDP-43 positively regulated the autophagy as mediated through ATG7. We further used electron microscopy to check whether the autophagy system was indeed affected by TDP-43 knockdown. Neuro2A cells transfected with the scRNA and siRNA-1 oligonucleotide, respectively, were cultured in serum-free medium for 15 h, fixed, and examined under the electron microscope. As shown in the histogram of Fig. 4C, treatment of Neuro2A cells with siRNA-1 oligonucleotide resulted in a less number of the autophagosomes in their cytosol (exemplified in the bottom photos, Fig. 4C) when compared with cells transfected with the scRNA oligonucleotide (exemplified in the top photos, Fig. 4C). Finally, we examined the status of ubiquitinated proteins in TDP-43-depleted Neuro2A cells. Ubiquitinated proteins were known to be degraded by both the autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system, or UPS (32Shin J. Arch Pharm. Res. 1998; 21: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 33Pankiv S. Clausen T.H. Lamark T. Brech A. Bruun J.A. Outzen H. Øvervatn A. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there were “cross-talks” between the autophagy and UPS (reviewed in Ref. 35Koga H. Kaushik S. Cuervo A.M. Ageing Res. Rev. 2011; 10: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), such as the inhibition of UPS by impairment of the autophagy (36Korolchuk V.I. Mansilla A. Menzies F.M.

Rev. 2010; 90: 1383-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Longer inhibition of the autophagy even resulted in greater perturbation of UPS (36Korolchuk V.I. Mansilla A. Menzies F.M. Rubinsztein D.C. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Consequently, ubiquitinated proteins would accumulate and form intracellular aggregates if either the autophagy or UPS was impaired with the use of drugs such as 3-MA (autophagy inhibitor) and MG132 (proteasome inhibitor) (36Korolchuk V.I. Mansilla A. Menzies F.M. Rubinsztein D.C. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The formation of the intracellular aggregates was enhanced greatly upon inhibition of both the autophagy and UPS, e.g. with the combined use of Atg6 siRNA and MG132 in cell culture (38Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Gao W. Yoshimori T. Stolz D.B. Ron D. Yin X.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 171: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Notably, knock-out of the Atg7 gene and the consequent impairment of the autophagy in mice also resulted in the accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates in the cells (28Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J.

Nature. 2006; 441: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2874) Google Scholar). Following the above, we carried out immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting analyses of Neuro2A cells that had undergone different treatments inhibiting the autophagy and/or UPS. As exemplified in supplemental Fig. 2, Neuro2A cells transfected with siRNA-1, treated with MG-132, or treated with 3-MA all exhibited higher immunofluorescent anti-ubiquitin signals than the control Neuro2A cells with the scRNA oligonucleotide transfection (supplemental Fig. 2). Also, Neuro2A cells co-treated with siRNA-1 and MG132 accumulated more intracellular polyubiquitinated proteins than the cells with either treatment alone. As shown in Fig. 5A, Neuro2A cells transfected with the siRNA-1 oligonucleotide for 48 h and then treated with 10 μm of MG132 for overnight exhibited enhanced signals of anti-ubiquitin staining and increased number of ubiquitin-positive, cytoplasmic dots in cells with TDP-43 depletion (Fig. 5A, bottom row). Furthermore, the ubiquitin immunoreactivities of Neuro2A cells treated with siRNA-1 or (MG132+siRNA-1) were significantly higher than those treated with the scRNA or (MG132+scRNA), respectively (histogram of Fig. 5A).

https://openalex.org/W2049777179,"Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the excessive deposition of a collagen-rich extracellular matrix. The accumulation of collagen within the lung interstitium leads to impaired respiratory function. Furthermore, smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts within the fibrotic lung contribute to disease progression. Because collagen and smooth muscle cell α-actin are coordinately expressed in the setting of fibrosis, the hypothesis was tested that specific transcriptional regulators of the myocardin family might also regulate collagen gene expression in myofibroblasts. Myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs), through their interaction with the serum-response factor (SRF) on CArG box regulatory elements (CC(A/T)6GG), are important regulators of myofibroblast differentiation. MRTF-A transactivated type I collagen gene reporters as much as 100-fold in lung myofibroblasts. Loss of functional MRTF-A using either a dominant negative MRTF-A isoform, shRNA targeting MRTF-A, or genetic deletion of MRTF-A in lung fibroblasts significantly disrupted type I collagen synthesis relative to controls. Analysis of the COL1A2 proximal promoter revealed a noncanonical CArG box (CCAAACTTGG), flanked by several Sp1 sites important for MRTF-A activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the co-localization of MRTF-A, SRF, and Sp1 bound to the same region of the COL1A2 promoter. Mutagenesis of either the noncanonical CArG box or the Sp1 sites significantly disrupted MRTF-A activation of COL1A2. Together, our findings show that MRTF-A is an important regulator of collagen synthesis in lung fibroblasts and exhibits a dependence on both SRF and Sp1 function to enhance collagen expression."

Like the other complexes, PSI is located in the thylakoid membrane of cyanobacteria, algae, and plants (1Arnon D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1971; 68: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 2Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 12-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). It catalyzes light-driven electron transport from plastocyanin, which is present in the thylakoid lumen, to ferredoxin, which is located in the stroma. With almost 100% quantum efficiency, PSI is considered to be the most efficient light-capturing and energy conversion apparatus found in nature (3Amunts A. Nelson N.

PSI evolved well over 1 billion years ago, probably over 2 billion years ago. It is thought to represent an elaboration of the simple homodimeric type I reaction centers of primordial organisms into the sophisticated machinery that we know from plants and algae (3Amunts A. Nelson N. Structure. 2009; 17: 637-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). During evolution, different groups of photosynthetic organisms colonized diverse ecological niches. As a consequence of adaptation to different environmental conditions, PSI design underwent structural rearrangements, most having to do with the peripheral antenna system. In the lineage that produced green algae and plants, this led to the addition of several specific complexes that enhance the light-harvesting capacity of the system (5Amunts A. Nelson N.

In cyanobacteria PSI exists as a trimer (8Boekema E.J. Dekker J.P. Vanheel M.G. Rogner M. Saenger W. Witt I. Witt H.T. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 283-286Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whereas in plants and green algae, PSI is monomeric and is composed of two moieties: the PSI core complex and an outer antenna system composed of light harvesting complexes (LHCI) (9Lam E. Oritz W. Mayfield S. Malkin R. Plant Physiol. 1984; 74: 650-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PSI core is responsible for light-driven charge separation and electron transfer. It coordinates around 100 chlorophylls and 20 β-carotene molecules. Its primary and tertiary structures are highly conserved among green algae and plants; 14 subunits are present in both types of organisms (PsaA-PsaL and PsaN-PsaO), whereas PsaP is present in plants but so far seems to be absent in algae (4Jensen P.E.

Chem. 2010; 285: 20072-20079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The central part of the core complex is composed of two large proteins, PsaA and PsaB, which binds all of the cofactors of the electron transfer chain (11Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar), except for the last 2 Fe4S4 clusters (FA and FB). These are bound to the peripheral subunit PsaC, which together with PsaD and PsaE forms the docking site for ferredoxin on the stromal side of the membrane (12Jensen P.E. Bassi R. Boekema E.J.

PsaJ is a hydrophobic protein located close to PsaF and plays a role in the stabilization of this subunit conformation (16Fischer N. Boudreau E. Hippler M. Drepper F. Haehnel W. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5546-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

The genes encoding the antenna complexes of PSI of plants and green algae are members of the Lhc multigene family, which also includes the antenna complexes of PSII. These complexes show structural homology in that each Lhc polypeptide has three transmembrane α-helices and coordinates Chls a, Chls b, and different carotenoid molecules (21Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar).

Based on their content of long wavelength Chls (“red forms”) and on their fluorescence emission maxima, the Lhca complexes were divided into three subclasses: “blue Lhca” (Lhca1, Lhca3, and Lhca7) with emission maxima at 682.5–683.5 nm, “intermediate Lhca” (Lhca5, Lhca6, and Lhca8) with maxima between 694.5 and 697.5, and “red Lhca” (Lhca2, Lhca4, and Lhca9) with maxima between 707 and 715 nm (30Mozzo M.

Recently the Lhca/core stoichiometry was estimated using mass spectrometry, suggesting the presence of 7.5 ± 1.4 Lhca subunits per PSI core (35Stauber E.J. Busch A. Naumann B. Svatos A. Hippler M. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Lhca complexes were categorized into three groups; that is, those present in a substoichiometric amount with respect to the core (Lhca2, Lhca5, Lhca6, Lhca8, and Lhca9), those present in a 1:1 ratio with the core (Lhca1, Lhca4, and Lhca7), and Lhca3 present at a 2:1 ratio (35Stauber E.J. Busch A. Naumann B. Svatos A. Hippler M. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting a heterogeneous composition of the PSI-LHCI complex. It was also shown that six Lhca subunits (Lhca1, Lhca4–8) may even assemble in the absence of PSI core complex (33Takahashi Y. Yasui T.A. Stauber E.J. Hippler M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7816-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Wollman F.A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 680: 352-360Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Three structural models of C.r.PSI-LHCI complex have been proposed based on single particle electron microscopy analysis (26Germano M. Yakushevska A.E. Keegstra W. van Gorkom H.J. Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Kargul J. Nield J. Barber J. J. Biol.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4797-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). When compared with higher plant PSI, the C.r.PSI-LHCI particles displayed additional densities, suggesting a larger antenna size. Germano et al. (26Germano M. Yakushevska A.E. Keegstra W. van Gorkom H.J. Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) suggested that about 14 Lhca complexes are associated with the core. Most of them are present on the PsaJ/PsaF side, whereas 2–3 Lhca bind to the PsaH subunit. Kargul et al. (27Kargul J. Nield J. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16135-16141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) proposed that 11 Lhcas are arranged on the PsaG/F/J/K side, but they later revised their model, suggesting that LHCI is made up of six Lhca subunits, four of which are located at the same position as the four Lhcas in higher plants, and two of which are at the PsaH side (37Kargul J. Turkina M.V. Nield J. Benson S. Vener A.V. Barber J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4797-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this work we have purified several PSI (sub)complexes that differ in protein composition, and we have analyzed them via a combination of biochemical, spectroscopic, and electron microscopy (EM) measurements, with the aim of revealing the functional architecture of this complex. A C. reinhardtii strain (JVD-1B[pGG1]) in which a hexahistidine tag had been added to the N terminus of PsaA (38Gulis G. Narasimhulu K.V. Fox L.N. Redding K.E. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 96: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was grown in liquid Tris-acetate-phosphate medium (39Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at room temperature (25 °C) on a rotary shaker under an illumination flux of 10 μmol of photons photosynthetically active radiation m−2 s−1. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 6 min, 4 °C) in the mid-logarithmic phase (A750 nm ≈ 0.7), and thylakoids were prepared as in Fischer et al. (40Fischer N. Sétif P. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Cells were disrupted by sonication (60 watt power in 10 cycles of 10 s on/30 s off) and centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C). Thylakoid membranes were separated on a discontinuous gradient (24,000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C) in a SW41 swinging bucket rotor as described (40Fischer N. Sétif P. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes were washed 3 times first with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) buffer, then with 5 mm EDTA, and finally with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5). Membranes were resuspended in solubilization buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl) to a chlorophyll concentration of 1 mg/ml, and an equal volume of 0.9% α-dodecylmaltoside (α-DM) was added. Samples were vortexed for few seconds and then centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove unsolubilized material. The supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap HP Column (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 0.03% α-DM, and washed with the same buffer. Elution was carried out with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.25 m imidazole, and 0.03% α-DM. The eluted fraction was loaded on a sucrose density gradient (made by freezing and thawing 0.65 m sucrose, 10 mm Tricine (pH 7.8), 0.03% α-DM buffer) and purified to homogeneity by ultracentrifugation (41,000 rpm, 17 h, 4 °C). The purification of PSI from A.t. was performed under the same conditions used for the purification of the Chlamydomonas PSI, with the difference that upon solubilization the thylakoid membranes were directly loaded on the sucrose gradient. Proteins were analyzed by a SDS-PAGE in a Tris-sulfate buffer system prepared as in Bassi (41Bassi R. Carlsberg Research. Commun. 1985; 50: 127-143Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 3 μg of sample (in Chls) was loaded into each well. Non-denaturing gels were prepared as in Peter and Thornber (42Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a few modifications. The resolving gel contained a 4–10% acrylamide gradient, and 0.01% SDS was added to the upper running buffer. Some of the PSI-LHCI samples were solubilized with 1% β-DM and 0.4% ZWITTERGENT (at a Chl concentration of 0.4 mg ml−1). For mass spectrometry-based protein identification, the green bands were excised from the gel and treated with 10 mm DTT followed by 55 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm NH4HCO3 to reduce and alkylate cysteine residues and subsequently dehydrated by incubation for 5 min in 100% acetonitrile. The gel slices were rehydrated in 10 μl of trypsin solution (Trypsin Gold, mass spectrometry grade, Promega 10 ng/μl in 25 mm NH4HCO3) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently 10 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 was added to prevent drying, and the incubation was prolonged overnight at 37 °C. The tryptic peptides were recovered by three subsequent extractions with 50 μl of 35%, 50, and 70% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The extracted peptides were pooled and concentrated under vacuum. For in-solution tryptic digestion, samples containing around 10 μg of protein were diluted to 20 μl in 100 mm NH4HCO3. For reduction and alkylation, the samples were incubated for 60 min at 55 °C in the presence of 10 mm DTT followed by the addition of iodoacetamide (final concentration of 50 mm) and incubation at room temperature for 30 min. After the addition of 0.5 μg of trypsin, the samples were incubated over night at 37 °C. Fractions of the peptide mixtures from in-gel trypsin digestions were diluted in 5% formic acid, passed through a pre-column (EASY-Column C18, 100 μm × 20 mm, 5-μm particle size, Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany), and separated on a capillary column (C18 PepMap 300, 75 μm × 250 mm, 3-μm particle size, Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) mounted on a Proxeon Easy-LC system (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark). Solutions of 0.1% formic acid in water and a 0.1% formic acid in 100% acetonitrile were used as the mobile phases. A gradient from 4 to 40% acetonitrile was performed in 140 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Eluted peptides were analyzed using a linear ion trap-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo Scientific). MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap in the range from 400 to 1800 m/z, with a resolution of 60,000 (full-width at half-maximum). The 7 most intense ions per scan were submitted to MS/MS fragmentation (35% Normalized Collision EnergyTM) and detected in the linear ion trap. The MS raw data were submitted to Mascot (Version 2.1, Matrix Science, London, UK) using the Proteome Discoverer 1.0 analysis platform (Thermo Scientific) and searched against the C. reinhardtii proteome. Peptide tolerance was set to 10 ppm and 0.9 Da for intact peptides and fragment ions, respectively, using semi-trypsin as protease specificity and allowing for up to 2 missed cleavages. Oxidation of methionine residues, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, and carboamidomethylation of cysteines were specified as variable modifications. The MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications were further validated with the program Scaffold (Version Scaffold_3.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR). Protein identifications based on at least 2 unique peptides identified by MS/MS, each with a confidence of identification probability higher than 95%, were accepted. All assigned spectra used for the spectral count analysis were derived from at least two experiments with the exception of the Lhca content in fraction A4. Room temperature absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 4000 spectrophotometer (Varian). Room temperature and 77 K fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using a Fluorolog 3.22 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon-Spex). The excitation wavelengths were 440, 475, and 500 nm, and excitation and emission slits were set to 3.5 nm. For low temperature measurements, samples were in 66.7% glycerol (w/v), 10 mm Tricine (pH 7.8), 0.03% α-DM. The pigment composition of the complexes was analyzed by fitting the spectrum of the acetone extracted pigments with the spectra of the individual pigments in acetone and by HPLC as described (43Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The data are the results of at least two different preparations. To improve sample purity and contrast in electron microscopy micrographs, the sucrose content of the gradient fractions was reduced by dialysis (2–4 h at 4 °C; Spectra/Por 12–14-kDa cut-off). After dialysis, specimens were prepared for negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate on glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids. Electron microscopy was performed on a Philips CM120 electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 tip, operated at 120 kV. Images were recorded with a Gatan 4000 SP 4K slow-scan CCD camera at 133,000 magnification with a pixel size of 0.225 nm at the specimen level after binning the images. GRACE software was used for semiautomated data acquisition (44Oostergetel G.T. Keegstra W. Brisson A. Ultramicroscopy. 1998; 74: 47-59Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Single particles were analyzed with the Groningen Image Processing software, including multireference and non-reference alignments, multivariate statistical analysis, and classification as previously described (45Boekema E.J. Van Roon H. Van Breemen J.F. Dekker J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To sharpen the final images, limited numbers of projections (500–2000) of homogeneous classes were summed, with the correlation coefficient in the final alignment step as a quality parameter. PSI-LHCI was purified in two steps from a strain carrying a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus of core subunit PsaA. Thylakoid membranes were mildly solubilized, and PSI particles were first purified on a nickel-Sepharose column. To obtain homogeneous preparations of PSI and to check for the presence of PSI complexes with different sizes, the eluted fraction was then subjected to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Two green bands were separated (B1 and B2; Fig. 1A), indicating that the elution contained two populations of complexes differing in molecular mass. These chlorophyll-protein complexes were collected and subjected to biochemical and spectroscopic analysis. The protein compositions of the two fractions were visualized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). The polypeptide profile analysis confirmed the presence of PSI in both fractions. A broad band at high molecular mass corresponds to the PSI reaction center core subunits, PsaA and PsaB, that have an apparent molecular mass of ∼65 kDa and typically migrate as a diffuse band. Bands in the 20–27-kDa range correspond to LHCI antennae and the stromal subunits PsaD and PsaF, whereas those in the 10–20-kDa range arise from small core subunits (10Ozawa S. Onishi T. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20072-20079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Bassi R. Soen S.Y. Frank G. Zuber H. Rochaix J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25714-25721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No bands corresponding to PSII subunits were visible in the gel, indicating that both PSI complexes were free from PSII contamination, as seen before with the unfractionated eluate (38Gulis G. Narasimhulu K.V. Fox L.N. Redding K.E. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 96: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the band pattern was very similar for the two fractions, the ratio between core subunits and Lhca complexes was higher in B1 than in B2, suggesting that the two fractions contain PSI complexes with different antenna sizes. B2 thus represents the largest complex, and in the following it is called PSI-LHCI. B1 is likely the result of a partial disassembly of PSI-LHCI during purification, as indicated by the fact that Lhca complexes were observed in the flow-through of the nickel column (supplemental Fig. S1). However, we cannot exclude that this fraction also contains the assembly intermediate recently observed by Ozawa et al. (10Ozawa S. Onishi T. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20072-20079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine in more detail the protein composition of PSI-LHCI, we performed a mass spectrometry analysis. A shotgun proteomics approach revealed the presence of all nine Lhca proteins (Lhca1–9) and all PSI core subunits, with the exception of PsaI and PsaO. These subunits are likely to be present in the complex but are unidentifiable by tryptic digestion because the resulting peptides would be too short and would not be detectable in our experimental setup. PsaN and PsaJ were not identified in all experiments and were only seen via one unique peptide, so they are not considered in the analysis. The proteomic analysis also confirms the high purity of the preparation (Fig. 1C); 94% of the MS/MS spectra were assigned to peptides originating from PSI or LHCI, with 55% from Lhca polypeptides and 39% from PSI core subunits. Only 6% were due to impurities, of which 4% stemmed from ATP synthase subunits. No PSII or LHCII subunits were detected in the preparation. Pigment analysis indicated a Chl a/b ratio of 4.4 in the purified PSI-LHCI complex (Table 1). The main carotenoids were β-carotene, lutein, and violaxanthin. Loroxanthin was present in low amounts, in agreement with previous results indicating that this xanthophyll is mainly associated with PSII (46Pineau B. Gerard-Hirne C. Selve C. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 39: 73-85Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). No traces of neoxanthin could be detected, consistent with the fact that this xanthophyll is not present in PSI and that the preparation is not contaminated by PSII complexes. The Chl a/b ratio of C.r.PSI-LHCI is far lower than that of the PSI-LHCI complex of higher plants (a/b 8.5–9) (47van Oort B. Amunts A. Borst J.W. van Hoek A. Nelson N. van Amerongen H. Croce R. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 5851-5861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 48Wientjes E. Oostergetel G.T. Jansson S. Boekema E.J. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7803-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We envision two possible origins for this difference: 1) a higher number of antenna complexes associated with C.r.PSI-LHCI as compared with plant PSI-LHCI and/or 2) a higher complement of Chl b in the Lhca complexes of C. reinhardtii as compared with the homologues of higher plants. Both effects probably contribute. Indeed, if the chlorophyll composition of the C.r.Lhca were the same as in higher plants (14 Chls per complex with a Chl a/b ratio of 3.7 (49Wientjes E. Croce R. Biochem. J. 2011; 433: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)), then 48 Lhcas would be needed to explain a Chl a/b ratio of 4.4 in C.r.PSI-LHCI! On the other hand, to explain this value purely in terms of a different affinity for Chl a and b, the C.r.Lhcas would need to have a Chl a/"

This top-down MS method eliminates the need for proteolytic digestion. Instead, it analyzes whole proteins directly in the mass spectrometer to obtain accurate molecular weight measurements of all forms of the protein in the first step. Subsequently, the modified form of the protein can be isolated in the mass spectrometer (like “gas-phase” purification) and fragmented by various tandem MS (MS/MS) techniques for reliable mapping of the PTM sites. Electron capture dissociation (ECD), a nonergodic MS/MS technique, can preserve labile PTMs during its fragmentation process and is, thus, especially suited for studying protein phosphorylation (32Zabrouskov V.

We have extensively studied the basal phosphorylation level of cTnI purified from healthy human and animal heart tissues using such a top-down approach and unambiguously identified Ser22/23 as the basally phosphorylated sites in human, monkey, pig, rat, and mouse cTnI (32Zabrouskov V.

Hyperphosphorylation of Ser42/44 and Thr143 have not been identified in healthy hearts with normal cardiac function. Thus, a comprehensive study of endogenous cTnI modifications in animal models of heart failure is imperative to our understanding of protein kinase-dependent regulation of cardiac contractile dysfunction. Here, we combined top-down high resolution MS/MS, affinity purification, and Western blot analysis to study the phosphorylation of cTnI in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Since its development from Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) in 1963 (43Okamoto K. Aoki K. Jap. Circ. J. 1963; 27: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar), the SHR has been the most extensively studied model of hypertension-induced heart failure (43Okamoto K. Aoki K. Jap. Circ. J. 1963; 27: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar, 44Bing O.H. Conrad C.H. Boluyt M.O. Robinson K.G. Brooks W.W. Heart Fail. Rev. 2002; 7: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similar to patients with hypertension, SHRs progress from persistent hypertension (at approximately 2 months of age) to stable compensated hypertrophy (at approximately 6 months of age) to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure (at approximately 18 months of age) (45Bing O.H. Brooks W.W. Robinson K.G. Slawsky M.T. Hayes J.A. Litwin S.E. Sen S. Conrad C.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 383-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The transition from compensated hypertrophy to heart failure is accompanied by marked changes in cardiac function associated with altered mechanical properties of cardiac myofilaments. In this study, we have thoroughly characterized the PTMs of cTnI from SHR and WKY hearts. Quantitative MS and immunoblot analysis showed augmented phosphorylation of cTnI in SHRs. The top-down ECD MS/MS unambiguously mapped the up-regulated phosphorylation sites to Ser22/23 and Ser42/44. Additionally, immunoblot analysis also revealed up-regulation of PKC-α and -δ, decreased PKC-ϵ, but no changes in PKA or PKC-β levels in the failing SHR myocardium. Our data provide direct evidence of in vivo hyperphosphorylation of cTnI-Ser42/44 sites in an animal model of hypertensive heart failure, supporting the hypothesis that PKC phosphorylation of cTnI may be maladaptive and potentially associated with cardiac dysfunction. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo evidence documenting phosphorylation of cTnI-Ser42/44 in a pathological condition. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless noted otherwise. Protease inhibitor mixture was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. All solutions were prepared in Milli-Q water (Millipore). Male SHR and WKY were purchased from Charles River or Harlan animal research laboratories. Blood pressure was monitored weekly in nonanesthetized animals by the tail cuff method. All animals were handled in accordance with the guidelines of the University of Kentucky Animal Care Committee. Left ventricular tissues were prepared from hearts of 5-week-old and 80-week-old SHRs and age-matched WKY controls. SHR and WKY hearts were removed quickly under deep anesthesia (sodium pentobarbital, 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and rinsed free of blood in ice-cold saline (0.9% NaCl) or Tyrode's buffer. The tissues were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 ºC. Left ventricular tissue was minced into small pieces and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in ice-cold buffer containing 75 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.2), 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, 1 m DTT, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors, as reported previously (46Sfichi-Duke L.

Isolated myofibrils were suspended in a urea-thiourea loading buffer, resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a Hybond-LF membrane (GE Healthcare), blocked for 1–2 h at room temperature in 5% ECF blocking agent (GE Healthcare) and incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-PKA (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-actin (Sigma), anti-cTnI-Ser22/23 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-cTnI (Fitzgerald Industries, Acton, MA) and anti-PKCα, -β, -δ, and -ϵ (Cell Signaling Technology or Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphate-conjugated secondary antibody. Protein bands were detected using ECF substrate (GE Healthcare). Membranes were scanned using a Typhoon-9410 (GE Healthcare). Scans were analyzed using ImageQuant TL software.

The entire purification process was conducted at 4 ºC to minimize the enzymatic activity and preserve the endogenous state. The cTn complex was eluted from CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B conjugated with an anti-troponin I monoclonal antibody (MF4; Hytest) with 100 mm glycine HCl (pH 2). A total of 6–7 eluted samples with 400 ml each were collected into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 40 ml of MOPS (pH 9). The flow-through, wash, and all elutions were analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE for an estimation of concentration before desalting. Purified cTn complexes were desalted with offline reverse phase C18 protein microtrap (Michrom Bioresources Inc.) and eluted with 1% acetic acid in 30:70, 50:50, and 75:25 methanol:water elution buffer. The sample was then introduced to a linear trap/Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) by an automated nanoelectrospray ionization source (Triversa NanoMate; Advion BioSciences, Ithaca, NY) as described previously (33Ayaz-Guner S.

Mass Spectrom. 2010; 21: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 2–3% electron energy and 55-ms duration time were used for ECD. Approximately 2,000 scans with 2 microscans were averaged for each ECD spectrum to ensure data quality. All MS and MS/MS data were analyzed and assigned to rat cTnI sequence (Swiss-Prot P23693, TNNI3_RAT) using in-house developed ion assignment software. The signal:noise threshold was set at 3 and fit factor at 40%. The tolerance for mass error was 10 ppm for precursor ions and 20 ppm for fragment ions, respectively. All reported mass values are most abundant masses. Allowances were made for PTMs such as removal of N-terminal methionine, acetylation, and phosphorylation. The mass lists generated for ECD analysis were manually validated and assigned to fragments with or without modifications. Quantitative analysis was performed as described previously (32Zabrouskov V. Ge Y. Schwartz J. Walker J.W. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1838-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33Ayaz-Guner S. Zhang J. Li L. Walker J.W. Ge Y.

Briefly, the integrated peak heights of the top five isotopomers were used to calculate the relative abundance of each observed protein or fragment ion. The percentages of the mono- (%Pmono), bis- (%Pbis), and tris- (%Ptris) phosphorylated cTnI species are defined as the summed abundances of mono-phosphorylated cTnI (pcTnI), bis-phosphorylated cTnI (ppcTnI), and tris-phosphorylated (pppcTnI) species over the summed abundances of the entire cTnI population, respectively. Equation 1 (Eq. 1) is used to calculate the quantitative value of the total amount of cTnI phosphorylation (Ptotal, mol of Pi/mol of cTnI),Ptotal=%Pmono+2×%Pbis+3×%Ptris/100(Eq. 1) Samples were run in triplicate to ensure technical consistency, and averages were taken for statistical analysis. The percentages of phosphorylation were analyzed and plotted using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t tests were performed between group comparisons to evaluate statistical significance of variance. Differences among means were considered significant at p < 0.05. SHRs develop high blood pressure early on (∼8–10 weeks) and remain hypertensive throughout their lifespan. At ∼80 weeks, SHRs (referred to as SHR-HF hereafter) showed significantly higher systolic blood pressure compared with normotensive WKY (Fig. 1A). SHR-HFs also demonstrated a progressive increase in heart weight and a decrease in body weight compared with age-matched WKY. The ratio of heart weight to body weight is significantly higher in SHRs than that of age-matched WKY, indicating severe hypertrophy (Fig. 1B). We employed immunoaffinity chromatography for the purification of cTn complex from both WKY and SHR-HF left ventricular tissue samples. Representative SDS-PAGE of the affinity purification process is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. As the three subunits of cTn strongly interact with each other, cTnT and cTnC co-elute with cTnI that binds tightly to the anti-cTnI antibody. The three bands at ∼37, 26, and 18 kDa correspond to cTnT, cTnI, and cTnC, respectively. In parallel to SDS-PAGE analysis, the affinity-purified cTn heterotrimer was separated with off-line reverse-phase protein chromatography and analyzed by top-down MS. MS spectra of cTnI from the WKY and SHR-HF groups exhibit large difference in the phosphorylation level (Fig. 2). In WKY, cTnI is present in three forms: un-, mono- and bis-phosphorylated, with mass increment of 80 Da (the mass of added phosphate, HPO3) between each other. The most abundant molecular mass of 24,069.97 Da matches well with the unphosphorylated cTnI based on the rat cTnI sequence (Swiss-Prot P23693, TNNI3_RAT) with the removal of initial methionine and N-terminal acetylation (calculated: 24,069.73 Da). The other two masses, 24,149.93 and 24,229.87 Da, are consistent with mono- and bis-phosphorylated cTnI (calculated: 24,149.69 and 24,229.66 Da), respectively. Evidently, the majority of cTnI exists as unphosphorylated in WKY. Tris-phosphorylated cTnI is not detected in WKY myocardium (which is estimated to be <0.1% of the total cTnI population based on the signal intensity at the expected position of tris-phosphorylated cTnI over the summed intensity of all cTnI protein forms). In contrast, SHR-HF exhibits significant hyperphosphorylation of cTnI. The relative intensity of bis-phosphorylated cTnI is significantly increased in SHR-HF compared with WKY. Tris-phosphorylated cTnI, which has an experimental molecular mass of 24,309.85 Da and is 80 Da larger than the bis-phosphorylated protein, was confidently detected in SHR-HF. The single amino acid polymorphism of S7A reported in our previous study in cTnI purified from Sprague-Dawley rats (48Sancho Solis R. Ge Y. Walker J.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2008; 29: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was not detected in WKY or SHR hearts. To satisfy statistical requirements, we have systematically analyzed cTnI purified from 7 WKY and 7 SHR-HF hearts. Three technical replicates were performed for each sample to ensure data reproducibility and consistency. cTnI from all SHR-HF hearts shows consistently higher bis-phosphorylation than WKY. Percentages of mono- and bis-phosphorylation from WKY and SHR are shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively. The percentages of mono-phosphorylated cTnI (%Pmono) are comparable between WKY and SHR (WKY 34.3% ± 7.6%, SHR 37.5% ± 4.9%, Student's t test p = 0.1825), whereas the percentages of the bis-phosphorylated form (%Pbis) differ drastically between the two groups (WKY 7.2% ± 6.3%, SHR 31.5% ± 8.3%, Student's t test p < 0.001). The tris-phosphorylated form is only present in SHR (%Ptris, 3.7% ± 2.4%). The total amount of cTnI phosphorylation (Ptotal, mol Pi/mol cTnI) is shown in Fig. 3C. The difference between WKY and SHR is of high statistical significance (WKY 0.49 ± 0.06, SHR 1.12 ± 0.07, Student's t test p < 0.001), which shows that SHR cTnIs are hyperphosphorylated compared with WKY. To identify the augmented phosphorylation sites and assess the order of phosphorylation, single charge states of mono-phosph"
https://openalex.org/W2128403978,"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified genetic variants in the promoter region of the high temperature requirement factor A1 (HTRA1) gene associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). As a secreted serine protease, HTRA1 has been reported to interact with members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family and regulate their signaling pathways. Growth differentiation factor 6 (GDF6), a member of the TGF-β family, is involved in ectoderm patterning and eye development. Mutations in GDF6 have been associated with abnormal eye development that may result in microphthalmia and anophthalmia. In this report, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6982567 A/G near the GDF6 gene that is significantly associated with AMD (p value = 3.54 × 10(-8)). We demonstrated that the GDF6 AMD risk allele (rs6982567 A) is associated with decreased expression of the GDF6 and increased expression of HTRA1. Similarly, the HTRA1 AMD risk allele (rs10490924 T) is associated with decreased GDF6 and increased HTRA1 expression. We observed decreased vascular development in the retina and significant up-regulation of GDF6 gene in the RPE layer, retinal and brain tissues in HTRA1 knock-out (htra1(-/-)) mice as compared with the wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, we showed enhanced SMAD signaling in htra1(-/-) mice. Our data suggests a critical role of HTRA1 in the regulation of angiogenesis via TGF-β signaling and identified GDF6 as a novel disease gene for AMD."
https://openalex.org/W1966181824,"Theory predicts that local mate competition (LMC) favors the evolution of female-biased sex ratios. Empirical support of this prediction is indirect and comes from comparative studies or from studies showing that individuals can adjust their offspring sex ratio in response to varying LMC intensities. Replicate lines from a population of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae were selected under three LMC intensities for up to 54 generations. Within each selection regime, the final sex ratio matched theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the ability of individuals to adjust their offspring sex ratio diminished in females evolving under strict LMC, but not in females evolving under relaxed LMC levels. These results provide direct experimental evidence for the evolutionary process by which LMC modifies sex-allocation strategies and suggest that evolution under strict and constant LMC may lead to a loss of phenotypic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2064619348,"First observed by Mary Lea Heger in 1922, diffuse interstellar bands, or DIBs, are dark absorption lines in the spectra of distant stars. More than 500 DIBs are known, but surprisingly none has been convincingly identified with a specific element or molecule. Of the known DIBs, only two have wavelengths beyond one micrometre, but here Geballe et al. report 13 DIBs in the 1.5–1.8 μm interval on high-extinction sightlines towards stars in the Galactic Centre. They appear to originate almost entirely in the Galactic Centre region, a much warmer and harsher environment than that associated with previously observed DIBs. The spectrum of any star viewed through a sufficient quantity of diffuse interstellar material reveals a number of absorption features collectively called ‘diffuse interstellar bands’ (DIBs). The first DIBs were reported about 90 years ago1, and currently well over 500 are known2. None of them has been convincingly identified with any specific element or molecule, although recent studies suggest that the DIB carriers are polyatomic molecules containing carbon3,4,5. Most of the DIBs currently known are at visible and very near-infrared wavelengths, with only two previously known at wavelengths beyond one micrometre (10,000 ångströms), the longer of which is at 1.318 micrometres (ref. 6). Here we report 13 diffuse interstellar bands in the 1.5–1.8 micrometre interval on high-extinction sightlines towards stars in the Galactic Centre. We argue that they originate almost entirely in the Galactic Centre region, a considerably warmer and harsher environment than where DIBs have been observed previously. The relative strengths of these DIBs towards the Galactic Centre and the Cygnus OB2 diffuse cloud are consistent with their strengths scaling mainly with the extinction by diffuse material."
https://openalex.org/W1951890910,"TGF-β family ligands are involved in a variety of critical physiological processes. For instance, the TGF-β ligand myostatin is a staunch negative regulator of muscle growth and a therapeutic target for muscle-wasting disorders. Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of TGF-β family regulation. One form of regulation is through inhibition by extracellular antagonists such as the follistatin (Fst)-type proteins. Myostatin is tightly controlled by Fst-like 3 (Fstl3), which is the only Fst-type molecule that has been identified in the serum bound to myostatin. Here, we present the crystal structure of myostatin in complex with Fstl3. The structure reveals that the N-terminal domain (ND) of Fstl3 interacts uniquely with myostatin as compared with activin A, because it utilizes different surfaces on the ligand. This results in conformational differences in the ND of Fstl3 that alter its position in the type I receptor-binding site of the ligand. We also show that single point mutations in the ND of Fstl3 are detrimental to ligand binding, whereas corresponding mutations in Fst have little effect. Overall, we have shown that the NDs of Fst-type molecules exhibit distinctive modes of ligand binding, which may affect overall affinity of ligand·Fst-type protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2002456594,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide have been implicated in both autophagy and apoptosis. However, the roles of these sphingolipid metabolites in the links between these two processes are not completely understood. Depletion of S1P phosphohydrolase-1 (SPP1), which degrades intracellular S1P, induces the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced autophagy (Lépine, S., Allegood, J. C., Park, M., Dent, P., Milstien, S., and Spiegel, S. (2011) Cell Death Differ. 18, 350–361). Surprisingly, however, treatment with doxorubicin, which by itself also induced autophagy, markedly reduced the extent of autophagy mediated by depletion of SPP1. Concomitantly, doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was greatly enhanced by down-regulation of SPP1. Autophagy and apoptosis seemed to be sequentially linked because inhibiting autophagy with 3-methyladenine also markedly attenuated apoptosis. Moreover, silencing Atg5 or the three sensors of the unfolded protein response, IRE1α, ATF6, and PKR-like eIF2α kinase (PERK), significantly decreased both autophagy and apoptosis. Doxorubicin stimulated calpain activity and Atg5 cleavage, which were significantly enhanced in SPP1-depleted cells. Inhibition or depletion of calpain not only suppressed Atg5 cleavage, it also markedly decreased the robust apoptosis induced by doxorubicin in SPP1-deficient cells. Importantly, doxorubicin also increased de novo synthesis of the pro-apoptotic sphingolipid metabolite ceramide. Elevation of ceramide in turn stimulated calpain; conversely, inhibiting ceramide formation suppressed Atg5 cleavage and apoptosis. Hence, doxorubicin switches protective autophagy in SPP1-depleted cells to apoptosis by calpain-mediated Atg5 cleavage.

Autophagy and apoptosis are important and interconnected stress-response mechanisms. Although apoptotic cell death, known as type I programmed cell death, is a universal process leading to self-killing, autophagy (“self-eating”) is a major protective pathway that usually helps cells to survive various stresses. It is generally considered that autophagy and apoptosis are antagonistic and tend to inhibit each other (1Kroemer G. Mariño G. Levine B. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar). For example, autophagy is induced to protect cells when apoptosis is blocked, whereas autophagy blockade triggers or enhances apoptosis (1Kroemer G. Mariño G. Levine B. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar). However, increased formation of autophagosomes can be associated with autophagic cell death, termed type II programmed cell death, and there is still some controversy about the functional role of autophagy in life and death outcomes (2Eisenberg-Lerner A. Bialik S. Simon H.U. Kimchi A. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 966-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). This functional duality is also apparent during the unfolded protein response (UPR), 2The abbreviations used are: UPRunfolded protein responseATF6activating transcription factor 6Atgautophagy-related geneCHOPC/EBP homologous proteinC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteindndominant-negativeE64dl-3-carboxy-trans-2,3-epoxypropionyl-leu-amido-(4-guanidino-)butane-ethylesterERendoplasmic reticulumFB1fumonisin B1IRE1αinositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endonuclease αLC3microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 33MA3-methyladeninemTORmammalian target of rapamycinPARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerasePERKPKR-like eIF2α kinaseS1Psphingosine 1-phosphateSPP1S1P phosphohydrolase 1siControlcontrol scrambled siRNAsiSPP1siRNA targeted to SPP1. the major ER stress pathway (3Buchberger A.

Although the UPR initially improves folding and degradation of misfolded proteins, if the UPR is overwhelmed, leading to chronic ER stress, apoptosis can be initiated. Hence, multiple connections must exist between ER stress, autophagy, and apoptosis, and the molecular interplay and functional relationship between their pathways are now receiving considerable attention (1Kroemer G.

The sphingolipid metabolites, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its precursor ceramide, have long been implicated as critical regulators of cell fate decisions (4Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Although ceramide is generally pro-apoptotic and activates both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways (reviewed in Ref. 5Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), S1P has been linked to cell survival and suppression of apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 6Alvarez S.E. Milstien S. Spiegel S.

Cancer. 2010; 10: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that these sphingolipid metabolites are also important regulators of ER stress and autophagy. Elevation of ceramide, either artificially by treatment with short-chain ceramides or with the anti-cancer drug tamoxifen, leads to autophagic cell death triggered by Beclin 1 or by inhibition of Akt phosphorylation (8Scarlatti F. Bauvy C. Ventruti A. Sala G. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Ghidoni R. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18384-18391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Similarly, ceramide sensitized multiple cancer cell lines to apoptosis induced by the commonly used anti-cancer drug doxorubicin by promoting AMP kinase activation and mTORC1 inhibition (9Ji C. Yang B. Yang Y.L. He S.H. Miao D.S. He L. Bi Z.G. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 6557-6568Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, increasing S1P by overexpression of sphingosine kinase 1 (10Lavieu G. Scarlatti F. Sala G. Carpentier S. Levade T. Ghidoni R. Botti J. Codogno P. J. Biol.

Allegood J.C. Park M. Dent P. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), induced protective autophagy. Thus, it was of interest to examine the possibility that these counteracting sphingolipid metabolites, S1P and ceramide, may be involved in the link between autophagy and apoptosis. The autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) product, which is required for the formation of autophagosomes, has been suggested to be a molecular link between autophagy and apoptosis as its cleavage by calpain destroys its pro-autophagic function (12Xia H.G. Zhang L. Chen G. Zhang T. Liu J. Jin M. Ma X. Ma D. Yuan J. Autophagy. 2010; 6: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and produces a pro-apoptotic mitochondrion-permeabilizing fragment (13Yousefi S. Perozzo R. Schmid I. Ziemiecki A. Schaffner T. Scapozza L. Brunner T. Simon H.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1124-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that deficiency of SPP1 enhances doxorubicin-induced, calpain-mediated cleavage of Atg5. Ceramide, whose synthesis is increased by doxorubicin, also stimulated calpain; moreover, inhibition of ceramide formation suppressed Atg5 cleavage as well as the robust apoptosis induced by doxorubicin in SPP1-deficient cells. Thus, doxorubicin switches autophagy in SPP1-depleted cells to apoptosis by calpain-mediated Atg5 cleavage. Cell culture medium and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Doxorubicin, l-3-carboxy-trans-2,3-epoxypropionyl-leu-amido-(4-guanidino-)butane-ethylester (E64d), and 3-methyladenine (3MA) were purchased from Sigma.

Myc-tagged dominant negative PERK (dnPERK) was from J. A. Diehl (University of Pennsylvania). Human breast cancer MCF7 and MB-MDA-231 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in phenol red-free improved minimum essential medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.25% glucose as described (11Lépine S.

Allegood J.C. Park M. Dent P. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells were quantified by fluorescence microscopy after labeling with Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml) (11Lépine S. Allegood J.C. Park M. Dent P. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells exhibiting blue condensed or fragmented nuclei were considered apoptotic. At least 300 cells in three independent experiments were quantified with a Nikon Eclipse TE300 fluorescence microscope (Melville, NY). Cell viability was also determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1:500 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transblotted to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated overnight with the appropriate primary antibodies at 4 °C. The appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were added in TBS containing 2.5% nonfat milk. Immunoreactive signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce Chemical Co). Lipids were extracted, and sphingolipid metabolites were quantified by liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS, 4000 QTRAP, Applied Biosystems) as described (14Hait N.C. Allegood J. Maceyka M. Strub G.M. Harikumar K.B. Singh S.K. Luo C. Marmorstein R. Kordula T. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Science. 2009; 325: 1254-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Calpain activity was determined with the Calpain-Glo protease assay kit using a luminogenic succinyl calpain substrate following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Luminescence was measured using a Victor X4 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Experiments were repeated at least three times. Results were analyzed for statistical significance with the Student's t test for unpaired samples, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. We have recently demonstrated that depletion of SPP1 leads to activation of the UPR and ER stress-mediated autophagy in various cell types (11Lépine S. Allegood J.C. Park M. Dent P. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This autophagy has unique characteristics as compared with those of other inducers of ER stress, such as tunicamycin or thapsigargin, as it did not involve p53 and did not trigger apoptosis, even after prolonged periods of autophagy or after inhibition of autophagy. Thus, it was of interest to examine whether this protective autophagy would influence the effects of the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. The high level of autophagy observed in MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells depleted of SPP1, determined by the presence of characteristic punctate fluorescent GFP-LC3 patterns indicating recruitment of LC3 during autophagosome formation, was not altered by treatment with doxorubicin for 6 h (Fig. 1, A and B). Electron micrograph images of SPP1-depleted cells 6 h after doxorubicin treatment confirmed the presence of membrane-bound electron dense structures sequestering cellular components, a distinctive feature of double-membrane autophagosomes, single-membrane autolysosomes, and multivesicular bodies (Fig. 1C). However, after treatment of control siRNA transfectants with doxorubicin for 6 h, GFP-LC3 was observed predominantly as diffuse green fluorescence in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previous studies (15Akar U. Chaves-Reyez A. Barria M. Tari A. Sanguino A. Kondo Y. Kondo S. Arun B. Lopez-Berestein G. Ozpolat B. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 16Muñoz-Gámez J.A. Rodríguez-Vargas J.M. Quiles-Pérez R. Aguilar-Quesada R. Martín-Oliva D. de Murcia G. Menissier de Murcia J. Almendros A. Ruiz de Almodóvar M. Oliver F.J. Autophagy. 2009; 5: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), prolonged treatment of these cells with doxorubicin induced autophagy (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, however, doxorubicin decreased autophagy in SPP1-depleted cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Notably, doxorubicin up-regulated expression of SPP1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). However, in siSPP1-transfected cells, its expression was still markedly down-regulated even after 48 h (Fig. 1D). Immunoblots of doxorubicin-treated control scrambled siRNA (siControl) cells for the autophagy marker LC3 indicated a progressive conversion of the free LC3-I form over 48 h to its lipidated, autophagosome-associated LC3-II form, with a concomitant induction in total LC3 (Fig. 1E). In contrast, conversion to LC3-II in SPP1 down-regulated cells decreased after treatment with doxorubicin (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that autophagy induced by silencing SPP1 in MCF7 cells was not potentiated by doxorubicin, but rather tended to disappear with time. On the other hand, doxorubicin did not annihilate the autophagic process as it was able to induce autophagy in control cells within the same time frame. It has previously been demonstrated that autophagy induced by doxorubicin involves the canonical pathway in which Beclin-1 (also known as Atg6) initiates the generation of autophagosomes by forming a multiprotein complex with class III PI3K and repression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (16Muñoz-Gámez J.A. Rodríguez-Vargas J.M. Quiles-Pérez R. Aguilar-Quesada R. Martín-Oliva D. de Murcia G. Menissier de Murcia J. Almendros A. Ruiz de Almodóvar M. Oliver F.J. Autophagy. 2009; 5: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In agreement, doxorubicin increased Beclin-1 expression and suppressed mTOR activity as demonstrated by inhibition of phosphorylation of its substrate p70s6 kinase (Fig. 2A). The effect of 3MA, a class III PI3K inhibitor, on autophagy was next examined. Interestingly, although 3MA did not inhibit autophagy induced by silencing SPP1, in agreement with our previous findings (11Lépine S. Allegood J.C. Park M. Dent P. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it markedly reduced autophagy induced by doxorubicin in the presence or absence of SPP1 expression (Fig. 2B). The UPR and ER stress-mediated autophagy induced by SPP1 depletion involves the three canonical branches of the UPR: PKR-like eIF2α kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), and IRE1α (11Lépine S. Allegood J.C. Park M. Dent P. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As the role of these branches in autophagy induced by doxorubicin is still not clear (17Kim S.J. Park K.M. Kim N. Yeom Y.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Lai H.C. Yeh Y.C. Ting C.T. Lee W.L. Lee H.W. Wang L.C. Wang K.Y. Lai H.C. Wu A. Liu T.J. Eur. J.

Toxicol. 2010; 30: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), their contributions to autophagy induction by doxorubicin were examined. Doxorubicin enhanced expression of CHOP, a transcriptional regulator that is induced by all three arms of the UPR (Fig. 2A). To examine the involvement of ER stress transducers in doxorubicin-mediated autophagy, cells were transfected with specific siRNAs targeting IRE1α and ATF6, which reduced their expression by more than 90%, or dominant-negative PERK, which blocked phosphorylation of eIF2α (11Lépine S. Allegood J.C. Park M. Dent P. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Both markedly reduced autophagy induced by doxorubicin in the presence or absence of SPP1 expression (Fig. 2C) and decreased conversion of LC3 to LC3-II (Fig. 2D). Altogether, these data demonstrate that although either depletion of SPP1 or treatment with doxorubicin induces ER stress-mediated autophagy, when combined, autophagy was markedly decreased rather than enhanced. Because ER stress-mediated autophagy has been shown to protect against cell death in some conditions (20Ogata M. Hino S. Saito A. Morikawa K. Kondo S. Kanemoto S. Murakami T. Taniguchi M. Tanii I.

This was accompanied by increased cleavage of PARP (Fig. 3B), a substrate for caspase-mediated proteolysis, and increased activation of caspase 7 (Fig. 3B), the main effector caspase in MCF7 cells (23Cuvillier O. Nava V.E. Murthy S.K. Edsall L.C. Levade T. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), as shown by the appearance of cleaved caspase 7. Although apoptosis was undetectable in SPP1-silenced MCF7 cells (11Lépine S. Allegood J.C. Park M. Dent P. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), in the presence of doxorubicin, there was marked enhancement of apoptosis (Fig. 3A) as well as cleavage of PARP and caspase 7 (Fig. 3B). Thus, depletion of SPP1 sensitized the cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. We previously showed that increased activation of the survival signal Akt in autophagy triggered by down-regulation of SPP1 protected cells from apoptosis (11Lépine S. Allegood J.C. Park M. Dent P. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Indeed, the increased phosphorylation of Akt induced by SPP1 depletion was markedly reduced by doxorubicin (Fig. 3B), consistent with our previous observation that inactivation of Akt induced apoptosis of SPP1-depleted cells (11Lépine S. Allegood J.C. Park M. Dent P. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although down-regulation of S1P lyase, another ER-localized enzyme that cleaves S1P irreversibly, also significantly induced autophagy (10 ± 1.3% to 48 ± 10%), it did not sensitize the cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. However, similar to SPP1 depletion, treatment with the ER stress inducer tunicamycin, an N-linked glycosylation inhibitor, which also by itself did not induce apoptosis, significantly enhanced apoptosis (Fig. 4A) and PARP cleavage (Fig. 4B) when combined with doxorubicin. It has been suggested that autophagy can become a death-promoting mechanism when the caspase 3-dependent pathway is blocked (25Gozuacik D. Bialik S. Raveh T. Mitou G. Shohat G. Sabanay H. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Kimchi A. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1875-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because MCF7 cells are devoid of caspase 3 due to functional deletion of the CASP3 gene (26Jänicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar), it was of interest to examine whether SPP1 depletion-mediated autophagy can be switched to cell death by doxorubicin in other types of cancer cells expressing caspase 3, such as HCT116 colon carcinoma cells.

The core components of the microprocessor complex, consisting of Drosha and DGCR8, are both necessary and sufficient for this process, although accessory proteins have been found that modulate the biogenesis of a subset of miRNA. Curiously, many of the proteins involved in miRNA biogenesis are also needed for ribosomal RNA processing. Here we show that nucleolin, another protein critical for rRNA processing, is involved in the biogenesis of microRNA 15a/16 (miR-15a/16), specifically at the primary to precursor stage of processing. Through overexpression and knockdown studies, we show that miR-15a/16 levels are directly correlated to nucleolin expression. Furthermore, we found that cellular localization is critical for the proper functioning of nucleolin in this pathway and that nucleolin directly interacts with DGCR8 and Drosha in the nucleus. Nucleolin can bind to the primary miRNA both directly and specifically. Finally, we show that in the absence of nucleolin, cell extracts are unable to process miR-15a/16 in vitro and that this can be rescued by the addition of nucleolin. Our findings offer a new protein component in the microRNA biogenesis pathway and lend insight into miRNA dysregulation in certain cancers.

Han J. Siomi M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar). Transcripts from miRNA-encoding genes generate primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) that vary in size from one to tens of kilobases and contain a 5′ cap and a poly(A) tail. These pri-miRNA are processed in the microprocessor complex composed of Drosha and DGCR8 into a 60–90-nucleotide pre-miRNA (2Gregory R.I. Yan K.P. Amuthan G. Chendrimada T. Doratotaj B. Cooch N.

After being exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 and Ran-GTP, pre-miRNA are cleaved by Dicer, which transfers the double-stranded RNA to the Argonaut complex to generate the mature miRNA (3Lund E Güttinger S.

The miRNA biogenesis pathway is tightly regulated with numerous other proteins transiently associating with the individual complexes to either stimulate or inhibit processing. For example, transient interaction of p53, p68, and p72 with Drosha increases the processing of a subset of miRNA (6Suzuki H.I. Yamagata K. Sugimoto K. Iwamoto T. Kato S. Miyazono K. Nature. 2009; 460: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 7Davis B.N. Hilyard A.C. Lagna G. Hata A. Nature. 2008; 454: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Negative regulators of miRNA processing include the estrogen receptor, NF45-NF90 complexes, and Lin28 (8Yamagata K. Fujiyama S. Ito S. Ueda T. Murata T. Naitou M. Takeyama K. Minami Y. O'Malley B.W.

Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). The AU-rich binding protein KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) can interact with both the microprocessor and the Dicer complexes and affect their function (11Trabucchi M. Briata P.

Cell. 2011; 41: 371-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The effect of these regulators on miRNA processing can be very specific, as is the case of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, which facilitates the specific processing of miR-18a from the polycistronic miRNA miR-17-92 and Lin28, which blocks the biogenesis of let-7 family miRNA (10Viswanathan S.R. Daley G.Q. Gregory R.I. Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 13Guil S. Cáceres J.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Although KH-type splicing regulatory protein and Lin28 are the only two regulatory proteins known to affect Dicer, most of the transient effectors characterized thus far interact exclusively with the microprocessor complex, suggesting that this may be a critical step in the regulation of miRNA expression. An interesting parallel exists between miRNA biogenesis and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis with a number of proteins having important roles in both pathways. Drosha was originally identified for its role in rRNA biogenesis, cleaving the 48 S pre-rRNA into the 12 S rRNA intermediate (14Wu H. Xu H. Miraglia L.J. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36957-36965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Both p68 and p72 are responsible for cleavage of the 12 S rRNA to generate the mature 5.8 S rRNA species (15Fukuda T. Yamagata K. Fujiyama S. Matsumoto T. Koshida I. Yoshimura K. Mihara M. Naitou M. Endoh H. Nakamura T. Akimoto C. Yamamoto Y. Katagiri T. Foulds C. Takezawa S. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. O'Malley B.W. Kato S. Nat.

Additionally, Dicer has recently been found to associate with the chromatin encoding rRNA (17Sinkkonen L. Hugenschmidt T. Filipowicz W. Svoboda P. PLoS One. 2010; 5e12175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Depletion of either Dicer or Ago2 results in an accumulation of 5.8 S rRNA species, indicating that they are necessary for processing (18Liang X.H. Crooke S.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 4875-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that Drosha co-localizes with nucleolin in the nucleolus to increase the biogenesis of a mouse long non-coding RNA mrhl, which is a 2.8-kb RNA that gets cleaved into an 80-nucleotide RNA that can be further processed into a 21-nucleotide RNA by Dicer (19Ganesan G. Rao S.M. RNA. 2008; 14: 1399-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Strikingly, this pathway, like that of rRNA biogenesis, is very similar to the miRNA biogenesis pathway with regard to proteins and RNA substrates. Nucleolin has long been known as a protein critical for rRNA biogenesis (20Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that it may also have a role as an accessory protein in miRNA biogenesis. Nucleolin is predominantly a nucleolus-localized protein; however, in a number of different cancers, nucleolin is found largely in the cytoplasm (21Otake Y. Soundararajan S. Sengupta T.K. Kio E.A.

Sengupta T.K. Kio E.A. Smith J.C. Pineda-Roman M. Stuart R.K. Spicer E.K. Fernandes D.J. Blood. 2007; 109: 3069-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). When cytoplasmic levels of nucleolin are decreased upon treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid, the levels of miR-15a and miR-16 increase in both acute promyelocytic leukemia cell lines and patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (25Otake Y.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4148-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). miR-15a and -16 have been shown to target bcl-2 mRNA and are greatly decreased in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where nucleolin is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm (21Otake Y. Soundararajan S. Sengupta T.K. Kio E.A. Smith J.C. Pineda-Roman M. Stuart R.K. Spicer E.K. Fernandes D.J. Blood. 2007; 109: 3069-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 27Cimmino A.

We determined how overall expression of nucleolin and its cellular localization impacts miRNA expression. Additionally, we characterized the interaction of nucleolin with components of the miRNA biogenesis pathway and with miRNA directly. All cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). HEK293 and MCF-7 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS. MOLM-13 cells were grow in RPMI with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Antibodies to nucleolin (clone 4E2, MBL International), FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), HA (Roche Applied Science, clone 3F10), Drosha (Cell Signaling, D28B1), GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-32233), PARP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-1019), and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A2228) were obtained from the suppliers indicated. Parthenolide was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Oligonucleotides used in this study were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and are listed in supplemental Table 1. The pCMV2-FLAG-NCL was generously donated by Paula Bates (University of Louisville) and previously described (28Teng Y. Girvan A.C. Casson L.K. Pierce Jr., W.M. Qian M. Thomas S.D. Bates P.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10491-10500Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The tandem affinity purification-tagged DGCR8 expression vector was generated by the Tuschl laboratory and was obtained through Addgene (Plasmid ID: 10921) (29Landthaler M. Yalcin A. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2162-2167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Cells stably transfected with the pCMV2-FLAG-NCL plasmid were selected for 3 weeks with 800 μg/ml G418 and maintained with 200 μg/ml G418. Cells transfected with pFLAG/HA-DGCR8 were selected in 10 μg/ml puromycin for 1 week and maintained with 1 μg/ml. Primary miRNA for in vitro processing assays were reverse-transcribed from cDNA using the SuperScript III first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen), and PCR products included ∼200 nucleotides of the flanking sequences. The gel-purified products were inserted into the pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega) by TA cloning, and inserts were verified by sequencing. Small interfering RNA were purchased from Dharmacon and Sigma-Aldrich and routinely achieved >70% knockdown efficiency. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 with 40 nm siRNA for 48–72 h before knockdown experiments were carried out. RNA was extracted using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed and quantified using the TaqMan miRNA assay kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of RNA was run on a 15% PAGE-urea gel and transferred to BrightStar-Plus positively charged nylon membranes (Ambion, Inc.) by semidry transfer. The membrane was cross-linked using a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene) at 0.12 J/cm2 followed by baking for 30 min at 80 °C. Membranes were prehybridized in ULTRAhyb-Oligo (Ambion) for 30 min at 42 °C before the addition of 106 cpm of 32P-labeled synthetic LNA probes (Exiqon) and incubated overnight at 42 °C. Membranes were washed two times for 30 min at 37 °C in 2× SSC and 0.5% SDS before being exposed on a phosphorimaging screen overnight. Cells were trypsinized and washed three times with PBS. Three packed cell volumes of cytoplasmic extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) were used to resuspend the pellet. After 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.3%, gently mixed, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was saved as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was washed once with 2 volumes of cytoplasmic extraction buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 1 volume of nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was saved as the nuclear extract, and the pellet was discarded. HEK293 cells stably expressing either FLAG/HA-DGCR8 or FLAG-NCL were collected, washed with PBS, and lysed in Nonidet P-40 whole cell extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). 2.5 μg of antibody was added to the 500-μl immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C. RNase A (20 μg/ml) treatments were overnight at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the lysates for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and boiled in 60 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. 20 μl of the boiled beads and 10% of input and supernatant were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with the described antibodies. RNA immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously with slight modifications (30Gilbert S.L. Pehrson J.R. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36491-36494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 10 ml of PBS. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min followed by quenching with 0.25 m glycine for 10 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (5 mm PIPES (pH 8.0), 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were collected by spinning at 2500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once with buffer A without Nonidet P-40. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of buffer B (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.1)) and sonicated. Insoluble material was pelleted at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted into immunoprecipitation buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 167 mm NaCl) and incubated with 5 μg of FLAG antibody overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed once with low salt wash (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash (same as low salt but with 500 mm NaCl), and LiCl wash (0.25 m LiCl 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.1)) and twice with Tris-EDTA buffer. Immunoprecipitated complexes were eluted from the beads by treatment with 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) at 65 °C for 10 min. Samples were reverse cross-linked by incubation for 2 h at 42 °C and 6 h at 65 °C in 0.5× elution buffer plus 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K. RNA was extracted with TRIzol and reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl final volume using the high capacity cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems) with random primers. Following reverse transcription, 5 μl of sample was analyzed by PCR with 500 nm primer concentration, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30–35 cycles before 10 μl of product was analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. The processing assay was carried out as described previously (31Lee Y. Kim V.N. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 427: 89-106PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled primary miRNA were generated using the MAXIscript kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of linearized plasmid was labeled with 32P-labeled UTP. RNA products were gel-purified and eluted in 0.5 m NH4OAc, 1 mm EDTA, 2% SDS overnight at 37 °C followed by ethanol precipitation. All in vitro transcribed probes were made fresh for each experiment. HEK293 cells were treated with siRNA for 48 h before being collected. Cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in in vitro processing lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA), and sonicated. Insoluble material was pelleted by spinning at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. 15 μl of cell extract was mixed with 3 μl of 64 mm MgCl2, 3 μl of labeled pri-miRNA (∼3 × 104 cpm), and 1 unit/μl SUPERase-in (Ambion), and the final volume was brought to 30 μl with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. For rescue experiments, 5 or 10 μl of beads from a FLAG-nucleolin immunoprecipitation was added to the reaction. The reaction was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C before the RNA was extracted with TRIzol LS (Invitrogen). Purified RNA was run on a 12.5% denaturing PAGE and exposed to a phosphorimaging device overnight. To determine whether nucleolin expression impacts the levels of miRNA, nucleolin was knocked down with siRNA, and cancer-associated mature miRNA was assessed by qRT-PCR. As a positive control, Drosha was also knocked down (Fig. 1A). As expected, all mature miRNA were decreased in Drosha knockdown to 25–50% of control siRNA cells (Fig. 1C). In nucleolin knockdown cells, five miRNA were significantly reduced. Because none of the miRNA tested were increased upon loss of nucleolin, we investigated whether nucleolin directly controlled their expression through processing. Primary miRNA levels were analyzed because loss of proteins involved in processing typically causes an increase in primary miRNA, whereas mature miRNA decrease (2Gregory R.I. Yan K.P. Amuthan G. Chendrimada T. Doratotaj B. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2004; 432: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar, 15Fukuda T. Yamagata K. Fujiyama S. Matsumoto T. Koshida I. Yoshimura K.

Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). All primary miRNA increased in Drosha knockdown, whereas only two primary miRNA, miR-15a and miR-16, increased in the absence of nucleolin. This suggests that nucleolin may directly control the expression of these two miRNA, whereas the other miRNA decreased in the absence of nucleolin may be controlled through indirect mechanisms. To determine whether the opposite held true when nucleolin is increased, MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with a CMV-driven expression vector containing FLAG-tagged nucleolin, and miRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR. We were able to achieve an ∼2-fold increase in nucleolin expression (Fig. 1B). Upon overexpression of nucleolin, the levels of mature miR-15a and miR-16 increased ∼2.5-fold (Fig. 1D). Two other miRNA, miR-100 and miR-31, increased significantly with miR-31 increasing nearly 80-fold. This increase may be transcriptionally regulated because the pri-miRNA for miR-31 significantly increased in nucleolin-overexpressing cells. pri-miRNA for miR-15 and miR-16 also increase, however; this may be indirectly regulated through c-Myc. Nucleolin can inhibit c-Myc through formation of a G-quadruplex in the promoter of c-myc, and c-Myc can transcriptionally inhibit miR-15a and miR-16 (32González V. Hurley L.H. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 9706-9714Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Chang T.C. Yu D. Lee Y.S. Wentzel E.A. Arking D.E. West K.M. Dang C.V. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. Mendell J.T. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). An interesting observation was that nucleolin expression inversely correlates to Drosha expression (Fig. 1, A and C). It is possible that this relationship is the way cells compensate for altered ribosome biogenesis as this is a common function between the two. We speculate that upon loss of nucleolin, the cell tries to compensate by increasing Drosha, and whenever nucleolin is plentiful, there is less of a need for Drosha in ribosome biogenesis. Altogether, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that nucleolin plays an ancillary role in the biogenesis of miR-15a and miR-16. Clinical data from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients show that nucleolin is localized primarily in the cytoplasm, which leads to increased bcl-2 mRNA levels (21Otake Y. Soundararajan S. Sengupta T.K. Kio E.A. Smith J.C. Pineda-Roman M. Stuart R.K. Spicer E.K. Fernandes D.J. Blood. 2007; 109: 3069-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because miR-15a and miR-16 are known to target bcl-2 mRNA, we sought to determine whether cytoplasmic nucleolin could lead to decreased levels of miR-15a and miR-16. We found that when MOLM-13 acute myelogenous leukemia cells are treated with parthenolide, a natural product small molecule that affects multiple signal transduction pathways, it induces a dramatic increase in cytoplasmic nucleolin levels (Fig. 2A). Analysis of mature miRNA by qRT-PCR revealed a significant decrease in both miR-15a and miR-16 concurrent with cytoplasmic localization of nucleolin (Fig. 2B). To determine whether treatment with parthenolide decreased the transcription of these miRNA, the pri-miRNA were amplified by PCR. Astonishingly, we found not a decrease but rather an increase in the pri-miRNA precursor of miR-15a and miR-16 (Fig. 2C). Given this finding, we analyzed the precursor species by Northern blot and found that levels of the pre-miR-15 and -16 precursors decreased similarly to that of the mature miRNA following parthenolide treatment (Fig. 2D). These data are similar to that observed when either Drosha or DGCR8 are knocked down, resulting in a decrease of mature species and an increase in the primary precursors (21Otake Y. Soundararajan S. Sengupta T.K. Kio E.A. Smith J.C. Pineda-Roman M. Stuart R.K. Spicer E.K. Fernandes D.J. Blood. 2007; 109: 3069-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although it was clear that nucleolin increased in cytoplasmic localization, it appeared that nucleolin did not decrease in nuclear expression despite the miRNA expression indicating this. Nucleolin normally resides in the nucleolus and is not evenly dispersed throughout the nucleus. Upon activation of p53, nucleolin leaves the nucleolus (39Daniely Y. Dimitrova D.D. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We previously reported that parthenolide potently activates p53 (34Gopal Y.N. Arora T.S. Van Dyke M.W. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 813-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Drosha co-localizes with nucleolin in the nucleolus, and so we hypothesized that the interaction between nucleolin and Drosha is decreased upon relocalization of nucleolin out of the nucleolus. To determine this, MOLM13 cells were treated with parthenolide, and nucleolin was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts. We found that nucleolin interacts with Drosha and that this interaction is disrupted upon treatment with parthenolide (Fig. 2E). From these data, we concluded that nucleolin facilitates the processing of miR-15a and miR-16 likely through the microprocessor complex, which is localized exclusively in the nucleus. Upon cellular stress, nucleolin alters its localization and is spatially separated from the microprocessor complex, which is responsible for the cleavage of primary miRNA to generate the precursor. We suspect that in the absence of nucleolin, the microprocessor can less effectively cleave the primary species, resulting in the observed buildup of the pri-miRNA for miR-15a and miR-16. Conversely, when the acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell line was treated with all-trans-retinoic acid, nucleolin was observed to move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (supplemental Fig. 1A). The increased nuclear localization of nucleolin was accompanied by significant increases in mature miR-15a/16 (supplemental Fig. 1B). The primary miRNA were not increased in these cells following treatment (supplemental Fig. 1C), indicating post-transcriptional regulation. To further validate that nucleolin is involved in the processing of primary miRNA, nucleus-localized nucleolin was induced in MCF-7 cells. This was achieved through treatment of MCF-7 cells with parthenolide. Interestingly, in MCF-7 cells, parthenolide induced nucleus-localized nucleolin, whereas in MOLM-13 acute myelogenous leukemia cells, parthenolide increased cytoplasmic levels of nucleolin (Figs. 2A and 3C). This differential effect was independent of the capacity of parthenolide as a specific HDAC1 inhibitor, which is the same in both cell lines (34Gopal Y.N. Arora T.S. Van Dyke M.W. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 813-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Upon analyzing the miRNA expression in parthenolide-treated and DMSO-treated control cells, there was a substantial (>12-fold) increase in mature miR-15a in parthenolide-treated cells. miR-16 expression also significantly increased in parthenolide-treated cells, albeit to a lesser extent (∼2.5-fold). This could be due to the fact that the steady-state levels of mature miR-16 are over 50-fold higher under normal conditions than miR-15a 4B. Pickering, unpublished observation. and may not be as easily increased as miR-15a. To rule out that all miRNA are altered upon parthenolide (PN) treatment, we also analyzed let-7a expression, which was not altered following changes in nucleolin expression (Fig. 1, B and D). let-7a mature miRNA remain unchanged. To determine whether the large increases observed were truly due to nucleolin and not the effects of parthenolide, nucleolin or RISC-free control siRNA were transfected into MCF-7 cells, and 72 h later, treated with parthenolide. Incredibly, when nucleolin is dramatically knocked down (Fig. 3A, inset), the increase in miR-15a is almost completely ablated as the resulting miRNA levels were close to that of the DMSO-treated cells, whereas the RISC-free control remained comparable with untransfected cells. Similarly, miR-16 in nucleolin knockdown cells decreased significantly from the RISC-free control group following parthenolide treatment (Fig. 3A). We next sought to determine how the primary miRNA precursors of miR-15a and miR-16 were affected by the induced nuclear localization of nucleolin. From the data shown in Fig. 2, we concluded that cytoplasmic nucleolin inhibited the processing of pri-miRNA species as determined by their increase. Upon analyzing the pri-miRNA following parthenolide treatment in either the untransfected or the RISC-free control groups, we observed an absence of pri-miR-15a and pri-miR-16. These data indicate that in the presence of increased nuclear nucleolin, the primary miRNA are efficiently processed into precursor and ultimately mature miRNA, resulting in exhaustion of the p"
https://openalex.org/W2128479500,"How enzymes have evolved to their present form is linked to the question of how pathways emerged and evolved into extant metabolic networks. To investigate this mechanism, we have explored the chemical diversity present in a largely unbiased data set of catalytic reactions processed by modern enzymes across the tree of life. In order to get a quantitative estimate of enzyme chemical diversity, we measure enzyme multispecificity or promiscuity using the reaction molecular signatures. Our main finding is that reactions that are catalyzed by a highly specific enzyme are shared by poorly divergent species, suggesting a later emergence of this function during evolution. In contrast, reactions that are catalyzed by highly promiscuous enzymes are more likely to appear uniformly distributed across species in the tree of life. From a functional point of view, promiscuous enzymes are mainly involved in amino acid and lipid metabolisms, which might be associated with the earliest form of biochemical reactions. In this way, results presented in this paper might assist us with the identification of primeval promiscuous catalytic functions contributing to life's minimal metabolism."

Its gamma-ray luminosity L_gamma = (8.4 +/- 1.6) x10^34 ergs per second, is the highest observed for any millisecond pulsar (MSP) to date, and it accounts for most of the cluster emission. The non-detection of the cluster in the off-pulse phase implies that its contains < 32 gamma-ray MSPs, not ~100 as previously estimated. The gamma-ray luminosity indicates that the unusually large rate of change of its period is caused by its intrinsic spin-down. This implies that J1823-3021A, has the largest magnetic field and is the youngest MSP ever detected, and that such anomalous objects might be forming at rates comparable to those of the more normal MSPs."
https://openalex.org/W2072757906,"Hedgehog (Hh) proteins are morphogens that mediate many developmental processes. Hh signaling is significant for many aspects of embryonic development, whereas dysregulation of this pathway is associated with several types of cancer. Hh proteins require heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) for their normal distribution and signaling activity. Here, we have used molecular modeling to examine the heparin-binding domain of sonic hedgehog (Shh). In biochemical and cell biological assays, the importance of specific residues of the putative heparin-binding domain for signaling was assessed. It was determined that key residues in human (h) Shh involved in heparin and HSPG syndecan-4 binding and biological activity included the well known cationic Cardin-Weintraub motif (lysines 32-38) but also a previously unidentified major role for lysine 178. The activity of Shh mutated in these residues was tested by quantitation of alkaline phosphatase activity in C3H10T1/2 cells differentiating into osteoblasts and hShh-inducible gene expression in PANC1 human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. Mutated hShhs such as K37S/K38S, K178S, and particularly K37S/K38S/K178S that could not interact with heparin efficiently had reduced signaling activity compared with wild type hShh or a control mutation (K74S). In addition, the mutant hShh proteins supported reduced proliferation and invasion of PANC1 cells compared with control hShh proteins, following endogenous hShh depletion by RNAi knockdown. The data correlated with reduced Shh multimerization where the Lys-37/38 and/or Lys-178 mutations were examined. These studies provide a new insight into the functional roles of hShh interactions with HSPGs, which may allow targeting this aspect of hShh biology in, for example, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2125744499,"Vinculin is an essential and highly conserved cell adhesion protein, found at both focal adhesions and adherens junctions, where it couples integrins or cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton. Vinculin is involved in controlling cell shape, motility, and cell survival, and has more recently been shown to play a role in force transduction. The tail domain of vinculin (Vt) contains determinants necessary for binding and bundling of actin filaments. Actin binding to Vt has been proposed to induce formation of a Vt dimer that is necessary for cross-linking actin filaments. Results from this study provide additional support for actin-induced Vt self-association. Moreover, the actin-induced Vt dimer appears distinct from the dimer formed in the absence of actin. To better characterize the role of the Vt strap and carboxyl terminus (CT) in actin binding, Vt self-association, and actin bundling, we employed smaller amino-terminal (NT) and CT deletions that do not perturb the structural integrity of Vt. Although both NT and CT deletions retain actin binding, removal of the CT hairpin (1061-1066) selectively impairs actin bundling in vitro. Moreover, expression of vinculin lacking the CT hairpin in vinculin knock-out murine embryonic fibroblasts affects the number of focal adhesions formed, cell spreading as well as cellular stiffening in response to mechanical force."

https://openalex.org/W2052998306,"Chemoresistance of ovarian cancer has been previously attributed to the expression and activation of Bcl-2 family proteins. BH3-mimetic molecules possessing potential anticancer activity are able to inhibit antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. AT101 (R-(−)-gossypol), a natural BH3-mimetic molecule, has shown anti-tumor activity as a single agent and in combination with standard anticancer therapies in a variety of tumor models. Here, we report the effect of AT101 on apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells and identify the major molecular events that determine sensitivity. AT101 induced cell apoptosis by activating Bax through a conformational change, translocation, and oligomerization. The inhibition of Bax expression only partially prevented caspase-3 cleavage. However, the gene silencing of Bax had no effect on mitochondrial Smac release. Further experiments demonstrated that Smac reduction inhibited caspase-3 activation and attenuated cell apoptosis. More importantly, the inhibition of Smac or overexpression of XIAP attenuated Bax activation in ovarian cells. Furthermore, our data indicate that the Akt-p53 pathway is involved in the regulation of Smac release. Taken together, our data demonstrate the role of Smac and the molecular mechanisms of AT101-induced apoptosis of chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. Our findings suggest that AT101 not only triggers Bax activation but also induces mitochondrial Smac release. Activated Smac can enhance Bax-mediated cellular apoptosis.

Ovarian carcinoma is the leading cause of death among patients with gynecologic cancer (1Salzberg M. Thurlimann B. Bonnefois H. Fink D. Rochlitz C. von Moos R. Senn H. Oncology. 2005; 68: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The three most commonly used treatments for ovarian cancer are surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, with chemotherapy being the predominant mode of treatment. However, as in the treatment of many other cancers, both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance are serious problems in ovarian cancer treatment. Recent evidence suggests that the failure of drug-induced apoptosis may be an underlying cause of drug resistance. Some studies have identified a number of key mediators of apoptosis that are altered in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells (2Asselin E. Mills G.B. Tsang B.K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1862-1868PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fraser M. Leung B.M. Yan X. Dan H.C. Cheng J.Q. Tsang B.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7081-7088PubMed Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family proteins constitute a central checkpoint for apoptotic pathways. The levels of expression and the activation of the Bcl-2 family proteins often play important roles in controlling apoptotic responses to drug treatments, thus modulating the chemosensitivity of tumor cells (4Rudin C.M.

Hu Y.Y. Liu J.R. Gynecol. Oncol. 2005; 96: 287-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These proteins can form multiple BH-3-mediated heterodimeric complexes that modulate their pro- or antiapoptotic properties (6Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). These interactions occur via the BH3 domain, which plays a central role in the control of apoptosis. The ratio between pro- and antiapoptotic members, their conformation, and their subcellular localization constitute major determinants of cell survival. Following an apoptotic stress event, BH3-only proteins translocate to the mitochondria and initiate the mitochondrial cell death pathway by either directly activating Bax-like proteins or indirectly binding prosurvival Bcl-2 family members, thereby releasing the Bax-like proteins (6Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar, 7Borner C. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 615-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Therefore, in ovarian carcinoma, inhibition of the protective function of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to release Bax-like proapoptotic multidomain members seems to be an attractive strategy for either restoring the normal apoptotic process or circumventing resistance to conventional chemotherapy. In this regard, many groups have designed BH3 mimetics that bind and inhibit the function of the antiapoptotic members (8Simonin K. Brotin E. Dufort S. Dutoit S. Goux D. N'diaye M. Denoyelle C.

AT101, a natural product from cottonseed with a BH3-mimetic structure, was identified as a small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Mcl-1 that potently induces apoptosis in various cancer cell lines (9Meng Y.

AT101 is one of the world's first small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitors that has entered into clinical trials and is now in phase II clinical trials for hormone-refractory prostate cancer and other types of cancers (10Liu G.

Preclinical studies revealed that gossypol not only interrupts the interaction between anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins but also induces BH3 protein (such as Puma and Noxa) up-regulation (9Meng Y. Tang W. Dai Y. Wu X. Liu M. Ji Q. Ji M. Pienta K. Lawrence T. Xu L. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or down-regulates XIAP expression (12Sung B.

Thus, gossypol can induce apoptosis by activating apoptogenic factors other than the Bcl-2 family. The small mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac), also known as direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) 3The abbreviations used are: IAPinhibitor of apoptosis proteincyt ccytochrome cMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidePIpropidium iodideKDknockdown. binding protein with low isoelectric point (DIABLO), is a mitochondrial protein containing an N-terminal 55-amino acid mitochondrial import sequence, which is released from mitochondria into the cytosol in response to apoptotic stimuli. Smac promotes caspase activation, presumably by antagonizing IAPs, such as X-linked IAP (XIAP) (13Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial Smac release is suppressed by Akt, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL but promoted by Bax, Bad, and Bid (13Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). Expression of Smac sensitizes human cancer cells to apoptosis induced by a variety of anticancer agents (14Arnt C.R. Kaufmann S.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1118-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and Smac release is a determinant of chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer cells (15Yang X. Fraser M. Moll U.M.

In the present study, we show that Bax was activated during AT101-induced apoptosis of cisplatin-resistant cells. The down-regulation of Bax did not completely inhibit caspase-3 cleavage and did not cause an increase in caspase-3-XIAP interaction. Moreover, knockdown of Bax did not inhibit mitochondrial Smac release or the Smac-XIAP interaction induced by AT101, whereas Smac reduction attenuated Bax activation in ovarian cancer cells. Further experiments indicated that knockdown of Smac inhibited caspase-3 cleavage and partially prevented cytochrome c (cyt c) release following AT101 treatment. Bax and Smac double knockdown inhibited cyt c release. Furthermore, AT101-induced Smac release was dependent on p53 mitochondrial translocation, which was regulated by Akt. These results suggest that Smac potentiates Bax activation and that Smac-mediated Bax activation is a major molecular event in AT101-induced apoptosis in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells.

Despite massive cell death concurrent with treatment, the cultures were maintained for 4–6 weeks by regular changes of culture medium until the surviving cells recovered a normal growth pattern. Next, cisplatin treatment was resumed with elevated drug concentrations (7.5–10 μg/ml). After selection, the chemoresistant variants were treated with cisplatin every month to maintain their high level of chemoresistance. For transfection, cells were seeded on 6-well plates and then transfected with the appropriate plasmid DNA or siRNA using the manufacturers' protocols. Typically, cells were seeded on coverslips in the 6-well plates, and then 1 μg of plasmid DNA or 100 nm siRNA and 4 μl of DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) were used per coverslip. The cells were incubated for 4 h in the transfection mixture, which was then replaced with fresh culture medium. For stable transfection, cells were transfected with the constructs as described previously (20Nie C. Tian C. Zhao L. Petit P.X. Mehrpour M. Chen Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15359-15369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Positive clones were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 for several weeks. Ovarian cell viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in triplicate using a standard procedure (21Yuan Z. Liu H. Yan F. Wang Y. Gou L.

Four methods were used to assess AT101-induced apoptotic cell death: detection of DNA fragmentation with the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science), Western blot analysis of caspase activation, PARP cleavage, and measurement of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry (PI staining for sub-G1). The Cell Death Detection ELISA quantified the apoptotic cells by detecting the histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) generated by the apoptotic cells (17Chen K.F. Yeh P.Y. Yeh K.H. Lu Y.S. Huang S.Y. Cheng A.L. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6698-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Mitochondria and cytoplasm from cells were fractionated by differential centrifugation as described previously (20Nie C. Tian C. Zhao L. Petit P.X. Mehrpour M. Chen Q. J. Biol.

PLoS One. 2011; 6: e20586Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and resuspended in 3 volumes of hypotonic buffer (210 mm sucrose, 70 mm mannitol, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml pepstatin. After gentle homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer, cell lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g to pellet the mitochondria-enriched heavy membrane fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain a cytosolic fraction. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described (20Nie C. Tian C. Zhao L. Petit P.X. Mehrpour M. Chen Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15359-15369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, all cells were harvested by resuspension in CHAPS cell extract buffer (Cell Signaling) and sonicated on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Cytosol extracts were precleared and incubated with antibodies against XIAP, Smac, or Bax with protein A-Sepharose (Invitrogen) to pull down immune complexes. The Sepharose was washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with PBS. Cytosol, mitochondria extracts, total lysates, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot with antibody dilutions as follows: actin at 1:20,000; Puma, Bim, XIAP, p53, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), and Akt at 1:2,000; and caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP, Mcl-1, Noxa, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax cyt c, and Smac at 1:1,000. A2780/CP cells were seeded in 24-well plates with Lab-Tek chamber slides with a cover (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) in 500 μl of medium and incubated overnight. Cells were then treated with AT101 (10 μm) for 24 h, and treated cells were incubated with 200 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in culture medium for 30 min. Medium was removed, and cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde containing 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After rinsing with cold PBS (pH 7.4), cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After blocking with 5% goat serum, antibodies against p53 (Ab-11, Oncogene) (1:70 dilution), cytochrome c (7H8.2C12, BD Pharmingen) (1:100 dilution), Smac (Cell Signaling) (1:100 dilution), or Bax (6A7, Sigma) (1:100 dilution) were added, and the fixed cells were incubated with antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Sigma) (1:128 dilution) for 1 h. After removal of antibodies, cells were rinsed with PBS and mounted with 90% glycerol. Fluorescence was immediately observed using an Olympus DP72 microscope. Bax oligomerization with cross-linking was detected as described previously (20Nie C. Tian C. Zhao L. Petit P.X. Mehrpour M. Chen Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15359-15369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with conjugating buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose. Disuccinimidyl suberate in DMSO was added from a 10-fold stock solution to a final concentration of 2 mm. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with non-reducing buffer, and the cross-linker was then quenched by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 20 mm and incubation at room temperature for 15 min. The samples were then solubilized in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer without a reducing agent and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Bax was detected by Western blot using a Bax polyclonal antibody. For gel filtration analysis of oligomerization, cell lysates were obtained 18–20 h after transfection by lysing the cells in lysis buffer (Buffer A with 2% CHAPS). The composition of Buffer A was 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.1 mm PMSF supplemented with protease inhibitors (5 mg/ml pepstatin A and 10 mg/ml leupeptin). The cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation before centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant, ∼1 mg of total protein as measured by a protein assay (Bio-Rad), was loaded onto an FPLC Superdex 200 10/30 column equilibrated with 100 mm NaCl in Buffer A (with 1.8% CHAPS) and calibrated with the calibration kit provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted at 0.4 ml/min, and fractions (0.6 ml) were collected using a fast protein liquid chromatography instrument. Statistical analysis of the differences between the groups was performed using Student's t test with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. We first determined the growth-inhibitory effect of AT101 on various cisplatin-sensitive (A2780) and -resistant (A2780/CP and OVCAR-3) human ovarian cell lines. As depicted in Fig. 1A, AT101 caused a dose-dependent reduction of cell viability in all ovarian cancer cells regardless of their chemosensitivity. To examine AT101-induced apoptosis, the cells were treated with 10 μm AT101, and apoptosis was confirmed by a DNA fragmentation ELISA at various time points. These results demonstrated that AT101 effectively induced apoptosis in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cells (Fig. 1B). Western blots confirmed cell death through detection of caspase-9 and PARP cleavage in all ovarian cells (Fig. 1C). Flow cytometry analysis with PI staining further revealed that there was no difference in AT101-induced apoptosis between cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant cells (Fig. 1D). To determine whether AT101 modulates the expression level of proteins important in the survival of ovarian cancer cells, we used Western blot analysis. We focused on the expression of anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins because these proteins are the main targets of gossypol (10Liu G. Kelly W.K. Wilding G. Leopold L. Brill K. Somer B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 3172-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). AT101 did not affect the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, or Mcl-1. Similar results were found for Bim and Bax induction after treatment with AT101. Although AT101 up-regulated Puma and Noxa expression to some extent, no apparent trend was found for protein expression (Fig. 2A). A recent report indicated that Bax apoptotic activity results mainly from its mitochondrial translocation, oligomerization, and conformational change (20Nie C. Tian C. Zhao L. Petit P.X. Mehrpour M. Chen Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15359-15369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine whether these changes in Bax also occur following AT101 treatment, ovarian cancer cells were incubated with AT101 followed by separation of the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. As Fig. 2B illustrates, after treatment with AT101, the level of Bax in the cytosol decreased, and it translocated to mitochondria in a time-dependent manner. We next examined Bax oligomerization. Cross-linking and gel filtration analysis showed that oligomerized Bax existed after AT101 treatment (Fig. 2C). We then analyzed the conformational change of Bax during apoptosis using a Bax 6A7 monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the conformational change (20Nie C. Tian C. Zhao L. Petit P.X. Mehrpour M. Chen Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15359-15369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Following AT101 treatment, the Bax conformational change was detected in cells (Fig. 2D). To validate Bax activation in apoptosis, we used A2780/CP cells as a model to detect Bax by immunofluorescence with the Bax 6A7 antibody. AT101 indeed induced the Bax conformational change and translocation (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that Bax activation is involved in AT101-induced apoptosis. To further investigate the contribution of Bax in cell death, we knocked down Bax expression in A2780 and A2780/CP cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, Bax siRNA effectively decreased Bax expression but did not have a major effect on the induction of PARP (caspase substrate) cleavage after AT101 treatment. Meanwhile, upstream caspase-3 activation was not completely prevented in Bax knockdown (KD) cells following AT101 treatment (Fig. 3B). Similar results were found with Bax KD in A2780/CP cells (data not shown). These results suggest that Bax is probably independent of or at least not absolutely required for AT101-induced cell death. Because some studies demonstrated that the XIAP-caspase-3 interaction was abrogated to promote apoptosis and that Bax deficiency maintained the binding between XIAP and caspase-3 (23Deng Y. Lin Y. Wu X. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 24Yu J. Wang P. Ming L. Wood M.A. Zhang L. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4189-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we then determined whether Bax knockdown affects the XIAP-caspase-3 interaction. Positive control immunoprecipitation experiments proved that XIAP binds to caspase-3 in HCT116 cells, whereas XIAP did not bind activated caspase-3 in Bax wild type (WT) or KD ovarian cancer cells, indicating that Bax deficiency does not affect the caspase-3-XIAP interaction (Fig. 3B). Previous results demonstrated that Bax activation induced Smac release from mitochondria and that Smac neutralized the inhibitory activity of IAPs, including XIAP, and allowed caspase activation during cell death (23Deng Y. Lin Y. Wu X. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Smac was involved in AT101-induced procaspase-3 cleavage and enzyme activity. The association between Smac and XIAP was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of cytosol extracts obtained from Bax WT and Bax KD cells before and after AT101 treatment. Analysis of whole cell lysates showed that expression of Smac and XIAP was not affected by AT101 treatment. Previous experiments indicated that cytosolic Smac protein was detected only in treated Bax WT cancer cells and not in Bax KD cells (23Deng Y. Lin Y. Wu X. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), whereas our results showed that cytosolic Smac was observed in both Bax WT and KD cells treated with AT101. More importantly, Smac coimmunoprecipitated with XIAP in these two cell lines (Fig. 3C). Conversely, immunoprecipitation of XIAP also coimmunoprecipitated cytosolic Smac in Bax WT and KD cancer cells treated with AT101 (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the release of Smac from mitochondria to the cytosol enables Smac to interact with XIAP to disrupt the XIAP-caspase-3 interaction, thus allowing caspase-3 cleavage and functional activation. The XIAP-Smac interaction is not dependent on Bax activation in ovarian cell death. Moreover, these results suggest that Smac is probably necessary for AT101-induced cell apoptosis. We then examined whether the release of Smac is necessary for apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells using the A2780 and A2780/CP cell lines. We first examined mitochondrial and cytosolic Smac levels after AT101 treatment. As shown in Fig. 4A, exposure of ovarian cancer cells to AT101 decreased mitochondrial Smac and increased cytosolic Smac levels in a time-dependent fashion. Similar results were found for cyt c release (Fig. 4A). The release of Smac or cyt c in apoptosis was also consistently shown by immunostaining (Fig. 4B). To further study the role of Smac in cell apoptosis, we used siRNA to knockdown Smac expression. As depicted in Fig. 5A, a decrease in Smac expression was confirmed by Western blot. Silencing of Smac significantly inhibited AT101-induced caspase-3 cleavage and attenuated apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 5A). Moreover, overexpression of a Smac heptapeptide (Smac-N7) enhanced AT101-induced cell death (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that Smac, the mitochondrial apoptogenic protein, plays a prominent role in the execution of AT101-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Our data already demonstrated that Smac reduction prevented caspase-3 activation. Recent studies revealed that Smac could influence cyt c release in cell apoptosis (24Yu J. Wang P. Ming L. Wood M.A. Zhang L. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4189-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Hasenjäger A. Gillissen B. Müller A. Normand G. Hemmati P.G. Schuler M. Dörken B. Daniel P.T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4523-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear whether Smac also mediates cyt c release in AT101-induced apoptosis. To determine the relationship between Smac activation and cyt c release in ovarian cells, A2780 and A2780/CP cells were transfected with Smac siRNA and then treated with AT101 at the indicated time. The release of cyt c decreased in Smac siRNA-treated cells after AT101 treatment (Fig. 6, A and B), accompanied by the inhibition of caspase-3 activation (Fig. 6A). These results indicate that Smac can induce cyt c release in AT101-induced apoptosis. Our previous data demonstrated that Bax activation had no effect on Smac release (Fig. 3C). Conversely, it is unknown whether Smac affects Bax activation in cell death. To address this possibility, we examined the effect of Smac knockdown on Bax activation. As shown in Fig. 7A, AT101 induced large scale Bax oligomerization in control (Ctrl) siRNA cells. By comparison, AT101-treatment failed to activate Bax efficiently in Smac siRNA cells, and only a trace"
https://openalex.org/W2021783684,"The three members of the NR4A orphan nuclear receptor subfamily Nur77, Nurr1, and NOR-1, regulate a variety of biological functions including vascular disease and metabolism. In this study, we identified Four and a half LIM domains protein-2 (FHL2) as a novel interacting protein of NR4A nuclear receptors by yeast two-hybrid screen and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Each of the four LIM domains of FHL2 can bind Nur77, and both the amino-terminal domain and the DNA binding domain of Nur77 are involved in the interaction between FHL2 and Nur77. FHL2 represses Nur77 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner, and short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of FHL2 results in increased Nur77 transcriptional activity. ChIP experiments on the enolase3 promoter revealed that FHL2 inhibits the association of Nur77 with DNA. FHL2 is highly expressed in human endothelial and smooth muscle cells, but not in monocytes or macrophages. To substantiate functional involvement of FHL2 in smooth muscle cell physiology, we demonstrated that FHL2 overexpression increases the growth of these cells, whereas FHL2 knockdown results in reduced DNA synthesis. Collectively, these studies suggest that association of FHL2 with Nur77 plays a pivotal role in vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2128719261,"The JAK2 mutation V617F is detectable in a majority of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Enforced expression of JAK2 V617F in mice induces myeloproliferation and bone marrow (BM) fibrosis, suggesting a causal role for the JAK2 mutant in the pathogenesis of MPNs. However, little is known about mechanisms and effector molecules contributing to JAK2 V617F-induced myeloproliferation and fibrosis. We show that JAK2 V617F promotes expression of oncostatin M (OSM) in neoplastic myeloid cells. Correspondingly, OSM mRNA levels were increased in the BM of patients with MPNs (median 287% of ABL, range 22–1450%) compared to control patients (median 59% of ABL, range 12–264%; P< 0.0001). OSM secreted by JAK2 V617F+ cells stimulated growth of fibroblasts and microvascular endothelial cells and induced the production of angiogenic and profibrogenic cytokines (HGF, VEGF, and SDF-1) in BM fibroblasts. All effects of MPN cell-derived OSM were blocked by a neutralizing anti-OSM antibody, whereas the production of OSM in MPN cells was suppressed by a pharmacologic JAK2 inhibitor or RNAi-mediated knockdown of JAK2. In summary, JAK2 V617F-mediated up-regulation of OSM may contribute to fibrosis, neoangiogenesis, and the cytokine storm observed in MPNs, suggesting that OSM might serve as a novel therapeutic target molecule in these neoplasms.—Hoermann, G., Cerny-Reiterer, S., Herrmann, H., Blatt, K., Bilban, M., Gisslinger, H., Gisslinger, B., Müllauer, L., Kralovics, R., Mannhalter, C., Valent, P., Mayerhofer, M.

https://openalex.org/W2058670868,"Elastin haploinsufficiency causes the cardiovascular complications associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome and isolated supravalvular aortic stenosis. Significant variability exists in the vascular pathology in these individuals. Using the Eln(+/-) mouse, we sought to identify the source of this variability. Following outcrossing of C57Bl/6J Eln(+/-), two backgrounds were identified whose cardiovascular parameters deviated significantly from the parental strain. F1 progeny of the C57Bl/6J; Eln(+/-)x129X1/SvJ were more hypertensive and their arteries less compliant. In contrast, Eln(+/-) animals crossed to DBA/2J were protected from the pathologic changes associated with elastin insufficiency. Among the crosses, aortic elastin and collagen content did not correlate with quantitative vasculopathy traits. Quantitative trait locus analysis performed on F2 C57; Eln(+/-)x129 intercrosses identified highly significant peaks on chromosome 1 (LOD 9.7) for systolic blood pressure and on chromosome 9 (LOD 8.7) for aortic diameter. Additional peaks were identified that affect only Eln(+/-), including a region upstream of Eln on chromosome 5 (LOD 4.5). Bioinformatic analysis of the quantitative trait locus peaks revealed several interesting candidates, including Ren1, Ncf1, and Nos1; genes whose functions are unrelated to elastic fiber assembly, but whose effects may synergize with elastin insufficiency to predispose to hypertension and stiffer blood vessels. Real time RT-PCR studies show background-specific increased expression of Ncf1 (a subunit of the NOX2 NAPDH oxidase) that parallel the presence of increased oxidative stress in Eln(+/-) aortas. This finding raises the possibility that polymorphisms in genes affecting the generation of reactive oxygen species alter cardiovascular function in individuals with elastin haploinsufficiency through extrinsic noncomplementation."

The two types of MC differ in their content of several components including MC proteases (1Gurish M.F. Austen K.F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: F1-F5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In rodents, the two types of MC can also be distinguished based on glycosaminoglycan content; whereas mucosal MCs synthesize the proteoglycan serglycin with chondroitin sulfate chains, serglycin in connective tissue type MCs contains heparin (2Kolset S.O. Prydz K. Pejler G. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Also, during connective tissue type MC differentiation, glycosaminoglycan content differs between immature cells containing chondroitin sulfate and more highly differentiated cells that synthesize heparin (2Kolset S.O.

Heparin is a highly sulfated variant of heparan sulfate (HS). Whereas heparin is found exclusively in the MC granules, HS is a ubiquitous component of cell surfaces and is also present in the extracellular matrix, predominantly in basement membranes. HS/heparin biosynthesis is a complex process with many different Golgi enzymes involved (3Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The HS-polymerases EXT1 and EXT2 synthesize a polysaccharide backbone consisting of repeating units of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. The first modifying event is the N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST) reaction, where N-acetyl groups of selected N-acetylglucosamine residues are removed and replaced by sulfate groups (4Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holmborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellén L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). After N-sulfation, the C5-epimerase converts glucuronic acid residues to iduronic acid. Sulfation at the 2-O position of iduronic acid residues and some glucuronic acid is then carried out by a 2-O-sulfotransferase, followed by glucosamine 6-O-sulfation and, more rarely, 3-O-sulfation. Little is known about the organization of the biosynthesis enzymes in the Golgi stacks. It has been suggested that the enzymes together with other yet unidentified components form GAGosomes, molecular machines responsible for elongation as well as modification of the glycosaminoglycan chains (5Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Different compositions of the GAGosome may result in different modification patterns of the HS chain. In support of the GAGosome concept, several interactions between pairs of HS/heparin biosynthesis enzymes have been demonstrated. For example, the polymerases EXT1 and EXT2 are known to form a functional complex (6McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 7Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interactions have also been demonstrated between the C5-epimerase and the 2-O-sulfotransferase (8Pinhal M.A. Smith B. Olson S. Aikawa J. Kimata K. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12984-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and between the xylosyltransferase and galactosyltransferase-I (9Schwartz N.B. Rodén L. Dorfman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 56: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently demonstrated an interaction between NDST1 and EXT2 that greatly influenced the structure of the polysaccharide formed (10Presto J. Thuveson M. Carlsson P. Busse M. Wilén M. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). During recent years it has become evident that HS has a key role in embryonic development (11Lin X. Development. 2004; 131: 6009-6021Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). As first demonstrated for FGFs, the proteoglycans act as co-receptors for signaling molecules (12Pellegrini L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition, HS has been shown to create and maintain gradients of morphogens and cytokines (13Lander A.D. Nie Q. Wan F.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 785-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Also, extracellular matrix proteins, proteases, protease inhibitors, lipases, lipoproteins, and microbial proteins are known to show affinity for HS (5Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Knock-out mice have been particularly useful to study the role of HS in development. Targeted disruption of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes, respectively, leads to a complete lack of HS and an early embryonic lethality (14Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev.

Complete lack of NDST1 results in perinatal lethality, forebrain defects, skeletal malformation, and lung hypoplasia. Vascular development, endothelial cell function, lipid metabolism, lacrimal gland induction, lens development, and neural tube fusion have also been shown to be impaired in NDST1-deficient animals. In contrast, NDST2-deficient mice are healthy and fertile, but their connective tissue type MCs lack sulfated heparin and contain reduced levels of histamine and the MC-specific proteases, (32Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellén L.

Also, mice with a targeted deletion of NDST3 develop normally with only subtle symptoms, such as lowered cholesterol and HDL levels (34Pallerla S.R. Lawrence R. Lewejohann L. Pan Y. Fischer T.

No knock-out strain carrying a targeted deletion of NDST4 has yet been described. Crosses between NDST2−/− mice and NDST1+/− and analyses of their offspring demonstrated that lack of both isoforms results in early embryonic lethality (35Holmborn K. Ledin J. Smeds E. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42355-42358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To be able to determine the cause of the early embryonic lethality, we recently established embryonic stem (ES) cell lines deficient for both NDST1 and NDST2 and showed that the HS produced lacks N-sulfation but contains low levels of 6-O-sulfate groups (35Holmborn K. Ledin J. Smeds E. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42355-42358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we have studied the role of NDST1 and NDST2 in MC development in vitro. Although no MCs were formed when ES cells deficient in both NDST1 and NDST2 were differentiated in vitro, deficiency in either NDST1 or NDST2 was compatible with MC differentiation. In vitro differentiated NDST2−/− MCs had an altered morphology compared with control cells and lacked or showed reduced expression of MC proteases. These cells synthesized HS/heparin with a lower sulfation degree than polysaccharide isolated from control cells. In contrast, in vitro differentiated NDST1−/− as well as NDST1+/− MCs contained increased levels of connective tissue type MC proteases compared with control cells and synthesized heparin with a higher degree of sulfation. For the generation of MCs from mouse embryos the following mouse strains were used: C57BL/6, NDST1+/− (N10 on C57BL/6) (17Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F. Eriksson I. Olofsson A.M. Kjellen L. Forsberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25926-25930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and NDST1+/−2−/− (N10 on C57BL/6) (32Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellén L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). NDST1+/−2−/− mice were obtained by crossing NDST1+/− with NDST2−/− mice. All animal experiments were conducted with the approval of the local animal ethical committee in Uppsala. Embryo-derived MCs were obtained by culturing of day 10.5 to day 12.5 embryos in defined medium in a humidified cell culture chamber in 37 °C and 5% CO2 essentially as described by Vial et al. (36Vial D. Oliver C. Jamur M.C. Pastor M.V. da Silva Trindade E. Berenstein E. Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6178-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The embryos were collected and transferred into a 24-well plate containing 0.5 ml of Complete medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 4 mm l-glutamine, 0.5 × 10−6 m β-mercaptoethanol, 10% NCTC 109 medium (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml G418, 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse (rm) IL-3 and 25 ng/ml rmSCF). Embryo tissues were left to adhere to the plastic for 2 days and then trypsinized to disrupt embryonic structures and to get a dispersed cell suspension. Trypsinization was stopped by addition of 1.5 ml (10× the volume of trypsin) of complete medium. The dispersed cells quickly adhered to the tissue culture dish, and after ∼4 days to 1 week nonadherent cells appearing in the cultures were transferred into 6-well plates and expanded for 2–4 weeks. Aliquots of cells were removed from the developing MC culture corresponding to each embryo. Cells were put on cytospin glasses and stained with May-Grünwald/Giemsa for morphological examination of MC differentiation. In addition, DNA was purified and analyzed by PCR, as described previously (35Holmborn K. Ledin J. Smeds E. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42355-42358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), to define the genotype of the cultures. NDST1−/−2−/− ES cells were cultivated as described previously (35Holmborn K. Ledin J. Smeds E. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42355-42358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). NDST1+/−, NDST2+/−, and WT (R1) (37Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar) ES cells were used as controls. Before differentiation, ES cells were cultured in DMEM with GlutaMAX-1, sodium pyruvate, 4,500 mg/liter glucose, and pyridoxine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1× nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 20% FCS (ES cell qualified; Invitrogen), 10−4 m β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 1,000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (mouse recombinant, Chemicon). To induce MC development, a slight modification of the protocol described previously by Tsai et al. was used (38Tsai M. Wedemeyer J. Ganiatsas S. Tam S.Y. Zon L.I. Galli S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9186-9190Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In different experiments, 2,000 or 20,000 ES cells were plated in bacterial dishes in 100-μl droplets of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Sigma) containing 15% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), 5 ng/ml rmIL-11 (R&D Systems), 50 ng/ml rmSCF (Peprotech), 50 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and 450 μm monothioglycerol (Sigma) to enable formation of embryoid bodies (EBs). The plating of cells on nonadherent bacterial Petri dishes is referred to as day 0. Two to 3 days after the initiation of EB formation, more medium was added to achieve a floating EB culture. Six days after initiation, the EB cultures were boosted with 1 volume of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 15% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 30 ng/ml rmIL-6 (Peprotech), 30 ng/ml rmIL-3 (Peprotech), 50 ng/ml rmSCF (Peprotech), 50 μg/ml G418, and 450 μm monothioglycerol (Sigma). At day 12, the EBs were transferred to tissue culture plates for adherent growth and differentiation in a defined MC medium (DMEM containing 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml G418, and 450 μm monothioglycerol (Sigma), 50 ng/ml rmSCF (Peprotech), and 30% WEHI-3 cell conditioned medium as an IL-3 supplement. Once a week, half of the medium containing the newly developed MCs was removed from the dishes, and new medium was added. Transferred nonadherent cells were grown continuously in MC medium. Starting from 2 weeks, an aliquot was checked weekly by May-Grünwald/Giemsa for MC morphology. The derived MCs were used for different experiments from week 5 to 9 after the initiation of MC differentiation. RNA purification from MCs, ES cells, and mouse 11-day embryo total RNA (Clontech) was performed with the E.Z.N.A. total RNA kit (Omega). The amount of RNA obtained was estimated based on absorbance at 260 nm. One μg of RNA was used as template for cDNA synthesis using SuperscriptTM II (Invitrogen,) reverse transcriptase with random hexamers. The Bio-Rad MiniOpticon system together with the Bio-Rad enzyme mix was used for quantitative PCR analysis. cDNA was amplified using the following primers: NDST1 (226 bp) forward, 5′-CCA CAA CTA TCA CAA AGG CAT CG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAA AGG TTG ACT TTA GGG CCA C-3′; NDST2 (240 bp) forward, 5′-GTG TGG CAG AAT CCC TGT G-3′ and reverse, 5′-GTG CAG GCT CAG GAA GAA GT-3′; NDST3 (143 bp) forward, 5′-GGA GCT CTT CTT CAC TGT GGT T-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCT GAA GAC GCA GGT TGG T-3′; NDST4 (170 bp) forward, 5′-GGA GAA AAC CTG TGA CCA TTT AC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCT TGT GAT AGT TGT TGC CAT TA-3′. The PCR was performed by denaturating the DNA at 95 °C for 10 min before amplification for 40 cycles, each cycle consisting of 95 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s. Approximately 1 × 106 MCs were solubilized in 100 μl of 1 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Equal volumes of the cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. The separated proteins were then blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% milk powder in TBS/0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Following blocking, the membranes were incubated with antisera against carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3), the chymase MCPT5 (also designated mMCP-5), and the tryptase MCPT6 (also designated mMCP-6), diluted 1:2,000 in TBS/2% BSA/0.1% Tween 20, at 40 °C overnight (the antisera were kindly provided by Dr. Lars Hellman, Uppsala University). Membranes were then washed extensively with TBS/0.1% Tween 20, and the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was left to bind for 1 h. After extensive washing, the blots were developed using a Bio-Rad detection system. 5 × 106 MCs of relevant genotypes, cultured in the MC-inducing medium described above, were metabolically labeled overnight with 200 μCi of carrier-free [35S]sulfate (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation, cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 300 × g, washed with cold PBS, incubated in 2 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.10 m NaCl), and centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min. The supernatant containing radiolabeled macromolecules was recovered, and 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were isolated from the solubilized cell lysate on a 0.3-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.10 m NaCl. After washing the column with equilibration buffer followed by a second washing step with 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.10 m NaCl, the 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were eluted with 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 m NaCl. A portion of the eluted 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans was treated with alkali (0.5 m NaOH) as described previously (39Bengtsson J. Eriksson I. Kjellén L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2110-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After desalting in water on PD10 columns (Amersham Biosciences), followed by lyophilization, the 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycan chains were subjected to digestion with 0.1 unit of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) as described previously (40Cheung W.F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindhal U. Kjellén L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or treated with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (41Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Untreated and treated 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were then analyzed by gel chromatography on Sephadex G50 eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Cells (10 × 106) were dissolved in 0.5 ml of Pronase buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mg/ml Pronase) and incubated end-over-end for 19 h at 55 °C. After heat inactivation of the enzyme for 5 min at 96 °C, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 2 mm. After addition of Benzonase (12 milliunits), the sample was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C followed by heat inactivation for 5 min at 96 °C. The NaCl concentration was then adjusted to 0.1 m, and the sample was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted with 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, and applied to a Sep-Pak® C18 cartridge (Waters) that had been primed first with methanol, then with water, and finally with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl. The cartridge was washed with 2 ml of the Tris-HCl buffer, and the washing fraction was combined with the nonbinding fraction and used for purification of glycosaminoglycans. The sample was applied to a 0.2-ml DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated in loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). After washing with 6 column volumes of loading buffer, 6 volumes of low pH buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), and 6 volumes of loading buffer without Triton X-100, the glycosaminoglycans were eluted with 0.6 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 m NaCl). After desalting on an NAP-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in water, the glycosaminoglycans were dried by SpeedVac centrifugation. The glycosaminoglycan pool was then digested with 50 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC in 100 μl of 40 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.0. The digestion was allowed to proceed for 4 h at 37 °C, and the sample was then boiled to stop the reaction. After removal of 10 μl for chondroitin sulfate analysis by RPIP-HPLC, as described previously (20Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Götte M. Selleck S. Kjellén L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42732-42741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), heparin/HS was recovered after a second round of DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, as described for total glycosaminoglycan isolation. Purified heparin/HS was dissolved in 200 μl of heparinase buffer (5 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2) and divided into two equal aliquots. One of the aliquots was treated with 0.4 milliunit each of heparinases I, II, and III and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The other aliquot (control sample) was incubated under the same conditions without enzymes. After heat inactivation for 5 min at 96 °C, the samples were analyzed by RPIP-HPLC (20Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Götte M. Selleck S. Kjellén L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42732-42741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Significant differences were determined using an unpaired t test. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. and calculated p values indicated as not significant (ns) p > 0.05 or significant *, p < 0.05. Using an in vitro cultivation protocol (36Vial D. Oliver C. Jamur M.C. Pastor M.V. da Silva Trindade E. Berenstein E. Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6178-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), embryos obtained from NDST1+/− and NDST1+/−2−/− intercrosses, isolated at embryonic (E) stages E10.5 to E12.5, were used as a starting point for differentiation of embryo-derived MCs. Because NDST1−/−2−/− embryos do not survive beyond E5.5, this genotype was not represented among the cultures. The embryos were placed into 24-well plates, and after 2 days of in vitro cultivation the embryo tissues were dispersed by trypsinization, and the cells were left to adhere again. Approximately 4 days to 1 week after readherence, MC differentiation was observed in all genotypes tested. No major morphological differences could be seen between cells of the different genotypes except for the presence of some “empty” vacuoles in the cells lacking NDST2 (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the MC proteases at the protein level demonstrated that the WT embryo-derived MCs resemble true connective tissue type MCs and express CPA3 as well as high levels of the chymase MCPT5 and the tryptase MCPT6 (Fig. 1B). In agreement with previous work (32Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellén L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 33Humphries D.E. Wong G.W. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Qiu W.T. Huang C. Sharpe A.H. Stevens R.L. Nature. 1999; 400: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), cells lacking NDST2, the NDST2−/−, and NDST1+/−2−/− embryo-derived MCs were devoid of activated CPA3 and MCPT5 and contained reduced levels of MCPT6 (Fig. 1B). Remarkably, NDST1−/− as well as NDST1+/− MCs seemed to store higher amounts of CPA3 and MCPT5 than WT MCs (Fig. 1B). Characterization of the glycosaminoglycans produced by the MCs in the presence of [35S]sulfate also gave interesting results. Compared with WT MCs where only 4% of the total 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans resisted degradation with chondroitinase ABC and thus was identified as heparin/HS, ∼30% of the glycosaminoglycans produced by NDST1−/− and NDST1+/− cells was heparin/HS (Fig. 2, A–C). Analysis with ion exchange chromatography of the chondroitinase ABC-resistant 35S-glycosaminoglycans (representing HS and/or heparin) demonstrated that the NDST2-deficient cells produced HS with a lower charge density (Fig. 2D). In contrast, 35S-labeled heparin/HS produced by NDST1−/− and NDST1+/− MCs were eluted at higher ionic strength and were more homogeneous than WT heparin/HS, which in addition contained some material of lower charge density. To characterize in more detail the structure of the heparin/HS produced by the embryo-derived MCs, glycosaminoglycans from the cells were analyzed by RPIP-HPLC (20Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Götte M. Selleck S. Kjellén L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42732-42741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans from four WT, six NDST1+/−, and two NDST1−/− MC cultures were separately analyzed (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 1). Confirming the results obtained with ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2D), the total sulfation of heparin/HS isolated from NDST1+/− and NDST1−/− cells is higher than that of heparin/HS from WT cells. Importantly, N-sulfation increased with ≈10%. Because the 2- and 6-O-sulfotransferases are largely dependent on N-sulfation for substrate recognition, an increase in O-sulfation would be expected. This was also the cas"

Oxygen represents not only a challenge for catalysis but also for the complex assembling process of the [NiFe] active site. Apart from nickel and iron, the catalytic center contains unusual diatomic ligands, namely two cyanides (CN−) and one carbon monoxide (CO), which are coordinated to the iron. One of the open questions of the maturation process concerns the origin and biosynthesis of the CO group. Isotope labeling in combination with infrared spectroscopy revealed that externally supplied gaseous 13CO serves as precursor of the carbonyl group of the regulatory [NiFe] hydrogenase in R. eutropha. Corresponding 13CO titration experiments showed that a concentration 130-fold higher than ambient CO (0.1 ppmv) caused a 50% labeling of the carbonyl ligand in the [NiFe] hydrogenase, leading to the conclusion that the carbonyl ligand originates from an intracellular metabolite. A novel setup allowed us to the study effects of CO depletion on maturation in vivo. Upon induction of CO depletion by addition of the CO scavenger PdCl2, cells cultivated on H2, CO2, and O2 showed severe growth retardation at low cell concentrations, which was on the basis of partially arrested hydrogenase maturation, leading to reduced hydrogenase activity. This suggests gaseous CO as a metabolic precursor under these conditions. The addition of PdCl2 to cells cultivated heterotrophically on organic substrates had no effect on hydrogenase maturation. These results indicate at least two different pathways for biosynthesis of the CO ligand of [NiFe] hydrogenase.

Upon induction of CO depletion by addition of the CO scavenger PdCl2, cells cultivated on H2, CO2, and O2 showed severe growth retardation at low cell concentrations, which was on the basis of partially arrested hydrogenase maturation, leading to reduced hydrogenase activity. This suggests gaseous CO as a metabolic precursor under these conditions. The addition of PdCl2 to cells cultivated heterotrophically on organic substrates had no effect on hydrogenase maturation. These results indicate at least two different pathways for biosynthesis of the CO ligand of [NiFe] hydrogenase."

Real time quantitative PCR confirmed up-regulation of Egr2 mRNA expression by loading of the tibia in vivo. In vitro studies where strain was applied to primary cultures of mouse tibia-derived osteoblastic cells and the osteoblast UMR106 cell line also showed up-regulation of Egr2 mRNA expression. In UMR106 cells, inhibition of β1/β3 integrin function had no effect on strain-related Egr2 expression, but it was inhibited by a COX2-selective antagonist and imitated by exogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This response to PGE2 was mediated chiefly through the EP1 receptor and involved stimulation of PKC and attenuation by cAMP/PKA. Neither activators nor inhibitors of nitric oxide, estrogen signaling, or LiCl had any effect on Egr2 mRNA expression, but it was increased by both insulin-like growth factor-1 and high, but not low, dose parathyroid hormone and exogenous Wnt-3a. The increases by strain, PGE2, Wnt-3a, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were attenuated by inhibition of MEK-1. EGR2 appears to be involved in many of the signaling pathways that constitute early responses of bone cells to strain. These pathways all have multiple functions. Converting their strain-related responses into coherent “instructions” for adaptive (re)modeling is likely to depend upon their contextual activation, suppression, and interaction probably on more than one occasion.

Converting their strain-related responses into coherent “instructions” for adaptive (re)modeling is likely to depend upon their contextual activation, suppression, and interaction probably on more than one occasion. It is clear that normality of bone architecture, and the ability to withstand functional loads that it implies, is achieved and maintained through a process in which the cells that bring about the (re)modeling involved are responsive, in a feedback relationship, to the strains that load-bearing engenders in the bone tissue. This strain-related control of bone architecture has been called the “mechanostat” (1Frost H.M. The mechanostat: a proposed pathogenic mechanism of osteoporoses and the bone mass effects of mechanical and nonmechanical agents.Bone Miner. 1987; 2: 73-85PubMed Google Scholar). The simplicity of this functionally adaptive concept belies the complexity of the control mechanisms involved. Although the cells responsive to the earliest mechano-responsive events are almost certainly those in contact with the bone tissue (osteoblasts and osteocytes), the actual loading-related events to which they respond (strain, strain-related fluid flow, etc.) are unclear. From the many studies on mechanical regulation of bone cell behavior, it is evident that there is no unique strain sensor or dedicated strain-responsive pathway. Rather, exposure to strain-related events appears to result in activation of a number of different nonspecific signal transduction pathways. These include generation of and signaling by nitric oxide (NO) (2Bakker A.D. Klein-Nulend J. Tanck E. Albers G.H. Lips P. Burger E.H.

Although many of these individual pathways are well characterized, it is the mechanisms with which they interact to provide a structurally relevant, strain-related, location-dependent, and tissue-specific response that remain elusive. To try and resolve this situation, we had previously conducted a microarray study of changes in gene expression in mouse bones that had either been loaded in vivo 3, 8, 12, or 24 h earlier or were in a situation of disuse (19Zaman G. Saxon L.K. Sunters A. Hilton H. Underhill P. Williams D. Price J.S. Lanyon L.E. Loading-related regulation of gene expression in bone in the contexts of estrogen deficiency, lack of estrogen receptor alpha and disuse.Bone. 2010; 46: 628-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This study indicated differential regulation of more than 2,000 genes after loading, none of which appeared to be specific to bone or to strain. Analysis of the pattern of gene regulation in this study by Ingenuity software indicated statistically significant relationships between the bones, the loading situation, 18 canonical signaling pathways, and 15 functions (19Zaman G. Saxon L.K. Sunters A. Hilton H. Underhill P. Williams D. Price J.S. Lanyon L.E. Loading-related regulation of gene expression in bone in the contexts of estrogen deficiency, lack of estrogen receptor alpha and disuse.Bone. 2010; 46: 628-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study, we used PASTAA analysis of the genes involved in these pathways and functions. This revealed that the transcription factor EGR2/Krox-20 appeared more often in more loading-related functions than any other despite the fact that changes in its levels of expression by the microarray had not achieved statistical significance. EGR2 has been previously suggested to play a role in bone development because EGR2 knock-out mice are osteopenic (20Levi G. Topilko P. Schneider-Maunoury S. Lasagna M. Mantero S. Cancedda R. Charnay P. Defective bone formation in Krox-20 mutant mice.Development. 1996; 122: 113-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary observations supporting a role for EGR2 in adaptive bone remodeling in response to strain have subsequently been confirmed (21Ott C.E. Bauer S. Manke T. Ahrens S. Rödelsperger C. Grünhagen J. Kornak U. Duda G. Mundlos S. Robinson P.N. Promiscuous and depolarization-induced immediate-early response genes are induced by mechanical strain of osteoblasts.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2009; 24: 1247-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Given the potential importance of EGR2 to bone homeostasis, we therefore sought to identify its role in a number of the signaling pathways already demonstrated to be utilized during bone cell response to mechanical strain. In addition to the PASTAA analysis, which identified EGR2 as a potentially important contributor to post-loading responses of bone cells, the studies described here investigated the involvement of strain-related regulation of EGR2 with the known strain-responsive signaling pathways prostaglandins, nitric oxide, integrins, estrogen receptor, the Wnt pathway, and IGF-1. We present evidence that PKC promotes and PKA attenuates EGR2 expression and that EGR2 activation is dependent on ERK1/2 activity. Additionally, we show that although EGR2 is involved in a number of strain-related pathways within minutes of exposure to strain, it is not common to all of them because the PGE2-related down-regulation of the soluble Wnt antagonist SOST is unaffected by silencing strain-related regulation of EGR2.

PMA and SNAP2 were purchased from Calbiochem. 17β-Estradiol, LiCl, PGE2, AH8609, AH23848, collagen, fibronectin and hPTH(1–34) were purchased from Sigma. ICI 182,780, H89, NS398, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, echistatin, and l-NAME were purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK) and IGF-1 analog (des-(1–3)-IGF-1) was purchased from GroPep, Adelaide, Australia.

EGR2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (La Jolla, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Dako (Ely, UK). The purpose of the in vivo experiment was to establish the effects on Egr2 expression of estrogen receptor signaling pathways. To assess the effect of the estrogen receptor on Egr2 expression, a group of 17-week-old C57BL/6 female mice were injected with the ER blocker ICI 182,780 (4 mg/kg/day) subcutaneously for 21 days to test the potential role of estrogen and signaling on Egr2 mRNA expression levels assessed. The right tibiae of 15-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (n = 32) and a separate group of unilaterally sciatic neurectomized mice, in which the tibiae received no functional loading (the WT-SN group), were subjected to a single period of dynamic axial loading using a hydraulic actuator under feedback control (Dartec HC10, Zwick Testing Machines Ltd., Leominster, UK) to produce a peak compressive strain of −1300 microstrain (μϵ) on the medial surface of the bone at a frequency of 2 Hz for 30 s (2 Hz). In previous studies, this regimen, which included the previous microarray study (19Zaman G. Saxon L.K. Sunters A. Hilton H. Underhill P. Williams D. Price J.S. Lanyon L.E. Loading-related regulation of gene expression in bone in the contexts of estrogen deficiency, lack of estrogen receptor alpha and disuse.Bone. 2010; 46: 628-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), proved sufficient to produce an osteogenic response (19Zaman G.

Mechanical loading enhances the anabolic effects of intermittent parathyroid hormone (1–34) on trabecular and cortical bone in mice.Bone. 2008; 43: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The contralateral limb was not loaded and served as an internal control (23Sugiyama T. Price J.S. Lanyon L.E. Functional adaptation to mechanical loading in both cortical and cancellous bone is controlled locally and is confined to the loaded bones.Bone. 2010; 46: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Eight animals were sacrificed at each time point of 3, 8, 12, and 24 h after loading. To assess the effects of strain on EGR2 expression in primary osteoblast-like cells, cultures of these were prepared from the long bones of 17-week-old female high bone mass mice (LRP5G171V) and their wild-type littermates as described previously (15Zaman G. Suswillo R.F. Cheng M.Z. Tavares I.A. Lanyon L.E. Early responses to dynamic strain change and prostaglandins in bone-derived cells in culture.J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These osteoblast-like cells, and the UMR106 cells also used in these studies, were seeded in complete media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at a density of 8 × 103 cells/cm2 onto 66-mm dishes for treatment with exogenous agents or onto plastic slides (when subjected to mechanical strain). 100-mm dishes used for the integrins experiment were coated with collagen and fibronectin and air-dried prior to use. Osteoblast-like cells cultured on plastic slides were subjected to a single period of 600 cycles of four-point bending at a frequency of 1 Hz. The waveform of each strain cycle consisted of a ramped square wave with strain rates on and off of 23,000 μϵ/s, dwell times on and off of 0.4 and 0.75 s, respectively, and a peak strain of 3,400 μϵ (15Zaman G. Suswillo R.F. Cheng M.Z. Tavares I.A. Lanyon L.E. Early responses to dynamic strain change and prostaglandins in bone-derived cells in culture.J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Following strain treatment, the cells were maintained in the media exposed to the strain and cultured for specified times after treatment. Controls and treated cells on slides and in wells or dishes were maintained under similar conditions. In the case of pretreatment, compounds were added to the cultures of primary osteoblast-like cells or cells of the UMR106 cell line 3 h prior to stimulation with strain. To test the effects of the estrogen receptor, monolayers of osteoblast-like cells were cultured in the presence of estrogen (10−8 m) and ICI 182,780 (10−7 m). When the effects of hPTH(1–34) were investigated, the hormone was added at a final concentration of 0.01 or 10 nm for 1 h. To test the potential role of integrin and nitric oxide-mediated signaling, cells were cultured in the presence of echistatin (100 nm) (24Zheng B. Clemmons D.R. Blocking ligand occupancy of the alphaVbeta3 integrin inhibits insulin-like growth factor I signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and SNAP2 (100 μm), respectively. PGE2 (5 μm) and prostaglandin receptor antagonists (AH6809 (30 μm) and AH23848 (30 μm)) were used to assess the contribution of prostaglandin signaling pathways. PMA (500 nm) was used as a PKC agonist, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mm) and H89 (1 μm) were used as PKA agonist and antagonist, respectively. IGF-1 analog (des-(1–3)-IGF-1), when present, was added at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. Right and left tibiae were carefully dissected, and all their surrounding musculature was removed leaving the periosteum intact. The cartilaginous ends of the bones were removed, and the remaining tibial shaft was spun at 5,000 rpm for 2 min (Eppendorf centrifuge) to remove the marrow. The tibial shafts were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized under liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, and lysed in QIAzol lysis reagent. Total RNA from these lysed samples was purified and DNase-treated using the RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA from osteoblast-like cells was isolated and DNase-treated using RNeasy Plus mini kit. The quantity and the integrity of the purified RNA were assessed using the Agilent RNA Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies UK Ltd., Stockport, UK). Egr2 mRNA expression levels were analyzed using quantitative real time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase. Real time qPCR was carried out as described earlier (25Zaman G. Jessop H.L. Muzylak M. De Souza R.L. Pitsillides A.A. Price J.S. Lanyon L.L. Osteocytes use estrogen receptor alpha to respond to strain but their ERalpha content is regulated by estrogen.J. Bone Miner.

Primer sequences, the positions in the coding region, and the expected PCR products for Egr2, Ep1–Ep4, Oc, Ho-1, Igf-1, and the housekeeping genes (β-actin (Actb) and β2-microglobulin (B2m)) are summarized in Table 1. Primers for rat Sost were obtained from Qiagen (QuantiTect Primer Assays, QT004148558). A relative standard curve was constructed for Egr2, Sost, Igf-1, Oc, Ho-1, and housekeeping genes using serial dilutions of their amplicons, and these standards were included in each run. Standards were run in duplicate and samples in triplicate. Samples of unknown concentrations were quantified relative to these standard curves. The expression levels for all the genes analyzed were normalized to the reference genes (Actb and B2m). Average values were used for subsequent statistical analysis.TABLE 1Quantitative real time RT-PCR primer sequences (5′ → 3′)GeneSequence (forward)Sequence (reverse)PositionLengthGenBankTM accession no.bpEgr2CGCCACACCAAGATCCACAGCCCCCAGGACCAGAGG1586–168296NM_010118Ep1CTGCTGGTATTGGTGGTGGGTAGGAGGCGAAGAAGTTG1530–1693163NM_013110Ep2ACGAAAGCCCAGCCATCACCAGCGCGATGAGGTTTC110–17565NM_013088Ep3ACTGTCCGTCTGCTGGTCCCTTCTCCTTTCCCATCT854–968114NM_012704Ep4ACATGGGCGTGGGTAGGTGTGGTCCAGTCGATGAAGCA464–52763NM_032076OcCATGAGGACCCTCTCTCTGCTGGACATGAAGGCTTTGTCA798–893109NM_013414Ho-1GGTGTCCAGGGAAGGCTTTAAGGTGCAGCTCCTCAGGGAAGTAG239–386129NM_012580Igf-ITCACATCTCTTCTACCTGGCACTCCAGTACATCTCCAGCCTCCTCAGA71–309238NM_178866ActbCTATGAGCTGCCTGACGGTCAGTTTCATGGATGCCACAGG798–912114NM_031144B2mATGGCTCGCTCGGTGACCCTTTCTCCGGTGGGTGGCGTGA52–161109NM_0039735 Open table in a new tab UMR106 cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected with 2.5 μg of TCF reporter plasmid (TopFlash, Upstate Biotechnology) and 0.25 μg of a control plasmid containing Renilla luciferase gene under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter from Promega (Southampton, UK) using TransFectin purchased from Bio-Rad or Effectene purchased from Qiagen (Crawley, West Sussex, UK). After 24 h of LiCl treatment (10 mm), the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). 20 μl of lysate was used to determine the relative luciferase activity of firefly and Renilla using the Dual-Luciferase assay (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was determined and normalized to that of Renilla. Slides or coverslips containing monolayers of osteoblast-like cells were washed in PBS, and the cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol on ice for 10 min followed by two PBS washes. The cells were then permeabilized in buffer (20 mm HEPES, 300 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.05% sodium azide, 0.5% Triton X-100 (Surfact-Amps-x-100, pH 7.0)) for 10 min on ice. Nonspecific antigen-binding sites were blocked by incubating the slides in wash buffer (10% fetal calf serum, 0.05% sodium azide in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies recognizing EGR2 (1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber, after which they were washed for 30 min at room temperature before incubation with the secondary antibody. Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) was diluted 1:100 and incubated for 45 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice in wash buffer and mounted in PBS before visualization by confocal microscopy. Cells were briefly washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in denaturing lysis buffer (2% SDS, 2 m urea, 8% sucrose, 20 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and 5 mm Na2VO4) using 100 μl/slide. Genomic DNA was sheared by passage through a QIAshredder column, and proteins and DNA denatured by boiling for 5 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Perbio, Chester, UK). 20 μg of protein were size-fractionated using SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto Protran nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 0.2% (w/v) I-block before being incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL) (GE Healthcare). Western blots were analyzed using the ImageJ program, and band volumes were quantitated. For knockdown of Egr2, predesigned small interfering (si) RNA reagents were obtained using an ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lafayette, CO). For transfection of siRNA, UMR106 cells were plated at 8 × 103 cells/cm2 and left to sit overnight. The siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected the next day at a final concentration of 100 nm using Escort III transfection reagent (Sigma). UMR106 cells were treated with prostaglandin 24 h after transfection and analyzed for Egr2, Sost, and Oc mRNA expression by RT-qPCR. ON-TARGETplus NonTargeting siRNA pool (Dharmacon, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lafayette, CO) was used as a negative control. The PASTAA program was used to identify transcription factors associated with a set of co-regulated genes (26Roider H.G. Manke T. O'Keeffe S. Vingron M. Haas S.A. PASTAA: identifying transcription factors associated with sets of co-regulated genes.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To do this, we uploaded the data of genes differentially expressed by context (WT, WT-OVX, ERα−/−, and WT-SN) and mechanical loading from the earlier in vivo microarray study (19Zaman G. Saxon L.K. Sunters A. Hilton H. Underhill P. Williams D. Price J.S. Lanyon L.E. Loading-related regulation of gene expression in bone in the contexts of estrogen deficiency, lack of estrogen receptor alpha and disuse.Bone. 2010; 46: 628-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) into PASTAA. Genes associated with a particular load-associated function were deleted from genes up-regulated by loading, and the remaining pool of genes was processed by PASTAA analysis. The p values are used as scores to subsequently rank the associations for a given transcription factor, and we assume that the smallest achieved p value corresponds to the most meaningful detectable association between a given transcription factor and a set of genes in a given category. In addition to PASTAA we also used Whole Genome Vista analysis. PASTAA and Whole Genome Vista are two of the many analytical tools available online to identify association between a set of genes and their regulating transcription factors. PASTAA was chosen for this study because it is capable of not only recovering many known tissue-specific acting transcription factors but also provides novel associations so far not detected by alternative methods (26Roider H.G.

Statistical analysis was carried out on SPSS version 17 for Windows. Up to two groups were compared by independent sample t test. Comparisons of more than two groups were made by analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. p < 0.05 was considered significant. The PASTAA program analysis identified transcription factors associated with a set of co-regulated genes whose expression was perturbed by estrogen deficiency (WT-OVX), absence of estrogen receptor α (ERα−/−), and disuse because of sciatic neurectomy (WT-SN) as well as by exposure to bone loading (disuse or recent exposure to an osteogenic stimulus) superimposed on top of these contexts. For EGR2, the significance of this association was p = 9.0 × 10−6 for disuse (WT-SN), whereas for ovariectomy (WT-OVX) and ERα−/− it was 0.032 and 0.033, respectively. The significance of the association for genes differentially regulated by loading at the 8-h post-loading time point was p = 5.1 × 10−5. A significant EGR2 positional matrix signature was observed across the conserved regions within the −10-kb region of all the altered genes within 3 and 8 h following loading (p < 0.001). The affinity scores for all the genes significantly altered by loading at each time point are shown (Fig. 1A), indicating the greatest affinity scores at 8 h after loading. For further analysis, an affinity threshold (27Roider H.G. Kanhere A. Manke T. Vingron M.

Based on structures of the oxygenase component (C2), both His-120 and Ser-146 are located ∼2.8 Å from the hydroxyl group of HPA. The variants H120N, H120Q, H120Y, H120D, and H120E can form C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN (a reactive intermediate necessary for hydroxylation) but cannot hydroxylate HPA. The impairment of H120N is not due to substrate binding because the variant can still bind HPA. In contrast, the H120K variant catalyzes hydroxylation with efficiency comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme; the hydroxylation rate constant for H120K is 5.7 ± 0.6 s−1, and the product conversion ratio is 75%, compared with values of 16 s−1 and 90% for the wild-type enzyme. H120R can also catalyze hydroxylation, suggesting that a positive charge on residue 120 can substitute for the hydroxylation function of His-120. Because the hydroxylation reaction of wild-type C2 is pH-independent between pH 6 and 10, the protonation status of key components required for hydroxylation likely remains unchanged in this pH range. His-120 may be positively charged for selective binding to the phenolate form of HPA, i.e. to form the Hisδ+·HPAδ− complex, which in turn promotes oxygen atom transfer via an electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism. Analysis of Ser-146 variants revealed that this residue is necessary for but not directly engaged in hydroxylation. Product formation in S146A is pH-independent and constant at ∼70% over a pH range of 6–10, whereas product formation for S146C decreased from ∼65% at pH 6.0 to 27% at pH 10.0. These data indicate that the ionization of Cys-146 in the S146C variant has an adverse effect on hydroxylation, possibly by perturbing formation of the Hisδ+·HPAδ− complex needed for hydroxylation. p-Hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA) 3-hydroxylase is a two-component flavoprotein monooxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of p-hydroxyphenylacetate to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate.

Incorporation of single oxygen atoms into organic compounds (monooxygenation) by hydroxylation or epoxidation is an important biological process for aerobic organisms. The monooxygenation reaction is generally catalyzed by cytochrome P450, metalloenzymes, pterin-dependent and flavin-dependent monooxygenases (1Torres Pazmiño D.E. Winkler M. Glieder A. Fraaije M.W. J. Biotechnol. 2010; 146: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Flavin-dependent monooxygenases are involved in a wide variety of biological processes (2van Berkel W.J. Kamerbeek N.M.

Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., Oxford2010: 37-117Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze the monooxygenation of many aromatic and aliphatic compounds (3Fagan R.L. Palfey B.A. Comprehensive Natural Products II Chemistry and Biology. Vol. 7. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., Oxford2010: 37-117Google Scholar). Based on the number of proteins required for catalysis, flavin-dependent monooxygenases can be classified into single-protein component and two-protein component types (2van Berkel W.J. Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 670-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 3Fagan R.L. Palfey B.A. Comprehensive Natural Products II Chemistry and Biology. Vol. 7.

Besides an organic substrate, both types of enzymes require NAD(P)H and oxygen as co-substrates. The initial part of the reaction is the reduction of an enzyme-bound flavin by NAD(P)H to generate reduced flavin followed by the reaction of reduced flavin with oxygen to form the C4a-(hydro)peroxy flavin, a key intermediate that is required for oxygenation of an organic substrate. Oxygenation occurs via an oxygen atom transfer from C4a-hydroperoxy flavin to an organic substrate, resulting in the formation of a C4a-hydroxy flavin intermediate and an oxygenated product. The C4a-hydroxy flavin dehydrates at the last step of the reaction to form the final species, oxidized flavin (2van Berkel W.J. Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. J.

All steps for the reactions of single-protein component flavin-dependent monooxygenases occur within the same polypeptide, whereas for the two-protein component type the flavin reduction occurs on a reductase component and the oxygenation occurs on an oxygenase component (4Ballou D.P.

The mechanism by which the reduced flavin is transferred involves simple diffusion or protein-protein contacts (5Ellis H.R. Arch. Biochem.

Although single-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases have been studied for more than 40 years, two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases have only received significant attention during the past decade after recent discoveries of their involvement in a wide variety of reactions (2van Berkel W.J.

The mechanism by which the oxygen atom transfer occurs in flavin-dependent monooxygenases is well understood for only a few enzymatic systems. The best understood oxygenation reaction is the hydroxylation of aromatic compounds catalyzed by a single-component flavoenzyme, p-hydroxybenzoate (pOHB) 5The abbreviations used are: pOHBp-hydroxybenzoatePHBHp-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylaseHPAp-hydroxyphenylacetateHPAHp-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylaseDHPA3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetateC1the reductase component of HPAH from A. baumanniiC2the oxygenase component of HPAH from A. baumanniiMHPCO2-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine-5-carboxylic acid oxygenaseTftDthe oxygenase component of chlorophenol 4-monooxygenase from B. cepacia AC1100AUabsorbance units. hydroxylase (PHBH) (4Ballou D.P.

Studies of PHBH and 2-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine-5-carboxylic acid (MHPC) monooxygenase (MHPCO) reactions showed that hydroxylation occurs via an electrophilic aromatic hydroxylation mechanism in which an aromatic substrate acts as a nucleophile and a terminal -OH group of C4a-hydroperoxy flavin acts as an electrophile (9Entsch B.

For the PHBH reaction, the hydroxylation rate constant increases upon an increase in pH with a pKa of 7.1 (13Ortiz-Maldonado M. Entsch B. Ballou D.P.

For two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases, the mode of oxygen atom transfer in hydroxylation of aromatic compounds has never been explored. Recently, pH-dependent studies of the oxygenase component (C2) of p-hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA) hydroxylase (HPAH) have shown that, unlike the PHBH reaction, the hydroxylation rate constant and the efficiency of product formation by C2 is constant in a pH range of 6–10 (15Ruangchan N.

Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies of the HPAH from A. baumannii have shown that Ser-171 is a key residue for stabilization of the reactive intermediate, C4a-hydroperoxy flavin, whereas His-396 facilitates intermediate formation (27Thotsaporn K.

Although the ability of C2 to prolong the lifetime of C4a-hydroperoxy flavin is necessary for substrate hydroxylation (27Thotsaporn K. Chenprakhon P. Sucharitakul J. Mattevi A. Chaiyen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 28170-28180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the enzyme must have another fine-tuned mechanism for efficient oxygen transfer because between pH 6.0 and 10.0 the product conversion percentage is ∼90% without wasteful H2O2 production, and the rate constants for hydroxylation remain constant at 15–17 s−1 (15Ruangchan N. Tongsook C. Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The pH independence of the C2 reaction implies that the protonation status of key components required for oxygen atom transfer is unchanged in this pH range. Based on the x-ray structure of C2 (23Alfieri A. Fersini F. Ruangchan N. Prongjit M. Chaiyen P. Mattevi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the hydroxyl group of HPA is ∼2.8 Å away from the Nϵ atom of His-120 and the Oγ atom of Ser-146, a distance that should allow the formation of H-bonding interactions (Fig. 1). However, previous studies could not distinguish whether HPA was bound in the phenolic or phenolate form, and the protonation status of His-120 remains unknown. Therefore, in this work we investigated the protonation status of His-120 and HPA bound at the C2 active site and the functional roles of His-120 and Ser-146 using site-directed mutagenesis, transient kinetics (stopped-flow and rapid-quench techniques), and product analysis at various pH values. The residue His-120 was mutated to Asn (H120N), Gln (H120Q), Tyr (H120Y), Asp (H120D), Glu (H120E), Lys (H120K), and Arg (H120R) to explore if the active form of His-120 is required to be neutral, negatively, or positively charged. The residue Ser-146 was mutated to Ala (S146A) and Cys (S146C) to explore whether the H-bonding ability or a suitable van der Waals contact of Ser-146 is necessary for the hydroxylation reaction. All chemicals and reagents used were analytical grade and purchased from commercial sources.

For the reactions of the His-120 and Ser-146 variants at pH 7.0, solutions of enzymes and oxidized FMN in the absence or presence of HPA in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), were equilibrated in the anaerobic glove box. The anaerobic enzyme solution was reduced with an equal reducing equivalent of sodium dithionite (a solution of 5 mg/ml in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0). Spectra of FMN were monitored with a diode-array spectrophotometer inside the glove box to ensure complete reaction. Then, the reduced enzyme solution was transferred into a glass tonometer. Solutions of various concentrations of oxygen were prepared by equilibrating buffers with air and certified oxygen-nitrogen gas mixtures (29Sucharitakul J. Prongjit M. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All experiments used acid as the quenching solution and were performed at 4 °C using a TgK Scientific Model RQF-63, DimentionTM D1 rapid quench-flow system in an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology). The rapid quench-flow system employed three syringes. An anaerobic solution of a C2variant (H120K, S146A, or S146C), FMN, and HPA in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), was reduced with a solution of sodium dithionite (5 mg/ml in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) in the anaerobic glove box. The solution of reduced enzyme·substrate complex from one syringe was mixed with the air-saturated buffer plus HPA from the second syringe. The reaction mixture was incubated for various time periods before quenching with a 0.15 m HCl solution from a third syringe. The reaction mixture after mixing and before quenching contained H120K, S146A, or S146C (100 μm), FMNH− (50 μm), and HPA (2 mm for S146A, 20 mm for H120K and S146C). The quenched samples were collected from the sample loop, and the enzyme was removed by ultrafiltration with a Microcon unit (Amicon YM-10). The filtrates were analyzed for the amount of DHPA produced from the reaction using an HPLC method, as previously described (16Chaiyen P. Suadee C. Wilairat P. Eur. J.

Anaerobic solutions of His-120 and Ser-146 variants (100 μm), FMNH− (50 μm), and HPA (2 mm or 20 mm) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), at 25 °C were reduced with a solution of sodium dithionite in an anaerobic glove box. An anaerobic solution of reduced enzyme·substrate complex was added in closed vessels containing air-saturated buffers at various pH values in the anaerobic glove box. The air-saturated buffers used for maintaining the various pH values were 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–7.5), 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0–8.5), and 100 mm glycine buffer adjusted with NaOH (pH 9.0–10.0). After the reaction was complete (5 min), 0.15 m HCl was immediately added to the mixture to a final concentration of 0.08 m. Denatured protein was removed from the quenched solution using a Centricon YM-10 concentrator. Samples were analyzed for the amount of DHPA formed using the HPLC method previously described (16Chaiyen P. Suadee C. Wilairat P. Eur. J.

Acta. 2004; 1680: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Measurements of H2O2 formed in C2 reactions were carried out as described in the supplemental Procedures. Kinetic data were analyzed by fitting the data using exponential functions in Program A, which was developed by Rong-yen Chu, Joel Dinverno, and D. P. Ballou at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI) to obtain the observed rate constants (kobs). Determinations of rate constants were calculated from plots of kobs versus substrate concentration using Levenber-Marquardt algorithms that were included in the KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software). A solution of His-120 variant (40 μm) and FMN (16 μm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was made anaerobic and reduced with a solution of sodium dithionite. The resulting enzyme-FMNH− complex was mixed with the same buffer containing the following oxygen concentrations: 0.13, 0.31, 0.61, and 1.03 mm (concentrations after mixing). The reactions were monitored by the changes in absorbance at 390 and 446 nm. For the H120K·FMNH− variant, the reaction exhibited biphasic kinetics (Fig. 2A). The first phase (reaction time ∼ 0.002–0.1 s) was an increase in absorbance at 390 nm without any significant change at 446 nm. The rate constants during this phase were oxygen-dependent, consistent with a bimolecular rate constant of 6.3 ± 0.2 × 105 m−1s−1 (k1) (Table 1). The second phase (0.1–20 s) was a small decrease in absorbance at 390 nm and a large increase in absorbance at 446 nm. The rate constants during this phase (k2) were independent of oxygen concentration and measured 0.52 ± 0.01 s−1. The reaction at oxygen concentration of 1.03 mm was measured with wavelengths of detection ranging from 310–550 nm, and the absorbances at a reaction time of 0.1 s were plotted (filled circle spectrum in the inset in Fig. 2A) to obtain an intermediate spectrum after the first phase. The spectrum in the inset in Fig. 2A had a maximum absorption peak at 390 nm, similar to that of a C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN intermediate in the reactions of wild-type C2 and other variants (15Ruangchan N.

Therefore, the first phase shown in Fig. 2A was the formation of C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN, and the second phase was the elimination of H2O2 from the intermediate to generate oxidized FMN (Fig. 3). For other His-120 variants, the kinetics of the reactions are shown in supplemental Figs. 1–5. All His-120 variants show similar kinetic patterns as those of H120K and wild-type enzymes (15Ruangchan N. Tongsook C. Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the reactions are depicted in Fig. 3. Rate constants for the formation and decay of C4a-hydroperoxy flavin are summarized in Table 1. The rate constants for C4a-hydroperoxy flavin formation in these variants are similar to that of wild-type C2, whereas those for H2O2 elimination are similar for H120Q and H120Y, ∼7–10-fold higher for H120N, H120D, and H120E and ∼170-fold higher for H120K.TABLE 1Summary of the rate constants for the reactions of H120N·FMNH−, H120Q·FMNH−, H120Y·FMNH−, H120D·FMNH−, H120E·FMNH−, H120K·FMNH−, S146A·FMNH−, and S146C·FMNH− with oxygen in the absence and presence of HPAEnzymesRate constant of C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN formation (k1)Rate constant of H2O2 elimination from C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN (k2)Rate constant of C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN·HPA formation (k3)Rate constant of hydroxylation (k4)Rate constant of C4a-hydroxy-FMN dehydration (k5)m−1s−1s−1m−1s−1s−1s−1C2 wild type1.1 × 106 aRate constants of the wild-type enzyme at pH 7.0, 4 °C from (15).3 × 10−3 aRate constants of the wild-type enzyme at pH 7.0, 4 °C from (15).4.8 × 104 aRate constants of the wild-type enzyme at pH 7.0, 4 °C from (15).16 aRate constants of the wild-type enzyme at pH 7.0, 4 °C from (15).0.35 aRate constants of the wild-type enzyme at pH 7.0, 4 °C from (15).H120 variantsH120N6.2 ± 0.3 × 1051.9 ± 0.2 × 10−26.7 ± 0.2 × 105 bRate constants of the reactions of H120N·FMNH− and H120D·FMNH− with oxygen in the presence of HPA.

https://openalex.org/W2073705264,"The vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) is a secretory vesicle protein that is responsible for the vesicular storage and subsequent exocytosis of ATP (Sawada, K., Echigo, N., Juge, N., Miyaji, T., Otsuka, M., Omote, H., and Moriyama, Y. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 5683-5686). Because VNUT actively transports ATP in a membrane potential (Δψ)-dependent manner irrespective of divalent cations such as Mg(2+) and Ca(2+), VNUT recognizes free ATP as a transport substrate. However, whether or not VNUT transports chelating complexes with divalent cations remains unknown. Here, we show that proteoliposomes containing purified VNUT actively took up Mg(2+) when ATP was present, as detected by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The VNUT-containing proteoliposomes also took up radioactive Ca(2+) upon imposing Δψ (positive-inside) but not ΔpH. The Δψ-driven Ca(2+) uptake required ATP and a millimolar concentration of Cl(-), which was inhibited by Evans blue, a specific inhibitor of SLC17-type transporters. VNUT in which Arg-119 was specifically mutated to alanine, the counterpart of the essential amino acid residue of the SLC17 family, lost the ability to take up both ATP and Ca(2+). Ca(2+) uptake was also inhibited in the presence of various divalent cations such as Mg(2+). Kinetic analysis indicated that Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) did not affect the apparent affinity for ATP. RNAi of the VNUT gene in PC12 cells decreased the vesicular Mg(2+) concentration to 67.7%. These results indicate that VNUT transports both nucleotides and divalent cations probably as chelating complexes and suggest that VNUT functions as a divalent cation importer in secretory vesicles under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2074663180,"Early invasive growth and metastasis are features of pancreatic cancer that rely on its resistance to anoikis, an apoptosis program activated on loss of matrix anchorage. How anoikis is regulated is unclear. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylman-nosamine-kinase (GNE) was silenced, or p16 was over-expressed, in human pancreatic carcinoma cells. Gene expression profiling, enzymatic assays, Western blotting, and cell cycle analysis were conducted. Silencing of GNE, the key enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis, sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to anoikis. Accordingly, we observed a loss of GNE enzyme activity in cells, which became anoikis susceptible after transfection with the tumor suppressor p16. Similarly, studies of another cell line with low GNE activity revealed strong anoikis susceptibility, confirming the association of low GNE activity and anoikis susceptibility. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that the loss of GNE triggered the transcriptional activation of the ATF4-ATF3-CHOP pathway, leading to apoptosis in the framework of the unfolded protein response. In silico analysis showed that GNE up-regulation occurred predominantly in pancreatic cancer but also in other malignancies. Delineation of GNE-dependent signaling pathways may provide targets that control anchorage dependence and/or restore drug efficacy, which is of utmost relevance for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.—Kemmner, W., Kessel, P., Sanchez-Ruderisch, H., Möller, H., Hinderlich, S., Schlag, P.

The cytosolic tails of integrins are essential for transmitting bidirectional signaling and also implicated in maintaining the resting states of the receptors. In addition, cytosolic tails of integrins often undergo post-translation modifications like phosphorylation. However, the consequences of phosphorylation on the structures and interactions are not clear. The leukocyte-specific integrin αMβ2 is essential for myeloid cell adhesion, phagocytosis, and degranulation. In this work, we determined solution structures of the myristoylated cytosolic tail of αM and a Ser phosphorylated variant in dodecylphosphocholine micelles by NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the interactions between non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated αM tails with β2 tail were investigated by NMR and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The three-dimensional structures of the 24-residue cytosolic tail of αM or phosphorylated αM are characterized by an N-terminal amphipathic helix and a loop at the C terminus. The residues at the loop are involved in packing interactions with the hydrophobic face of the helix. 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence experiments identified residues of αM and β2 tails that may be involved in the formation of a tail-tail heterocomplex. We further examined interactions between myristoylated β2 tail in dodecylphosphocholine micelles with dansylated αM tail peptides by FRET. These studies revealed enhanced interactions between αM or phosphorylated αM tails with β2 tail with Kd values ∼5.2 ± 0.6 and ∼4.4 ± 0.7 μm, respectively.

Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6847) Google Scholar). Each subunit has a large extracellular region that is required for ligand binding, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (2Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev.

Integrin occupation and clustering induce cytoplasmic signaling by recruiting cytoplasmic adaptor and cytoskeletal proteins to its cytoplasmic tails, ultimately forming an integrin adhesome (4Zaidel-Bar R.

They are αLβ2 (LFA-1, CD11aCD18), αMβ2 (Mac-1, CD11bCD18), αXβ2 (p150,95, CD11cCD18), and αDβ2 (CD11dCD18). The functional importance of the β2 integrins is underscored by the high susceptibility to microbial infections of leukocyte adhesion deficiency I and III patients (9Abram C.L. Lowell C.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2009; 87: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The adhesive and migratory properties of the leukocytes are compromised in these patients because of disrupting mutations in the β2 subunit (leukocyte adhesion deficiency I) or in the integrin cytoplasmic regulator kindlin-3 (leukocyte adhesion deficiency III) that regulates the activation of the β2 integrins (10Hogg N.

Although αM has a short cytoplasmic tail as compared with αL, αX, and αD, it serves important functions in regulating αMβ2 ligand binding and outside-in signaling. It is well established that αMβ2 outside-in signaling regulates neutrophil survival. In particular, αMβ2 with a truncated αM cytoplasmic tail or with the αM tail replaced by a αL tail have an impaired ability to protect transfected K562 cells from apoptosis as a result of inactivation of Akt and Erk1/2 (25Pluskota E. Soloviev D.A. Szpak D. Weber C. Plow E.F. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 3609-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Notably, αMβ2, but not the αMβ2 mutant with its αM cytoplasmic tail replaced with that of αL or αX, recruits the Src family kinase Hck (26Tang R.H. Law S.K. Tan S.M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4435-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a genome-wide association study found an association between systemic lupus erythematosus and a non-synonymous SNP, rs1143678 (C→T), that substitutes amino acid Pro1130 with Ser in the αM tail (27Harley J.B. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1053-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of integrin cytoplasmic tails is an important post-translational modification that is necessary for integrin functions (28Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Gahmberg C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 504-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In polymorphonuclear leukocytes, the αM cytoplasmic tail is constitutively phosphorylated, whereas the phosphorylation of the β2 tail is dependent on cellular activation (29Buyon J.P. Slade S.G. Reibman J. Abramson S.B. Philips M.R. Weissmann G. Winchester R. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 191-197PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chatila T.A. Geha R.S. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3435-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). There are two phosphorylation sites in the αM cytosolic tail, Tyr1121 and Ser1126. Interestingly, it was found that mutation of Ser1126 in the αM cytosolic tail disrupts the ability of αMβ2 to bind intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-2 but not iC3b and denatured BSA (31Tang M.L. Vararattanavech A. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25392-25403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that αM cytosolic tail Ser1126 phosphorylation plays an important role in αMβ2 functional regulation. Indeed, the mutant αMS1126Aβ2 failed to react with the activation reporter mAb KIM127 and bound poorly to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (32Fagerholm S.C. Varis M. Stefanidakis M. Hilden T.J. Gahmberg C.G. Blood. 2006; 108: 3379-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, cells expressing αMS1126Aβ2, but not wild-type αMβ2, when injected into mice showed reduced extravasation into the spleens and lungs (32Fagerholm S.C. Varis M. Stefanidakis M.

Collectively, these data suggest that the αM cytoplasmic tail is pivotal in the regulation of αMβ2 ligand binding and outside-in signaling. To understand the mechanism of αMβ2 regulation and its cytoplasmic signaling, detailed analyses of its cytoplasmic tails are required. In this study, solution structures of myristoylated αM tail in two forms, phosphorylated (Ser(P)1126) and non-phosphorylated, were determined in solution containing dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) 3The abbreviations used are: DPCdodecylphosphocholineHSQCheteronuclear nuclear single quantum coherencedansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylKSIketosteroid isomeraseMyrmyristoylatedMyr-Pmyristoylated and phosphorylatedDandansylated and unphosphorylatedDan-Pdansylated and phosphorylatedTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyPREparamagnetic relaxation enhancementTMtransmembrane domain. micelles. Interactions studies between the αM and β2 tails using NMR and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) demonstrated a low affinity binding for the non-myristoylated tails in solution.

Synthetic cytoplasmic tail peptides of αM and β2 used in this study are given in Table 1. All of the cytoplasmic tail peptides (myristoylated, non-myristoylated, and other derivatives) were purchased from GL Biochem (Shanghai, China) and were further purified using reverse phase HPLC (Waters, Milford, MA) connected to a C18 column (300-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size). A linear gradient of acetonitrile/water with a flow rate of 2 ml/min was used to elute the peptides, and the major peak fractions were lyophilized. The mass of the peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry.TABLE 1Synthetic cytosolic tail peptides of αM and β2 used in this workPeptideSequenceMyr-αMMyr-1KLGFFKRQYKDMMSEGGPPGAEPQ24Myr-PαMaPαM, Myr-PαM, and Dan-PαM contain phosphorylation at Ser (pS; bold) residue.Myr-1KLGFFKRQYKDMMpSEGGPPGAEPQ24αM1KLGFFKRQYKDMMSEGGPPGAEPQ24PαMaPαM, Myr-PαM, and Dan-PαM contain phosphorylation at Ser (pS; bold) residue.1KLGFFKRQYKDMMpSEGGPPGAEPQ24β21KALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFKSATTTVINPKFAES46β2H5WbThe sequences of β2H5W and Myr-β2H5W were mutated at position His5 and Trp24 with residues Trp and Ala, respectively.

Reibman J. Abramson S.B. Philips M.R. Weissmann G. Winchester R. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 191-197PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length β2 tail (Lys702–Ser747) that was subcloned into the AlwNI site of pET-31b(+) vector (Novagen, EMD, San Diego, CA) containing an N-terminal ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) has been reported previously (33Bhunia A. Tang X.Y. Mohanram H. Tan S.M. Bhattacharjya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3873-3884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the full-length αM tail (Lys1113–Gln1136) with the terminating stop codon was PCR-amplified from αM-pcDNA3.0 expression plasmid (31Tang M.L. Vararattanavech A. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25392-25403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and cloned into the AlwNI site of the pET-31b(+) vector. The forward primer used for the PCR was designed such that formic acid cleavage GGGGSDP sequence (34Jaroniec C.P. Kaufman J.D. Stahl S.J. Viard M. Blumenthal R. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16167-16180Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was introduced between the KSI and the αM tail sequences. The DP site allows cleavage of the αM tail from the KSI using formic acid in subsequent protein expression and purification procedures. A stop codon was introduced immediately after Gln1136 in the αM tail that disrupts the expression of a C-terminal His6 tag in the pET-31b(+) vector; therefore, we constructed a His6 tag at the N terminus of the KSI to generate the final expression plasmid containing His6-KSI-GGGGSDP-αM tail. This allowed affinity purification of the fusion protein, cleavage of the fusion protein by formic acid, and recovery of full-length αM tail without additional tag sequences. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic tails of αM (Lys1113–Gln1136) and β2 (Lys702–Ser747) are numbered as αM (Lys1–Gln24) and β2 (Lys1–Ser46), respectively. Fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) either in LB medium or in M9 minimal medium supplemented with [15N]ammonium chloride and/or [15N]ammonium chloride/[13C]glucose as described in our previous study (33Bhunia A. Tang X.Y. Mohanram H. Tan S.M. Bhattacharjya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3873-3884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the induction of protein expression, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.8 mm) was added, and the bacteria culture was incubated at 25 °C. The harvested cell pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.9), sonicated on ice, and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The protein pellet was then resuspended in binding buffer containing 8 m urea, and His6-tagged fusion protein was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) column. The fusion protein was eluted in elution buffer (300 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and dialyzed against distilled water overnight at 4 °C. The protein precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. CNBr in 70% (v/v) formic acid was used for the cleavage of the β2 tail from the KSI fusion partner as described previously (33Bhunia A. Tang X.Y. Mohanram H. Tan S.M. Bhattacharjya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3873-3884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the cleavage of the αM tail from the KSI fusion partner, the fusion protein precipitate was dissolved in 90% (v/v) formic acid and incubated overnight at room temperature. The solution was then evaporated to dryness at 28 °C in a rotary evaporator. The protein gel was dissolved in deionized water. The KSI protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cleaved αM or β2 tails were subjected to reverse phase HPLC (Waters) purification on a C18 column (300-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size) by a linear gradient of an acetonitrile/water mixture. All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 600-MHz instrument equipped with an actively shielded cryoprobe. NMR data were processed using TOPSPIN 2.1 and analyzed with SPARKY. 4T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, unpublished work. Two-dimensional 1H-1H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and two-dimensional 1H-1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments were carried out for myristoylated αM (Myr-αM) and myristoylated and phosphorylated αM (Myr-PαM) at a concentration of 0.7 mm in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.6, containing 200 mm perdeuterated DPC (DPC-d38) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) at 308 K. NOESY spectra were acquired for myristoylated peptides (200 μm) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.6 at 308 K. TOCSY and NOESY spectra were acquired for non-myristoylated αM tail peptide at a concentration of 0.7 mm in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.6 at 278 K. The phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated αM tail peptides were also dissolved in 200 mm perdeuterated DPC to record both TOCSY and NOESY spectra. The mixing time for TOCSY and NOESY experiments was fixed to 50 and 200 ms, respectively. Natural abundance 13C-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments were carried out for Myr-αM and Myr-PαM in DPC solution under similar D2O buffer conditions to obtain 13Cα chemical shifts. Paramagnetic perturbation studies of the myristoylated or non-myristoylated αM tails with or without 200 mm DPC were carried out in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.6 by acquiring two-dimensional NOESY and TOCSY spectra with 200- and 50-ms mixing times, respectively, in the absence or presence of 1 mm MnCl2. The changes in the intensity of intraresidue CαH/HN cross-peaks were normalized to the peak intensity of the respective unperturbed spectra. Standard three-dimensional HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments were performed with 0.5 mm 15N/13C-labeled samples of αM and β2 tails at 298 K to obtain backbone resonance assignments. The interactions between the tails of β2 and αM or PαM were determined by 1H-15N HSQC experiments. HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled β2 or αM tail peptides were acquired in the presence of unlabeled αM or phosphorylated αM or of unlabeled β2 tail peptides, respectively. Samples were prepared by dissolving lyophilized powder of tail peptides in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The chemical shift changes, after addition of the unlabeled binding partners, of the backbone amide nitrogen and amide proton of each residue were calculated using the following equation: Δ1H + Δ15N where Δ1H is the absolute value of the change in amide proton chemical shift and Δ15N is the absolute value of the change in backbone amide nitrogen chemical shift. Circular dichroic measurements were performed by a Chirascan CD spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) using a cuvette of 0.1-cm path length (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany). CD spectra of 0.2 mm Myr-αM and Myr-PαM in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 60 mm DPC and of 0.3 mm synthetic αM in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 were acquired from wavelengths of 190–240 nm at 0.1-s time steps. CD spectra were averaged over three scans and subtracted from the corresponding background buffer contributions. The final CD spectra were converted to molar ellipticity. Three-dimensional structures of Myr-αM and Myr-PαM were determined using CYANA 2.1 (35Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar). Interproton distance restraints were derived from strong, medium, and weak NOE intensities translated to upper bound distance limits of 2.5, 3.5, and 5.0 Å, respectively. Backbone dihedral angle (φ, ψ) restraints were determined based on 13Cα chemical shifts using PREDITOR (36Berjanskii M.V. Neal S. Wishart D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W63-W69Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Of the 100 structures, the 20 lowest energy structures were selected for evaluation and analyses. PROCHECK-NMR (37Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4400) Google Scholar) was used to evaluate the stereochemical quality of the structure ensembles, and structures were visualized using PyMOL, MOLMOL, and Discovery Studio 2.0. RosettaDock (38Lyskov S. Gray J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W233-W238Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) was used to generate low energy models of the complexes between the αM tails and β2 tail. All fluorescence studies were conducted using a 0.5-cm path length luminescence spectroscopy microcell (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer. Peptide samples were prepared in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 containing 1.2 mm DPC. FRET experiments were typically conducted by collecting fluorescence emission spectra of intrinsic Trp residue of Myr-β2 tail mutated (β2H5W) or Myr-β2 at 1 μm concentration in the presence of various concentrations (ranging from 1 to 5 μm) of dansylated and unphosphorylated αM (Dan-αM) and phosphorylated αM (Dan-PαM) tail peptides. Samples were excited at a wavelength of 295 nm, and emission was monitored from 310 to 400 nm. The extent of quenching of Trp emission (resulting from FRET) of Myr-β2H5W at 355 nm was used to determine the dissociation constants (Kd) for the interactions between the β2 and αM tail peptides following a standard non-linear least square fit. Additional FRET studies were also performed for the non-myristoylated β2H5W in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 and myristoylated β2H5W in 50% acetonitrile, buffer mixture with dansylated αM peptides. We used a myristoylation strategy, i.e. covalently attaching a myristic acid to the N terminus of the αM cytoplasmic tail, to determine three-dimensional structures in the DPC lipid micelles. The long acyl chain (C14) of myristic acid, a probable mimic of the transmembrane domain, may stabilize conformations of peptides (39Losonczi J.A. Prestegard J.H.

Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the acylated cytosolic tails of integrins were found to be biologically active (40Vinogradova O. Vaynberg J. Kong X. Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Qin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4094-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 41Edwards R.J. Moran N. Devocelle M. Kiernan A. Meade G. Signac W. Foy M. Park S.D. Dunne E. Kenny D. Shields D.C. Nat. Chem.

Fig. 1 shows two-dimensional 1H-1H NOESY spectra correlating low field resonances (6.5–9.0 ppm) with upfield resonances (0.8–4.5 ppm) of the 24-residue synthetic αM tail peptides (Table 1) in Myr-αM (Fig. 1A) and Myr-PαM (Fig. 1B) in DPC micelles at 308 K and non-myristoylated αM in aqueous solution at 278 K (Fig. 1C). As evident from the figure, there are dramatic differences in the NOE connectivities observed for the Myr-αM (Fig. 1A), Myr-PαM (Fig. 1B), and αM (Fig. 1C). There were lesser NOE connectivities in the NOESY spectrum of αM tail in free solution even at 278 K, particularly among the backbone/side chain and side chain/side chain resonances (Fig. 1C). By contrast, the NOESY spectra of the Myr-αM and Myr-PαM demonstrated an overwhelming number of NOE connectivities in solutions containing DPC micelles (Fig. 1, A and B). The paucity of NOE interactions observed for the non-myristoylated αM tail in aqueous solution indicates a lack of significant populations of folded conformations. The structural transitions of the αM cytosolic tail peptides were also examined by far-UV CD spectroscopy (supplemental Fig. S1). The myristoylated peptides Myr-αM and Myr-PαM in DPC micelles showed negative CD bands at 225 and 208 nm diagnostic of helical structure (43Adler A.J. Greenfield N.J. Fasman G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 675-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). By contrast, far-UV CD spectra of the non-myristoylated αM peptide delineated an intense CD band of negative ellipticity at ∼200 nm, indicating random conformations (43Adler A.J. Greenfield N.J. Fasman G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 675-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). To ascertain conformational stabilization of αM tail peptides by myristoylation and micelle incorporation, NOESY spectra were also acquired for the non-myristoylated and myristoylated αM tail peptides either in DPC-containing solutions (supplemental Fig. S2) or in aqueous solutions, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3). Again, the myristoylated αM tail peptides in the presence of DPC micelles yielded a greater number of NOE connectivities in comparison with the non-myristoylated tail peptides in DPC or myristoylated tail peptides in aqueous solutions. The NMR spectra of the myristoylated tail peptides in aqueous solutions appeared to be significantly broadened (supplemental Fig. S3). Such broad resonances may potentially arise as a result of aggregations of the myristoylated peptides in aqueous solutions. In other words, the myristoylated peptides may be improperly folded in the absence of DPC detergent solution. Therefore, the presence of a large number of NOE connectivities for the Myr-αM and Myr-PαM establishes that the cytoplasmic tails of αM, either non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated at residue Ser14, acquire well defined conformations in the presence of DPC micelles. We further probed whether the myristoylated peptides Myr-αM and Myr-PαM were inserted into the DPC micelles using NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments. In these studies, two-dimensional 1H-1H NOESY spectra were acquired for the myristoylat"
https://openalex.org/W1998550611,"Lamin B receptor (LBR) is a polytopic protein of the nuclear envelope thought to connect the inner nuclear membrane with the underlying nuclear lamina and peripheral heterochromatin. To better understand the function of this protein, we have examined in detail its nucleoplasmic region, which is predicted to harbor a Tudor domain (LBR-TD). Structural analysis by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy establishes that LBR-TD indeed adopts a classical β-barrel Tudor fold in solution, which, however, features an incomplete aromatic cage. Removal of LBR-TD renders LBR more mobile at the plane of the nuclear envelope, but the isolated module does not bind to nuclear lamins, heterochromatin proteins (MeCP2), and nucleosomes, nor does it associate with methylated Arg/Lys residues through its aromatic cage. Instead, LBR-TD exhibits tight and stoichiometric binding to the ""histone-fold"" region of unassembled, free histone H3, suggesting an interesting role in histone assembly. Consistent with such a role, robust binding to native nucleosomes is observed when LBR-TD is extended toward its carboxyl terminus, to include an area rich in Ser-Arg residues. The Ser-Arg region, alone or in combination with LBR-TD, binds both unassembled and assembled H3/H4 histones, suggesting that the TD/RS interface may operate as a ""histone chaperone-like platform."""
https://openalex.org/W2115931591,"Protein misfolding is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and occurs in aging. However, the contribution of the misfolded ensembles to toxicity remains largely unknown. Here we introduce 2 primate cell models of destabilized proteins devoid of specific cellular functions and interactors, as bona fide misfolded proteins, allowing us to isolate the gain-of-function of non-native structures. Both GFP-degron and a mutant chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase fused to GFP (GFP-Δ9CAT) form perinuclear aggregates, are degraded by the proteasome, and colocalize with and induce the chaperone Hsp70 (HSPA1A/B) in COS-7 cells. We find that misfolded proteins neither significantly compromise chaperone-mediated folding capacity nor induce cell death. However, they do induce growth arrest in cells that are unable to degrade them and promote stress-induced death upon proteasome inhibition by MG-132 and heat shock. Finally, we show that overexpression of all heat-shock factor-1 (HSF1) and Hsp70 proteins, as well as wild-type and deacetylase-deficient (H363Y) SIRT1, rescue survival upon stress, implying a noncatalytic action of SIRT1 in response to protein misfolding. Our study establishes a novel model and extends our knowledge on the mechanism of the function-independent proteotoxicity of misfolded proteins in dividing cells."

The conditional transgenic mice with cartilage-specific RB1CC1 excess that were used in the present study were made for the first time by the Cre-loxP system. Cartilage-specific RB1CC1 excess caused dwarfism in mice without causing obvious abnormalities in endochondral ossification and subsequent skeletal development from embryo to adult. In vitro and in vivo analysis revealed that the dwarf phenotype in cartilaginous RB1CC1 excess was induced by reductions in the total amount of cartilage and the number of cartilaginous cells, following suppressions of type II collagen synthesis and Erk1/2 signals. In addition, we have demonstrated that two kinds of SNPs (T-547C and C-468T) in the human RB1CC1 promoter have significant influence on the self-transcriptional level. Accordingly, human genotypic variants of RB1CC1 that either stimulate or inhibit RB1CC1 transcription in vivo may cause body size variations."
https://openalex.org/W2028722238,"Free reduced flavins are involved in a variety of biological functions. They are generated from NAD(P)H by flavin reductase via co-factor flavin bound to the enzyme. Although recent findings on the structure and function of flavin reductase provide new information about co-factor FAD and substrate NAD, there have been no reports on the substrate flavin binding site. Here we report the structure of TTHA0420 from Thermus thermophilus HB8, which belongs to flavin reductase, and describe the dual binding mode of the substrate and co-factor flavins. We also report that TTHA0420 has not only the flavin reductase motif GDH but also a specific motif YGG in C terminus as well as Phe-41 and Arg-11, which are conserved in its subclass. From the structure, these motifs are important for the substrate flavin binding. On the contrary, the C terminus is stacked on the NADH binding site, apparently to block NADH binding to the active site. To identify the function of the C-terminal region, we designed and expressed a mutant TTHA0420 enzyme in which the C-terminal five residues were deleted (TTHA0420-ΔC5). Notably, the activity of TTHA0420-ΔC5 was about 10 times higher than that of the wild-type enzyme at 20-40 °C. Our findings suggest that the C-terminal region of TTHA0420 may regulate the alternative binding of NADH and substrate flavin to the enzyme."
