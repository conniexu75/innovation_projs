https://openalex.org/W2044594872,"Circumstantial evidence has accumulated suggesting that CFTR is a regulated low-conductance Cl- channel. To test this postulate directly, we have purified to homogeneity a recombinant CFTR protein from a high-level baculovirus-infected insect cell line. Evidence of purity included one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, N-terminal peptide sequence, and quantitative amino acid analysis. Reconstitution into proteoliposomes at less than one molecule per vesicle was accomplished by established procedures. Nystatin and ergosterol were included in these vesicles, so that nystatin conductance could serve as a quantitative marker of vesicle fusion with a planar lipid bilayer. Upon incorporation, purified CFTR exhibited regulated chloride channel activity, providing evidence that the protein itself is the channel. This activity exhibited the basic biophysical and regulatory properties of the type of Cl- channel found exclusively in CFTR-expressing cell types and believed to underlie cAMP-evoked secretion in epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W1982647438,"Studies in Trembler and control mice demonstrated that myelinating Schwann cells exert a profound influence on axons. Extensive contacts between myelin and axons have been considered structural. However, demyelination decreases neurofilament phosphorylation, slow axonal transport, and axonal diameter, as well as significantly increasing neurofilament density. In control sciatic nerves with grafted Trembler nerve segments, these changes were spatially restricted: they were confined to axon segments without normal myelination. Adjacent regions of the same axons had normal diameters, neurofilament phosphorylation, cytoskeletal organization, and axonal transport rates. Close intercellular contacts between myelinating Schwann cells and axons modulate a kinase-phosphatase system acting on neurofilaments and possibly other substrates. Myelination by Schwann cells sculpts the axon-altering functional architecture, electrical properties, and neuronal morphologies."
https://openalex.org/W1482195692,"Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), also known as 92-kDa gelatinase/type IV collagenase, is secreted from neutrophils, macrophages, and a number of transformed cells in zymogen form. Here we report that matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3/stromelysin) is an activator of the precursor of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (proMMP-9). MMP-3 initially cleaves proMMP-9 at the Glu40-Met41 bond located in the middle of the propeptide to generate an 86-kDa intermediate. Cleavage of this bond triggers a change in proMMP-9 that renders the Arg87-Phe88 bond susceptible to the second cleavage by MMP-3, resulting in conversion to an 82-kDa form. alpha 2-Macroglobulin binding studies of partially activated MMP-9 demonstrate that the 82-kDa species is proteolytically active, but not the initial intermediate of 86 kDa. This stepwise activation mechanism of proMMP-9 is analogous to those of other members of the MMP family, but the action of MMP-3 on proMMP-9 is the first example of zymogen activation that can be triggered by another member of the MMP family. The results imply that MMP-3 may be an effective activator of proMMP-9 in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1561751955,"Reducing sugars react with protein amino groups to form a diverse group of protein-bound moieties with fluorescent and cross-linking properties. These compounds, called advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), have been implicated in the structural and functional alterations of proteins that occur during aging and long-term diabetes. Although several AGEs have been identified on the basis of de novo synthesis and tissue isolation procedures, the measurement of AGE compounds in vivo has remained difficult. As an approach to the study of AGE formation in vivo, we prepared polyclonal antiserum to an AGE epitope(s) which forms in vitro after incubation of glucose with ribonuclease (RNase). This antiserum proved suitable for the detection of AGEs which form in vivo. Both diabetic tissue and serum known to contain elevated levels of AGEs readily competed for antibody binding. Cross-reactivity studies revealed the presence of a common AGE epitope(s) which forms after the incubation of diverse proteins with glucose. Cross-reactive epitopes also formed with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose. These data suggest that tissue AGEs which form in vivo appear to contain a common immunological epitope which cross-reacts with AGEs prepared in vitro, supporting the concept that immunologically similar AGE structures form from the incubation of sugars with different proteins (Horiuchi, S., Araki, N., and Morino, Y. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7329-7332). None of the known AGEs, such as 4-furanyl-2-furoyl-1H-imidazole, 1-alkyl-2-formyl-3,4-diglycosylpyrrole, pyrraline, carboxymethyllysine, or pentosidine, were found to compete for binding to anti-AGE antibody. These data further suggest that the dominant AGE epitope which forms from the reaction of glucose with proteins under native conditions is immunologically distinct from the structurally defined AGEs described to date."
https://openalex.org/W2020819625,"Long-term potentiation is a long-lasting, use-dependent increase in the strength of synaptic connections. We investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) in determining the duration of potentiation induced by high frequency stimulation of afferents in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. The calcium/calmodulin-dependent production of NO can be initiated by activation of excitatory amino acid receptors and results in increased levels of cGMP in target cells. Here we report that only a relatively short-term potentiation can be induced in the presence of nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an NO synthase inhibitor. The effects of L-NAME on the duration of potentiation are partially reversed by coadministration of L-arginine, a precursor of neuronal NO, and by dibutyryl cGMP. Hemoglobin, which binds extracellular NO, also shortens the duration of stimulus-induced potentiation. The results suggest a role for NO in the maintenance of activity-dependent synaptic enhancements, possibly via the generation of cGMP."

https://openalex.org/W1483189363,"Agonist-regulated redistribution of human beta 2-adrenergic receptors was examined in 293 cells. A specific antiserum recognizing the carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic domain of the receptor was developed, characterized, and used for immunocytochemical localization of receptors in fixed cells by conventional fluorescence and confocal fluorescence microscopy. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced redistribution of receptors from the surface of cells into small (less than 1 micron diameter) punctuate accumulations which were detected in cells within 2 min of agonist addition. The time course of receptor redistribution paralleled that of receptor sequestration measured by ligand binding, and receptor redistribution was reversible in the presence of the beta-adrenergic antagonist alprenolol. Optical sections imaged through cells by confocal microscopy localized receptor accumulations within the cytoplasm. To address the question of receptor internalization further, a mutant receptor possessing an engineered antigenic epitope in the amino-terminal hydrophilic domain was constructed, transfected into cells, and localized using both a monoclonal antibody recognizing the epitope tag (receptor ectodomain) and an antiserum recognizing the carboxyl terminus (receptor endodomain). In untreated cells most receptor antigen was detected at the cell surface, as assessed by accessibility to ectodomain antibodies in unpermeabilized specimens. In isoproterenol-treated cells, however, little receptor antigen was detected at the cell surface. Punctate receptor accumulations present in isoproterenol-treated cells were labeled by antibodies only following permeabilization of cells, as expected if these receptor accumulations were intracellular. Finally, internalized beta-adrenergic receptors colocalized with transferrin receptors, which are markers of endosomal membranes. These data provide several lines of evidence establishing that beta-adrenergic receptors undergo ligand-regulated internalization, they suggest that internalized receptors may be recycled back to the cell surface, and they provide the first direct indication that these processes involve the same endosomal membrane system passaged by constitutively recycling receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2066108840,"L-arginine causes insulin release from pancreatic B cells. Data from three model systems support the hypothesis that L-arginine-derived nitrogen oxides (NOs) mediate insulin release stimulated by L-arginine in the presence of D-glucose and by the hypoglycemic drug tolbutamide. The formation of NO in pancreatic B cells was detected both chemically and by the NO-induced accumulation of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate. NG-substituted L-arginine analogs inhibited the release of both insulin and NO. Protein immunoblot and histochemical analysis with antiserum to type I NO synthase suggest that the formation of NO in pancreatic B cells is catalyzed by an NADPH- (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent type I NO synthase of about 150 kilodaltons."
https://openalex.org/W2014584100,"Kainate, a glutamate receptor agonist, is a potent neuroexcitatory agent that produces epileptiform activity and selective neuronal degeneration. Binding studies using neuronal membrane homogenates or brain sections have identified sites having either high or low affinity for [3H]kainate. Here we report the cloning of a gene, GluR7, with approximately 75% sequence identity with the previously cloned GluR5 and GluR6 subunit genes. Transcripts of the GluR7 gene are evident in brain areas that bind [3H]kainate and are susceptible to kainate-induced neurotoxicity. We have performed ligand binding studies with membranes of transfected HeLa cells expressing GluR6 or GluR7 subunits. Our data show that the GluR6 and GluR7 subunits have a rank order of agonist affinity (domoate greater than kainate much greater than L-glutamate, quisqualate much greater than AMPA, NMDA) and a dissociation constant for kainate (95 and 77 nM, respectively) characteristic of the low affinity kainate-binding sites described in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2090342749,"We have produced the human class II histocompatibility protein, HLA-DR1, as a soluble, secreted glycoprotein in insect cells infected with baculoviruses carrying truncated alpha and beta subunit genes. The peptide-binding site is empty, and the empty molecules are fully competent to bind antigenic peptide. We used the empty molecules to measure an intrinsic rate for peptide association, and to investigate the role of peptide in stabilizing the class II structure. Peptide binding kinetics for the empty molecule are only 10-fold faster than for peptide exchange into an occupied site, suggesting that a conformational change may accompany peptide binding. The native alpha beta heterodimer assembles in the absence of antigenic peptide, but peptide binding stabilizes the empty heterodimer against aggregation and against SDS-induced denaturation."
https://openalex.org/W1522814938,"Eucaryotic organisms possess natural defense processes triggered by stress factors such as injury, infection, and inflammation. The acute phase response is an early defense mechanism during which striking changes in protein synthesis occur in the liver and other tissues. The altered expression of many acute phase protein genes is at the transcriptional level. Some of these genes have DNA binding sites for the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors. We report here that in vivo expression of three isoforms of C/EBP is dramatically changed during the acute phase response. The steady-state mRNA levels of C/EBP alpha decreased significantly in the liver, lung, and fat tissues of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice; moreover, nuclear run-off transcription assays indicated a decrease in the rate of C/EBP alpha gene transcription in isolated liver nuclei. The steady-state levels of C/EBP beta and a new isoform, C/EBP delta, were dramatically increased in many tissues within 4 h following LPS treatment. The rates of transcription of these two genes were only minimally altered in liver but significantly increased in kidney nuclei isolated from stimulated animals. Thus, the C/EBP isoforms exhibit differential mechanisms in their responses to LPS in various tissues and are likely to play an important role in mediating the transcriptional activation of genes involved in the acute phase response."
https://openalex.org/W2123917531,"The expression of several forms of cytochrome P450 including P450 1A2, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A was investigated in human hepatocytes maintained in primary culture for 96 h in the absence or presence of 50 microM of various imidazole derivatives. These included ketoconazole, clotrimazole, miconazole, fluconazole, secnidazole and metronidazole. In addition, the typical inducers rifampicin and beta-naphthoflavone were used for comparison. Western and Northern blot analysis of microsomes and RNA prepared from these cultures as well as de novo synthesis experiments revealed that, among the imidazole derivatives tested, only clotrimazole was a strong rifampicin-like inducer of P450 3A. The expression of the other forms of P450 tested was not affected by the treatments. Analysis of the inhibition of 13 monoxygenase activities, including ethoxyresorufin and phenacetin O-deethylases, coumarin 7 alpha-, lauric acid 11- and 12-, mephenytoin 4-, debrisoquin 4-, and aniline hydroxylases, benzphetamine, aminopyrine, mephenytoin and erythromycin demethylases, and cyclosporin oxidase (representative of 10 different forms of P450 in human liver microsomes) revealed that ketoconazole was a strong and selective in vitro inhibitor of P450 3A (cyclosporin oxidase) with a Ki less than 1 microM. Clotrimazole and miconazole were also strong inhibitors of P450 3A-mediated activities in contrast to the other imidazole derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1563789995,"In addition to polynucleotide polymerization, DNA polymerases and bacterial RNA polymerase can also remove nucleotides from the growing end of nucleic acid chains. For DNA polymerases this activity is an important factor in establishing fidelity in DNA synthesis. This report describes a novel in vitro activity of RNA polymerase II whereby it cleaves an RNA chain contained within an active elongation complex. These elongation complexes are arrested at a previously identified, naturally occurring transcriptional pause site in a human gene. The new 3'-end revealed by this cleavage remains associated with an active elongation complex and is capable of being extended by RNA polymerase II. Nascent RNA cleavage is evident after removal of free nucleotides and is dependent upon a divalent metal cation and transcription elongation factor SII. This function of SII could be important in its function as an activator of transcription elongation. It is also possible that the transcript cleavage activity of RNA polymerase II represents a proofreading function of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1584199233,"The glycosylation of human cytokeratin (CK) 8 and 18 was studied after metabolic labeling of HT29 colonic cells with [3H]glucosamine. Labeling of CK8/18 was not inhibited by tunicamycin, suggesting that glycosylation was not N-linked. Acid hydrolysis of CK8 and CK18, purified from [3H]glucosamine-labeled cells, generated free glucosamine. In the presence of UDP-[3H]galactose, galactosyltransferase catalyzed the labeling of cytokeratin 8 and 18. beta-Elimination of the [3H]galactose- labeled CK8/18 generated the disaccharide N-acetyllactosaminitol, indicating that cytokeratin 8 and 18 contain single O-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues. Using chemical analysis, the stoichiometry of glycosylation was found to be 1.5 and 2 molecules of N-acetylglucosamine/protein molecule of CK8 and CK18, respectively. Peptide maps of [3H]glucosamine-labeled CK8/18 showed that multiple peptides were labeled with the amino sugar. The biosynthetic and degradation rates of the carbohydrate moiety were faster than the protein core as determined by metabolic radiolabeling or pulse-chase experiments, respectively. Our results show that CK8 and 18 are glycosylated at multiple sites with a single O-linked N-acetylglucosamine. Furthermore, CK8/18 glycosylation is a dynamic process which is likely to have functional relevance."
https://openalex.org/W1530154863,"Abstract This work characterizes a mutant integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa) from a thrombasthenic patient, ET, whose platelets fail to aggregate in response to stimuli. The nature of defect was defined by the reduced ability of synthetic peptide ligands, corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the fibrinogen gamma chain (gamma 402-411) and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), to increase the binding of the occupancy-dependent anti-LIBS1 antibody to mutant alpha IIb beta 3 and the reduced binding of mutant alpha IIb beta 3 to an immobilized RGD peptide. In addition, ET's platelets failed to bind the ligand-mimetic monoclonal anti-alpha IIb beta 3, PAC1. DNA sequence analysis of amplified ET genomic DNA revealed a single G----A base change which encoded substitution of R214 by Q in mature beta 3. Introduction of this point mutation into recombinant wild type alpha IIb beta 3 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells reproduced the ET platelet alpha IIb beta 3 deficits in binding of fibrinogen, mAb PAC1, and synthetic peptide ligands. Furthermore, substitution of R214 by Q in the synthetic peptide containing the sequence of beta 3(211-222) resulted in decreased ability of this peptide to block fibrinogen binding to purified alpha IIb beta 3. These findings suggest that substitution of beta 3 R214 by Q is responsible for the functional defect in alpha IIb beta 3 and that R214 is proximal to or part of a ligand binding domain in alpha IIb beta 3."
https://openalex.org/W2012944381,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF, cachectin), a protein secreted by activated macrophages, participates in inflammatory responses and in infectious and neoplastic disease states. The mechanisms by which TNF exerts cytotoxic, hormonal, and other specific effects are obscure. Structural studies of the TNF trimer have revealed a central pore-like region. Although several amino acid side chains appear to preclude an open channel, the ability of TNF to insert into lipid vesicles raised the possibility that opening might occur in a bilayer milieu. Acidification of TNF promoted conformational changes concordant with increased surface hydrophobicity and membrane insertion. Furthermore, TNF formed pH-dependent, voltage-dependent, ion-permeable channels in planar lipid bilayer membranes and increased the sodium permeability of human U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells. Thus, some of the physiological effects of TNF may be elicited through its intrinsic ion channel-forming activity."
https://openalex.org/W1520197177,"The use of unequal concentrations of the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) in DNA polymerization reactions alters base substitution error rates in a predictable way. Less is known about the effects of substrate imbalances on base addition and deletion error rates. Thus, we examined pool bias effects on frameshift fidelity during DNA synthesis catalyzed by replicative DNA polymerases. Imbalanced pools altered the frameshift fidelity of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase. Both mutagenic and antimutagenic effects were observed for minus-one, plus-one, and minus-two nucleotide errors, in a highly sequence-specific manner. Most of this specificity can be rationalized by either of two models. One involves frameshifts initiated by pool bias-induced nucleotide misinsertion, and the other involves pool bias-initiated template-primer slippage. Several examples of complex mutations were also recovered more than once in small mutant collections. These contained closely spaced single-base substitution and minus-one base frameshift changes. The two changes occurred at a frequency much higher than predicted if they were generated independently. This suggests that when the polymerase makes one mistake, the probability that it will make a second mistake within the next few incorporations increases significantly. Perturbation of dNTP pools also affected the frameshift fidelity of the replicative yeast DNA polymerase alpha. In reactions containing a low concentration of one dNTP, the error rate increased for one-nucleotide deletions at homopolymeric template nucleotides complementary to the dNTP whose concentration was low. We extended this approach to determine the frameshift fidelity of simian virus 40 origin-dependent semiconservative replication of double-stranded DNA in extracts of human cells. In reactions performed with an equal concentration of all four dNTPs, replication was highly accurate for minus-one-nucleotide errors. However, when the concentration of one dNTP was decreased, the replication error rate increased at complementary, homopolymeric template positions. This response provides an approach for describing frameshift accuracy during replication of the leading and lagging strands."
https://openalex.org/W1931922695,"The B subunit is one of two nucleotide-binding polypeptides found in all members of the vacuolar class of H(+)-translocating ATPases. We have isolated aDNA clone encoding the bovine brain B (58 kDa) subunit and have deduced its amino acid sequence. The bovine brain amino acid sequence is 99% identical to a partial cDNA reported from human brain. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from bovine tissues and a bovine kidney cell line reveals that two messages of approximately 3.2 and 2.0 kilobases (kb) are expressed in all tissues examined except brain, where only the 3.2-kb message can be detected. Northern blotting of RNA isolated from human fibroblast and human lung tumor cell lines reveals that three messages of approximately 6.0, 3.2, and 2.0 kb are expressed, whereas only the 3.2-kb message is expressed in a human brain tumor cell line. This is the first demonstration of tissue-specific expression of multiple forms of a vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit. We have also isolated a partial cDNA clone from bovine brain which appears to encode an isoform of the B subunit. The deduced amino acid sequence is 82% identical to the major bovine brain B subunit sequence; it does not hybridize with either the 3.2- or 2.0-kb message on Northern blot. Southern blot analysis of bovine genomic DNA with probes derived from both isolated cDNAs indicates that the bovine B subunit is encoded by a multigene family."
https://openalex.org/W2046390092,"The mutant mouse spastic (spa) develops a characteristic motor disorder about 2 weeks after birth, with symptoms resembling sublethal poisoning by the glycinergic antagonist strychnine. Correspondingly, adult homozygotic mutants (spa/spa) exhibit a severe reduction of inhibitory glycine receptors in spinal cord and brain. Here we show that the spastic mutation selectively interferes with the postnatal accumulation of the adult isoform of the glycine receptor protein, whereas perinatal expression of the neonatal receptor isoform is not detectably affected. Heterologous expression in X. laevis oocytes of poly(A)+ RNA and Northern blot analysis indicate normal levels of glycine receptor alpha 1 subunit transcripts in spinal cord of adult spastic mutants. Thus, the age-dependent manifestation of spastic symptoms after birth reflects a selective effect of the mutation on the developmental expression of the adult glycine receptor isoform."
https://openalex.org/W2056834243,"Retroviruses can capture cellular sequences and express them as oncogenes. Capture has been proposed to be a consequence of the inefficiency of polyadenylation of the viral genome that allows the packaging of cellular sequences flanking the integrated provirus in virions; after transfer into virions, these sequences could be incorporated into the viral genome by illegitimate recombination during reverse transcription. As a test for this hypothesis, a tissue culture system was developed that mimics the transduction process and allows the analysis and quantitation of capture events in a single step. In this model, transduction of sequences adjacent to a provirus depends on the formation of readthrough transcripts and their transmission in virions and leads to various recombinant structures whose formation is independent of sequence similarity at the crossover site. Thus, all events in the transduction process can be attributed to the action of reverse transcriptase on readthrough transcripts without involving deletions of cellular DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1498711077,"We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of heparin to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth. Previous experiments have shown that heparin inhibits induction of c-fos and c-myc protooncogene mRNA in rat VSMC stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) but not when stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Pukac, L. A., Castellot, J. J., Wright, T. C., Caleb, B. L., and Karnovsky, M. J. (1990) Cell Regul. 1, 435-443). The present experiments show that these mitogens activate distinct second messenger pathways in VSMC, because PMA but not EGF induction of c-fos and c-myc mRNA was suppressed in protein kinase C (PKC) down-regulated VSMC; this suggests that EGF does not act through a PKC-dependent pathway for induction of these genes. Heparin inhibited serum stimulation of c-fos mRNA in control VSMC, but heparin did not inhibit the smaller but significant serum stimulation of c-fos mRNA in PKC down-regulated VSMC, indicating that heparin may selectively inhibit PKC-dependent, but not PKC-independent, stimulation of gene expression. To further determine if heparin inhibits non-PKC pathways, VSMC were treated with dibutyryl cAMP, 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, and Ca2+ ionophore A23187; stimulation of c-fos mRNA by this treatment was not inhibited by heparin. DNA synthesis and cell proliferation were inhibited in rat VSMC exposed briefly to heparin during the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. These experiments indicate heparin can act early in the cell cycle and suggest PKC-dependent but not PKC-independent signaling pathways for gene expression are selectively sensitive to heparin inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1542858183,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays a central role in normal lipid metabolism as the key enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of triglycerides present in chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins. LPL is a member of a family of hydrolytic enzymes that include hepatic lipase and pancreatic lipase. Based on primary sequence homology of LPL to pancreatic lipase, Ser-132, Asp-156, and His-241 have been proposed to be part of a domain required for normal enzymic activity. We have analyzed the role of these potential catalytic residues by site-directed mutagenesis and expression of the mutant LPL in human embryonic kidney-293 cells. Substitution of Ser-132, Asp-156, and His-241 by several different residues resulted in the expression of an enzyme that lacked both triolein and tributyrin esterase activities. Mutation of other conserved residues, including Ser-97, Ser-307, Asp-78, Asp-371, Asp-440, His-93, and His-439 resulted in the expression of active enzymes. Despite their effect on LPL activity, substitutions of Ser-132, Asp-156, and His-241 did not change either the heparin affinity or lipid binding properties of the mutant LPL. In summary, mutation of Ser-132, Asp-156, and His-241 specifically abolishes total hydrolytic activity without disrupting other important functional domains of LPL. These combined results strongly support the conclusion that Ser-132, Asp-156, and His-241 form the catalytic triad of LPL and are essential for LPL hydrolytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2019940001,"In vitro and in vivo model systems for the study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) were used to evaluate compounds for their potential as therapeutic agents. A sulfated polysaccharide-peptidoglycan compound (SP-PG) produced by bacteria controlled the in vitro growth of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated, KS-derived spindle-shaped cells (AIDS-KS cells) at noncytotoxic concentrations. Angiogenesis induced by AIDS-KS cells in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay was blocked by SP-PG, which also inhibited the vascular hyperpermeability response and the angiogenesis associated with the induction of KS-like lesions that develop after subcutaneous inoculation of AIDS-KS cells into nude mice. Suramin, pentosan polysulfate, and interferon alpha, which are currently in use for therapy of KS, were either less effective than SP-PG or much more cytotoxic, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1492805715,"Biochemical and molecular genetic studies were made on a case of placental aromatase (P-450AROM) deficiency. Of the enzymes participating in the electron transport system of placental microsomes, only aromatase activity was decreased specifically in the patient, being less than 0.3% of the normal activity. Northern and Western blotting analyses showed that the transcription of the aromatase gene and the translation of its mRNA proceeded normally in the placenta of this patient. However, aromatase cDNA isolated from a placental cDNA library of the patient was found to have an insert of 87 base pairs, encoding 29 amino acids in frame with no termination codon. The insert was located at the splicing point between exon 6 and intron 6 of the normal aromatase gene, and the extra DNA fragment was the first part of intron 6, except that its initial GT was altered to GC. These findings indicated that in this patient with aromatase deficiency, splicing between exon 6 and intron 6 did not occur at the normal position because of a point mutation in its consensus sequence and was forwarded to GT in the next cryptic consensus sequence 87 base pairs downstream according to the canonical GT/AG rule, resulting in translation of an abnormal protein molecule with 29 extra amino acids. During the transient expression in COS-7 cells, the aromatase cDNA of the patient was found to produce a protein with a trace of activity. This is the first report of a genetic defect for aromatase deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1570126067,"Endocrine factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of the oxytocin (OT) gene were investigated in heterologous expression systems. Plasmids having a 5‘-flanking region of the rat OT gene (-363/+16) or the human OT gene (-382/+41) cloned in front of the firefly luciferase gene were co-transfected with an expression vector for the rat thyroid hormone receptor alpha in P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. Thyroid hormone (T3) stimulated the activity of the rat and human OT promoters about 10-fold. In MCF-7 breast tumor cells transfected with the human OT promoter-luciferase fusion gene, T3 stimulation through endogenous thyroid hormone receptors was about 5-fold. Co-transfection experiments in P19EC cells using 5‘ deletion mutants of the rat OT gene showed that thyroid hormone responsiveness was located in two regions, one located between nucleotides -195 and -172, the other between nucleotides -172 and -148. Each region accounted for about 3-fold T3 stimulation. Gel retardation analysis using extracts from HeLa cells over-producing the c-erbA/TR alpha protein showed specific binding to the -172/-148 element, while no binding occurred on the -195/-172 element. The -172/-148 element which contains the imperfect estrogen response element, GGTGACCTTGACC, has inverted as well as direct repeats of the TGACC motif. Mutagenesis of TGACC motifs separately reduced thyroid hormone responsiveness by about 50%. However, simultaneous mutation of two TGACC motifs abolished the responsiveness to T3 completely. There was no cooperativity between the activated thyroid hormone and estrogen receptors in transfected MCF-7 cells nor in thyroid hormone receptor and estrogen receptor co-transfected P19EC cells. Negative interactions between these two receptors were observed and gel retardation assays showed interaction between the two receptors proteins. It was shown in an in vivo experiment that treatment of rats with thyroid hormone increased hypothalamic OT mRNA levels, the pituitary OT content, as well as OT levels in blood. The results reveal thyroid hormone as a physiological regulator of OT gene expression, which stimulates OT promoter activity directly through interaction with a thyroid hormone-response element in the OT gene."
https://openalex.org/W1552234210,"To aid in studies of human glycoinositol-phospholipid (GPI) anchor pathway biochemistry in normal and affected paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria cells, GPI anchor-defective human K562 cell lines were derived by negative fluorescent sorting of anti-decay-accelerating factor (DAF) monoclonal antibody-stained cells either following or in the absence of ethylmethylsulfonate pretreatment. The resulting cloned cells showed deficiencies of both DAF and GPI-anchored CD59, some (designated group A) exhibiting total absence and some (designated group B) exhibiting approximately 10% levels of surface expression of the two proteins. In heterologous cell fusions, group A clones complemented defective Thy-1 expression by class A, B, C, E, and I Thy-1-negative lymphoma lines, but not H or D lines, the latter of which is defective in the Thy-1 structural gene. In contrast, group B clones complemented all previously described GPI anchor pathway-defective lymphoma classes. Immunoradiomatic assays of cells and supernatants and 35S biosynthetic labeling showed that group A cells degraded DAF protein while group B cells secreted it but failed to attach a GPI anchor structure. [3H]Man labeling of intact cells and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc and GDP-[3H]Man labeling of broken cell preparations demonstrated that group A cells failed to synthesize GlcNAc- and GlcN-PI (GPI-A and -B) as well as more polar mannolipids, whereas group B cells showed accumulation of GlcNAc-PI with approximately 10-fold diminished levels of GlcN-PI and more polar mannolipids. The failed assembly of GlcNAc-PI in group A cells and the reduced conversion of this intermediate to GlcN-PI in group B cells indicates that the former harbors a defect in UDP-GlcNAc transferase or in assembly of its PI acceptor, while the latter harbors a defect in GlcN-PI deacetylase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1606179902,"The mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblastic cell line rapidly differentiates to an adipocyte phenotype when post-confluent cells are treated for 48 h in fetal calf serum-containing medium supplemented with 1 microM dexamethasone (D), 0.5 mM methylisobutylxanthine (M) and 10 micrograms/ml insulin (I). D and I act synergistically to commit the cells to differentiate 24-48 h after initiating treatment, and this is blocked by the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. In order to identify cellular proteins involved in the differentiation process we analyzed differentiating 3T3-L1 cells using two-dimensional electrophoresis on large format gels. We observed changes in over 300 proteins during differentiation (over 100 within 5 h of initiating differentiation) and many of these are also changed at the level of mRNA (by analysis of in vitro translation products). About 75% of the initial changes were maximally induced by treatment with a combination of M and I, while no more than 10 proteins and their corresponding mRNAs were maximally induced by D within 3.5 h. Another 10 proteins were synergistically regulated by the combination of all three agents (DMI) within 3.5 h. Additional species were induced at later times. Five of these were synergistically induced by treatments that lead to differentiation, were first expressed at elevated levels during commitment and remained elevated in fully differentiated adipocytes. One or more of these proteins could well have a functional role in the commitment to and/or expression of the adipocyte differentiation program."
https://openalex.org/W1482211797,"Recently, we demonstrated that aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells results in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a 72-kDa protein (pp72). Here we investigated the relationship of pp72 phosphorylation to guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) activation and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. The activation of G proteins by NaF in intact cells or by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) in streptolysin O-permeabilized cells induced both phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and histamine release without tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72. Similarly, in RBL-2H3 cells expressing the G protein-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, carbachol activated phospholipase C and induced secretion without concomitant pp72 phosphorylation. Therefore, pp72 phosphorylation was not induced by G protein activation or as a consequence of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. To investigate whether pp72 tyrosine phosphorylation precedes the activation of phospholipase C, we studied the effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Preincubation of cells with genistein decreased, in parallel, antigen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72 (IC50 = 34 micrograms/ml) and histamine release (IC50 = 31 micrograms/ml). However, genistein at concentrations of up to 60 micrograms/ml did not inhibit phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis nor did it change the amount of the secondary messenger inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate. Previous observations showed that there was no pp72 tyrosine phosphorylation after activation of protein kinase C or after an increase in intracellular calcium. Taken together, these results suggest that pp72 tyrosine phosphorylation represents a distinct, independent signaling pathway induced specifically by aggregation of the Fc epsilon RI."
https://openalex.org/W1487589684,"We have used a full-length clone encoding rabbit tryptophan hydroxylase (TRH) to isolate the Drosophila homologue (DTPH). Southern analysis of Drosophila genomic DNA reveals a pattern indicative of a single gene. The single transcript is expressed in adult head and body mRNA but is also detected in mRNA from early embryos. The embryonic transcript is ubiquitously expressed and appears to concentrate in yolk granules. In situ hybridization of TRH-homologous antisense RNA probe to sectioned tissue from third instar larvae demonstrated the presence of this transcript in fat body and cuticular tissue. Developmental immunoblot analysis using antibodies raised against a beta-galactosidase-Drosophila fusion protein revealed a 45-kDa embryonic protein also detected in female abdomens and a 50-kDa protein found in larval and adult stages. Immunocytochemical analysis of the Drosophila protein in the larval central nervous system showed that it appeared to be present in both serotonin- and catecholamine-containing neurons. A nonfusion protein generated in Escherichia coli hydroxylates both tryptophan and phenylalanine. We propose that there are only two aromatic amino acid hydroxylase genes in Drosophila: one encoding tyrosine hydroxylase, DTH, and DTPH, a gene encoding both tryptophan and phenylalanine hydroxylase activities."
https://openalex.org/W1680009429,Biliverdin reductase is a unique dual cofactor- and pH-dependent enzyme that converts biliverdin to bilirubin and displays extensive inter-organ pI and molecular weight microheterogeneity. Presently we have explored the molecular basis for these properties. The amino acid composition and the sequences of NH2 termini plus five tryptic fragments of purified rat liver and kidney enzymes were obtained. A 62-nucleotide DNA probe was designed and in combination with antibody was used to screen a rat kidney cDNA library. A cDNA sequence of 1108 base pairs (bp) containing an 885-bp open reading frame was generated. The cloned cDNA probe detected a single mRNA of approximately 1500 bp in liver and kidney. The open reading frame encodes a 295 amino acid protein. Methionine and aspartic acid residues at positions 1 and 2 of the deduced protein are removed during processing. The deduced amino acid composition of the mature protein closely matched that of the purified rat liver and kidney enzymes. All liver peptides were found in the deduced amino acid sequence of kidney enzyme and the NH2 termini of both enzymes were identical. The expressed protein co-migrated with purified reductase and was recognized by antiserum to the enzyme. The expressed reductase displayed two distinct pH optima using a different cofactor at each pH: NADH at the lower pH 6.7-6.9 range and NADPH at pH 8.5-8.7. The findings suggest that the liver and kidney enzymes are the products of the same transcript(s) and that their microheterogeneity may reflect tissue-specific post-translational modifications.
https://openalex.org/W2153388221,"Endothelin (ET), a potent stimulator of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) secretion in atrial myocyte cultures, has been hypothesized to act via the stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC). This study was carried out in order to determine if ET activates PKC in atrial cultures and whether this activation fully accounts for the effects of ET on ANF secretion. By monitoring the phosphorylation of p80 upon exposure to phorbol ester or ET, it was shown that ET activated PKC in atrial cultures, but to a lesser extent than phorbol ester. In contrast, ET stimulated ANF secretion to a level five times greater than phorbol ester, indicating that PKC activation alone does not fully account for the effects of ET on ANF secretion. Down-regulation of PKC or exposure to the PKC inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H7) resulted in a 50% decrease in ET-stimulated ANF secretion. Interestingly, increasing calcium influx with BAY K 8644 stimulated ANF secretion but did not effect the phosphorylation of p80, indicating a PKC-independent pathway of ANF secretion. Similarly, a component of ET-stimulated secretion that required calcium influx was independent of PKC activation but was sensitive to the Ca2+/calmodulin kinase (CaMK) inhibitor KN-62. Complete inhibition of ET-mediated ANF secretion was obtained only in the presence of both H7 and KN-62. These results demonstrate that ET activates PKC in atrial myocyte cultures and that the full effects of ET on ANF secretion require both PKC and Ca2+/calmodulin kinase activities."
https://openalex.org/W1543267667,"The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, expresses two abundant stage-specific glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoproteins, the procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP or procyclin) in the procyclic form, and the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) in the mammalian bloodstream form. The GPI anchor of VSG can be readily cleaved by phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), whereas that of PARP cannot, due to the presence of a fatty acid esterified to the inositol. In the bloodstream form trypanosome, a number of GPIs which are structurally related to the VSG GPI anchor have been identified. In addition, several structurally homologous GPIs have been described, both in vivo and in vitro, that contain acyl-inositol. In vivo the procyclic stage trypanosome synthesizes a GPI that is structurally homologous to the PARP GPI anchor, i.e. contains acyl-inositol. No PI-PLC-sensitive GPIs have been detected in the procyclic form. Using a membrane preparation from procyclic trypanosomes which is capable of synthesizing GPI lipids upon the addition of nucleotide sugars we find that intermediate glycolipids are predominantly of the acyl-inositol type, and the mature ethanolamine-phosphate-containing precursors are exclusively acylated. We suggest that the differences between the bloodstream and procyclic form GPI biosynthetic intermediates can be accounted for by the developmental regulation of an inositol acylhydrolase, which is active only in the bloodstream form, and a glyceride fatty acid remodeling system, which is only partially functional in the procyclic form."

Negative staining electron microscopy reveals globular-like structures 10-13 nm in diameter. The receptor has a Stokes radius of 400,000 daltons as determined by molecular sieve high performance liquid chromatography. The receptor preparation binds inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, inositol hexaphosphate (or phytol), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP4, IP6, and IP3, respectively) with submicromolar affinity (0.19, 0.15, and 0.54 microM, respectively) at conditions approximating physiological ionic strength and pH. The purified receptor preparation, when reconstituted into planar bilayers, displays ion channel activity, preferentially permeable to K+. Permeability ratios of the channel are PK+/PNa+ approximately 5 and PK+/PCl approximately 19. In symmetrical 100 mM KCl, the channel is characterized by long open times (minutes) with a conductance of 7.2 picosiemens. The channel is selectively modulated by IP4. That is, at 1 microM IP4, the mean open time decreased substantially to rapid flicker behavior and the channel is completely closed at 10 microM IP4. IP6 and IP3 did not modulate the channel under similar conditions. Thus, the channel appears to be an IP4-modulated K+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W1594891632,"Transmembrane signalling mechanisms of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were examined with special reference to the involvement of G-protein, in intact and permeabilized murine osteoblast-like cells. TNF alpha stimulated the release of 3H radioactivity from intact cells labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid within 10 min in a dose dependent manner and the production of lyso forms of phospholipids, an event presumably mediated through the activation of phospholipase A2. Production of cAMP and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was not affected by TNF alpha. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin inhibited the liberation of [3H]arachidonate. GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate) reduced the binding affinity of [125I]TNF alpha to beta-escin-permeabilized cells. The addition of TNF alpha together with an unhydrolyzable analog of GTP, GTP gamma S, to the beta-escin-permeabilized cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid led to a release of the 3H radioactivity. The production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was markedly stimulated by TNF alpha in a dose over 100 ng/ml, with a latent time of about 3 h, and the stimulation was abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. The time and dose requirements for this process differed from those for the possible activation of phospholipase A2, thereby indicating that other process(es) in addition to the activation of phospholipase A2 may be responsible for the enhanced production of PGE2. The activity of cyclooxygenase (i.e. the combined activities of prostaglandin endoperoxide syntase and PGH2-PGE2 isomerase) was stimulated by TNF alpha with much the same time and dose requirements as for the production of PGE2, and the activation was found to be due to the increased amount of the enzyme, as assessed by a Western blot analysis with anti-cyclooxygenase antibody. This process was also sensitive to pertussis toxin. Therefore, receptors for TNF alpha in MC3T3-E1 cells apparently couple to G-protein sensitive to pertussis toxin and the coupling regulates the activations of phospholipase A2 and the de novo synthesis of cyclooxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W2126312723,"The molecular and biochemical properties of myosin light chain kinases from chicken skeletal and smooth muscle were investigated by recombinant DNA techniques. Deletion of the amino-terminal region of either the smooth or skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase resulted in a decrease in Vmax with no significant change in Km values for light chain substrates. Skeletal/smooth muscle chimeric kinases were inactive when a 65-residue region amino-terminal of the catalytic core was exchanged between the two forms. Changing alanine 494 to glutamic acid within this region in the chicken skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase increased the Km values for light chains 10-fold. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the region amino-terminal of the catalytic core in myosin light chain kinases is involved in light chain recognition. A skeletal muscle kinase which contained the smooth muscle calmodulin binding domain remained regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin. Thus, the calmodulin binding domains of smooth and skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinases share structural elements necessary for regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1503059924,"Abstract We have purified to homogeneity a 38-kDa protein (called p38) from bovine tracheal epithelium. This protein, when reconstituted into liposomes, mediates stilbene disulfonate-sensitive 125I- conductive uptake. On nonreduced or partially reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, this protein associates into a doublet of 62-64 kDa. In some experiments a multimer of 141 kDa was also observed. Rabbit polyclonal anti-P38 antibodies have been produced and used to immunopurify the native transporter. Upon reconstitution of the immunoaffinity-purified protein into liposomes, a 260-fold enhancement of 4,4'-bis(isothiocyano)-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate and valinomycin-sensitive 125I- uptake was observed as compared to proteoliposomes containing unseparated material. On Western blots of total solubilized tracheal membrane proteins or semipurified fractions, the antibody recognized the 62-64-kDa doublet much better than the original 38-kDa antigen. Similar protein bands were detected in T84 and CFPAC cells as well. However, if apical membrane proteins were first separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, the antibody recognized major bands at 140 and approximately 240 kDa. Upon partial reduction, immunolabeling of these proteins diminished with the concomitant appearance of the 62-64-kDa doublet. Upon complete reduction, the appearance of 32- and 38-kDa proteins was evident with the disappearance of the 62-64-kDa doublet. We hypothesize that the native Cl-channel is a heteromer containing at least four subunits connected by S-S bridges."
https://openalex.org/W1507330777,"The reverse transcriptases (RTs) from human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively) are relatively highly related yet there are several significant differences in their catalytic activities. In an attempt to relate these functional dissimilarities to the differences in amino acid sequences, we have employed a novel approach of constructing chimeric molecules composed of complementary amino acid sequences derived from the two HIV RTs. These recombinant proteins were analyzed for their enzymatic activities and for their sensitivity to tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepin-2[1H]-one and thione (TIBO), which selectively inhibits only HIV-1 RT. The active chimeric RTs were used to map the TIBO binding site on the HIV-1 RT molecules and to localize the putative sequences responsible for the high RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT relative to that of HIV-2 RT. The results suggest that TIBO interacts with amino acid residues located around residue 200 within the DNA polymerase domain of HIV-1 RT which shows a relatively low similarity to HIV-2 RT. The difference in the RNase H activity maps to a position in the DNA polymerase domain rather than to the RNase H domain. Out of the 12 chimeric RTs generated, four were either fully active or hyperactive, three others lost most of their catalytic activities, and the rest were totally inactive. The pattern of catalytic activities of these hybrid proteins can be explained by a model for the initial folding of HIV RTs, which entails the formation of three distinct and independently folded regions. Each region can be formed by amino acid sequences derived exclusively from either HIV-1 RT or HIV-2 RT."

We have examined the ability of (-)-enantiomeric carbovir triphosphate to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (EC 2.7.7.49). A comparison of inhibition kinetics was made with 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate and phosphonoformate. Inhibition of the reverse transcriptase was evaluated using poly(rA).oligo(dT)12-18, poly(rC).oligo(dG)12-18, or influenza virion RNA template with a specific oligodeoxynucleotide as primer. (-)-Carbovir 5'-triphosphate was shown to be a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an apparent Ki similar to that of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate. Chain elongation studies utilizing an MS2 RNA template showed that (-)-carbovir 5'-triphosphate terminated transcription at positions identical to those where dideoxy-GTP terminated. This indicates that (-)-carbovir 5'-monophosphate is incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA and terminates transcription at that point. We conclude that (-)-carbovir 5'-triphosphate is a potent inhibitor of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme and that (-)-carbovir most likely inhibits HIV by activity at the triphosphate level by a combination of direct competition for binding of the natural deoxynucleoside triphosphates to the reverse transcriptase and chain termination."
https://openalex.org/W2033344414,"A neuron-specific cytoskeletal antigen (5E10), whose expression pattern during initial motoneuron outgrowth into the chick limb suggests that it is playing a role in axon guidance, is described. This antigen, which was shown to be a phosphorylated epitope, probably of the intermediate weight neurofilament protein (NF-M), exhibits a highly stereotyped and spatially heterogeneous pattern of expression. The point of onset of expression, which was abrupt and occurred in the distal axon and base of the growth cone, differed between groups of neurons that projected to different targets. Specifically, expression occurred from positions where previous perturbation experiments suggested that the axons in question would begin responding to specific guidance cues, and it remained high along the axon from this point to the target. Expression of this antigen could also be induced in cultured motoneurons by activating several second messenger systems."

(1986) Nucleic Acids Res. 14, 1341-1354] from the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila was sequenced and found to have eight introns, four transcription start sites, and a putative polypeptide of 1081 amino acids. A polypeptide 20 amino acids longer could be made if a transcribed in-frame ATG close to the start sites and with suboptimal sequence context is used. This gene was identified through hybridization and amino acid sequence similarity to the previously cloned and sequenced ileRS (cytoplasmic) gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Englisch, U., Englisch, S., Markmeyer, P., Schischkoff, J., Sternbach, H., Kratzin, H., and Cramer, F.

We also compared it to ileRS genes from E. coli and an archaebacterium. Two leucine zippers motifs were identified in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the polypeptide; one of these motifs is in the same area as the zinc finger motif found in the E. coli enzyme.

In inside-out membrane patches from single, uncontacted P cells in culture, cation channel activity was increased by rat brain PKC and cofactors.

https://openalex.org/W1584886353,"Glucocorticoid regulatory elements, denoted GREs and delayed secondary GREs (sGREs), bind the purified glucocorticoid receptors via distinctive sequence motifs and confer a primary and delayed secondary hormone inducibility, respectively, upon a linked reporter construct in stably transfected mammalian cells. The delayed secondary responses, but not the primary responses, are preceded by a time lag of several hours and blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors. In this report, we further characterized and distinguished these hormonal inductions. A 206-base pair DNA fragment from the hepatic rat alpha 2u-globulin (RUG) gene, containing at least two delayed sGREs, was specifically activated by glucocorticoids in a dose-dependent manner via a process which is sensitive to receptor antagonist RU486. Delayed sGRE-stimulated production of correctly initiated transcripts was preceded by a time lag of 2 h, a time when the GRE-mediated induction had reached maximal levels. A pulse of glucocorticoids sustained maximal activation of the delayed secondary response but not the primary response. In fact, hormone withdrawal triggered a premature induction of this delayed secondary response, suggesting that delayed sGREs are under both negative and positive control of the hormone receptor. Two separable elements of the 206-base pair fragment, including the 29-base pair sequence of a single receptor binding site, activated the reporter expression as effectively with transient, pulsatile exposure to hormone as with continuous exposure. Our results suggest that the information content of a hormonal pulse is retained, or memorized, more persistently by a receptor binding site of delayed sGREs than those of the prototypical GREs."
