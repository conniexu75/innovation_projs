https://openalex.org/W1982056270,"Most primary organic-particulate emissions are semivolatile; thus, they partially evaporate with atmospheric dilution, creating substantial amounts of low-volatility gas-phase material. Laboratory experiments show that photo-oxidation of diesel emissions rapidly generates organic aerosol, greatly exceeding the contribution from known secondary organic-aerosol precursors. We attribute this unexplained secondary organic-aerosol production to the oxidation of low-volatility gas-phase species. Accounting for partitioning and photochemical processing of primary emissions creates a more regionally distributed aerosol and brings model predictions into better agreement with observations. Controlling organic particulate-matter concentrations will require substantial changes in the approaches that are currently used to measure and regulate emissions."

We report here that a form of impulsivity in rats predicts high rates of intravenous cocaine self-administration and is associated with changes in dopamine (DA) function before drug exposure. Using positron emission tomography, we demonstrated that D2/3 receptor availability is significantly reduced in the nucleus accumbens of impulsive rats that were never exposed to cocaine and that such effects are independent of DA release. These data demonstrate that trait impulsivity predicts cocaine reinforcement and that D2 receptor dysfunction in abstinent cocaine addicts may, in part, be determined by premorbid influences."

We show that precise focusing can be achieved by fine-tuning the densities of carriers on the n- and p-sides of the junction to equal values, whereas the current distribution in junctions with different densities resembles caustics in optics. This finding can be utilized in the engineering of electronic lenses and focused beam-splitters using gate-controlled \textit{n-p-n} junctions in graphene-based transistors."

https://openalex.org/W2102264469,"A hallmark of mammalian immunity is the heterogeneity of cell fate that exists among pathogen-experienced lymphocytes. We show that a dividing T lymphocyte initially responding to a microbe exhibits unequal partitioning of proteins that mediate signaling, cell fate specification, and asymmetric cell division. Asymmetric segregation of determinants appears to be coordinated by prolonged interaction between the T cell and its antigen-presenting cell before division. Additionally, the first two daughter T cells displayed phenotypic and functional indicators of being differentially fated toward effector and memory lineages. These results suggest a mechanism by which a single lymphocyte can apportion diverse cell fates necessary for adaptive immunity."

https://openalex.org/W2051907575,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and is commonly caused by a constellation of risk factors called the metabolic syndrome. We characterized a family with autosomal dominant early CAD, features of the metabolic syndrome (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes), and osteoporosis. These traits showed genetic linkage to a short segment of chromosome 12p, in which we identified a missense mutation in LRP6 , which encodes a co-receptor in the Wnt signaling pathway. The mutation, which substitutes cysteine for arginine at a highly conserved residue of an epidermal growth factor–like domain, impairs Wnt signaling in vitro. These results link a single gene defect in Wnt signaling to CAD and multiple cardiovascular risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2075385578,"The thalamus provides fundamental input to the neocortex. This input activates inhibitory interneurons more strongly than excitatory neurons, triggering powerful feedforward inhibition. We studied the mechanisms of this selective neuronal activation using a mouse somatosensory thalamocortical preparation. Notably, the greater responsiveness of inhibitory interneurons was not caused by their distinctive intrinsic properties but was instead produced by synaptic mechanisms. Axons from the thalamus made stronger and more frequent excitatory connections onto inhibitory interneurons than onto excitatory cells. Furthermore, circuit dynamics allowed feedforward inhibition to suppress responses in excitatory cells more effectively than in interneurons. Thalamocortical excitatory currents rose quickly in interneurons, allowing them to fire action potentials before significant feedforward inhibition emerged. In contrast, thalamocortical excitatory currents rose slowly in excitatory cells, overlapping with feedforward inhibitory currents that suppress action potentials. These results demonstrate the importance of selective synaptic targeting and precise timing in the initial stages of neocortical processing."

Pichia stipitis is a well-studied, native xylose-fermenting yeast. The mechanism and regulation of xylose metabolism in P. stipitis have been characterized and genes from P. stipitis have been used to engineer xylose metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have sequenced and assembled the complete genome of P. stipitis. The sequence data have revealed unusual aspects of genome organization, numerous genes for bioconversion, a preliminary insight into regulation of central metabolic pathways and several examples of colocalized genes with related functions. The genome sequence provides insight into how P. stipitis regulates its redox balance while very efficiently fermenting xylose under microaerobic conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2091906420,"IKKϵ is an IKK (inhibitor of nuclear factor κBkinase)–related kinase implicated in virus induction of interferon-β (IFNβ). We report that, although mice lacking IKKϵ produce normal amounts of IFNβ, they are hypersusceptible to viral infection because of a defect in the IFN signaling pathway. Specifically, a subset of type I IFN-stimulated genes are not activated in the absence of IKKϵ because the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 complex (ISGF3) does not bind to promoter elements of the affected genes. We demonstrate that IKKϵ is activated by IFNβ and that IKKϵ directly phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), a component of ISGF3. We conclude that IKKϵ plays a critical role in the IFN-inducible antiviral transcriptional response."
https://openalex.org/W1974158357,"How effectively and quickly endothelial caveolae can transcytose in vivo is unknown, yet critical for understanding their function and potential clinical utility. Here we use quantitative proteomics to identify aminopeptidase P (APP) concentrated in caveolae of lung endothelium. Electron microscopy confirms this and shows that APP antibody targets nanoparticles to caveolae. Dynamic intravital fluorescence microscopy reveals that targeted caveolae operate effectively as pumps, moving antibody within seconds from blood across endothelium into lung tissue, even against a concentration gradient. This active transcytosis requires normal caveolin-1 expression. Whole body gamma-scintigraphic imaging shows rapid, specific delivery into lung well beyond that achieved by standard vascular targeting. This caveolar trafficking in vivo may underscore a key physiological mechanism for selective transvascular exchange and may provide an enhanced delivery system for imaging agents, drugs, gene-therapy vectors and nanomedicines. 'In vivo proteomic imaging' as described here integrates organellar proteomics with multiple imaging techniques to identify an accessible target space that includes the transvascular pumping space of the caveola."
https://openalex.org/W1979276366,"Observations made during the historic 2005 hurricane season document a case of “eyewall replacement.” Clouds outside the hurricane eyewall coalesce to form a new eyewall at a greater radius from the storm center, and the old eyewall dies. The winds in the new eyewall are initially weaker than those in the original eyewall, but as the new eyewall contracts, the storm reintensifies. Understanding this replacement mechanism is vital to forecasting variations in hurricane intensity. Processes in the “moat” region between the new and old eyewall have been particularly unclear. Aircraft data now show that the moat becomes dynamically similar to the eye and thus is converted into a region inimical to survival of the inner eyewall. We suggest that targeting aircraft to key parts of the storm to gain crucial input to high-resolution numerical models can lead to improvements in forecasting hurricane intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2013644564,"Long-term potentiation (LTP), which approximates Hebb's postulate of associative learning, typically requires depolarization-dependent glutamate receptors of the NMDA ( N -methyl-D-aspartate) subtype. However, in some neurons, LTP depends instead on calcium-permeable AMPA-type receptors. This is paradoxical because intracellular polyamines block such receptors during depolarization. We report that LTP at synapses on hippocampal interneurons mediating feedback inhibition is “anti-Hebbian”:Itis induced by presynaptic activity but prevented by postsynaptic depolarization. Anti-Hebbian LTP may occur in interneurons that are silent during periods of intense pyramidal cell firing, such as sharp waves, and lead to their altered activation during theta activity."

https://openalex.org/W2021372968,"Theory suggests that the current rapid increase in connectivity and consequential changes in the structure of human, agricultural, and wildlife populations may select for parasite strains with higher infectivity. We carried out a test of this spatial theory by experimentally altering individual host movement rates in a model host/pathogen system by altering the viscosity of their environment. In our microevolutionary selection experiments, the infectivity of the virus was, as predicted by the theory, reduced in the most viscous populations. We therefore provide empirical support for the theory that population structure affects the evolution of infectious organisms."

To better understand polymer-driven DNA segregation, we reconstituted the three-component segregation system of the R1 plasmid from purified components. We found that the ParR/ parC complex can construct a simple bipolar spindle by binding the ends of ParM filaments, inhibiting dynamic instability, and acting as a ratchet permitting incorporation of new monomers and riding on the elongating filament ends. Under steady-state conditions, the dynamic instability of unattached ParM filaments provides the energy required to drive DNA segregation."

https://openalex.org/W2046146206,"Sedimentation filling space beneath ice shelves helps to stabilize ice sheets against grounding-line retreat in response to a rise in relative sea level of at least several meters. Recent Antarctic changes thus cannot be attributed to sea-level rise, strengthening earlier interpretations that warming has driven ice-sheet mass loss. Large sea-level rise, such as the approximately 100-meter rise at the end of the last ice age, may overwhelm the stabilizing feedback from sedimentation, but smaller sea-level changes are unlikely to have synchronized the behavior of ice sheets in the past."
https://openalex.org/W2034498682,"We report on the discovery of a grounding-line sedimentary wedge (""till delta"") deposited by Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica. Our observation is that grounding-line deposition serves to thicken the ice and stabilize the position of the grounding line. The ice thickness at the grounding line is greater than that of floating ice in hydrostatic equilibrium. Thus, the grounding line will tend to remain in the same location despite changes in sea level (until sea level rises enough to overcome the excess thickness that is due to the wedge). Further, our observation demonstrates the occurrence of rapid subglacial erosion, sediment transport by distributed subglacial till deformation, and grounding-line sedimentation, which have important implications for ice dynamics, numerical modeling of ice flow, and interpretation of the sedimentation record."
https://openalex.org/W2006491332,"During the Archean, massive amounts of iron were deposited in the form of banded iron formations. It has been suggested that sedimenting particles of ferric oxyhydroxide may have stripped dissolved phosphate from the oceans, causing a reduction in phytoplankton productivity. However, that model does not take into account the high concentration of dissolved silica that was present in seawater at that time. We show experimentally that silica effectively competes with phosphate for sorption sites on ferrihydrite particles. Furthermore, coprecipitation of silica with ferrihydrite reduces particle reactivity toward phosphate. Hence, Archean oceans probably contained considerably more phosphate than previously predicted."

https://openalex.org/W1973631828,"Although expansion of trinucleotide repeats accounts for over 30 human diseases, mechanisms of repeat instability remain poorly understood. We show that a Drosophila model for the CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 recapitulates key features of human CAG-repeat instability, including large repeat changes and strong expansion bias. Instability is dramatically enhanced by transcription and modulated by nuclear excision repair and a regulator of DNA repair adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB)–binding protein—a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) whose decreased activity contributes to polyQ disease. Pharmacological treatment to normalize acetylation suppressed instability. Thus, toxic consequences of pathogenic polyQ protein may include enhancing repeat instability."

https://openalex.org/W2088064365,"Deleted in colon cancer (DCC) and UNC5 function as netrin dependence receptors by inducing apoptosis in the absence of their ligand and accordingly were recently designated as putative conditional tumor suppressors. Herein, we determined whether netrin-1 and its receptors are implicated in cancer cell invasion and tumor progression. Expression of DCC, UNC5 and adenosine A2B-receptors (A2B-Rs) was investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in human colon cancer cells. The impact of DCC restitution and netrin-1 was evaluated on collagen type I invasion, tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice, cancer cell survival and gene expression profiling. Flow cytometry, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 and caspase-8 activation were used to evaluate the impact of DCC on cell death. Both netrin-1 and A2B-R activation induced the invasive phenotype through the Rho–Rho kinase axis in DCC-deficient human colorectal cancer cells. Restitution of wild-type DCC blocked invasion induced by netrin-1, A2B-R agonist and other agents. Ectopic expression of netrin-1 led to increased growth of human colon tumor xenografts in athymic mice. Conversely, introduction of wt-DCC in kidney MDCKts.src-ggl cells strongly inhibited metastasis in lymph nodes and lungs and increased sensitivity to apoptosis in hypoxia. DNA microarrays revealed that netrin and DCC had common and divergent impacts on gene expression linked to cell cycle, survival, surface signaling and adhesion. Our findings underscore that netrin is a potent invasion and tumor growth-promoting agent and that DCC is a metastasis suppressor gene targeting both proinvasive and survival pathways in a cumulative manner."

The Chankillo towers thus provide evidence of early solar horizon observations and of the existence of sophisticated Sun cults, preceding the Sun pillars of Incaic Cusco by almost two millennia."
https://openalex.org/W2002466582,"In earlier studies, one in six adults had overactive bladder which may impair quality of life. However, earlier studies have either not been population-based or have suffered from methodological limitations. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of overactive bladder symptoms, based on a representative study population and using consistent definitions and exclusions.The aim of the study was to assess the age-standardized prevalence of overactive bladder defined as urinary urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, usually with urinary frequency and nocturia in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. In 2003-2004, a questionnaire was mailed to 6,000 randomly selected Finns aged 18-79 years who were identified from the Finnish Population Register Centre. Information on voiding symptoms was collected using the validated Danish Prostatic Symptom Score, with additional frequency and nocturia questions. Corrected prevalence was calculated with adjustment for selection bias due to non-response. The questionnaire also elicited co-morbidity and socio-demographic information. Of the 6,000 subjects, 62.4% participated. The prevalence of overactive bladder was 6.5% (95% CI, 5.5% to 7.6%) for men and 9.3% (CI, 7.9% to 10.6%) for women. Exclusion of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia reduced prevalence among men by approximately one percentage point (to 5.6% [CI, 4.5% to 6.6%]). Among subjects with overactive bladder, urgency incontinence, frequency, and nocturia were reported by 11%, 23%, and 56% of men and 27%, 38%, and 40% of women, respectively. However, only 31% of men and 35% of women with frequency, and 31% of subjects of both sexes with nocturia reported overactive bladder.Our results indicate a prevalence of overactive bladder as low as 8% suggesting that, in previous studies, occurrence has been overestimated due to vague criteria and selected study populations regarding age distribution and low participation."

https://openalex.org/W2005449981,"Loss of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions has been correlated with cancer cell invasion and poor patient survival. p120-catenin has emerged as a key player in promoting E-cadherin stability and adherens junction integrity and has been proposed as a potential invasion suppressor by preventing release of cells from the constraints imposed by cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. However, it has been proposed that tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 may contribute to cadherin-dependent junction disassembly during invasion. Here, we use small interfering RNA (siRNA) in A431 cells to show that knockdown of p120 promotes two-dimensional migration of cells. In contrast, p120 knockdown impairs epidermal growth factor-induced A431 invasion into three-dimensional matrix gels or in organotypic culture, whereas re-expression of siRNA-resistant p120, or a p120 isoform that cannot be phosphorylated on tyrosine, restores the collective mode of invasion employed by A431 cells in vitro. Thus, p120 promotes A431 cell invasion in a phosphorylation-independent manner. We show that the collective invasion of A431 cells depends on the presence of cadherin-mediated (P- and E-cadherin) cell-cell contacts, which are lost in cells where p120 expression is knocked down. Furthermore, membranous p120 is maintained in invasive squamous cell carcinomas in tumours suggesting that p120 may be important for the collective invasion of tumours cells in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2111310880,"Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomais the most common extranodal lymphoid neoplasm. Chromosomal translocation t(11;18)(q21,q21) is found in 30% of gastric MALT lymphomas and is associated with a failure to respond to standard treatment and a tendency to disseminate. This translocation generates a chimeric protein composed of N-terminal sequences of Inhibitor of Apoptosis 2 (API2, also known as BIRC3 and cIAP2) fused to C-terminal sequences of MALT1. API2-MALT1 promotes cell survival and proliferation via activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Here, we investigate the mechanism by which the API2 moiety contributes to NF-κB stimulation. We find that the API2 moiety mediates oligomerization of API2-MALT1 as well as interaction with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). Surprisingly, oligomerization does not occur via homotypic interaction; rather, the API2 moiety of one monomer interacts with the MALT1 moiety of another monomer. Further, the specific region of the API2 moiety responsible for mediating oligomerization is distinct from that mediating TRAF2 binding. Although deletion or mutation of the TRAF2 binding site does not inhibit oligomerization, it does lead to dramatically decreased NF-κB activation. Deletion of both TRAF2 binding and oligomerization regions results in near-complete loss of NF-κB activation. Thus, API2 moiety-mediated heterotypic oligomerization and TRAF2 binding both contribute to maximal API2-MALT1-dependent NF-κB stimulation."

We undertook this study in order to estimate the overall incidence of such injuries in a newly founded tertiary hospital, and to evaluate possible changes in their incidence over time.We prospectively studied the PEIs and blood splashes on the skin of employees in a newly founded (October 2000) tertiary hospital in Athens, Greece, while a vaccination program against hepatitis B virus, as well as educational activities for avoidance of injuries, were taking place. The study period ranged from October 1, 2002 to February 28, 2005. Serologic studies for hepatitis B (HBV) and C virus (HCV) as well as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were performed in all injured employees and the source patients, when known. High-titer immunoglobulin (250 IU anti-HBs intramuscularly) and HBV vaccination were given to non-vaccinated or previously vaccinated but serologically non-responders after exposure. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using Mc Nemar's and Fisher's tests. 60 needlestick, 11 sharp injuries, and two splashes leading to exposure of the skin or mucosa to blood were reported during the study period in 71 nurses and two members of the cleaning staff. The overall incidence (percutaneous injuries and splashes) per 100 full-time employment-years (100 FTEYs) for high-risk personnel (nursing, medical, and cleaning staff) was 3.48, whereas the incidence of percutaneous injuries (needlestick and sharp injuries) alone per 100 FTEYs was 3.38. A higher incidence of injuries was noted during the first than in the second half of the study period (4.67 versus 2.29 per 100 FTEYs, p = 0.005). No source patient was found positive for HCV or HIV. The use of high-titer immunoglobulin after adjustment for the incidence of injuries was higher in the first than in the second half of the study period, although the difference was not statistically significant [9/49 (18.37%) vs 1/24 (4.17%), p = 0.15].Our data show that nurses are the healthcare worker group that reports most of PEIs. Doctors did not report such injuries during the study period in our setting. However, the possibility of even relatively frequent PEIs in doctors cannot be excluded. This is due to underreporting of such events that has been previously described for physicians and surgeons. A decrease of the incidence of PEIs occurred during the operation of this newly founded hospital."

These domains recruit the STAGA (SPT3-TAF9-GCN5-acetyltransferase) coactivator complex, but not TFTC (TATA-binding protein-free TAF-containing) to the target gene promoter. Although components of this complex are well conserved between yeast and mammals, four mammalian orthologs of yeast SPT8, SPT20, SGF11 and SGF29 remain to be identified. Here, we isolated a rat ortholog of yeast SGF29, a component of yeast SAGA (SPT-ADA-GCN5-acetyltransferase) complex. Both rat (r) SGF29 and c-myc mRNAs were overexpressed in five out of the eight tested rodent tumor cells. rSGF29 directly interacted with rADA3 and co-immunoprecipitated with two other TFTC/STAGA components, rGCN5 and rSPT3. rSGF29 was recruited to the c-Myc target gene promoters together with c-Myc, and it activated c-Myc target gene expressions. Downregulation of rSGF29 suppressed the expression of c-Myc target genes and inhibited anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity and lung metastasis of rat hepatoma K2 cells when injected into nude mice. These results show that rSGF29 is a novel component of TFTC/STAGA complexes and could be involved in the c-Myc-mediated malignant transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2055227650,"Background Chromosomal aneuploidy is a defining feature of carcinomas. For instance, in colon cancer, an additional copy of Chromosome 7 is not only observed in early pre-malignant polyps, but is faithfully maintained throughout progression to metastasis. These copy number changes show a positive correlation with average transcript levels of resident genes. An independent line of research has also established that specific chromosomes occupy a well conserved 3D position within the interphase nucleus. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated whether cancer-specific aneuploid chromosomes assume a 3D-position similar to that of its endogenous homologues, which would suggest a possible correlation with transcriptional activity. Using 3D-FISH and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we show that Chromosomes 7, 18, or 19 introduced via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer into the parental diploid colon cancer cell line DLD-1 maintain their conserved position in the interphase nucleus. Conclusions Our data is therefore consistent with the model that each chromosome has an associated zip code (possibly gene density) that determines its nuclear localization. Whether the nuclear localization determines or is determined by the transcriptional activity of resident genes has yet to be ascertained."

NRL-TGFα mice acquire proliferative hyperplasias as well as cystic and solid tumors. Quantitative transcript analysis revealed a progressive decrease in estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA levels with tumorigenesis. However, ER protein was evident in all lesion types and in surrounding stromal cells using immunohistochemistry. PR protein was identified in normal epithelial cells and in very few cells of small epithelial hyperplasias, but never in stromal or tumor cells. Prophylactic ovariectomy significantly delayed tumor development and decreased incidence. Finally, while heterozygous (+/−) p53 mice did not acquire mammary lesions, p53+/− mice carrying the NRL-TGFα transgene developed ER negative/PR negative undifferentiated carcinomas. These data demonstrate that unregulated TGFα expression in the mammary gland leads to oncogenesis that is dependent on ovarian steroids early in tumorigenesis. Resulting tumors resemble a clinical phenotype of ER+/PR−, and when combined with a heterozygous p53 genotype, ER−/PR−."

Just as her team is preparing some long-awaited follow-up papers on multipotent adult progenitor (MAP) cells, stem cell researcher Catherine Verfaillie is dealing with accusations that her landmark study, published in Nature in 2002, contains “flaws” that could jeopardize its conclusions. Nature has decided to rereview the work. Verfaillie, now at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, says that although some data are puzzling, the problems do not affect her findings.

The accusations were raised last summer but became widely known only last week following an article in New Scientist . They've received a flurry of attention because of the big splash Verfaillie made when she originally reported that her team had cultivated a new type of cell that appeared to have the potential to grow into most cell types in the body ( Science , 9 February, p. [760][2]).

Last year, two New Scientist reporters noticed that the Nature paper and another the team published at the same time in the Journal of Experimental Hematology contained identical data on flow cytometry—a technique for identifying cells—even though the two papers described different cell populations. They notified Verfaillie, who in turn notified the journal editors and the University of Minnesota (UMN), Twin Cities, where she did the research.

At Verfaillie's request, UMN convened three experts to review the flow-cytometry data. They concluded last August that the duplication was an “honest error.” Verfaillie subsequently had an erratum published in the hematology journal.

However, the panel also said it had reservations about the “validity” of the flow-cytometric analysis data in the Nature paper. Flow cytometry involves the use of antibodies to recognize proteins on cell membranes. Some of the fluorescent signatures generated by antibodies showed a variability “far outside what would be expected for this kind of experiment,” said the panel. If those data are unreliable, it could mean that the MAP cells do not have all the characteristics described in the paper.

The experts said they couldn't judge whether the problem would affect the paper's conclusions about the versatility of MAP cells. One of them told Science that “problems are rampant” in flow cytometry, and it would be hard to find a paper without some flaw.

UMN then asked two unnamed stem cell experts to address the validity of the conclusions of the Nature paper. Their comments have not been made public, but the university's vice president for research, Tim Mulcahy, says that one of the experts felt the problematic data “weakened” the paper. The other said the data were “not critical” to the conclusions. Mulcahy says the university plans no further action and will let the scientific community judge the matter for itself.

Verfaillie says her team has “no explanation for why” the data turned out as they did. “I personally don't think it affects the conclusion of the paper, and I've spoken to many people who personally don't think so,” she says. But it's “up to Nature to decide.”
