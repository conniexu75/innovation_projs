https://openalex.org/W2990312754,"Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta in plaques, aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles and neuroinflammation, together resulting in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline1. The NLRP3 inflammasome assembles inside of microglia on activation, leading to increased cleavage and activity of caspase-1 and downstream interleukin-1β release2. Although the NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to be essential for the development and progression of amyloid-beta pathology in mice3, the precise effect on tau pathology remains unknown. Here we show that loss of NLRP3 inflammasome function reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation by regulating tau kinases and phosphatases. Tau activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and intracerebral injection of fibrillar amyloid-beta-containing brain homogenates induced tau pathology in an NLRP3-dependent manner. These data identify an important role of microglia and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the pathogenesis of tauopathies and support the amyloid-cascade hypothesis in Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating that neurofibrillary tangles develop downstream of amyloid-beta-induced microglial activation. The authors show that NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in microglia of patients with fronto-temporal dementia and in a mouse model of tau pathology, and that the loss of NLRP3 inflammasome function decreases tau pathology and improves cognition in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2991483425,"Caspase-8 is the initiator caspase of extrinsic apoptosis(1,2) and inhibits necroptosis mediated by RIPK3 and MLKL. Accordingly, caspase-8 deficiency in mice causes embryonic lethality(3), which can be rescued by deletion of either Ripk3 or Mlkl(4-6). Here we show that the expression of enzymatically inactive CASP8(C362S) causes embryonic lethality in mice by inducing necroptosis and pyroptosis. Similar to Casp8(-/-) mice(3,7), Casp8(C362S/C362S) mouse embryos died after endothelial cell necroptosis leading to cardiovascular defects. MLKL deficiency rescued the cardiovascular phenotype but unexpectedly caused perinatal lethality in Casp8(C362S/C362S) mice, indicating that CASP8(C362S) causes necroptosis-independent death at later stages of embryonic development. Specific loss of the catalytic activity of caspase-8 in intestinal epithelial cells induced intestinal inflammation similar to intestinal epithelial cell-specific Casp8 knockout mice(8). Inhibition of necroptosis by additional deletion of Mlkl severely aggravated intestinal inflammation and caused premature lethality in Mlkl knockout mice with specific loss of caspase-8 catalytic activity in intestinal epithelial cells. Expression of CASP8(C362S) triggered the formation of ASC specks, activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1 beta. Both embryonic lethality and premature death were completely rescued in Casp8(C362S/C362S)Mlkl(-/-)Asc(-/-) or Casp8(C362S/C362S)Mlkl(-/-)Casp1(-/-) mice, indicating that the activation of the inflammasome promotes CASP8(C362S)-mediated tissue pathology when necroptosis is blocked. Therefore, caspase-8 represents the molecular switch that controls apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis, and prevents tissue damage during embryonic development and adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2989562929,"The current need for novel antibiotics is especially acute for drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens1,2. These microorganisms have a highly restrictive permeability barrier, which limits the penetration of most compounds3,4. As a result, the last class of antibiotics that acted against Gram-negative bacteria was developed in the 1960s2. We reason that useful compounds can be found in bacteria that share similar requirements for antibiotics with humans, and focus on Photorhabdus symbionts of entomopathogenic nematode microbiomes. Here we report a new antibiotic that we name darobactin, which was obtained using a screen of Photorhabdus isolates. Darobactin is coded by a silent operon with little production under laboratory conditions, and is ribosomally synthesized. Darobactin has an unusual structure with two fused rings that form post-translationally. The compound is active against important Gram-negative pathogens both in vitro and in animal models of infection. Mutants that are resistant to darobactin map to BamA, an essential chaperone and translocator that folds outer membrane proteins. Our study suggests that bacterial symbionts of animals contain antibiotics that are particularly suitable for development into therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2991552764,"Oncogenes are commonly amplified on particles of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cancer1,2, but our understanding of the structure of ecDNA and its effect on gene regulation is limited. Here, by integrating ultrastructural imaging, long-range optical mapping and computational analysis of whole-genome sequencing, we demonstrate the structure of circular ecDNA. Pan-cancer analyses reveal that oncogenes encoded on ecDNA are among the most highly expressed genes in the transcriptome of the tumours, linking increased copy number with high transcription levels. Quantitative assessment of the chromatin state reveals that although ecDNA is packaged into chromatin with intact domain structure, it lacks higher-order compaction that is typical of chromosomes and displays significantly enhanced chromatin accessibility. Furthermore, ecDNA is shown to have a significantly greater number of ultra-long-range interactions with active chromatin, which provides insight into how the structure of circular ecDNA affects oncogene function, and connects ecDNA biology with modern cancer genomics and epigenetics."
https://openalex.org/W2980663762,"The evolutionary processes that drive universal therapeutic resistance in adult patients with diffuse glioma remain unclear1,2. Here we analysed temporally separated DNA-sequencing data and matched clinical annotation from 222 adult patients with glioma. By analysing mutations and copy numbers across the three major subtypes of diffuse glioma, we found that driver genes detected at the initial stage of disease were retained at recurrence, whereas there was little evidence of recurrence-specific gene alterations. Treatment with alkylating agents resulted in a hypermutator phenotype at different rates across the glioma subtypes, and hypermutation was not associated with differences in overall survival. Acquired aneuploidy was frequently detected in recurrent gliomas and was characterized by IDH mutation but without co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q, and further converged with acquired alterations in the cell cycle and poor outcomes. The clonal architecture of each tumour remained similar over time, but the presence of subclonal selection was associated with decreased survival. Finally, there were no differences in the levels of immunoediting between initial and recurrent gliomas. Collectively, our results suggest that the strongest selective pressures occur during early glioma development and that current therapies shape this evolution in a largely stochastic manner. The GLASS Consortium studies the evolutionary trajectories of 222 patients with a diffuse glioma to aid in our understanding of tumour progression and treatment failure"

https://openalex.org/W2990327991,"Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in circulating white blood cells is the most common form of clonal mosaicism1–5, yet our knowledge of the causes and consequences of this is limited. Here, using a computational approach, we estimate that 20% of the male population represented in the UK Biobank study (n = 205,011) has detectable LOY. We identify 156 autosomal genetic determinants of LOY, which we replicate in 757,114 men of European and Japanese ancestry. These loci highlight genes that are involved in cell-cycle regulation and cancer susceptibility, as well as somatic drivers of tumour growth and targets of cancer therapy. We demonstrate that genetic susceptibility to LOY is associated with non-haematological effects on health in both men and women, which supports the hypothesis that clonal haematopoiesis is a biomarker of genomic instability in other tissues. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies dysregulated expression of autosomal genes in leukocytes with LOY and provides insights into why clonal expansion of these cells may occur. Collectively, these data highlight the value of studying clonal mosaicism to uncover fundamental mechanisms that underlie cancer and other ageing-related diseases. A genome-wide association study of mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in UK Biobank participants identifies 156 genetic determinants of LOY, showing that LOY is associated with cancer and non-haematological health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2989865490,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are brief flashes of gamma rays, considered to be the most energetic explosive phenomena in the Universe. The emission from GRBs comprises a short (typically tens of seconds) and bright prompt emission, followed by a much longer afterglow phase. During the afterglow phase, the shocked outflow -- produced by the interaction between the ejected matter and the circumburst medium -- slows down, and a gradual decrease in brightness is observed. GRBs typically emit most of their energy via gamma-rays with energies in the kiloelectronvolt-to-megaelectronvolt range, but a few photons with energies of tens of gigaelectronvolts have been detected by space-based instruments. However, the origins of such high-energy (above one gigaelectronvolt) photons and the presence of very-high-energy (more than 100 gigaelectronvolts) emission have remained elussive. Here we report observations of very-high-energy emission in the bright GRB 180720B deep in the GRB afterglow -ten hours after the end of the prompt emission phase, when the X-ray flux had already decayed by four orders of magnitude. Two possible explanations exist for the observed radiation: inverse Compton emission and synchrotron emission of ultrarelativistic electrons. Our observations show that the energy fluxes in the X-ray and gamma-ray range and their photon indices remain comparable to each other throughout the afterglow. This discovery places distinct constraints on the GRB environment for both emission mechanisms, with the inverse Compton explanation alleviating the particle energy requirements for the emission observed at late times. The late timing of this detection has consequences for the future observations of GRBs at the highest energies."
https://openalex.org/W2991354426,"Long-duration γ-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from ultra-relativistic jets launched from the collapsing cores of dying massive stars. They are characterized by an initial phase of bright and highly variable radiation in the kiloelectronvolt-to-megaelectronvolt band, which is probably produced within the jet and lasts from milliseconds to minutes, known as the prompt emission1,2. Subsequently, the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium generates shock waves that are responsible for the afterglow emission, which lasts from days to months and occurs over a broad energy range from the radio to the gigaelectronvolt bands1–6. The afterglow emission is generally well explained as synchrotron radiation emitted by electrons accelerated by the external shock7–9. Recently, intense long-lasting emission between 0.2 and 1 teraelectronvolts was observed from GRB 190114C10,11. Here we report multi-frequency observations of GRB 190114C, and study the evolution in time of the GRB emission across 17 orders of magnitude in energy, from 5 × 10−6 to 1012 electronvolts. We find that the broadband spectral energy distribution is double-peaked, with the teraelectronvolt emission constituting a distinct spectral component with power comparable to the synchrotron component. This component is associated with the afterglow and is satisfactorily explained by inverse Compton up-scattering of synchrotron photons by high-energy electrons. We find that the conditions required to account for the observed teraelectronvolt component are typical for GRBs, supporting the possibility that inverse Compton emission is commonly produced in GRBs. A multi-frequency observing campaign of the γ-ray burst GRB 190114C reveals a broadband double-peaked spectral energy distribution, and the teraelectronvolt emission could be attributed to inverse Compton scattering."
https://openalex.org/W2990686989,"In the Drosophila brain, ‘compass’ neurons track the orientation of the body and head (the fly’s heading) during navigation 1,2. In the absence of visual cues, the compass neuron network estimates heading by integrating self-movement signals over time3,4. When a visual cue is present, the estimate of the network is more accurate1,3. Visual inputs to compass neurons are thought to originate from inhibitory neurons called R neurons (also known as ring neurons); the receptive fields of R neurons tile visual space5. The axon of each R neuron overlaps with the dendrites of every compass neuron6, raising the question of how visual cues are integrated into the compass. Here, using in vivo whole-cell recordings, we show that a visual cue can evoke synaptic inhibition in compass neurons and that R neurons mediate this inhibition. Each compass neuron is inhibited only by specific visual cue positions, indicating that many potential connections from R neurons onto compass neurons are actually weak or silent. We also show that the pattern of visually evoked inhibition can reorganize over minutes as the fly explores an altered virtual-reality environment. Using ensemble calcium imaging, we demonstrate that this reorganization causes persistent changes in the compass coordinate frame. Taken together, our data suggest a model in which correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity triggers associative long-term synaptic depression of visually evoked inhibition in compass neurons. Our findings provide evidence for the theoretical proposal that associative plasticity of sensory inputs, when combined with attractor dynamics, can reconcile self-movement information with changing external cues to generate a coherent sense of direction7–12. Visual inputs to compass neurons can reorganize over minutes as a fly explores an altered virtual-reality environment."
https://openalex.org/W2991430622,"Many animals rely on an internal heading representation when navigating in varied environments1-10. How this representation is linked to the sensory cues that define different surroundings is unclear. In the fly brain, heading is represented by 'compass' neurons that innervate a ring-shaped structure known as the ellipsoid body3,11,12. Each compass neuron receives inputs from 'ring' neurons that are selective for particular visual features13-16; this combination provides an ideal substrate for the extraction of directional information from a visual scene. Here we combine two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics in tethered flying flies with circuit modelling, and show how the correlated activity of compass and visual neurons drives plasticity17-22, which flexibly transforms two-dimensional visual cues into a stable heading representation. We also describe how this plasticity enables the fly to convert a partial heading representation, established from orienting within part of a novel setting, into a complete heading representation. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the memory-related computations that are essential for flexible navigation in varied surroundings."
https://openalex.org/W2991537080,"In preparation for bidirectional DNA replication, the origin recognition complex (ORC) loads two hexameric MCM helicases to form a head-to-head double hexamer around DNA1,2. The mechanism of MCM double-hexamer formation is debated. Single-molecule experiments have suggested a sequential mechanism, in which the ORC-dependent loading of the first hexamer drives the recruitment of the second hexamer3. By contrast, biochemical data have shown that two rings are loaded independently via the same ORC-mediated mechanism, at two inverted DNA sites4,5. Here we visualize MCM loading using time-resolved electron microscopy, and identify intermediates in the formation of the double hexamer. We confirm that both hexamers are recruited via the same interaction that occurs between ORC and the C-terminal domains of the MCM helicases. Moreover, we identify the mechanism of coupled MCM loading. The loading of the first MCM hexamer around DNA creates a distinct interaction site, which promotes the engagement of ORC at the N-terminal homodimerization interface of MCM. In this configuration, ORC is poised to direct the recruitment of the second hexamer in an inverted orientation, which is suitable for the formation of the double hexamer. Our results therefore reconcile the two apparently contrasting models derived from single-molecule experiments and biochemical data."
https://openalex.org/W2991327056,"Haem is an essential prosthetic group of numerous proteins and a central signalling molecule in many physiologic processes1,2. The chemical reactivity of haem means that a network of intracellular chaperone proteins is required to avert the cytotoxic effects of free haem, but the constituents of such trafficking pathways are unknown3,4. Haem synthesis is completed in mitochondria, with ferrochelatase adding iron to protoporphyrin IX. How this vital but highly reactive metabolite is delivered from mitochondria to haemoproteins throughout the cell remains poorly defined3,4. Here we show that progesterone receptor membrane component 2 (PGRMC2) is required for delivery of labile, or signalling haem, to the nucleus. Deletion of PGMRC2 in brown fat, which has a high demand for haem, reduced labile haem in the nucleus and increased stability of the haem-responsive transcriptional repressors Rev-Erbα and BACH1. Ensuing alterations in gene expression caused severe mitochondrial defects that rendered adipose-specific PGRMC2-null mice unable to activate adaptive thermogenesis and prone to greater metabolic deterioration when fed a high-fat diet. By contrast, obese-diabetic mice treated with a small-molecule PGRMC2 activator showed substantial improvement of diabetic features. These studies uncover a role for PGRMC2 in intracellular haem transport, reveal the influence of adipose tissue haem dynamics on physiology and suggest that modulation of PGRMC2 may revert obesity-linked defects in adipocytes. Progesterone receptor membrane component 2 is required to transport haem from the mitochondria to the nucleus, where, in adipose tissue, it has roles in regulation of thermogenesis and glucose metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2991090823,"Autophagy is typically a prosurvival cellular process that promotes the turnover of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, but it can also induce cell death. We have previously reported that the small molecule Z36 induces autophagy along with autophagic cell death in HeLa cells. In this study, we analyzed differential gene expression in Z36-treated HeLa cells and found that Z36-induced endoplasmic reticulum–specific autophagy (ER-phagy) results in ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). This result is in contrast to the common notion that autophagy is generally activated in response to ER stress and the UPR. We demonstrate that Z36 up-regulates the expression levels of FAM134B, LC3, and Atg9, which together mediate excessive ER-phagy, characterized by forming increased numbers of autophagosomes with larger sizes. We noted that the excessive ER-phagy accelerates ER degradation and impairs ER homeostasis and thereby triggers ER stress and the UPR as well as ER-phagy–dependent cell death. Interestingly, overexpression of FAM134B alone in HeLa cells is sufficient to impair ER homeostasis and cause ER stress and cell death. These findings suggest a mechanism involving FAM134B activity for ER-phagy to promote cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2990822923,"Genetic analysis of airborne plant material has historically focused (generally implicitly rather than as a stated goal) on pollen from anemophilous (wind-pollinated) species, such as in multiple studies examining the relationship of allergens to human health. Inspired by the recent influx of literature applying environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches to targeted-species and whole-ecosystem study, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment to determine whether airborne samples reliably detect genetic material from non-anemophilous species that may not be releasing large plumes of pollen. We collected airborne eDNA using Big Spring Number Eight dust traps and quantified the amount of eDNA present for a flowering wind-pollinated genus (Bouteloua) and insect-pollinated honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) that was not flowering at the time of the study. We were able to detect airborne eDNA from both species. Since honey mesquite is insect-pollinated and was not flowering during the time of this study, our results confirm that airborne eDNA consists of and can detect species through more than just pollen. Additionally, we were able to detect temporal patterns reflecting Bouteloua reproductive ecology and suggest that airborne honey mesquite eDNA responded to weather conditions during our study. These findings suggest a need for more study of the ecology of airborne eDNA to uncover its potential for single-species and whole-community research and management in terrestrial ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2990934726,"Background Teenage pregnancies and childbearing are important health concerns in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) including Malawi. Addressing these challenges requires, among other things, an understanding of the socioeconomic determinants of and contributors to the inequalities relating to these outcomes. This study investigated the trends of the inequalities and decomposed the underlying key socioeconomic factors which accounted for the inequalities in teenage pregnancy and childbearing in Malawi. Methods The study used the 2004, 2010 and 2015–16 series of nationally representative Malawi Demographic Health Survey covering 12,719 women. We used concentration curves to examine the existence of inequalities, and then quantified the extent of inequalities in teenage pregnancies and childbearing using the Erreygers concentration index. Finally, we decomposed concentration index to find out the contribution of the determinants to socioeconomic inequality in teenage pregnancy and childbearing. Results The teenage pregnancy and childbearing rate averaged 29% (p<0.01) between 2004 and 2015–16. Trends showed a “u-shape” in teenage pregnancy and childbearing rates, albeit a small one (34.1%; p<0.01) in 2004: (25.6%; p<0.01) in 2010, and (29%; p<0.01) in 2016. The calculated concentration indices -0.207 (p<0.01) in 2004, -0.133 (p<0.01) in 2010, and -0.217 (p<0.01) in 2015–16 indicated that inequality in teenage pregnancy and childbearing worsened to the disadvantage of the poor in the country. Additionally, the decomposition exercise suggested that the primary drivers to inequality in teenage pregnancy and child bearing were, early sexual debut (15.5%), being married (50%), and wealth status (13.8%). Conclusion The findings suggest that there is a need for sustained investment in the education of young women concerning the disadvantages of early sexual debut and early marriages, and in addressing the wealth inequalities in order to reduce the incidences of teenage pregnancies and childbearing."
https://openalex.org/W2991261590,"Background Healthcare professionals’ attitudes to older people, and especially those living with dementia, may contribute to unsatisfactory healthcare. Despite repeated calls to address increasing need, training an adequate geriatric workforce remains an international concern. Of particular concern are the attitudes and knowledge healthcare workers may hold about people living with dementia. Students’ knowledge of dementia has been found to be low at the beginning of their university education and has shown limited improvement throughout their coursework; greater understanding of students’ attitudes to ageing and dementia, upon entry and throughout their degrees, may help inform targeted educational interventions to improve the healthcare delivered to older people. Methods This study measured knowledge of and attitudes toward dementia and ageing in an Australian university student sample (n = 183), comparing students from medical professional versus non-medical professional related fields at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. We examined diagnostic and prognostic biases through age manipulation of a vignette describing a hypothetical patient (aged 42 or 72 years), who was experiencing symptoms that were consistent with DSM-5 criteria for both dementia and depression. Based on information provided in the vignette, student participants were asked to select a primary disorder that they would assign to the patient. Results Showed that while medical professional students held significantly more positive attitudes toward ageing than 'other' students, average attitudinal scores indicated neutrality. Medical professional students indicated a diagnostic bias toward the older vignette patient, who was more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than depression. A history of geriatric-specific training did not predict dementia knowledge; however, having prior contact with people with dementia predicted both dementia knowledge and more positive prognoses. Conclusions Overall, findings indicated medical professional students held neutral attitudes towards older people and showed deficits in knowledge of dementia. Educational interventions that introduce students to people living with dementia may improve knowledge, skills, and attitudes. All university students would benefit from education about dementia and inclusivity to reduce stereotyping and stigma."

Here, we evaluated the pathogenicity of a previously unreported sarcomeric gene variant identified in a pediatric patient with sporadic dilated cardiomyopathy, and we determined a molecular mechanism. Trio whole-exome sequencing revealed a de novo missense variant in TNNC1 that encodes a p.I4M substitution in the N-terminal helix of cardiac troponin C (cTnC). Reconstitution of this human cTnC variant into permeabilized porcine cardiac muscle preparations significantly decreases the magnitude and rate of isometric force generation at physiological Ca2+-activation levels. Computational modeling suggests that this inhibitory effect can be explained by a decrease in the rates of cross-bridge attachment and detachment. For the first time, we show that cardiac troponin T (cTnT), in part through its intrinsically disordered C terminus, directly binds to WT cTnC, and we find that this cardiomyopathic variant displays tighter binding to cTnT. Steady-state fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy studies suggest that this variant propagates perturbations in cTnC structural dynamics to distal regions of the molecule. We propose that the intrinsically disordered C terminus of cTnT directly interacts with the regulatory N-domain of cTnC to allosterically modulate Ca2+ activation of force, perhaps by controlling the troponin I switching mechanism of striated muscle contraction.

https://openalex.org/W2991556003,"The exchange of volatile species-water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and halogens-between the mantle and the surface of the Earth has been a key driver of environmental changes throughout Earth's history. Degassing of the mantle requires partial melting and is therefore linked to mantle convection, whose regime and vigour in the Earth's distant past remain poorly constrained1,2. Here we present direct geochemical constraints on the flux of volatiles from the mantle. Atmospheric xenon has a monoisotopic excess of 129Xe, produced by the decay of extinct 129I. This excess was mainly acquired during Earth's formation and early evolution3, but mantle degassing has also contributed 129Xe to the atmosphere through geological time. Atmospheric xenon trapped in samples from the Archaean eon shows a slight depletion of 129Xe relative to the modern composition4,5, which tends to disappear in more recent samples5,6. To reconcile this deficit in the Archaean atmosphere by mantle degassing would require the degassing rate of Earth at the end of the Archaean to be at least one order of magnitude higher than today. We demonstrate that such an intense activity could not have occurred within a plate tectonics regime. The most likely scenario is a relatively short (about 300 million years) burst of mantle activity at the end of the Archaean (around 2.5 billion years ago). This lends credence to models advocating a magmatic origin for drastic environmental changes during the Neoarchaean era, such as the Great Oxidation Event."

Low doses of interleukin-15 (IL-15) that mimic exercise responses in the circulation improve skin structure and increase mitochondria in uninjured aged skin, suggesting that IL-15 is an essential mitochondrial signal for healing that is lost during aging. Here we used gene microarray analysis of old and young murine epidermal stem cells and demonstrate that aging results in a gene signature characteristic of bioenergetic dysfunction. Intravenous IL-15 treatment rescued chronological aging-induced healing defects and restored youthful wound closure in old, sedentary mice. Additionally, exercise-mediated improvements in the healing of aged skin depend upon circulating IL-15. We show that IL-15 induces signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling characteristic of young animals, reduces markers of growth arrest, and increases keratinocyte and fibroblast growth. Moreover, exercise or exercise-mimicking IL-15 treatment rescued the age-associated decrease in epidermal mitochondrial complex IV activity. Overall, these results indicate that IL-15 or its analogs represent promising therapies for treating impaired wound healing in elderly patients. Impaired wound healing in elderly individuals increases infection risk and prolongs surgical recovery, but current treatment options are limited. Low doses of interleukin-15 (IL-15) that mimic exercise responses in the circulation improve skin structure and increase mitochondria in uninjured aged skin, suggesting that IL-15 is an essential mitochondrial signal for healing that is lost during aging. Here we used gene microarray analysis of old and young murine epidermal stem cells and demonstrate that aging results in a gene signature characteristic of bioenergetic dysfunction. Intravenous IL-15 treatment rescued chronological aging-induced healing defects and restored youthful wound closure in old, sedentary mice. Additionally, exercise-mediated improvements in the healing of aged skin depend upon circulating IL-15. We show that IL-15 induces signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling characteristic of young animals, reduces markers of growth arrest, and increases keratinocyte and fibroblast growth.

Thrombocytopenia was defined as the platelet count<100,000/mm3 at enrollment. Severe thrombocytopenia was defined as the platelet count<50,000/mm3. The prevalence of SLE-related TP, the associations of thrombocytopenia with demographic data, organ involvements, laboratory findings, disease activity, damage, and mortality were investigated.Of 2104 patients with SLE, 342 patients (16.3%) were diagnosed with thrombocytopenia. The prevalence of neuropsychiatric SLE, vasculitis, myositis, nephritis, mucocutaneous lesions, pleuritis, fever, leukocytopenia and hypocomplementemia were significantly higher in patients with thrombocytopenia (p<0.05). SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) was significantly higher in patients with thrombocytopenia (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that leukocytopenia (OR = 2.644), lupus nephritis (OR = 1.539), hypocomplementemia (OR = 1.497) and elevated SLEDAI (OR = 1.318) were independently associated with thrombocytopenia (p<0.05). Long disease duration (OR = 1.006) was an independent risk factor of severe thrombocytopenia, while anti-rRNP (OR = 0.208) was an independent protective factor of severe thrombocytopenia (p<0.05). Long disease duration was an independent risk factor of mortality in patients with thrombocytopenia (RR = 1.006). The 6-year survival of patients with thrombocytopenia was significantly lower than patients without thrombocytopenia (88.2% vs. 95.5%).Thrombocytopenia was a common manifestation of SLE and was associated with leukocytopenia, nephritis and severe disease activity. Severe thrombocytopenia tended to occur in long-term and relatively inactive SLE. Patients with SLE-related thrombocytopenia has a decreased long-term survival rate. Long disease duration was an independent risk factor of mortality in patients with thrombocytopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2991069913,"Food waste diversion and composting, either mandated or voluntary, are growing alternatives to traditional waste disposal. An acceptable source of agricultural feed and composting material, methane-emitting food residuals, including post-consumer food scraps, are diverted from landfills allowing recapture of nutrients that would otherwise be lost. However, risk associated with the transfer of antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB), antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), or pathogens from food waste is not well characterized. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, ARGs, microbial content, and associated virulence factors were successfully identified across samples from an integrated poultry farm that feeds post-consumer food waste. A total of 495 distinct bacterial species or sub-species, 50 ARGs, and 54 virulence gene sequences were found. ARG sequences related to aminoglycoside, tetracycline, and macrolide resistance were most prominent, while most virulence gene sequences were related to transposon or integron activity. Microbiome content was distinct between on-farm samples and off-farm food waste collection sites, with a reduction in pathogens throughout the composting process. While most samples contained some level of resistance, only 3 resistance gene sequences occurred in both on- and off-farm samples and no multidrug resistance (MDR) gene sequences persisted once on the farm. The risk of incorporating novel or multi-drug resistance from human sources appears to be minimal and the practice of utilizing post-consumer food scraps as feed for poultry and composting material may not present a significant risk for human or animal health. Pearson correlation and co-inertia analysis identified a significant interaction between resistance and virulence genes (P = 0.05, RV = 0.67), indicating that ability to undergo gene transfer may be a better marker for ARG risk than presence of specific bacterial species. This work expands the knowledge of ARG fate during food scrap animal feeding and composting and provides a methodology for reproducible analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2989586171,"Environmental and endogenous electrophiles cause tissue damage through their high reactivity with endogenous nucleophiles such as DNA, proteins, and lipids. Protection against damage is mediated by glutathione (GSH) conjugation, which can occur spontaneously or be facilitated by the glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes. To determine the role of GST enzymes in protection against electrophiles as well as the role of specific GST families in mediating this protection, we exposed mutant mouse lines lacking the GSTP, GSTM, and/or GSTT enzyme families to the model electrophile acrylamide, a ubiquitous dietary contaminant known to cause adverse effects in humans. An analysis of urinary metabolites after acute acrylamide exposure identified the GSTM family as the primary mediator of GSH conjugation to acrylamide. However, surprisingly, mice lacking only this enzyme family did not show increased toxicity after an acute acrylamide exposure. Therefore, GSH conjugation is not the sole mechanism by which GSTs protect against the toxicity of this substrate. Given the prevalence of null GST polymorphisms in the human population (approximately 50% for GSTM1 and 20–50% for GSTT1), a substantial portion of the population may also have impaired acrylamide metabolism. However, our study also defines a role for GSTP and/or GSTT in protection against acrylamide mediated toxicity. Thus, while the canonical detoxification function of GSTs may be impaired in GSTM null individuals, disease risk secondary to acrylamide exposure may be mitigated through non-canonical pathways involving members of the GSTP and/or GSTT families."

Although Cas1-2/I-E does not prune the prespacers, its binding protects the prespacer boundaries from exonuclease action. This ensures the pruning of exposed ends by exonucleases to aptly sized substrates for integration into the CRISPR locus.

To this end, we appended various ERAD substrates with specific domains whose conformations were tunable in flexibility or tightness by binding to appropriate ligands. With this technique, we could define the capacity of specific retrotranslocons in disentangling very tight, less tight but well-folded, and unstructured conformations. The Hrd1 complex, the retrotranslocon on the ERAD-L branch, permitted the passage of substrates with a proteinase K–resistant tight conformation, whereas the E3 ligase gp78-mediated ERAD-M allowed passage only of nearly completely disordered but not well-folded substrates and thus may have the least unfoldase activity.

We anticipate that our biochemical system paves the way for identifying the factors necessary for the retrotranslocation of membrane proteins. Nearly one-third of human proteins are secretory and membrane proteins that are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumERADendoplasmic reticulum–associated degradationDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseDDdestabilizing domainTMXtrimetrexateMTXmethotrexateHCMHC-I heavy chainUPSubiquitin–proteasome systemNHKnull Hong Kong α1-antitrypsinCHXcycloheximideHRPhorseradish peroxidaseIPimmunoprecipitationHAhemagglutinin. When misfolded or failed to be assembled into a complex, these proteins are retained within the ER and ultimately eliminated by a process termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD). ERAD is typically categorized into ERAD-L, ERAD-M, and ERAD-C branches for their preference of substrates with lesions from ER luminal, transmembrane, and cytosolic domains, respectively (1Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Distinct ubiquitin-ligase complexes define convergent pathways for the degradation of ER proteins.Cell. 2006; 126 (16873066): 361-37310.1016/j.cell.2006.05.043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 2Mehrtash A.B.

These branches are known to use different sets of factors to promote substrate destruction (3Christianson J.C. Ye Y. Cleaning up in the endoplasmic reticulum: ubiquitin in charge.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Because the degradation machinery is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, all ERAD substrates must traverse the ER membrane to be relocated to the cytosol for their destruction. Therefore, a proteinaceous channel termed retrotranslocon should reside in the ER membrane to mediate retrotranslocation of soluble and membrane protein substrates into the cytosol (6Wu X. Rapoport T.A. Mechanistic insights into ER-associated protein degradation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2018; 53 (29719269): 22-2810.1016/j.ceb.2018.04.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Many candidates were proposed to be the channels, including the transmembrane E3 ligase Hrd1. Recent studies have shown that misfolded CPY* can be retrotranslocated in a reconstituted liposome containing yeast Hrd1p (7Stein A. Ruggiano A. Carvalho P. Rapoport T.A.

Cryo-EM structure revealed that the Hrd1p dimer shows a central cavity, likely the conduit for passing polypeptide (9Schoebel S. Mi W. Stein A. Ovchinnikov S. Pavlovicz R. DiMaio F. Baker D.

However, it is unclear whether Hrd1 is able to retrotranslocate the misfolded protein bearing a folded domain because these studies were performed using misfolded proteins. In mammalian cells, ubiquitin ligases Hrd1 and gp78 both show sequence homology to yeast Hrd1p within the transmembrane region. Hrd1 is strictly required for ERAD-L, whereas gp78 is mainly responsible for ERAD-M, especially for polytopic membrane proteins (10Bernasconi R. Galli C. Calanca V. Nakajima T. Molinari M. Stringent requirement for HRD1, SEL1L, and OS-9/XTP3-B for disposal of ERAD-LS substrates.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188 (20100910): 223-23510.1083/jcb.200910042Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). TRC8, a transmembrane E3 ligase required for cytomegalovirus-encoded protein US2-mediated degradation of MHC-I heavy chain (HC), also shows similar conserved characteristics to yeast Hrd1p (11Stagg H.R.

There are suggestions that some other (up to ∼20) ER-resident ubiquitin ligases in mammals could serve as retrotranslocons for polypeptide movement through the membrane of respective subset of ERAD substrates on ERAD-L, -M, and -C branches of pathway (9Schoebel S.

Because folding is an error-prone process, most, if not all, newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins have the potential to become substrates of ERAD. Therefore, ERAD must recognize and ultimately degrade a highly diverse range of substrates: not only accept individual proteins with different sizes but also handle potential diverse conformations when a protein is misfolded. Adding to the complexity is the fact that many substrates are modified with oligosaccharides in the ER lumen. It is largely unclear how limited number of potential retrotranslocons can handle substrates with potentially unlimited conformations. Specifically, the requirements on the size or conformation flexibility of substrates for threading through the pores of retrotranslocons in ERAD-L, -M, and -C pathways are largely unknown. A well-characterized strategy to study protein translocation takes advantage of a conformation-tunable cytosolic enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). When bound to folate analogs such as methotrexate (MTX) or the membrane-permeable derivative trimetrexate (TMX) (13Sasso S.P. Gilli R.M. Sari J.C. Rimet O.S. Briand C.M. Thermodynamic study of dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor selectivity.Biochim. Biophys.

Therefore, ligand-stabilized DHFR can be employed as a testing substrate to evaluate the pore size or the unfolding activity of translocation machineries. Studies using DHFR fusion proteins showed that preunfolded conformation is necessary for protein import into the ER, mitochondria, and lysosome (14Salvador N. Aguado C. Horst M. Knecht E.

However, the tightly folded DHFR–MTX complex can be imported across protein translocons present in the outer and inner chloroplast envelope membranes because of the large functional pore size with a diameter of 25.6 Å (17Ganesan I.

The destabilizing domains (DDs) derived from FKBP12 is another example whose conformation can be tuned by ligand binding (19Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G. Wandless T.J.

Binding to its ligand Shield-1 stabilizes the structure of several FKBP12 mutants (i.e. the DDs), which would otherwise show highly flexible conformation (20Egeler E.L. Urner L.M. Rakhit R. Liu C.W. Wandless T.J. Ligand-switchable substrates for a ubiquitin-proteasome system.J. Biol.

Although these nearly unstructured FKBP12 mutants can serve as a degron for the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) when present in the cytoplasm, they are very stable when confined within ER lumen (21Sellmyer M.A. Chen L.C. Egeler E.L. Rakhit R. Wandless T.J.

Thus, similar to DHFR/ligands, DD/Shield-1 pair could be used to study the conformation requirements for the entry into the pores of retrotranslocation machineries. To get a comprehensive understanding as to how defective ER proteins with distinct conformations and topologies, such as soluble protein and single-spanning and multispanning membrane proteins, are retrotranslocated during ERAD, we harnessed both DHFR/TMX and DD/Shield-1 pairs to investigate the substrate unfolding requirements for threading through the retrotranslocons on ERAD-L, ERAD-M, and HIV-encoded protein Vpu-mediated ERAD pathways (22Morito D. Nagata K. Pathogenic hijacking of ER-associated degradation: is ERAD flexible?.Mol.

This technique allows us to define the capacity of specific retrotranslocons in disentangling very tight, less tight but well-folded, and unstructured conformations. Our results demonstrated that three retrotranslocon complexes showed distinct protein unfolding requirements for moving substrates across respective pores. Thus, different strategies may be used to accommodate or unfold substrates for entry into respective channels. DHFR, when fused in-frame to the MHC-I heavy chain (DHFR-HC), can fold properly in the lumen of the ER and bind TMX, a membrane-permeable folate analog (23Tirosh B. Furman M.H. Tortorella D.

We adopted a similar strategy to append DHFR to the ER luminal region of a serial of ERAD substrates that are degraded through ERAD-L or Vpu-hijacked ERAD pathways (Fig. 1A). These included null Hong Kong α1-antitrypsin (NHK) and a truncated version of CD4 (mini-CD4, mCD4), which is degraded from the ER by Vpu-hijacked ERAD (24Preston G.M. Brodsky J.L.

Treating total cell lysates with proteinase K results in the generation of a ∼21–25-kDa DHFR fragment, indicating that the DHFR portions of these substrates bind the TMX and show tightly folded conformation (Fig. 1, C–E). No postlysis binding of TMX to DHFR was observed in control experiments (Fig. 1, B–E, sample 5). This result is consistent with a previous report (23Tirosh B. Furman M.H. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L.

Quantification of these results indicates that at least 90% of DHFR-fused substrates were bound with TMX in cultured cells (Fig. 1F). Thus, TMX binding to DHFR significantly improved substrate solubility in buffers containing mild detergents (Fig. 1G). We made HEK293T cells stably expressing DHFR-GFPu and asked whether DHFR-GFPu could be degraded by UPS in the presence of folate analogs. Significant accumulation of DHFR-GFPu in cultured cells was observed when the cells were treated with proteasome or p97 inhibitors (MG132 and CB5083) (27Anderson D.J. Le Moigne R. Djakovic S.

In addition, the translational arrest by cycloheximide resulted in degradation of DHFR-GFPu that could be impeded by the treatment of either MG132 or CB5083 but not folate analogs (Fig. 2B). These results revealed that DHFR bound with folate analogs, although resistant to proteinase K, could be degraded by protease activities of 20S proteasome and suggested that the AAA–ATPase activity in the 19S proteasome might disentangle the tightly folded conformation of DHFR charged with folate analogs (29Blythe E.E.

It has been reported that in the presence of MTX, CL1 degron-appended DHFR (DHFRu) is not able to be degraded by purified proteasome or in crude rabbit reticulocyte lysate (30Johnston J.A.

Uchiki T. Goldberg A.L. ATP-dependent steps in the binding of ubiquitin conjugates to the 26S proteasome that commit to degradation.Mol.

Here, the additional GFP moiety besides DHFR could provide sufficient flexible regions for the recognition of DHFR portion by the 19S proteasome. Thus, we concluded that once retrotranslocated from the ER, DHFR-linked ERAD substrates can be degraded even in the presence of folate analogs, unless the proteasome activity is blocked. To test whether TMX-occupied DHFR could traverse the ER membrane through ERAD-L pathway, we compare the turnover rate of DHFR-NHK in the absence or the presence of TMX. DHFR-NHK were rapidly degraded after blocking ribosomal translation by CHX (Fig. 2, C and D). However, TMX did not slow down degradation speed of substrates from the ER. In contrast, MG132 and CB5083 significantly extended the half-lives of substrates, suggesting that the degradation of these ERAD-L substrates depends on both p97 ATPase and proteasome. Notably, TMX somehow enhanced turnover rate of glycosylated DHFR-NHK, whereas cotreatment with MG132 and CHX led to the accumulation of a deglycosylated DHFR-NHK, which represents substrates retrotranslocated because of the removal of glycan by cytosolic N-glycanase (33Hirsch C. Blom D. Ploegh H.L. A role for N-glycanase in the cytosolic turnover of glycoproteins.EMBO J. 2003; 22 (12606569): 1036-104610.1093/emboj/cdg107Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrated that TMX-charged DHFR is able to be retrotranslocated across ER membrane via the ERAD-L pathway and ultimately degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol. We then asked whether retrotranslocated DHFR in cytoplasm maintained in the native-like conformation. We used a deubiquitinase from the Ebola virus (EBV-DUB), which could inhibit proteasomal degradation while permitting efficient retrotranslocation when expressed in cultured cells (34Ernst R. Claessen J.H. Mueller B. Sanyal S. Spooner E. van der Veen A.G. Kirak O. Schlieker C.D. Weihofen W.A. Ploegh H.L. Enzymatic blockade of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.PLoS Biol. 2011; 8 (21468303)e1000605 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000605Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The expression of EBV-DUB led to stabilization of the retrotranslocated DHFR-NHK in the cytoplasm, as shown by the appearance of the deglycosylated band (Fig. 2E, lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9). Proteinase K digestion for DHFR-NHK and DHFR-GFPu showed that MTX only bound with DHFR localized within the cytosol but not that of ER lumen (Fig. 2E; compare the proteinase K–resistant DHFR in lanes 2 and 4). However, the proteinase K–resistant DHFR band became evident concomitant with the appearance of retrotanslocated and deglycosylated DHFR-NHK (Fig. 2E, lanes 5 and 6). This result indicates that the retrotranslocated DHFR when in binding with MTX may still maintain the native-like conformation. Our results on the retrotranslocation of DHFR-NHK are consistent with that of DHFR-HC in the presence of US2, a cytomegalovirus-encoded adaptor protein for mediating MHC-I heavy chain ubiquitination and retrotranslocation (23Tirosh B. Furman M.H. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. Protein unfolding is not a prerequisite for endoplasmic reticulum-to-cytosol dislocation.J. Biol.

The degradation of DHFR-NHK strictly depends on the Hrd1 E3 ligase activity (Fig. S1, A and B) (35Christianson J.C. Shaler T.A. Tyler R.E. Kopito R.R. OS-9 and GRP94 deliver mutant α1-antitrypsin to the Hrd1-SEL1L ubiquitin ligase complex for ERAD.Nat.

Because the misfolded NHK functions as a degradation signal, the retrotranslocation should be initiated on at least partially unfolded structure of NHK moiety. The capability of TMX-charged DHFR to transverse the membrane suggests that once the Hrd1 retrotranslocon is opened for initiating the passage of the leading NHK moiety, the trailing 21-kDa TMX-bound DHFR is able to enter the channel and finally cross the membrane. However, according to the cryo-EM structure, yeast Hrd1p shows a narrow central channel that is closed at the luminal side (9Schoebel S. Mi W. Stein A. Ovchinnikov S. Pavlovicz R. DiMaio F. Baker D. Chambers M.G. Su H. Li D. Rapoport T.A. Liao M.

It is possible that the opened Hrd1 channel and/or Hrd1-associated factors such as Derlins could be dynamic to accommodate 21-kDa DHFR for successful retrotranslocation of ERAD-L substrates. After retrotranslocation, p97 might unfold and extract DHFR from the rigid DHFR-TMX complex, thread the flexible DHFR peptide through the p97's central pore, and release it into the cytosol (36Cooney I.

The DHFR polypeptide could be partially renatured to restore its native-like conformation before the degradation by proteasome. To investigate how ER luminal domain would affect retrotranslocation of an ERAD-C substrate, we utilized the Vpu-mediated ERAD system (22Morito D. Nagata K.

When inserted into the ER membrane of host cells, Vpu is phosphorylated and associates with E3 ligase SCFβTrCP to form a tightly bound complex anchored on ER membrane (Fig. S2A). The Vpu–ligase complex mediates degradation of many newly synthesized membrane proteins, including BST-2, PSGL-1, and CD4, by an ERAD-like pathway (Fig. S2B) (38Willey R.L. Maldarelli F.

https://openalex.org/W2991024117,"Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in America, and there are no curative options for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Docetaxel (DTX) has been used as a standard chemotherapy for the mCRPC. However, resistance to DTX is a significant clinical problem as half of patients fail to respond to therapy. The TR4 nuclear receptor has been reported to play an important role in PCa progression, however, its linkage to the DTX resistance remains unclear. Here we found that TR4 was upregulated after DTX chemotherapy in the mCRPC cells and patients, and TR4 expression is correlated with DTX sensitivity with a higher level conferring chemo-resistance. Targeting TR4 with an antagonist bexarotene (Bex, a derivative of retinoid) suppressed the TR4 transactivation with increased DTX chemo-sensitivity. Mechanism dissection studies revealed that TR4 might alter the DTX chemo-sensitivity via modulating the TR4/lincRNA-p21/HIF-1α/VEGF-A signaling. Together, these results suggest that targeting this newly identified TR4/lincRNA-p21/HIF-1α/VEGF-A signaling with Bex, an FDA-approved drug, may increase the DTX chemo-sensitivity to better suppress the mCRPC progression."

Logistic regressions were used to explore the association between social media use and socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants. Of the 265 study participants, 139 (52.5%) used social media in the last week. Fifty-six (21.1%) of the study participants used more than one social media site in the last week. Facebook was the most popular social media site.

Amongst negative symptoms, the CAINS motivation-pleasure (MAP) social factor scores were found to be significantly associated with social media use. Our study results suggested that the assessment of social interactions via social media should be considered in the clinical assessment of individuals with schizophrenia. Secondly, our results suggested that the development of treatment programs supported by social media platforms may be useful for certain groups of individuals with schizophrenia. Younger patients with above secondary level education, higher family income and lower symptom severity are likely to be avid users of social media and would be suitable candidates to receive illness related information or clinical interventions via social media."

Pooled faecal samples are routinely tested by culture to detect Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Mptb) infection. More recently, a direct high throughput molecular test has been introduced in Australia for the detection of Mptb in faeces to circumvent the long culture times, however, the optimal pool size for beef cattle faeces is not known. This study aimed to determine the optimal pool size to achieve the highest test sensitivity and specificity for beef cattle. Individual archived faecal samples with low, medium and high quantities of Mptb (n = 30) were pooled with faecal samples from confirmed JD negative animals to create pool sizes of 5, 10, 15 and 20, to assess the diagnostic sensitivity relative to individual faecal qPCR. Samples from JD-free cattle (n = 10) were similarly evaluated for diagnostic specificity. Overall, 160 pools were created, with Mptb DNA extracted using magnetic bead isolation method prior to Mptb-specific IS900 quantitative PCR (qPCR). The pool size of 10 yielded the highest sensitivity 73% (95% CI: 54–88%), regardless of the quantity of Mptb DNA present in the faeces. There was no significant differences between the four different pool sizes for positive pool detection, however, there was statistical significance between low, medium and high quantities of Mptb. Diagnostic specificity was determined to be 100%. The increase in pool size greater than 10 increased the chances of PCR inhibition, which was successfully relieved with the process of DNA dilution. The results of this study demonstrate that the pool size of 10 performed optimally in the direct faecal qPCR. The results from this study can be applied in future simulation modelling studies to provide suggestions on the cost-effective testing for JD in beef cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2990456446,"Understanding the entirety of basin-scale C cycling (DOC fluxes and CO2 exchanges) are central to a holistic perspective of boreal forest biogeochemistry today. Shifts in the timing and magnitude of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) delivery in streams and eventually into oceans can be expected, while simultaneously CO2 emission may exceed CO2 fixation, leading to forests becoming stronger CO2 sources than sinks amplifying rising trace gases in the atmosphere. At May Creek, a representative late-successional boreal forest watershed at the headwaters of the Copper River Basin, Alaska, we quantified the seasonality of DOC flux and landscape-scale CO2 exchange (eddy covariance) over two seasonal cycles. We deployed in situ fDOM and conductivity sensors, performed campaign sampling for water quality (DOC and water isotopes), and used fluorescence spectroscopy to ascertain DOC character. Simultaneously, we quantified net CO2 exchange using a 100 ft eddy covariance tower. Results indicate DOC exports were pulse-driven and mediated by precipitation events. Both frequency and magnitude of pulse-driven DOC events diminished as the seasonal thaw depth deepened, with inputs from terrestrial sources becoming major contributors to the DOC pool with decreasing snowmelt contribution to the hydrograph. A three-component parallel factorial analysis (PARAFAC) model indicated DOC liberated in late-season may be bioavailable (tyrosine-like). Combining Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) measurements indicate that the May Creek watershed fixes 142–220 g C m-2 yr-1 and only 0.40–0.57 g C m-2 yr-1 is leached out as DOC. Thus, the May Creek watershed and similar mature spruce forest dominated watersheds in the Copper River Basin are currently large ecosystem C sinks and exceeding C conservative. An understanding of DOC fluxes from Gulf of Alaska watersheds is important for characterizing future climate change-induced seasonal shifts."

https://openalex.org/W2990910846,"The multicomponent phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent sugar-transporting phosphotransferase system (PTS) in Escherichia coli takes up sugar substrates from the medium and concomitantly phosphorylates them, releasing sugar phosphates into the cytoplasm. We have recently provided evidence that many of the integral membrane PTS permeases interact with the fructose PTS (FruA/FruB) [1]. However, the biochemical and physiological significance of this finding was not known. We have carried out molecular genetic/biochemical/physiological studies that show that interactions of the fructose PTS often enhance, but sometimes inhibit the activities of other PTS transporters many fold, depending on the target PTS system under study. Thus, the glucose (Glc), mannose (Man), mannitol (Mtl) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) permeases exhibit enhanced in vivo sugar transport and sometimes in vitro PEP-dependent sugar phosphorylation activities while the galactitol (Gat) and trehalose (Tre) systems show inhibited activities. This is observed when the fructose system is induced to high levels and prevented when the fruA/fruB genes are deleted. Overexpression of the fruA and/or fruB genes in the absence of fructose induction during growth also enhances the rates of uptake of other hexoses. The β-galactosidase activities of man, mtl, and gat-lacZ transcriptional fusions and the sugar-specific transphosphorylation activities of these enzyme transporters were not affected either by frustose induction or by fruAB overexpression, showing that the rates of synthesis of the target PTS permeases were not altered. We thus suggest that specific protein-protein interactions within the cytoplasmic membrane regulate transport in vivo (and sometimes the PEP-dependent phosphorylation activities in vitro) of PTS permeases in a physiologically meaningful way that may help to provide a hierarchy of preferred PTS sugars. These observations appear to be applicable in principle to other types of transport systems as well."
https://openalex.org/W2991247623,"Endothelial cell migration plays a crucial role in achieving corneal clearance after corneal transplantation when using smaller-sized endothelial grafts to increase the donor pool. In this study we investigated how different strategies of Quarter-Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (Quarter-DMEK) limbal graft edge modification influence peripheral endothelial cell migration in an in vitro culture environment. For this study, 15 Quarter-DMEK grafts, prepared from 7 corneas deemed ineligible for transplantation but with intact and viable endothelial cells, were embedded in a cooled biocompatible, thermoresponsive matrix for culture. The limbal edge of ten Quarter-DMEK grafts were modified, either by using a small diameter punch or by peripheral radial cuts. All Quarter-DMEK grafts showed substantial collective endothelial cell migration from the radial cut graft edges, as observed by light microscopy at standardized time intervals. Grafts were retrieved from the polymer matrix after the two-week culture for immunohistochemistry analyses of the newly formed cell monolayers; this demonstrated the presence of tightly packed and viable cells that showed higher migratory ability at the leading edge. Peripheral endothelial cell migration, however, was not triggered by increasing cell exposure to free space through surgical modifications of the far periphery. Our data suggest that alterations in the far peripheral area of Quarter-DMEK grafts were insufficient to triggering cell migration from the limbal graft edge. This may be due to transient-amplifying cells that reside in the far periphery and which lack cytokinetic directional cues. Understanding the migration capacity of the peripheral endothelium could unlock cells’ therapeutic potential which are, at present, routinely discarded from transplantation. Encouraging peripheral cell migration may also improve clinical outcomes from Quarter-DMEK, but a more effective solution is required prior to clinical implementation of modified grafts."

In Caenorhabditis elegans the heterotrimeric kinesin-2 transports the intraflagellar transport particles into the cilium and toward the proximal region, but then there is a handoff to OSM-3, the KIF17 homolog, and OSM-3 transports these intraflagellar transport particles to the distal tip (24Snow J.J.

These results suggest that both kinesin-2 motors are required for cilia assembly and maintenance. However, Engelke et al. (26Engelke M.F. Waas B. Kearns S.E. Suber A. Boss A. Allen B.L. Verhey K.J.

This study concluded that KIF3AB–KAP is the only kinesin-2 required for ciliogenesis in mammals, thereby revealing that the utilization of kinesin-2 motors for intraflagellar transport and ciliogenesis may differ across species. Moreover, the inability of KIF3AC to drive intraflagella transport and ciliogenesis suggests that there are other role(s) for KIF3AC in mammals rather than being redundant for KIF3AB–KAP–promoted intraflagellar transport and ciliogenesis. Early studies indicated that KIF3C expression was enriched in the central nervous system and also suggested that not all KIF3C was associated with KIF3A (11Sardella M. Navone F. Rocchi M.

The results presented reveal that KIF3AC and KIF3AA were both capable of switching from one microtubule to another at a microtubule intersection. In contrast, KIF3CC detached at microtubule intersections rather than switch microtubules. The results support the interpretation that it is the mechanochemical properties of KIF3A that contribute largely to the ability of KIF3AC to switch microtubule tracks to navigate intersections and that the behavior of KIF3CC at microtubule intersections is more consistent with a role in microtubule plus end targeting and microtubule dynamics than a role as a cargo transporter.

Fig. 1B illustrates the three potential fates of the motor upon encountering a microtubule intersection. A motor can continue on the same microtubule track through the intersection (Fig. 1B, path 1), detach from the microtubule at the intersection (Fig. 1B, path 2), or turn onto the second intersecting microtubule (Fig. 1B, path 3). Pausing at the intersection point was also observed and scored. As shown in Fig. 1C, dual-color composite kymographs provided a visual representation of motor runs on each microtubule as separate colors. Individual kymographs for each constituent microtubule were constructed: for one microtubule, motor runs were represented in red on the kymograph, and for the second microtubule of the intersection motor runs were represented in green. The red and green kymographs for the constituent microtubules were overlaid at the points along their x axes corresponding to the point at which the two microtubules intersected. This process generated a composite kymograph in which a red run color represents Qdot motion along one of the microtubules, whereas a green run color represents Qdot motion on the second microtubule. These composite kymographs were constructed for each intersection, as described under “Experimental procedures”, to confirm Qdot behaviors observed in the experimental videos (Movies S1–S5). Qdot behavior at a given intersection was observed in the video and compared with the corresponding composite kymograph to confirm which of the three possible outcomes occurred in the motor's run. Fig. 1C provides examples of the three potential fates of a motor at the intersection. Qdots that continued on the same microtubule through the intersection showed the same color run on the kymograph before and after the intersection (Fig. 1C, panel 1). Qdots that detached at the intersection ended their runs at the intersection point on the kymograph x axis (Fig. 1C, panel 2). Qdots that switched microtubule tracks exhibited a change in run color after encountering the intersection (Fig. 1C, panel 3). The change in run color from red before the intersection point to green thereafter represents a track switch or a turn onto the intersecting microtubule. For all three outcomes, a motor that pauses at the microtubule intersection exhibits a yellow vertical lin"

During July 20-August 6 2012, we used a Teledyne Webb Research Slocum G2 glider equipped with a hydrophone logging system to record ocean sound along a 458 km north to south traverse of the outer continental shelf break along the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast. Glider derived recordings yielded a unique perspective on the variation of ambient sound with depth, where natural wind generated surface processes were identified as a dominant acoustic contributor to spectral levels in the region. Near and far-field vessel radiated noise were also found to add significant energy to ambient conditions. Spatially distributed measurements of ambient sound levels recorded from the glider were consistent with long-term spectral estimates from fixed station, deep ocean hydrophone array measurements during the 1990-2000's in the region. Ocean sound level measurements captured by a mobile glider are shown to be an effective and valuable asset for describing ocean surface wind conditions and characterizing spatial and temporal changes in the underwater acoustic environment over a broad regional scale."
https://openalex.org/W2989833780,"In shared decision making, the exploration of preferred personal health outcomes is important. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) provide input for discussions between patients and healthcare professionals. The Older Persons and Informal Caregivers Survey Minimum DataSet (TOPICS-MDS) PROM is a multidimensional questionnaire on the physical and mental health and wellbeing of older adults. This study investigates how the TOPICS-MDS could be used in individual healthcare conversations. We explored views of older adults regarding 1) whether the health domains they want to discuss are included in the TOPICS-MDS and 2) the comprehensibility of the TOPICS-MDS for healthcare conversations with older adults. A three-round Delphi study was conducted. A total of 57 older adults participated in the study, the mean (SD) age was 71.5 (8.5) years, and 78.9% of the participants were female. The participants were divided into four panels based on educational level and cultural background. We used online questionnaires and focus groups. Consensus was pre-defined to be the point when ≥75% of the participants agreed that a domain was important or very important (scored on a 5-point Likert scale). The inter-expert agreement was computed for Round 1 and 3 with Kendall’s W. Round 2 was a focus-group. Qualitative data were analyzed by content analysis. Older adults considered 'functional limitations', 'emotional wellbeing', 'social functioning' and 'quality of life' to be important domains of the TOPICS-MDS to discuss in healthcare conversations. The participants added 'coping with stress', 'dealing with health conditions and the effects on life' as extra domains for healthcare conversations. Challenges regarding the comprehensibility of the TOPICS-MDS included difficult words and lengthy or sensitive questions. Questions that included multiple topics were difficult to understand. The TOPICS-MDS covers the domains of life that older adults value as important to discuss with healthcare professionals, and two additional domains were identified. For older adults with a low level of education or a culturally diverse background, the TOPICS-MDS needs to be adjusted for comprehensibility."
https://openalex.org/W2990200600,"Hairlessness is usually a rare trait in pigs; however, in this study, we found hairless (HR) pigs at a relatively high frequency in 1 pig herd. We observed that, the lower hair shaft density of HR pigs could be mainly attributed to the lower hair follicle density, and during the embryonic period, d 39‐45 were a critical stage for the formation of the hair follicle. In this regard, d 41 during gestation was a particularly important point. Hair follicle morphogenesis occurring at an early stage of embryo development is similar to humans and mice. Further analyses of association studies based on single‐nucleotide polymorphism chip as well as sequence data, mRNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and comparative genomics demonstrated that microtubule‐associated protein 2 (MAP2) is a key gene responsible for hair follicle density and 1 missense mutation of A‐to‐G at rs328005415 in MAP2, causing a valine‐to‐methionine substitution leads to the HR phenotype. Considering the high homology between pigs and humans, our research has some significance for the study of the mechanisms of skin development, hair morphogenesis, and hair loss in humans by showing that the pig may be a more appropriate model in which to study these processes.—Jiang, Y., Jiang, Y., Zhang, H., Mei, M., Song, H., Ma, X., Jiang, L., Yu, Z., Zhang, Q., Ding, X.

Examples include the reach of individuals in (online) social networks, the importance of individual banks or loans in financial networks, the relevance of individual companies in supply networks, and the role of traffic hubs in transport networks. Which features characterize the importance of a node in a trade network during the emergence of a globalized, connected market? Here we analyze a model that maps the evolution of global connectivity in a supply network to a percolation problem. In particular, we focus on the influence of topological features of the node within the underlying transport network. Our results reveal that an advantageous position with respect to different length scales determines the competitiveness of a node at different stages of the percolation process and depending on the speed of the cluster growth."
https://openalex.org/W2991352711,"Many crashes occur around freeway exit ramp areas in China due to excessive speeds and large speed variances. Traditionally, a single posted ramp speed limit sign is installed around the physical gore area to manage the speed. To address this issue, the study presented in this paper proposes the use of an advisory exit speed sign (AESS), which is an additional exit speed limit sign positioned along the deceleration lane to accommodate the speed changes ahead of the physical gore. The study selected three sites with similar exit ramp configurations and two scenarios (with AESS/without AESS) to quantify the influences of the AESS on the speed of exiting vehicles. The speed profiles of 480 vehicles were obtained based on 12 hours of data collection. A t-test was applied to verify the reduction in mean speed between the two scenarios. The results show that the AESS in this study was effective in reducing the mean speed and 85th percentile speed, especially in the taper and deceleration lane. It was clearly seen that drivers began to decelerate in advance when the AESS was installed, which led to a smooth deceleration process, especially on the segment between the theoretical gore and the physical gore. The AESS was also helpful in reducing speeding to some extent. Although the effects of the AESS on speed reduction at curved ramps were not ideal, the speed fluctuation range tended to be more contracted when the AESS was installed. This paper provides useful information for researchers, managers, and engineers when considering the implementation of AESS."
https://openalex.org/W2989958460,"Dislocation after hip arthroplasty is still a major concern. Recent study of the volumetric wear of the cup has suggested that stresses studied in a one-legged stance model could predispose arthroplasty dislocation. The aim of this work was to study whether biomechanical parameters of contact stress distribution in total hip arthroplasty during a neutral hip position can predict a higher possibility of the arthroplasty dislocating. Biomechanical parameters were determined using 3-dimensional mathematical models of the one-legged stance within the HIPSTRESS method. Geometrical parameters were measured from standard anteroposterior X-ray images of the pelvis and proximal femora. Fifty-five patients subjected to total hip arthroplasty that later suffered dislocation of the head and, for comparison, ninety-four total hip arthroplasties that were functional at least 10 years after the implantation, were included in the study. Arthroplasties that suffered dislocation had on average a 6% higher resultant hip force than the control group (p = 0.004), 11% higher peak stress on the load-bearing area (p = 0.001) and a 50% more laterally positioned stress pole (p = 0.026), all parameters being less favorable in the group of unstable arthroplasties. There was no statistically significant difference in the gradient index or in the functional angle of the weight bearing. Our study showed that arthroplasties that show a tendency to push the head out of the cup in the representative body position-the one-legged stance-are prone to dislocation. An unfavorable resultant hip force, peak stress on the load bearing and laterally positioned stress pole are predictors of arthroplasty dislocation."

Subsequently, patients received a high dose of intravenous oxytocin until complete uterus evacuation was achieved. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by mean the relative risk of the foetal expulsion based on comparison of event rates, and the proportion of women induced to labor at 7, 10 and 15 h after the administration of isosorbide dinitrate or misoprostol. Safety was assessed on the basis of woman´s vital signs and evaluation of adverse effects, including headache, abdominal pain, pelvic pain, lower back pain, nausea, dizziness and vomiting.The foetal expulsion rate using the isosorbide dinitrate-oxytocin combination was approximately 4.4 times, and at least 2.1 times, the foetal expulsion rate with the misoprostol-oxytocin regimen at any given point in time. The proportion of women achieved vaginal delivery at 15 hours was 100% for the isosorbide dinitrate-oxytocin group and 86.7% for the misoprostol-oxytocin group. The average delivery induction interval was significantly lower when isosorbide dinitrate-oxytocin was used (8.7 ± 3.1 h) than when misoprostol-oxytocin (11.9 ± 3.1 h) was used. A total of 20% of patients in the isosorbide dinitrate-oxytocin group recorded headache, and no cases of uterine tachysystole, haemorrhage or coagulopathy were recorded.This study indicates that intravaginal isosorbide dinitrate followed by intravenous oxytocin was more effective than the conventional method used to induce labour in the medical management of foetal death in pregnancies after 20 weeks of gestation.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02488642."
https://openalex.org/W2990623853,"The knowledge about the usual size of objects—familiar size—is known to be a taken into account for distance perception. The influence of familiar size on action programming is less clear and has not yet been tested with regard to vergence eye movements. In two experiments, we stereoscopically presented everyday objects, such as a credit card or a package of paper tissues, and varied the distance as specified by binocular disparity and the distance as specified by familiar size. Participants had to fixate the shown object and subsequently reach towards it either with open or with closed eyes. When binocular disparity and familiar size were in conflict, reaching movements revealed a combination of the two depth cues with individually different weights. The influence of familiar size was larger when no visual feedback was available during the reaching movement. Vergence movements closely followed binocular disparity and were largely unaffected by familiar size. In sum, the results suggest that in this experimental setting familiar size is taken into account for programming and executing reaching movements while vergence movements are primarily based on binocular disparity."

https://openalex.org/W2991651828,"In Zimbabwe, viral load (VL) testing for people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy is performed at the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory using a NucliSens machine. Anecdotal evidence has shown that invalid graphs for ""Target Not Detectable (TND)"" will upon repeat VL testing produce a valid result for virus not detected, therefore removing the need to repeat the test. This needs formal assessment.To determine i) intra- and inter-rater agreement of the visual interpretation of NucliSens graphs (Target Detectable [TD], TND and No Line [NL]) between two laboratory scientists and ii) sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the NucliSens graphs compared with repeat VL results.Cross sectional study using secondary data. Two laboratory scientists independently rated graphs one week apart for intra-rater agreement and compared final ratings with each other for inter-rater agreement. Consensus interpretations of graphs were compared with repeat VL results. Kappa coefficients were used to obtain measures of agreement.There were 562 patients with NucliSens graphs and repeat VL. Kappa scores were: 0.98 (Scientist A); 0.99 (Scientist B); 0.96 (Scientist A versus Scientist B); and 0.65 (NucliSens graphs versus VL). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for graphs compared with VL were 71%, 92%, 79% and 89% respectively.Intra-and inter-rater agreements were almost perfect. The negative predictive value translates to a false negative rate of 11%. If repeat VL testing is not done, the clinical consequences need to be balanced against cost savings and the risks outweigh the benefits."
