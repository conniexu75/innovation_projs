https://openalex.org/W2028908847,A bioelectric record of human ovulation is briefly reported. A 57-hour continuous graphic record of a voltage difference existing betwe en the symphysis pubis and the vagina was obtained from a patient in whom a laparotomy was indicated. This period included a predicted time of ovulation. At noon on July 24 the vagina was negative to the symphys is about 10 mV; during the next 7 hours the vagina gradually became positive until at 7:00 it reached 30 mV; at 7:05 the recorder was thrown off scale but when the 0 point shifted it registered 70-80 mV. It steadily declined during the next 20 minutes until 7:35 when the voltage difference was 30 mV with the vagina still negative. This continued until midnight when the experiment was terminated. At laparotomy the next morning a bright punctate hemorrhage of a recently ruptured follicle was found in the left ovary. This observation confirms and extends previous studies and makes it clear that the use of the Burr-Lane-Nims technique enables one to determine with certainty and accuracy the time of ovulation in an intact human being.
