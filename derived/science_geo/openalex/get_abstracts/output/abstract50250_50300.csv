https://openalex.org/W1997870466,"During biosynthesis, a globular protein folds into a tight particle with an interior core that is shielded from the surrounding solvent. The hydrophobic effect is thought to play a key role in mediating this process: nonpolar residues expelled from water engender a molecular interior where they can be buried. Paradoxically, results of earlier quantitative analyses have suggested that the tendency for nonpolar residues to be buried within proteins is weak. However, such analyses merely classify residues as either ""exposed"" or ""buried."" In the experiment reported in this article proteins of known structure were used to measure the average area that each residue buries upon folding. This characteristic quantity, the average area buried, is correlated with residue hydrophobicity."
https://openalex.org/W2027598863,"The sequence of the entire RNA genome of the type flavivirus, yellow fever virus, has been obtained. Inspection of this sequence reveals a single long open reading frame of 10,233 nucleotides, which could encode a polypeptide of 3411 amino acids. The structural proteins are found within the amino-terminal 780 residues of this polyprotein; the remainder of the open reading frame consists of nonstructural viral polypeptides. This genome organization implies that mature viral proteins are produced by posttranslational cleavage of a polyprotein precursor and has implications for flavivirus RNA replication and for the evolutionary relation of this virus family to other RNA viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2093589943,"The size of the midsagittal area of the human corpus callosum obtained from postmortem measurement varied with tested hand preference. The corpus callosum, the main fiber tract connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, was larger by about 0.75 square centimeter, or 11 percent, in left-handed and ambidextrous people than in those with consistent right-hand preference. The difference was present in both the anterior and posterior halves, but not in the region of the splenium itself. This callosal morphology, which varied with hand preference, may also be related to individual differences in the pattern of hemispheric functional specialization. The greater bihemispheric representation of cognitive functions in left- and mixed-handers may be associated with greater anatomical connection between the hemispheres. The naturally occurring regressive events in neurogenesis, such as neuronal cell death and axonal elimination, may be factors in the individual differences in brain morphology and in functional lateralization. Specifically, right-handers may be those with more extensive early elimination of neural components."
https://openalex.org/W2002673255,"The spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus (SNB) contains many more motoneurons in adult male rats than in females. Androgens establish this sex difference during a critical perinatal period, which coincides with normally occurring cell death in the SNB region. Sex differences in SNB motoneuron number arise primarily because motoneuron loss is greater in females than in males during the early postnatal period. Perinatal androgen treatment in females attenuates cell death in the SNB region, reducing motoneuron loss to levels typical of males. The results suggest that steroid hormones determine sex differences in neuron number by regulating normally occurring cell death and that the timing of this cell death may therefore define critical periods for steroid effects on neuron number."
https://openalex.org/W2047944520,"(+/-)-3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), an amphetamine analog with hallucinogenic activity, produced selective long-lasting reductions in the level of serotonin, the number of serotonin uptake sites, and the concentration of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in rat brain. Morphological studies suggested that these neurochemical deficits were due to serotonin nerve terminal degeneration. These results show that MDA has toxic activity for serotonin neurons in rats and raise the question of whether exposure to MDA and related hallucinogenic amphetamines can produce serotonin neurotoxicity in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W165264657,"The amphipathic helix hypothesis for the lipid-associating domains of exchangeable plasma apolipoproteins has been further studied by analysis of the structure of the complexes formed between four synthetic peptide analogs of the amphipathic helix and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC). Density gradient ultracentrifugation, negative stain electron microscopy, nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, 1H NMR, high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry, and circular dichroism were the techniques used in these studies. The two analogs Asp-Trp-Leu-Lys-Ala-Phe-Tyr-Asp-Lys-Val-Ala-Glu-Lys-Leu-Lys-Glu-Ala-Phe (18A) and 18A-Pro-18A whose sequences most strongly mimic native amphipathic sequences were found also most strongly to mimic apolipoprotein A-I in DMPC complex structure. The covalently linked dimer of the prototype amphipathic analog 18A, 18A-Pro-18A, appears to have greater lipid affinity than 18A. This presumably is the result of the cooperativity provided by two covalently linked lipid-associating domains in 18A-Pro-18A. The studies further suggest that the charge-reversed analog of the prototype 18A, reverse-18A, has the lowest lipid affinity of the four analogs studied and forms only marginally stable discoidal DMPC complexes. We postulate that this low lipid affinity is due predominantly, but not necessarily exclusively, to the lack of a hydrophobic contribution of lysine residues at the polar-nonpolar interface of reverse-18A versus 18A. The intermediate lipid affinity of des-Val10-18A, the fourth analog peptide, to produce a rank order of 18A-Pro-18A greater than 18A greater than des-Val10-18A greater than reverse-18A, supports this interpretation. Des-Val10-18A which has Val deleted from 18A has an amphipathic helical structure partially disrupted by the shift of 2 lysine residues away from the polar-nonpolar interface."
https://openalex.org/W2081088219,"The hsp 70 gene of Drosophila contains three domains to which a heat shock gene specific transcription factor (HSTF) binds. In addition to the previously described 55 bp binding domain proximal to the TAT homology, there are two 25 bp binding sites farther upstream. Footprinting studies with 5' and 3' deletion mutations show two contiguous HSTF binding sites of different intrinsic affinities within the 55 bp binding domain. Determinations made with an agarose-acrylamide gel assay suggest that the HSTF possesses a 12.5-fold higher intrinsic affinity for the site closest to the TATA homology than for the more distal site. Binding of HSTF to the distal site thus appears cooperative, requiring occupancy of the first site. Transcription studies in vitro on the 5' deletions with nuclear extracts and reconstitution experiments show that the TATA proximal site alone, is insufficient for maximal transcriptional activation of the hsp 70 gene."

https://openalex.org/W2053810188,"Hemocyanins are large multi-subunit copper proteins that transport oxygen in many arthropods and molluscs. Comparison of the amino acid sequence data for seven different subunits of arthropod hemocyanins from crustaceans and chelicerates shows many highly conserved residues and extensive regions of near identity. This correspondence can be matched closely with the three domain structure established by x-ray crystallography for spiny lobster hemocyanin. The degree of identity is particularly striking in the second domain of the subunit that contains the six histidines which ligate the two oxygen-binding copper atoms. The polypeptide architecture of spiny lobster hemocyanin appears to be the same in all arthropods. This structure must therefore be at least as old as the estimated time of divergence of crustaceans and chelicerates, about 540 to 600 million years ago."

https://openalex.org/W2086332154,Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra showing the relative concentrations of high-energy phosphate metabolites have been recorded noninvasively from the human heart in vivo. Spectral data were spatially localized by combining a pulsed magnetic field gradient with surface NMR excitation-detection coils. The location of the selected spectral region was determined by conventional proton NMR imaging immediately before examination by phosphorus-31 NMR spectroscopy.

https://openalex.org/W1966565972,"The c-fms proto-oncogene was shown to be expressed in human bone marrow and in differentiated blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that its gene product plays a role in hematopoietic maturation. The c-fms mRNA was not detected in HL-60 cells, an established promyelocytic line, whereas c-fms expression appeared 48 hr after induction when most cells had differentiated into macrophages. An acquired deletion of chromosome 5 (5q−) in bone marrow cells is associated with abnormalities in blood cell production. The normal 5 and 5q− chromosomes were segregated by construction of cell hybrids between bone marrow and rodent cells. A selective system was used that requires retention of the structural gene for dihydrofolate reductase, located on human chromosome 5. Analysis of DNA from individual hybrid clones revealed that the 5q− deletion had removed the c-fms gene. We postulate that hemizygosity at the c-fms locus leads to abnormalities in hematopoietic maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2087480868,A specific fibrinolytic agent was synthesized by covalently coupling urokinase to a monoclonal antibody that was fibrin-specific and did not cross-react with fibrinogen. The antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide representing the seven amino-terminal residues of the beta chain of human fibrin. The urokinase-antifibrin conjugate retained the original binding specificity of the antibody and showed 100-fold increased fibrinolysis in vitro when compared to unmodified urokinase. The presence of human fibrinogen at plasma concentration did not influence these properties.
https://openalex.org/W2077367379,"Arterial blood nitrogen tensions of free-diving Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddelli) were measured by attaching a microprocessor-controlled blood pump and drawing samples at depth to determine how these marine mammals dive to great depths and ascend rapidly without developing decompression sickness. Forty-seven samples of arterial blood were obtained from four Weddell seals during free dives lasting up to 23 minutes to depths of 230 meters beneath the sea ice of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Peak arterial blood nitrogen tensions of between 2000 and 2500 millimeters of mercury were recorded at depths of 40 to 80 meters during descent, indicating that the seal's lung collapses by 25 to 50 meters. Then arterial blood nitrogen tensions slowly decreased to about 1500 millimeters of mercury at the surface. In a single dive, alveolar collapse and redistribution of blood nitrogen allow the seal to avoid nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness."
https://openalex.org/W2002907404,"Soon after infection, retroviruses synthesize a DNA copy of the genomic RNA and insert that DNA into the cellular genome by recombination at inverted repeat sequences at the termini of the viral genome. We have generated mutations that alter one terminus of the genome of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV). Some mutations did not prevent integration of the viral DNA even though the very terminal bases were disrupted. Other mutations had dramatic effects on the efficiency of infection; in these cases the formation of preintegrative DNA was normal but the establishment of the productive provirus was prevented. One of these defective mutants gave rise to a pseudorevertant which differed from the wild type but displayed normal infectivity. An unusual number of bases of viral DNA were removed during the integration reaction carried out by this virus."
https://openalex.org/W1487236423,"The time dependence of the release of fibrinopeptides from fibrinogen was studied as a function of the concentration of fibrinogen, thrombin, and Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro, an inhibitor of fibrin polymerization. The release of fibrinopeptides during fibrin assembly was shown to be a highly ordered process. Rate constants for individual steps in the formation of fibrin were evaluated at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C, gamma/2 = 0.15. The initial event, thrombin-catalyzed proteolysis at Arg-A alpha 16 to release fibrinopeptide A (kcat/Km = 1.09 X 10(7) M-1s-1) was followed by association of the resulting fibrin I monomers. Association of fibrin I was found to be a reversible process with rate constants of 1 X 10(6) M-1s-1 and 0.064 s-1 for association and dissociation, respectively. Assuming random polymerization of fibrin I monomer, the equilibrium constant for fibrin I association (1.56 X 10(7) M-1) indicates that greater than 80% of the fibrin I protofibrils should contain more than 10 monomeric units at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, when the fibrin I concentration is 1.0 mg/ml. Association of fibrin I monomers was shown to result in a 6.5-fold increase in the susceptibility of Arg-B beta 14 to thrombin-mediated proteolysis. The 6.5-fold increase in the observed specificity constant from 6.5 X 10(5) M-1s-1 to 4.2 X 10(6) M-1s-1 upon association of fibrin I monomers and the rate constant for fibrin association indicates that most of the fibrinopeptide B is released after association of fibrin I monomers. The interaction between a pair of polymerization sites in fibrin I dimer was found to be weaker than the interaction of fibrin I with Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro and weaker than the interaction of fibrin I with fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1595344075,"The stoichiometry of antithrombin III (AT) inhibition of alpha-thrombin (T) has been investigated in the presence and absence of heparin as a function of ionic strength by quantitative titration of enzyme active sites. In contrast to the ionic strength-independent stoichiometry of 1.0 mol of AT/mol of T observed in the absence of heparin, the presence of high-affinity heparin (HAH) resulted in an ionic strength-dependent increase in the apparent stoichiometry of inhibition from a molar ratio of 1.1 AT/T at an ionic strength of 0.3 to 9.8 mol of AT/T when the ionic strength was lowered to 0.01. Reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the reaction products revealed that the increased AT/T stoichiometry was due to preferential formation of a specific proteolytically cleaved form of AT that was indistinguishable from the previously characterized reactive site-cleaved AT (ATM). Using high-performance liquid chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to quantitate ATM, the cleaved inhibitor was shown to be formed rapidly and concomitant with the stable thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and quantitatively accounted for the apparent increase in reaction stoichiometry at low ionic strength in the presence of HAH. The levels of HAH required to produce maximum ATM were catalytic at mu greater than or equal to 0.15, but became stoichiometric as the ionic strength decreased below 0.1. Substantially less ATM was produced in the presence of low-affinity heparin, while a low molecular weight HAH, virtually inactive in accelerating T inhibition by AT, was unable to promote significant ATM formation. These results indicate competition between substrate and inhibition reactions of AT with T which are affected by an ionic strength-dependent heparin interaction. A reaction mechanism accounting for these observations is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2048121987,"Melanocytes derived from fetal or adult skin do not propagate in vitro unless cultured in the presence of factors such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). In a search for physiological factors regulating the growth of melanocytes, extracts of various cultured cell types were tested. Factors produced by melanoma and astrocytoma cell lines support continued proliferation of melanocytes in the absence of TPA. WI-38, a fibroblast cell line derived from human embryonic lung, was the most active source of melanocyte growth factors. No melanocyte growth-promoting activity was found in extracts of cultured neuroblastoma, renal cancer, normal keratinocytes, or renal epithelium. Nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, transforming growth factor-beta, and platelet-derived growth factor did not have growth-promoting activity for melanocytes. The presence of melanocyte growth factors and TPA together resulted in the strongest mitogenic activity for melanocytes, permitting the recovery (at 20 days) of 4 to 20 times as many cells as in growth factor or TPA alone."
https://openalex.org/W2020231679,"Picosecond time-resolved Raman spectra of hemoglobin generated with blue pulses (20 to 30 picoseconds) that were resonant with the Soret band and of sufficient intensity to completely photodissociate the starting liganded sample are reported. For both R- and T-state liganded hemoglobins, the peak frequencies in the spectrum of the deoxy transient were the same at approximately 25 picoseconds as those observed at 10 nanoseconds subsequent to photodissociation. In particular, the large R-T differences in the frequency of the stretching mode for the iron-proximal histidine bond (VFe-His) detected in previously reported nanosecond-resolved spectra were also evident in the picosecond-resolved spectra. The implications of this finding with respect to the distribution of strain energy in the liganded protein and the origin of the time course for geminate recombination are discussed. On the basis of these results, a microscopic model is proposed in which delocalization of strain energy is strongly coupled to the coordinate of the iron. The model is used to explain the origin of the R-T differences in the rates of ligand dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1844686547,"A somatic cell mutant (Mev-1) auxotrophic for mevalonate by virtue of a complete lack of detectable 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase activity has been shown to demonstrate a requirement for a non-sterol mevalonate-derived product for regulation of synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase. A comparison of the effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol and the combination of 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonate on HMG-CoA reductase activity, synthesis, and mRNA levels in Mev-1 is presented in this report. The results show a close correlation between activity, rate of synthesis, and mRNA levels for Mev-1 cells treated with 25-hydroxycholesterol alone. Under the conditions of these experiments these effects are relatively small (approximately a 4-fold decrease). A much larger inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity and rate of synthesis (approximately 50-fold) is observed upon treatment of Mev-1 cells with a combination of 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonate. Yet, under these conditions mRNA levels are still reduced by only a factor of 4. These results are interpreted to suggest that the non-sterol mevalonate-derived regulatory product of HMG-CoA reductase acts by a translational control mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2130692096,"The mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier has been substantially purified from rat liver mitoplasts by extraction with Triton X-114 in the presence of cardiolipin followed by chromatography on hydroxylapatite. Upon incorporation of the hydroxylapatite eluate into phospholipid vesicles, an n-butylmalonate-sensitive malonate/malate exchange has been demonstrated. This exchange activity is enhanced 226-fold relative to the starting material (i.e. detergent-extracted mitoplasts). Silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gels verify the high purity of this fraction relative to the starting material. Nonetheless, the banding pattern indicates that several protein species are still present. As isolated, the dicarboxylate transporter is rather unstable but can be stabilized either by the addition of 10% ethylene glycol and subsequent storage at -20 degrees C or by incorporation into phospholipid vesicles in the presence of malate followed by freezing in liquid nitrogen. Such proteoliposomes catalyze a [14C]malonate uptake which is characterized by a first order rate constant of 1.02 min-1 and a t 1/2 of 41 s. This uptake can be inhibited by dicarboxylates (e.g. succinate, malate, unlabeled malonate) but not by either alpha-ketoglutarate or by tricarboxylates (e.g. citrate, threo-Ds-isocitrate). Furthermore, the reconstituted malonate transport is dependent on internal malate and can be inhibited by n-butylmalonate, mersalyl, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and Pi, but not by N-ethylmaleimide. It is concluded that this highly purified fraction contains a reconstitutively active dicarboxylate transporter which, based on its substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity, appears to be identical to the native dicarboxylate transport system found in intact rat liver mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2008871930,"Salamanders of the genus Thorius (Plethodontidae) are among the smallest tetrapods. Hypotheses of limb skeletal evolution in these vertebrates were evaluated on the basis of estimates of natural variation, comparisons of skeletal homology, and analysis of molecular phylogeny. Nine carpal arrangements occur in Thorius, more than in all twelve related genera of typically larger salamanders; six of these arrangements are unique. They represent a trend toward a decrease in the number of separate cartilages that is independent of locomotor and ecological specialization. Miniaturization may be an important source of morphological novelty, distinct from local adaptation, in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2069644095,"The spectral sensitivities and color of oil droplets of cone photoreceptors in the retina of the red-eared turtle (Pseudemys scripta elegans) were investigated by intracellular recording and injections of Lucifer yellow dye. Six morphological types of cones could be distinguished by the color of the oil droplets located in the outermost inner segments. Single cones containing either red or pale green oil droplets were sensitive to red light, cones with yellow oil droplets to green, and cones with clear oil droplets to blue. Contrary to previous reports, both principal and accessory members of double cones were sensitive to red, and no diffusion of dye was detected between the two apposed members. Thus, the oil droplets provide a reliable morphological basis for further investigation of the neuroanatomical networks underlying the processing of color information in the vertebrate retina."
https://openalex.org/W1597626465,"It has been established that the horseradish peroxidase/O2/isobutyraldehyde (IBAL) system leads to triplet acetone and formic acid formation followed by phosphorescence of the triplet acetone (see, for example, Bechara, E.J.H., Faria Oliveira, O.M.M., Duran, N., Casadei de Baptista, R., and Cilento, G. (1979) Photochem. Photobiol. 30, 101-110). In this paper many of the mechanistic details are established. The reaction is initiated by the autoxidation of IBAL to form the peracid (CH3)2CHC = O(OOH). The peracid converts horseradish peroxidase into compound I which in turn is converted into compound II by abstracting the alcoholic hydrogen atom from the enol form of IBAL. This creates a free radical with two resonance forms. (Formula: see text) Addition of molecular oxygen to the latter resonance form creates a peroxy radical which abstracts a hydrogen atom near the active site of the enzyme. The newly formed alpha-peroxide in turn forms a dioxetane-type of intermediate which rapidly decomposes into triplet acetone and formic acid. Compound II reacts with the enol by the same pathway as compound I. Thus native horseradish peroxidase is regenerated. The hydrogen atom abstraction near the enzyme active site may occur directly from ethanol, present to solubilize IBAL or from a group on the enzyme, in which case ethanol participates in a repair mechanism. Phosphate buffer is necessary because it catalyzes the keto-enol conversion of IBAL. Thus horseradish peroxidase participates in a normal peroxidatic cycle. The only chain reaction is the uncatalyzed autoxidation of IBAL, most of which occurs prior to the mixing of IBAL with the oxygenated horseradish peroxidase solution."
https://openalex.org/W2039534337,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the coding region of the circumsporozoite antigen gene (CS gene) of the Nuri strain of the malarial parasite Plasmodium knowlesi is presented. The gene from the Nuri strain exhibits a novel form of sequence diversity when compared to the CS gene from the H strain. Instead of the 12 tandem repeating 36-base pair units of the H strain, the Nuri strain contains 16 tandem repeating 27-base pair units of a different nucleotide sequence that encodes a different repeating peptide. In contrast, the 5' and 3' coding and noncoding sequences flanking the repeats are 98 percent conserved in both strains."
https://openalex.org/W1508958720,"Rat liver glutathione S-transferases have been purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity by S-hexylglutathione-linked Sepharose 6B affinity chromatography and CM-cellulose column chromatography. At least 11 transferase activity peaks can be resolved including five Yb size homodimeric isozymes, two Yc size homodimeric isozymes, one Ya homodimeric isozyme, one Y alpha homodimeric isozyme, and two Ya-Yc heterodimeric isozymes. Distribution of the GSH peroxidase activity among the CM-cellulose column fractions suggests the existence of further multiplicity in this isozyme family. Substrate specificity patterns of the Yb subunit isozymes revealed a possibility that each of the five Yb-containing isozymes is composed of a different homodimeric Yb size subunit composition. Our findings on the increasing multiplicity of glutathione S-transferase isozymes are consistent with the notion that multiple isozymes of overlapping substrate specificities are required to detoxify a multitude of xenobiotics in addition to serving other important physiological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2044547779,"The activity of the Ultrabithorax (Ubx+) gene is necessary for the characteristic development of a particular anatomical domain of the body of Drosophila. Mutant alleles at the abx, bx, bxd, and pbx loci eliminate specific functions of Ubx+ since their phenotype is part of that of Ubx mutants. We have characterized several abx and bx alleles and found that their effect extends to the same anatomical subdomain. This suggests that they inactivate the same genetic subunit within Ultrabithorax. Also, their wild-type activity is required for two distinct functions: postprothorax, acting early in the embryonic period, and bithorax, acting through embryonic and larval periods. Our results suggest that the Ultrabithorax gene contains two genetic subunits and that each subunit may include two separate functions."
https://openalex.org/W1494497302,"In buffer containing 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.01% NaN3, and 0.2 mM ATP, the KD for the formation of the 1:1 complex between Acanthamoeba actin and Acanthamoeba profilin was about 5 microM. When the actin was modified by addition of a pyrenyl group to cysteine 374, the KD increased to about 40 microM but the critical concentration (0.16 microM) was unchanged. The very much lower affinity of profilin for modified actin explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin. Light-scattering assays of the polymerization of unmodified actin in the absence and presence of profilin gave a similar value for the KD (about 5-10 microM) when determined by the increase in the apparent critical concentration of F-actin at steady state at all concentrations of actin up to 20 microM and by the inhibition of the initial rates of polymerization of actin nucleated by either F-actin or covalently cross-linked actin dimer. In the same buffer, but with ADP instead of ATP, the critical concentration of actin was higher (4.9 microM) and the KD of the profilin-actin complex was lower for both unmodified (1-2 microM) and 100% pyrenyl-labeled actin (4.9 microM)."
https://openalex.org/W1567440722,"The functional molecular weight of rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase was determined by radiation inactivation. Both isolated hepatic microsomes and primary hepatocytes were irradiated with high energy electrons at -135 degrees C, and the residual microsomal enzyme activity was subsequently determined. The loss of enzyme activity in both irradiated microsomes and microsomes isolated from irradiated hepatocytes followed a single exponential decay which corresponded to a molecular mass of 200 kDa. This minimal molecular size of the functional enzyme was unaffected by either addition of cholestyramine to the rat diet or addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol plus mevalonate to the isolated rat hepatocytes. In addition, surviving enzyme protein was determined by immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled enzyme from hepatocytes that had been incubated with [35S]methionine before irradiation. The target size for loss of the monomer subunits was 98 kDa. The simplest interpretation of these results is that rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in situ is a noncovalently linked dimer of the Mr = 97,200 enzyme subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1548173171,"Diethyl pyrocarbonate inhibits pig kidney holo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase with a second-order rate constant of 1170 M-1 min-1 at pH 6.8 and 25 degrees C, showing a concomitant increase in absorbance at 242 nm due to formation of carbethoxyhistidyl derivatives. Activity can be restored by hydroxylamine, and the pH curve of inactivation indicates the involvement of a residue with a pKa of 6.03. Complete inactivation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase requires the modification of 6 histidine residues/mol of enzyme. Statistical analysis of the residual enzyme activity and of the extent of modification shows that, among 6 modifiable residues, only one is critical for activity. Protection exerted by substrate analogues, which bind to the active site of the enzyme, suggests that the modification occurs at or near the active site. The modified inactivated 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase still retains most of its ability to bind substrates. Thus, it may be suggested that the inactivation of enzyme by diethyl pyrocarbonate is not due to nonspecific steric or conformational changes which prevent substrate binding. However, the modified enzyme fails to produce at high pH either an enzyme-substrate complex or an enzyme-product complex absorbing at 390 nm. Considerations on this peculiar feature of the modified enzyme consistent with a catalytic role for the modified histidyl residue are discussed. The overall conclusion of this study may be that the modification of only one histidyl residue of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase inactivates the enzyme and that this residue plays an essential role in the mechanism of action of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1547860040,"The phosphorylation patterns of proteins were examined during the cell cycle of Chinese hamster ovary cells. This was accomplished by labeling synchronized cells at various times with [32P]orthophosphate and separating the proteins by both isoelectric focusing and nonequilibrium pH gradient two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The most dramatic changes occurred during late G2/M when approximately eight proteins (including vimentin, lamin B, and histones 1 and 3) showed increased phosphorylation. Ten other proteins appeared to be uniquely phosphorylated during late G2/M. Of these 10 proteins, seven were no longer phosphorylated shortly after mitosis. There is also at least one protein which showed a relative decrease in phosphorylation during late G2/M."
https://openalex.org/W1563738835,"The activation of pyruvate dehydrogenasea kinase activity by CoA esters has been further characterized. Half-maximal activation of kinase activity was achieved with about 1.0 microM acetyl-CoA after a 20-s preincubation in the presence of NADH. More than 80% of the acetyl-CoA was consumed during this period in acetylating sites in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex as a result of the transacetylation reaction proceeding to equilibrium. At 1.0 microM acetyl-CoA, this resulted in more than a 4-fold higher level of CoA than residual acetyl-CoA. Activation of kinase activity could result either from acetylation of specific sites in the complex or tight binding of acetyl-CoA. Removal of CoA enhanced both acetylation and activation, suggesting acetylation mediates activation. For allosteric binding of acetyl-CoA to elicit activation, an activation constant, Ka, less than 50 nM would be required. To further distinguish between those mechanisms, the effects of other CoA esters as well as the reactivity of most of the effective CoA esters were characterized. Several short-chain CoA esters enhanced kinase activity including (in decreasing order of effectiveness) malonyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and methylmalonyl-CoA. Butyryl-CoA inhibited kinase activity as did high concentrations of long-chain acyl-CoAs. Inhibition by long-chain acyl-CoAs may result, in part, from detergent-like properties of those esters. Malonyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, and methylmalonyl-CoA, obtained with radiolabeled acyl groups, were shown to acylate sites in the complex. Propionyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA were tested, in competition with acetyl-CoA or pyruvate, as alternative substrates for acylation of sites in the complex and as competitive effectors of kinase activity. Propionyl-CoA alone rapidly acylated sites in the complex at low concentrations, and low concentrations of propionyl-CoA were effective in activating kinase activity although only a relatively small activation was observed. When an equivalent level (20 microM) of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA was used, marked activation of kinase activity due to a dominant effect of acetyl-CoA was associated with acetylation of a major portion of sites in the complex and with a small portion undergoing acylation with propionyl-CoA. Those results were rapidly achieved in a manner independent of the order of addition of the two CoA esters. That indicates that tight slowly reversible binding of acetyl-CoA is not involved in kinase activation. High levels of propionyl-CoA greatly reduced acetylation by acetyl-CoA and nearly prevented activation of kinase activity by acetyl-CoA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1480983598,"The interaction of high mobility group protein 1 (HMG 1) isolated from chicken erythrocytes with DNA has been characterized using the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protein as a probe. It was found that the fluorescence is quenched approximately 30% upon binding to either single- or double-stranded DNA. Fluorescent titrations indicate that the physical site size for HMG 1 binding on native DNA is approximately 14 base pairs (or 14 bases for binding to single-stranded DNA). Binding to single-stranded poly(dA) is only slightly dependent on ionic strength, although the affinity for double-stranded DNA is strongly ionic strength-dependent and has an optimum at approximately 100-120 mM Na+. Above this range, binding to native DNA is virtually all electrostatic in nature. Although the affinity of HMG 1 for single-stranded DNA is higher than that for double-stranded DNA at the extremes of the ionic range studied, no clear evidence for a helix-destabilizing activity was obtained. At low ionic strength, the protein actually stabilized DNA against thermal denaturation, while at high ionic strength, HMG 1 appears to undergo denaturation below the Tm of the DNA. Studies of the environment of the tryptophan fluorophores using collisional quenchers iodide, cesium, and acrylamide suggest that the predominant fluorophore is relatively exposed but constrained in a rigid, positively charged environment."
https://openalex.org/W1503960820,"As is the case for cytochrome P-450c, arene 1,2-oxides have been identified as initial metabolites when naphthalene and anthracene are oxidized by cytochrome P-450b in a highly purified, reconstituted system. Overall rates of metabolism by cytochrome P-450b are greater than 3-fold and greater than 50-fold lower than the respective rates of metabolism by cytochrome P-450c. For both hydrocarbons, the (-)-(1S,2R)-oxide predominates (74%) with cytochrome P-450b as the terminal oxidant, based on trapping the labile arene oxides as N-acetyl-L-cysteine S-conjugates of known absolute configuration. This result is in marked contrast to data obtained with cytochrome P-450c where the (+)-(1R,2S)-oxides predominate (73-greater than 95%). In the absence of added epoxide hydrolase, the metabolically formed arene oxides rapidly isomerize to phenols. Addition of increasing amounts of epoxide hydrolase to the incubation medium results in the formation of trans-1,2-dihydrodiols at the expense of phenols from the common arene oxide intermediates. Evaluation of the kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) for the hydration of the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of both arene oxides by epoxide hydrolase has indicated that the (+)-(1R,2S)-enantiomers exhibit lower values of Km (approximately 1 microM) whereas the values of kcat are similar for both enantiomers of a given arene oxide. These parameters have allowed construction of a mathematical model which predicts the enantiomer composition of the dihydrodiols formed from naphthalene in reconstituted systems containing specific epoxide hydrolase concentrations. The data reported argue against a selective functional coupling mechanism between cytochrome P-450c and epoxide hydrolase in the metabolism of naphthalene and anthracene to the 1,2-dihydrodiols."
https://openalex.org/W2017699118,"The structure of a T = 1 icosahedral particle (where T is the triangulation number), assembled from southern bean mosaic virus coat protein fragments that lacked the amino-terminal arm, was solved by means of model building procedures with the use of 6-angstrom resolution x-ray diffraction data. The icosahedral five-, three-, and twofold contacts were found to be similar, at this resolution, to the analogous contacts (icosahedral five-, quasi-three-, and quasi-twofolds) found in the parent T = 3 southern bean mosaic virus. However, the icosahedral fivefold contacts of the T = 3 structure are the most conserved in the T = 1 capsid. These results are consistent with a mechanism in which pentameric caps of dimers are the building blocks for the assembly of T = 1 and T = 3 icosahedral viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1602678826,"The 31-kDa domain of human plasma fibronectin has been completely characterized. This fragment is located at the COOH-terminal end of the molecule immediately preceding the 3-kDa interchain disulfide-containing peptide. The 31-kDa domain was obtained after trypsin digestion of fibronectin and purified by affinity chromatography on gelatin- and heparin-Sepharose columns. The fragment eluted in the heparin-unbound fraction and was further purified by DEAE-cellulose and high performance liquid chromatography. The 31-kDa fragment contained a fibrin-binding site (fibrin II site) which was only active at physiological NaCl concentrations and therefore differed from that located in the NH2-terminal domain which also bound at lower NaCl concentrations. The 31-kDa domain bound to thiopropyl-Sepharose and was shown to contain a free sulfhydryl group located at position 35 in the sequence. To determine the complete amino acid sequence of this fragment, a trypsin digestion was performed on the reduced and alkylated 31-kDa domain, and the 17 resulting peptides were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography; their amino acid compositions and amino acid sequences have been determined, and the arrangement of peptides was achieved by comparison with the sequences deduced from human and rat cDNA clones and with a related plasmic fragment from bovine fibronectin. Comparison of these three sequences showed 23 amino acid differences between human and rat fibronectin and 16 between human and bovine fibronectin. This represents a 91 and 94% homology, respectively. An interesting finding is that the 31-kDa fragment contains a deletion of 31 residues when compared to the rat cDNA sequence. This deletion appears to represent a species difference since it is due to a shorter mRNA in the case of human fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W2073147618,"Tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin, coagulation factor III), a protein component of cell membranes, is an essential cofactor for factor VII-dependent initiation of blood coagulation. Since no tissue factor-deficient condition has been described, it is one of only a few proteins of the coagulation system for which the pattern of inheritance has not been ascertained. Because of the species-specificity of tissue factor activity and the availability of a very sensitive chromogenic assay, it was possible in the present study to use somatic cell hybrids to assign the chromosomal location of the tissue factor structural gene (F3) to human chromosome 1 (1pter----1p21)."

https://openalex.org/W1596785386,"Neurosecretory granule lysate from bovine posterior pituitary was shown to contain both carboxypeptidase B and amidating activities. The former sequentially releases COOH-terminal basic residues from the oxytocin biosynthetic precursor fragment oxytocinyl-GKR (CYIQNCPLGKR) to form oxytocinyl-GK and then oxytocinyl-G. The amidating enzyme converts the resulting oxytocinyl-G into oxytocin (CYIQNCPLG-NH2). The carboxypeptidase B was separated from a less specific carboxypeptidase present in granule lysate by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. Percoll density gradient centrifugation (after preliminary differential centrifugation) also yielded granule fractions enriched in the specific carboxypeptidase B activity. The carboxypeptidase B which converts the oxytocinyl peptides showed a fairly sharp pH dependence with an optimum of 5.5-6, was activated by cobalt ion, and was inhibited by cupric ion, EDTA, and a thiol protease inhibitor, p-chloromercuribenzoate. The amidating activity which converts oxytocinyl-G to oxytocin was competed by degradation due to proteases and/or peptidases present in lysate of Percoll gradient-derived granules. Oxytocinyl-GKR was shown by analytical affinity chromatography to bind noncovalently to neurophysin with an affinity close to that of mature oxytocin. This binding activity and the observation of carboxypeptidase B activity in the presence of large concentrations of neurophysin are consistent with the view that the exoproteolytic processing and amidation steps which occur after initial endoproteolysis of pro-oxytocin/neurophysin likely take place on oxytocin intermediate peptides which are bound in noncovalent complexes with the neurophysin domain from the precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2059374085,"The intermediate-sized filaments of vimentin-type (Mr = 57,000) have been identified biochemically and immunochemically as a major cytoskeleton component in the ciliary epithelium of the mammalian eye. When human or rabbit ciliary processes, or cultured ciliary epithelial-derived cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing [32P]orthophosphate and any of the following agents: 1) beta-adrenergic agonists (isoproterenol or epinephrine), 2) direct activators of adenylate cyclase (cholera toxin or forskolin), 3) analogs of cyclic AMP (8-Br-cAMP), or 4) prostaglandin E1, the phosphorylation of vimentin was significantly enhanced. The maximal enhancement ranged, in vivo and in vitro, from about 3-fold in human to 5-fold in rabbit, with either 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP or 0.1 microM forskolin. Phosphorylation of vimentin increased in the presence of beta-adrenergic agonists and could be blocked by the antiglaucoma beta-adrenergic antagonist timolol. The alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine had no effect on phosphorylation of vimentin. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody, anti-vimentin, allowed the localization of vimentin filaments in cultured ciliary epithelial cells. Treatment of these cells in culture with the catecholamine hormone, isoproterenol (1 microM), resulted in a profound reorganization of vimentin filaments. This may be correlated with the enhanced levels of phosphorylated vimentin observed upon increasing cellular cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1486267530,"In isolated rat adipocytes, epinephrine rapidly stimulates the transport of long chain fatty acid across the plasma membrane. At a concentration of unbound oleate of 0.1 microM ([fatty acid]/[albumin] = 1) and 5 min exposure to the hormone, the minimal effective concentration of epinephrine is 0.03 and the optimal concentration 0.3 microM (0.01 and 0.1 microgram/ml). The stimulated rates are 5-10-fold the basal rate of influx or efflux. The hormone effect is on the transport process specifically as shown by isolation of the product of transport in either direction as unesterified fatty acid and inhibition by the transport inhibitors phloretin and 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid. This effect of epinephrine on transport coordinates physiologically with lipase activation to bring about fatty acid release from adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1605705832,"Mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.17) has been purified from Aspergillus parasiticus, a filamentous fungus which produces the polyketide mycotoxin, versicolorin A. Its kinetic properties have been compared with those of mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase from the related non-toxin-producing fungus, A. niger. Both enzymes are inhibited by divalent transition metals, especially Zn2+ and Cd2+, but only the enzyme from A. parasiticus exhibits inhibitor-induced cooperative binding of the substrate, fructose-6 phosphate. Double reciprocal plots (1/v versus 1/Fru-6-P) are linear in the absence of Zn2+ but in the presence of Zn2+ are concave upward, with Hill coefficients of 1.5. The extent of cooperativity is inversely related to ionic strength, disappearing at 100 mM KCl. The enzymes from both organisms are relatively stable to incubation at 30 degrees C, but only the enzyme from A. parasiticus is rendered thermally unstable by the addition of divalent transition metals. A model is proposed to explain how binding of transition metal ions affects substrate binding and thermal stability of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1496275808,"We report on the preparation, crystallization, and preliminary x-ray crystallographic study of the Fab fragments of two monoclonal anti-2-phenyloxazolone antibodies obtained from the secondary response to this hapten. The Fab fragment from one of these (NQ10/12.5) has been crystallized from polyethylene glycol 8000 solutions in a form suitable for high-resolution x-ray crystallographic studies. These crystals are monoclinic, space group C2, with a = 129.2 A, b = 79.4 A, c = 57.7 A, beta = 96.2 degrees, and one Fab/asymmetric unit. Determination of the three-dimensional structure of Fab NQ10/12.5 should help clarify the role of somatic mutation in the maturation of an immune response. This antibody and an anti-lysozyme antibody also under study apparently use the same germ-line encoded VK and a similar VH gene, respectively, as the idiotypic anti-oxazolone antibodies characteristic of the primary response. A comparative study of the two structures should shed light on the role of the pairing of heavy and light chains in the antigen-binding function of antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1592105204,"Androgen receptors were attached covalently in situ to their nuclear acceptor sites with the contact site cross-linker, formaldehyde. Chromatin, prepared from sonicated nuclei of rat prostate, was labeled by isotope exchange with [3H]dihydrotestosterone and found to contain 19,000 +/- 900 (mean +/- S.E.) salt-extractable androgen receptors/nucleus which sedimented in the 3-4 S region of 7.6-76% (v/v) glycerol gradients and at a density of approximately 1.28-1.35 g/ml in CsCl gradients. After incubation of the chromatin with 0.5% (w/v) formaldehyde for 1 h at 4 degrees C, there was a 90% reduction in the concentration of free androgen receptors and an increase in the density of the androgen binding sites recovered from CsCl gradients. Extensive digestion of the cross-linked chromatin with micrococcal nuclease liberated 18% of the androgen receptors as 3-4 S entities and caused an overall decrease in the density of the receptor-acceptor complexes. Ribonuclease digestions had no effect on the androgen receptors cross-linked to chromatin. Mild digestion of the cross-linked preparations with trypsin, alone or in combination with micrococcal nuclease, resulted in the release of 74% and 97% of the androgen receptors, respectively. Together, these findings imply that two classes of receptor-acceptor complexes are present in prostatic chromatin--one, containing about 20% of the androgen receptors in which the receptors are in direct contact with DNA but not with proteins and the other, containing most of the androgen receptors in which the receptors are adjacent to acceptor proteins but not to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1588420821,"Monoclonal antibodies to rabbit skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase were produced by the conventional hybridoma cell technique. 90 out of 600 hybridomas were found to produce phosphorylase kinase binding antibodies from which only five secreted also phosphorylase kinase activity affecting antibodies. Three of them were cloned; two hybridomas resisted all cloning efforts. Employing immunoblot technique all monoclonal antibodies show cross-reactivity with the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of phosphorylase kinase indicating that similar, if not identical, epitopes are present on these three subunits. No cross-reactivity with delta is observed. Monoclonal antibodies secreted by two clones which bind to the alpha subunit stimulate the Ca2+-independent A0 activity of phosphorylase kinase more than 30-fold, whereas all other monoclonal antibodies obtained are ineffective in this respect. Monoclonal antibodies binding to the beta subunit inhibit the Ca2+-dependent activities significantly. Antibody produced by one hybridoma binds to the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits with approximately the same affinity. Based on the dual function of calmodulin in phosphorylase kinase (Hessova, Z., Varsanyi, M., and Heilmeyer, L.M.G., Jr. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 146, 107-115) we conclude that binding of anti-alpha monoclonal antibodies to a regulatory domain in the alpha subunit results in an uncoupling of the inhibitory function of the Ca2+-free delta from the holoenzyme which leads to a concomitant increase in A0 activity. Furthermore, binding of anti-beta monoclonal antibodies to the beta subunit prevents a signal transfer from the Ca2+-saturated delta to the catalytic site of the holoenzyme which inhibits the Ca2+-dependent activities."
https://openalex.org/W1511677402,"The external polysaccharide is a major component of Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell wall and displays distinct composition. The complete structure of the external polysaccharide had been elucidated as a basis for investigation of the cell wall structure-function relation. However, the mode of attachment of the polysaccharide to the peptidoglycan through a phosphodiester was not clear due to limitations in structural and biosynthetic studies. The present study describes purification of a lysozyme-resistant nondialyzable high-molecular-weight fragment of cell wall and identifies the sugar, D-glucose, as the point of external polysaccharide attachment to the peptidoglycan through a phosphate diester. Kinetic studies for the acid-catalyzed release of external polysaccharide from the peptidoglycan were performed in parallel with synthetic [methyl-2-acetamido-3-O-(D-1-carboxyethyl)-2-deoxy-alpha-D- glucopyranoside-6-yl]-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl phosphate and alpha-D-glucopyranosyl phosphate and showed the presence of a phosphodiester linkage between external polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. In addition, type of phosphate residue and cross-linking between muramic acid and protein part have been determined."
https://openalex.org/W2100754267,"The denaturation of horse metmyoglobin by guanidine hydrochloride was studied at pH 6.4 and 25 degrees C. Measurements of both the peptide circular dichroism and the absorbance in the Soret region suggest that the extent of renaturation strongly depends on the time interval during which the protein is exposed to concentrated solutions of the denaturant. From the equilibrium measurements of the absorption in the Soret region, it is concluded that the unfolding of metmyoglobin is complex. This is further supported by kinetic studies of denaturation which suggest the occurrence of the least four species in the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1643391121,"On amino acid analysis of urine of histidinemic patients, an unidentified compound was eluted in a position between beta-aminoisobutyric acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid. This compound was purified to homogeneity from the urine by a combination of extraction with 80% ethanol, repeated column chromatography on Bio-Rad AG-50, and high performance liquid chromatography on a strongly cationic ion exchanger. The compound yielded free histidine on hydrolysis in an evacuated sealed tube with 0.1-6.0 M HCl at 145 degrees C for 5 h, but not at 100 degrees C for 24 h. This compound was determined to be N tau-ribosylhistidine by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. The urinary content of this material in normal and histidinemic children was 17.8 +/- 13.4 (n = 10) and 126 +/- 51 (n = 14) mumol/g creatinine (mean +/- S.D.), respectively, and were closely correlated with those of urinary histidine. The renal clearance value of N tau-ribosylhistidine in humans was 96% of that of creatinine. When rats were fed on diets rich in histidine, the urinary excretion of N tau-ribosylhistidine increased greatly and was well correlated with the intake of histidine."
