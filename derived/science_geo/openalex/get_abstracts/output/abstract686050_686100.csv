https://openalex.org/W3216418284,"Understanding spin-lattice coupling represents a key challenge in modern condensed matter physics, with crucial importance and implications for ultrafast and two-dimensional magnetism. The efficiency of angular momentum and energy transfer between spins and the lattice imposes fundamental speed limits on the ability to control spins in spintronics, magnonics, and magnetic data storage. We report on an efficient nonlinear mechanism of spin-lattice coupling driven by terahertz light pulses. A nearly single-cycle terahertz pulse resonantly interacts with a coherent magnonic state in the antiferromagnet cobalt difluoride (CoF2) and excites the Raman-active terahertz phonon. The results reveal the distinctive functionality of antiferromagnets that allows ultrafast spin-lattice coupling using light."

High primary production of modern oceans is considered a prerequisite for the emergence of cetacean giants, but that condition cannot explain gigantism in Triassic ichthyosaurs. We describe the new giant ichthyosaur Cymbospondylus youngorum sp. nov. with a 2-meter-long skull from the Middle Triassic Fossil Hill Fauna of Nevada, USA, underscoring rapid size evolution despite the absence of many modern primary producers. Surprisingly, the Fossil Hill Fauna rivaled the composition of modern marine mammal faunas in terms of size range, and energy-flux models suggest that Middle Triassic marine food webs were able to support several large-bodied ichthyosaurs at high trophic levels, shortly after ichthyosaur origins."
https://openalex.org/W4200072940,"Because of a possible impact of capsaicin in the high concentrations on enterocyte injury (cytotoxicity) and bactericidal activity on probiotics, Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 (L34) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), the probiotics derived from Thai and Caucasian population, respectively, were tested in the chili-extract administered C57BL/6 mice and in vitro experiments. In comparison with placebo, 2 weeks administration of the extract from Thai chili in mice caused loose feces and induced intestinal permeability defect as indicated by FITC-dextran assay and the reduction in tight junction molecules (occludin and zona occludens-1) using fluorescent staining and gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Additionally, the chili extracts also induced the translocation of gut pathogen molecules; lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and (1→3)-β-d-glucan (BG) and fecal dysbiosis (microbiome analysis), including reduced Firmicutes, increased Bacteroides, and enhanced total Gram-negative bacteria in feces. Both L34 and LGG attenuated gut barrier defect (FITC-dextran, the fluorescent staining and gene expression of tight junction molecules) but not improved fecal consistency. Additionally, high concentrations of capsaicin (0.02-2 mM) damage enterocytes (Caco-2 and HT-29) as indicated by cell viability test, supernatant cytokine (IL-8), transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and transepithelial FITC-dextran (4.4 kDa) but were attenuated by Lactobacillus condition media (LCM) from both probiotic-strains. The 24 h incubation with 2 mM capsaicin (but not the lower concentrations) reduced the abundance of LGG (but not L34) implying a higher capsaicin tolerance of L34. However, Lactobacillus rhamnosus fecal abundance, using qRT-PCR, of L34 or LGG after 3, 7, and 20 days of the administration in the Thai healthy volunteers demonstrated the similarity between both strains. In conclusion, high dose chili extracts impaired gut permeability and induced gut dysbiosis but were attenuated by probiotics. Despite a better capsaicin tolerance of L34 compared with LGG in vitro, L34 abundance in feces was not different to LGG in the healthy volunteers. More studies on probiotics with a higher intake of chili in human are interesting."
https://openalex.org/W3214849032,"Carbon nanotubes have a helical structure wherein the chirality determines whether they are metallic or semiconducting. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we applied heating and mechanical strain to alter the local chirality and thereby control the electronic properties of individual single-wall carbon nanotubes. A transition trend toward a larger chiral angle region was observed and explained in terms of orientation-dependent dislocation formation energy. A controlled metal-to-semiconductor transition was realized to create nanotube transistors with a semiconducting nanotube channel covalently bonded between a metallic nanotube source and drain. Additionally, quantum transport at room temperature was demonstrated for the fabricated nanotube transistors with a channel length as short as 2.8 nanometers."
https://openalex.org/W4225707385,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruptions including to health services. In the early response to the pandemic many countries restricted population movements and some health services were suspended or limited. In late 2020 and early 2021 some countries re-imposed restrictions. Health authorities need to balance the potential harms of additional SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to contacts associated with health services against the benefits of those services, including fewer new HIV infections and deaths. This paper examines these trade-offs for select HIV services.We used four HIV simulation models (Goals, HIV Synthesis, Optima HIV and EMOD) to estimate the benefits of continuing HIV services in terms of fewer new HIV infections and deaths. We used three COVID-19 transmission models (Covasim, Cooper/Smith and a simple contact model) to estimate the additional deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health workers and clients. We examined four HIV services: voluntary medical male circumcision, HIV diagnostic testing, viral load testing and programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission. We compared COVID-19 deaths in 2020 and 2021 with HIV deaths occurring now and over the next 50 years discounted to present value. The models were applied to countries with a range of HIV and COVID-19 epidemics.Maintaining these HIV services could lead to additional COVID-19 deaths of 0.002 to 0.15 per 10,000 clients. HIV-related deaths averted are estimated to be much larger, 19-146 discounted deaths per 10,000 clients.While there is some additional short-term risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with providing HIV services, the risk of additional COVID-19 deaths is at least 100 times less than the HIV deaths averted by those services. Ministries of Health need to take into account many factors in deciding when and how to offer essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work shows that the benefits of continuing key HIV services are far larger than the risks of additional SARS-CoV-2 transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4226330648,"Pen enrichment for broiler chickens is one of the potential strategies to stimulate locomotion and consequently contribute to better leg health and welfare. This study was designed to evaluate effects of using a plethora of pen enrichments (barrier perches, angular ramps, horizontal platforms, large distance between feed and water and providing live Black Soldier fly larvae in a dustbathing area) on tibia characteristics, locomotion, leg health and home pen behaviour of fast and slower-growing broiler chickens. The experiment was set up as a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with a total of 840 male broiler chickens in a complete randomized design (7 pens per treatment and 30 chickens per pen) with the following treatments: 1) pen enrichment (enriched pen or non-enriched pen); 2) broiler strain (fast-growing Ross 308 or slower-growing Hubbard JA 757). Home pen behaviour and use of enrichment were observed. At approximately 1400 and 2200 g body weight, two chickens per pen were randomly selected and slaughtered, to investigate tibia morphological, biophysical and mechanical characteristics and leg health. Pen enrichment positively affected tibia biophysical characteristics, e.g., osseous volume (Δ = 1.8 cm3, P = 0.003), total volume (Δ = 1.4 cm3, P = 0.03) and volume fraction (Δ = 0.02%, P = 0.002), in both fast and slower-growing chickens, suggesting that pen enrichment particularly affects ossification and mineralization mechanisms. Accordingly, locomotion and active behaviours were positively influenced by pen enrichment. However, pen enrichment resulted in lower body weight gain in both strains, which might be due to higher activity or lower feed intake as a result of difficulties of crossing the barrier perches. Regarding the strain, slower-growing chickens showed consistently more advanced tibia characteristics and more active behaviour than fast-growing chickens. It can be concluded that pen enrichment may lead to more activity and better bone development in both fast and slower-growing chickens."
https://openalex.org/W4200000578,"Our knowledge of the recolonization of north-west Europe at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum depends to a large extent on finds from Gough’s Cave (Somerset, UK). Ultra-high resolution radiocarbon determinations suggest that the cave was occupied seasonally by Magdalenian hunters for perhaps no more than two or three human generations, centred on 12,600 BP (~14,950–14,750 cal BP). They left behind a rich and diverse assemblage of Magdalenian lithic and osseous artefacts, butchered animal bones, and cannibalised human remains. The faunal assemblage from Gough’s Cave is one of the most comprehensively studied from any Magdalenian site, yet new and unexpected discoveries continue to be made. Here, we record previously unrecognized flint-knapping tools that were identified during a survey of the Gough’s Cave faunal collection at the Natural History Museum (London). We identified bones used as hammers and teeth manipulated as pressure-flakers to manufacture flint tools. Most of the pieces appear to be ad hoc (single-use?) tools, but a horse molar was almost certainly a curated object that was used over an extended period to work many stone tools. This paper explores how these knapping tools were used to support a more nuanced understanding of Magdalenian stone-tool manufacturing processes. Moreover, we provide a standard for identifying minimally-used knapping tools that will help to establish whether retouchers and other organic stone-working tools are as rare in the Magdalenian archaeological record as current studies suggest."
https://openalex.org/W4200183134,"The system of partial differential equations governing the unsteady hydromagnetic boundary-layer flow along an electrically conducting cone embedded in porous medium in the presence of thermal buoyancy, magnetic field, heat source and sink effects are formulated. These equations are solved numerically by using an implicit Finite-Difference Method. The effects of the various parameters that are source/sink parameter, porous medium parameter, Prandtl number, mixed convection parameter and magnetic Prandtl number on the velocity, temperature profiles, transverse magnetic field are predicted. The effects of heat source and sink parameter on the time-mean value as well as on transient skin friction; heat transfer and current density rate are delineated especially in each plot. The extensive results reveal the existence of periodicity and show that periodicity becomes more distinctive for source and sink in the case of the electrically conducting cone. As the source and sink contrast increases, the periodic convective motion is invigorated to the amplitude and phase angle as reflect in the each plot. The dimensionless forms of the set of partial differential equations is transform into primitive form by using primitive variable formulation and then are solved numerically by using Finite Difference Scheme which has given in literature frequently. Physical interpretations of the overall flow and heat transfer along with current density are highlighted with detail in results and discussion section. The main novelty of the obtained numerical results is that first we retain numerical results for steady part and then used in unsteady part to obtain transient skin friction, rate of heat transfer and current density. The intensity of velocity profile is increased for increasing values of porosity parameter Ω, the temperature and mass concentration intensities are reduced due heat source effects."
https://openalex.org/W4200197455,"Several studies have reported changes in the corpus callosum (CC) in Alzheimer's disease. However, the involved region differed according to the study population and study group. Using deep learning technology, we ensured accurate analysis of the CC in Alzheimer's disease.We used the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset to investigate changes in the CC. The individuals were divided into three groups using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR); 94 normal controls (NC) were not demented (NC group, CDR = 0), 56 individuals had very mild dementia (VMD group, CDR = 0.5), and 17 individuals were defined as having mild and moderate dementia (MD group, CDR = 1 or 2). Deep learning technology using a convolutional neural network organized in a U-net architecture was used to segment the CC in the midsagittal plane. Total CC length and regional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of the CC were made.The total CC length was negatively associated with cognitive function. (beta = -0.139, p = 0.022) Among MRI measurements of the CC, the height of the anterior third (beta = 0.038, p <0.0001) and width of the body (beta = 0.077, p = 0.001) and the height (beta = 0.065, p = 0.001) and area of the splenium (beta = 0.059, p = 0.027) were associated with cognitive function. To distinguish MD from NC and VMD, the receiver operating characteristic analyses of these MRI measurements showed areas under the curves of 0.65-0.74. (total CC length = 0.705, height of the anterior third = 0.735, width of the body = 0.714, height of the splenium = 0.703, area of the splenium = 0.649).Among MRI measurements, total CC length, the height of the anterior third and width of the body, and the height and area of the splenium were associated with cognitive decline. They had fair diagnostic validity in distinguishing MD from NC and VMD."
https://openalex.org/W4200094632,"Fatty acids (FA) in ruminants, especially unsaturated FA (USFA) have important impact in meat quality, nutritional value, and flavour quality of meat, and on consumer's health. Identification of the genetic factors controlling the FA composition and metabolism is pivotal to select sheep that produce higher USFA and lower saturated (SFA) for the benefit of sheep industry and consumers. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the transcriptome profiling in the liver tissues collected from sheep with divergent USFA content in longissimus muscle using RNA deep-sequencing. From sheep (n = 100) population, liver tissues with higher (n = 3) and lower (n = 3) USFA content were analysed using Illumina HiSeq 2500. The total number of reads produced for each liver sample were ranged from 21.28 to 28.51 million with a median of 23.90 million. Approximately, 198 genes were differentially regulated with significance level of p-adjusted value <0.05. Among them, 100 genes were up-regulated, and 98 were down-regulated (p<0.01, FC>1.5) in the higher USFA group. A large proportion of key genes involved in FA biosynthesis, adipogenesis, fat deposition, and lipid metabolism were identified, such as APOA5, SLC25A30, GFPT1, LEPR, TGFBR2, FABP7, GSTCD, and CYP17A. Pathway analysis revealed that glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis- keratan sulfate, adipokine signaling, galactose metabolism, endocrine and other factors-regulating calcium metabolism, mineral metabolism, and PPAR signaling pathway were playing important regulatory roles in FA metabolism. Importantly, polymorphism and association analyses showed that mutation in APOA5, CFHR5, TGFBR2 and LEPR genes could be potential markers for the FA composition in sheep. These polymorphisms and transcriptome networks controlling the FA variation could be used as genetic markers for FA composition-related traits improvement. However, functional validation is required to confirm the effect of these SNPs in other sheep population in order to incorporate them in the sheep breeding program."
https://openalex.org/W4200383610,"Graphic design thinking is a key skill for landscape architects, but little is known about the links between the design process and brain activity. Based on Goel's frontal lobe lateralization hypothesis (FLLH), we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brain activity of 24 designers engaging in four design processes-viewing, copy drawing, preliminary ideas, and refinement-during graphic design thinking. The captured scans produced evidence of dramatic differences between brain activity when copying an existing graphic and when engaging in graphic design thinking. The results confirm that designs involving more graphic design thinking exhibit significantly more activity in the left prefrontal cortex. These findings illuminate the design process and suggest the possibility of developing specific activities or exercises to promote graphic design thinking in landscape architecture."
https://openalex.org/W4200386674,"There is limited information about what influences help-seeking following experience of intimate partner violence (IPV). This study investigated determinants of formal and informal help-seeking by those who had experienced lifetime physical, sexual or psychological IPV.A cross-sectional population-based New Zealand study conducted from 2017 to 2019 recruited 2,887 participants (1,464 women and 1,423 men) aged 16 years and older. Face-to-face interviews were conducted. Of these, 1,373 participants experienced physical, sexual or psychological IPV. Two series of logistic regressions were conducted: 1) comparing those who sought help with those who did not, and 2) comparing those who had not sought help with those who sought informal help only, or with those who also sought formal help.Of the 1,373 participants who reported experience of physical, sexual or psychological IPV 835 participants (71.3% of women and 49.0% of men) sought some form of help. In both genders self-reported physical and mental health or work-related IPV impacts were significantly associated with help-seeking. Experiencing only one form of IPV was associated with lower odds of seeking formal help by women (Adjusted odds ratio = 0.38; 95%CI = 0.15, 0.92 for physical/sexual only and AOR = 0.37, 95%CI = 0.22, 0.64 for psychological only) compared to those experiencing concurrent types of IPV.Although there were gender differences in help-seeking, for both women and men the experience of greater impacts associated with IPV exposure increased the likelihood of help-seeking. Agencies providing services for people who are experiencing IPV need to be equipped to identify and respond to multiple forms of IPV, and prepared to address the suite of impacts experienced."
https://openalex.org/W4200390279,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage degradation. Alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) is associated with inflammatory and metabolic responses in OA. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathological process of OA remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the role and mechanisms of α7nAChR-mediated autophagy and anti-inflammatory response in chondroprotection. Monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced Wistar rat OA model was used to assess the in vivo effects of the ɑ7nAChR agonist (PNU-282987). The histopathological characteristics of OA were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the levels of autophagy markers were determined by western blotting and transmission electron microscopy. The anti-inflammatory effect of the ɑ7nAChR agonist was assessed by IHC, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting. Parallel experiments to determine the molecular mechanisms through which the ɑ7nAChR agonist prevents OA were performed using interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-treated chondrocytes. Our results showed that PNU-282987 reduced cartilage degeneration and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-13 expressions. Activating α7nAChR with PNU-282987 significantly promoted MIA/IL-1β-induced chondrocyte autophagy, as demonstrated by the increase in LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, Beclin-1 levels, and autophagosome number. Furthermore, treating chondrocyte with ULK1 siRNA attenuated the PNU282987-induced enhancement of LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and Beclin-1 level. Additionally, PNU282987 suppressed NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inhibiting the ROS/TXNIP pathway and suppressed tumor necrosis factor-ɑ and IL-1β secretion in MIA/IL-1β-treated chondrocytes. Our results demonstrate that the activation of α7nAChR promotes chondrocyte autophagy and attenuates inflammation to mitigate OA progression, providing a novel target for the treatment of OA."
https://openalex.org/W4200104329,"When harmful bacteria are detected in the final product at a food manufacturing plant, it is necessary to identify and eliminate the source of contamination so that it does not occur again. In the current study, the source of contamination was tracked using core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) analysis in cases where Escherichia coli was detected in the final product at a food manufacturing plant. cgMLST analysis was performed on 40 strains of E. coli collected from the environment [floor (26 strains), drainage ditch (5 strains), container (4 strains), post-heating production line (1 strain)] and products [final product (3 strains) and intermediate product (1 strain)]. In total, 40 E. coli isolates were classified into 17 genogroups by cgMLST analysis. The 4 E. coli strains isolated from the intermediate and final products were classified into two genogroups (I and II). Certain isolates collected from the environment also belonged to those genogroups, it was possible to estimate the transmission of E. coli in the manufacturing plant. Thus, the dynamics of E. coli in the food manufacturing location were clarified by using cgMLST analysis. In conclusion, our results indicate that cgMLST analysis can be effectively used for hygiene management at food manufacturing locations."
https://openalex.org/W4200192226,"Studies have demonstrated students' resistance to active learning, despite evidence illustrating that their learning is improved relative to students in lectures. Specifically, while active learning and group work are effective at engaging students in their learning process, studies report that students' perceptions of active learning approaches are not always positive. What remains underexplored is whether students' perceptions of active learning improve with effective instructor facilitation and whether there exists differential perceptions between racially minoritized students and represented students. Here, we estimate students' perceptions of effective instructor facilitation as the mediator in the relationship between active learning and perceptions of learning and perceived utility for class activities (task value). Then, we examine differences by racial identification. We collected classroom observation data to empirically categorize courses as active learning or lecture-based and surveyed 4,257 college students across 25 STEM classrooms at a research-intensive university. We first examined the relationship between active learning on student perceptions and found a negative relationship between active learning and perceptions of learning and task value for both racially minoritized students and represented students. Next, we assessed whether students' perceptions of instructor effectiveness in facilitating group activities mediate these negative relationships. We found that, on average, students of all races were more likely to positively perceive instructor facilitation in active learning classes relative to lectures. In turn, the positive perceptions of instructor facilitation partially suppressed the negative relationship between active learning and perceptions of learning and task value. These results demonstrate that effective instructor facilitation can influence both students' self-assessment of learning and perceived utility of the learning activities, and underscores the importance of developing pedagogical competence among college instructors."
https://openalex.org/W4200309980,"We propose a new method for the classification task of distinguishing atrial fibrillation (AFib) from regular atrial tachycardias including atrial flutter (AFlu) based on a surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Recently, many approaches for an automatic classification of cardiac arrhythmia were proposed and to our knowledge none of them can distinguish between these two. We discuss reasons why deep learning may not yield satisfactory results for this task. We generate new and clinically interpretable features using mathematical optimization for subsequent use within a machine learning (ML) model. These features are generated from the same input data by solving an additional regression problem with complicated combinatorial substructures. The resultant can be seen as a novel machine learning model that incorporates expert knowledge on the pathophysiology of atrial flutter. Our approach achieves an unprecedented accuracy of 82.84% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.9, which classifies as “excellent” according to the classification indicator of diagnostic tests. One additional advantage of our approach is the inherent interpretability of the classification results. Our features give insight into a possibly occurring multilevel atrioventricular blocking mechanism, which may improve treatment decisions beyond the classification itself. Our research ideally complements existing textbook cardiac arrhythmia classification methods, which cannot provide a classification for the important case of AFib↔AFlu. The main contribution is the successful use of a novel mathematical model for multilevel atrioventricular block and optimization-driven inverse simulation to enhance machine learning for classification of the arguably most difficult cases in cardiac arrhythmia. A tailored Branch-and-Bound algorithm was implemented for the domain knowledge part, while standard algorithms such as Adam could be used for training."
https://openalex.org/W4200447065,"The research describes the recognition and classification of the acoustic characteristics of amphibians using deep learning of deep neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for biological applications. First, original data is collected from 32 species of frogs and 3 species of toads commonly found in Taiwan. Secondly, two digital filtering algorithms, linear predictive coding (LPC) and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC), are respectively used to collect amphibian bioacoustic features and construct the datasets. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is applied to achieve dimensional reduction of the training model datasets. Next, the classification of amphibian bioacoustic features is accomplished through the use of DNN and LSTM. The Pytorch platform with a GPU processor (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti) realizes the calculation and recognition of the acoustic feature classification results. Based on above-mentioned two algorithms, the sound feature datasets are classified and effectively summarized in several classification result tables and graphs for presentation. The results of the classification experiment of the different features of bioacoustics are verified and discussed in detail. This research seeks to extract the optimal combination of the best recognition and classification algorithms in all experimental processes."
https://openalex.org/W4200507742,"During pregnancy in placental mammals, small numbers of maternal cells (maternal microchimeric cells, or MMc cells) migrate into the fetus and persist decades, or perhaps for the rest of their lives, and higher frequencies of MMc cells are reported to correlate with variety of phenomena, such as immune tolerance, tissue repair, and autoimmune diseases. While detection of these MMc cells is considered in all pregnancies, their frequency differs largely according to tissue type and disease cases, and it remains unclear whether the number of MMc cells differs significantly among embryos in normal pregnancies. Here, for the first time, we developed a whole embryonic detection method for MMc cells using transgenic mice and counted live MMc cells in each individual embryo. Using this technique, we found that the number of MMc cells was comparable in most of the analyzed embryos; however, around 500 times higher number of MMc cells was detected in one embryo at the latest stage. This result suggests that the number of MMc cells could largely differ in rare cases with unknown underlying mechanisms. Our methodology provides a basis for testing differences in the numbers of MMc cells among individual embryos and for analyzing differences in MMc cell type repertoires in future studies. These data could provide a hint toward understanding the mechanisms underlying the variety of apparently inconsistent MMc-related phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W4207050208,"The shape of phylogenetic trees can be used to gain evolutionary insights. A tree’s shape specifies the connectivity of a tree, while its branch lengths reflect either the time or genetic distance between branching events; well-known measures of tree shape include the Colless and Sackin imbalance, which describe the asymmetry of a tree. In other contexts, network science has become an important paradigm for describing structural features of networks and using them to understand complex systems, ranging from protein interactions to social systems. Network science is thus a potential source of many novel ways to characterize tree shape, as trees are also networks. Here, we tailor tools from network science, including diameter, average path length, and betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality, to summarize phylogenetic tree shapes. We thereby propose tree shape summaries that are complementary to both asymmetry and the frequencies of small configurations. These new statistics can be computed in linear time and scale well to describe the shapes of large trees. We apply these statistics, alongside some conventional tree statistics, to phylogenetic trees from three very different viruses (HIV, dengue fever and measles), from the same virus in different epidemiological scenarios (influenza A and HIV) and from simulation models known to produce trees with different shapes. Using mutual information and supervised learning algorithms, we find that the statistics adapted from network science perform as well as or better than conventional statistics. We describe their distributions and prove some basic results about their extreme values in a tree. We conclude that network science-based tree shape summaries are a promising addition to the toolkit of tree shape features. All our shape summaries, as well as functions to select the most discriminating ones for two sets of trees, are freely available as an R package at http://github.com/Leonardini/treeCentrality ."
https://openalex.org/W4200110888,"Mulberry (Morus alba L.), and above all the extract from the leaves of this plant, is a natural medicine that has been used in traditional medicine for hundreds of years. Mulberry leaves contains polyphenol compounds: flavonoids, coumarins, numerous phenolic acids, as well as terpenes and steroids. The antioxidant effect of these compounds may be beneficial to the fat fraction of meat products, thereby increasing their functional qualities. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of mulberry water leaf extract, as an additive limiting adverse fat changes and affecting the functionality in model liver pâtés. Pork pâtés were prepared by replacing 20% of animal fat with rapeseed oil (RO), and water extract of mulberry leaves was added in the proportion of 0.2%, 0.6% and 1.0%. It has been shown that the addition of mulberry leaf extract delayed the appearance of primary and secondary fat oxidation products. The most effective antioxidant effect during 15-day storage was observed in the sample with the addition of 0.6% and 1.0% water mulberry leaf extract. These samples also showed inhibiting activity against angiotensin-converting enzymes and cholinesterase's. During storage, the tested pâtés had a high sensory quality with unchanged microbiological quality. Mulberry leaf extract can be an interesting addition to the production of fat meat products, delaying adverse changes in the lipid fraction and increasing the functionality of products."
https://openalex.org/W4200185632,"Data from the 2016-17 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey from Nigeria are used to study the relationship between child stature, mother's years of education, and indicators of early childhood development (ECD). The relationships are contrasted between two empirical approaches: the conventional approach whereby control variables are selected in an ad-hoc manner, and the double machine-learning (DML) approach that employs data-driven methods to select controls from a much wider set of variables and thus reducing potential omitted variable bias. Overall, the analysis confirms that maternal education and the incidence of chronic malnutrition have a significant direct effect on measures of early childhood development. The point estimates based on the ad-hoc specification tend to be larger in absolute value than those based on the DML specification. Frequently, the point estimates based on the ad-hoc specification fall inside the confidence interval of the DML point estimates, suggesting that in these cases the omitted variable bias is not serious enough to prevent making causal inferences based on the ad-hoc specification. However, there are instances where the omitted variable bias is sufficiently large for the ad hoc specification to yield a statistically significant relationship when in fact the more robust DML specification suggests there is none. The DML approach also reveals a more complex picture that highlights the role of context. In rural areas, mother's education affects early childhood development both directly and indirectly through its impact on the nutritional status of both older and younger children. In contrast, in urban areas, where the average level of maternal education is much higher, increases in a mother's education have only a direct effect on child ECD measures but no indirect effect through child nutrition. Thus, DML provides a practical and feasible approach to reducing threats to internal validity for robust inferences and policy design based on observational data."

https://openalex.org/W4200272816,"This study aimed to clarify the etiologic factors predicting acute ocular progression in SJS/TEN, and identify patients who require immediate and intensive ophthalmological treatment. We previously conducted two Japanese Surveys of SJS/TEN (i.e., cases arising between 2005-2007 and between 2008-2010), and obtained the medical records, including detailed dermatological and ophthalmological findings, of 230 patients. Acute ocular severity was evaluated as none, mild, severe, and very severe. A multi-state model assuming the Markov process based on the Cox proportional hazards model was used to elucidate the specific factors affecting the acute ocular progression. Our findings revealed that of the total 230 patients, 23 (24%) of 97 cases that were mild at initial presentation worsened to severe/very severe. Acute ocular progression developed within 3 weeks from disease onset. Exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and younger patient age were found to be statistically significant for the progression of ocular severity from mild to severe/very severe [hazard ratio (HR) 3.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 9.91] and none to severe/very severe [HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99], respectively. The acute ocular severity score at worst-condition was found to be significantly correlated with ocular sequelae. Thus, our detailed findings on acute ocular progression revealed that in 24% of SJS/TEN cases with ocular involvement, ocular severity progresses even after initiating intensive treatment, and that in younger-age patients with a history of exposure to NSAIDs, very strict attention must be given to their ophthalmological appearances."
https://openalex.org/W4200309892,"Self-focus is a type of cognitive processing that maintains negative emotions. Moreover, bodily feedback is also essential for maintaining emotions. This study investigated the effect of interactions between self-focused attention and facial expressions on emotions. The results indicated that control facial expression manipulation after self-focus reduced happiness scores. On the contrary, the smiling facial expression manipulation after self-focus increased happiness scores marginally. However, facial expressions did not affect positive emotions after the other-focus manipulation. These findings suggest that self-focus plays a pivotal role in facial expressions' effect on positive emotions. However, self-focusing is insufficient for decreasing positive emotions, and the interaction between self-focus and facial expressions is crucial for developing positive emotions."
https://openalex.org/W4200335093,"Patients with pacemakers need regular follow-ups which are demanding. Telemonitoring for pacemaker can provide a new opportunity to avoid follow-up visits. On the other hand, in-person visits could help patients with pacemakers to cope better with the anxiety linked to their condition and maintain better communication with their doctors than simple remote control of their device status. Therefore, our objective was to analyze the experiences and communication comparing telemonitoring (TM) versus conventional monitoring (CM) of patients with pacemakers. A single-center, controlled, non-randomized, non-blinded clinical trial was designed. Data were collected five years after implantation in a cohort of 89 consecutive patients assigned to two different groups: TM and CM. The 'Generic Short Patient Experiences Questionnaire' (GS-PEQ) was used to assess patients' experiences, and the Healthcare Communication Questionnaire (HCCQ) was used to measure the communication of patients with healthcare professionals. Additionally, an ad-hoc survey including items from the 'Telehealth Patient Satisfaction Survey' and a 'costs survey' was used. After five years, 55 patients completed the study (TM = 21; CM = 34). Participants' mean (±SD) age was 81 (±6.47), and 31% were females. No differences in baseline characteristics between groups were found. The comparative analyses TM versus CM showed some significant differences. According to GS-PEQ, TM users received adequate information about their diagnosis or afflictions (p = .035) and the treatment was better adapted to their situation (p = .009). Both groups reported negative experiences regarding their involvement in their treatment decisions, the waiting time before admission, and perceived a low-benefit. According to HCCQ, the TM group experienced poorer consultation management by the healthcare provider (p = .041). Participants reported positive overall communication experiences. The study provides insights into the experiences and communication in PM monitoring services as well as specific areas where users reported negative experiences such as the consultation management by clinicians.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and physical performance among community-dwelling middle-aged and old Japanese men and women.The subjects were community-dwelling 297 men and 415 women aged 50 years and over. Data on height (m) and weight (kg) were collected. Serum 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone, calcium, and albumin levels were measured. Serum 25(OH)D was classified into deficiency group: < 20 ng/mL, insufficiency group: 20-30 ng/mL, and sufficiency group: ≧ 30 ng/mL. Physical performance was assessed by grip strength, chair stand time, and functional reach. Information on current smoking, alcohol drinking, regular exercise, any comorbidities (hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, lung disease, and stroke), and pain (lumbar and knee) was collected.Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency based on serum 25(OH)D levels were observed in 15.2% and 56.9% of men and 52.0% and 43.6% of women, respectively. In men, higher serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with better grip strength (p for trend = 0.003), chair stand time (p for trend = 0.042), and functional reach (p for trend <0.001). On the other hand, these parameters were not associated with serum 25(OH)D levels in women.A higher level of serum 25(OH)D was associated with better physical performance in men but not in women."
https://openalex.org/W4200466267,"The objective of this study was to determine the associations between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and early childhood cardiometabolic risk factors in the offspring. Therefore, 7794 women from the Generation Rotterdam Study were included, an ongoing population-based prospective birth cohort. Women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy were classified as such when they were affected by pregnancy induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia or the haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome during pregnancy. Early childhood cardiometabolic risk factors were defined as the body mass index at the age of 2, 6, 12, 36 months and 6 years. Additionally, it included systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total fat mass, cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin and clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors at 6 years of age. Sex-specific differences in the associations between hypertensive disorders and early childhood cardiometabolic risk factors were investigated. Maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were inversely associated with childhood body mass index at 12 months (confounder model: -0.15 SD, 95% CI -0.27; -0.03) and childhood triglyceride at 6 years of age (confounder model: -0.28 SD, 95% CI -0.45; -0.10). For the association with triglycerides, this was only present in girls. Maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were not associated with childhood body mass index at 2, 6 and 36 months. No associations were observed between maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, fat mass index and cholesterol levels at 6 years of age. Our findings do not support an independent and consistent association between maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and early childhood cardiometabolic risk factors in their offspring. However, this does not rule out possible longer term effects of maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy on offspring cardiometabolic health."
https://openalex.org/W4200568758,"Bio-logging is a common method to collect ecological data on wild animals, but might also induce stress, reduce body condition, and alter behavior. Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) are a semi-aquatic and nocturnal species that are challenging to observe in the wild. Bio-loggers are hence useful tools to study their behaviour and movements, but this raises concerns of potential negative impacts of tagging. To investigate the potential negative impacts of glue-on tags, we compared body weight change for tagged and untagged Eurasian beavers. We hypothesized that tagged beavers would gain less body weight compared to untagged beavers, and that weight change might be affected by tagging length, tag weight, water temperature and the season of tagging. Daily percentage body weight change in relation to initial body weight during the first capture was compared during 57 tagging periods (18±7 days) and 32 controls periods (64±47 days). Body weight change varied between the two groups, with untagged beavers on average gaining daily weight whilst tagged beavers on average lost weight daily, indicating a negative effect of tagging. The average reduction in percentage body weight change per day for tagged beavers was small (0.1 ± 0.3%), and with large individual variation. Neither tag weight, number of tagging days, nor season were important in explaining body weight change of tagged animals. In other words, we found that tagging reduced daily body weight during the tagging period but were unable to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for this decline. Detrimental effects of tagging have important implications for animal welfare and can introduce bias in data that are collected. This calls for careful consideration in the use of tags. We conclude that studies investigating the effects of tagging should consider individual variation in the effects of tagging and, where possible, compare tagged animals with a control group."
https://openalex.org/W4200176165,"MicroRNAs have been proposed as biomarkers for equine sarcoids, the most prevalent equine skin tumors globally. This study served to validate the diagnostic and prognostic potential of whole blood microRNAs identified in a previous study for long-term equine sarcoid diagnosis and outcome prediction. Based on findings of a clinical examination at the age of 3 years and a follow-up following a further 5–12 years, 32 Franches-Montagnes and 45 Swiss Warmblood horses were assigned to four groups: horses with regression (n = 19), progression (n = 9), new occurrences of sarcoid lesions (n = 19) and tumor-free control horses (n = 30). The expression levels for eight microRNAs (eca-miR-127, eca-miR-432, eca-miR-24, eca-miR-125a-5p, eca-miR-134, eca-miR-379, eca-miR-381, eca-miR-382) were analyzed through reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction in whole blood samples collected on initial examination. Associations of sex, breed, diagnosis, and prognosis with microRNA expression levels were examined using multivariable analysis of variance. Sex and breed influenced the expression level of five and two microRNAs, respectively. Eca-miR-127 allowed discrimination between sarcoid-affected and tumor-free horses. No variation in microRNA expression was found when comparing horses with sarcoid regression and progression. Expression levels of eca-miR-125a-5p and eca-miR-432 varied in male horses that developed sarcoids throughout the study period in comparison to male control horses. While none of the investigated miRNAs was validated for predicting the prognosis of sarcoid regression / progression within young horses with this condition, two miRNAs demonstrated potential to predict if young male (though not female) tumor-free horse can develop sarcoids within the following years. Sex- and breed- biased miRNAs exist within the equine species and have an impact on biomarker discovery."
https://openalex.org/W4200182626,"Laboratory animals frequently undergo routine experimental procedures such as handling, restraining and injections. However, as a known source of stress, these procedures potentially impact study outcome and data quality. In the present study, we, therefore, performed an evidence-based severity assessment of experimental procedures used in a pancreatic cancer model including surgical tumour induction and subsequent chemotherapeutic treatment via repeated intraperitoneal injections. Cancer cell injection into the pancreas was performed during a laparotomy under general anaesthesia. After a four-day recovery phase, mice received either drug treatment (galloflavin and metformin) or the respective vehicle substances via daily intraperitoneal injections. In addition to clinical scoring, an automated home-cage monitoring system was used to assess voluntary wheel running (VWR) behaviour as an indicator of impaired well-being. After surgery, slightly elevated clinical scores and minimal body weight reductions, but significantly decreased VWR behaviour were observed. During therapy, body weight declined in response to chemotherapy, but not after vehicle substance injection, while VWR activity was decreased in both cases. VWR behaviour differed between treatment groups and revealed altered nightly activity patterns. In summary, by monitoring VWR a high impact of repeated injections on the well-being of mice was revealed and substance effects on well-being were distinguishable. However, no differences in tumour growth between treatment groups were observed. This might be due to the severity of the procedures uncovered in this study, as exaggerated stress responses are potentially confounding factors in preclinical studies. Finally, VWR was a more sensitive indicator of impairment than clinical scoring in this model."

This paper takes the innovation ecosystem as the boundary of the research paradigm. Based on innovation ecosystem theory, knowledge management theory and enterprise innovation theory, this paper constructs a moderated mediation model of the enterprise knowledge search, knowledge integration and breakthrough innovation under the characteristics of innovation ecosystem network. This model is tested on the survey data of 344 technology enterprise and manufacturing industries including R&D departments in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The research results show that: knowledge integration plays part of the intermediary role between knowledge search and enterprise breakthrough innovation; the larger the network scale, the stronger the network connection, the stronger the intermediary role of knowledge integration on the relationship between knowledge search and enterprise breakthrough innovation. The research results reveal the important role of the innovation ecosystem in enterprise breakthrough innovation. At the same time, the research on knowledge search and enterprise breakthrough innovation should consider the network characteristics of innovation ecosystem and the ability of enterprise knowledge integration."
https://openalex.org/W4200477864,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a sequential feeding program (SEQ) with diets varying in amino acid (AA) concentrations in the first and last 12 h of the day on the performance, body composition, and nutrient balance of growing-finishing pigs. Sixty-eight castrated male pigs were distributed in four treatments: a daily feeding program (DP) and three SEQs. In the DP, dietary requirements of AA were adjusted daily. In the SEQ, dietary daily requirements of AA were adjusted every 12 h, providing a low AA concentration in period 1 (P1; 00:00-11:59 h) and a high AA concentration in period 2 (P2; 12:00-23:59 h). In the SEQ, three different levels of low and high AA concentrations were evaluated: ±20%, ±30%, and ±40%. The experiment lasted 82 days and was divided into phase 1 (25-50 kg body weight; BW), phase 2 (50-70 kg BW), and phase 3 (70-100 kg BW). During phase 1, irrespective of dietary AA concentration, SEQ pigs had higher lysine intake, protein gain, and phosphorus efficiency than DP pigs (P ≤ 0.05). Pigs in the SEQ showed a tendency for greater average daily gain, body protein, and body lipids compared to the DP pigs (P ≤ 0.10). During phase 2, SEQ pigs showed a tendency for higher average feed intake in P2 compared to DP pigs (P = 0.07); consequently, average daily gain, body protein, and phosphorus retention tended to increase (P ≤ 0.10). During phase 3, SEQ pigs had a higher average feed intake in P2 than DP pigs (P = 0.03). However, they had a similar body composition (P > 0.05) and a tendency for higher nitrogen excretion (P = 0.06) than DP pigs. Our results suggest that SEQ is an effective approach for improving the performance and body composition of growing pigs."
https://openalex.org/W4200481232,"Conventional in vitro culture and manipulation of mouse embryos require a CO2 incubator, which not only increases the cost of performing experiments but also hampers the transport of embryos to the other laboratories. In this study, we established and tested a new CO2 incubator-free embryo culture system and transported embryos using this system. Using an Anaero pouch, which is a CO2 gas-generating agent, to increase the CO2 partial pressure of CZB medium to 4%-5%, 2-cell embryos were cultured to the blastocyst stage in a sealed tube without a CO2 incubator at 37°C. Further, the developmental rate to blastocyst and full-term development after embryo transfer were comparable with those of usual culture method using a CO2 incubator (blastocyst rate: 97% versus 95%, respectively; offspring rate: 30% versus 35%, respectively). Furthermore, using a thermal bottle, embryos were reliably cultured using this system for up to 2 days at room temperature, and live offspring were obtained from embryos transported in this simple and very low-cost manner without reducing the offspring rate (thermal bottle: 26.2% versus CO2 incubator: 34.3%). This study demonstrates that CO2 incubators are not essential for embryo culture and transportation and that this system provides a useful, low-cost alternative for mouse embryo culture and manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W4200527122,"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the most secured ciphertext algorithm that is unbreakable in a software platform’s reasonable time. AES has been proved to be the most robust symmetric encryption algorithm declared by the USA Government. Its hardware implementation offers much higher speed and physical security than that of its software implementation. The testability and hardware Trojans are two significant concerns that make the AES chip complex and vulnerable. The problem of testability in the complex AES chip is not addressed yet, and also, the hardware Trojan insertion into the chip may be a significant security threat by leaking information to the intruder. The proposed method is a dual-mode self-test architecture that can detect the hardware Trojans at the manufacturing test and perform an online parametric test to identify parametric chip defects. This work contributes to partitioning the AES circuit into small blocks and comparing adjacent blocks to ensure self-referencing. The detection accuracy is sharpened by a comparative power ratio threshold, determined by process variations and the accuracy of the built-in current sensors. This architecture can reduce the delay, power consumption, and area overhead compared to other works."
https://openalex.org/W4200560044,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is considered a public health problem due to its rapid spread and high morbidity. In 2016-2017 an outbreak of CHIKV was occurred in Pakistan but the data regarding the genomic diversity of CHIKV was not reported. Hence, the current study aimed to determine the genetic diversity of CHIKVs in Pakistan. A cross sectional study was carried out using sera of infected CHIKV patients (n = 1549) during the outbreak in Pakistan (2016-2018). Nucleotide sequencing of non-structural genes of CHIKV from eight isolates were performed followed by phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian method. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the Pakistani CHIKV strains belonged to Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL) of genotype ECSA and C1.3a clade. Furthermore, the Pakistani isolates showed several key mutations (nsP2-H130Y, nsP2-E145D, nsP4-S55N and nsP4- R85G) corresponding to mutations reported in 2016 Indian strains of CHIKV. The molecular analysis revealed high evolutionary potential of CHIKV strains as well as better understanding of enhanced virulence and pathogenesis of this outbreak. The study highlights the need to continue surveillance in order to understand viral diversity over time and to devise preventive measures to limit diseases transmission in the region."

Different brands of COVID-19 vaccines have different protocols. It is important that the knowledge and skills of the vaccination staff at AVCs should be accurate. To assess this, a cross-sectional study was conducted in all 15 AVCs at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's provincial capital in May 2021, using the simulated client approach. Structured open-ended and simulated scenario-based questions were used to collect data from the vaccination staff of AVCs. This study showed that 53.3% of the AVCs had at most three out of four brands of COVID-19 vaccines. 60% of the AVCs did not have the mechanism to track client's vaccine first dose, date, and brand. Only 66.7% of the AVCs had a complete knowledge of all the available vaccines. 86.7% and 80% of the AVCs knew the correct duration and administration of the same brand of COVID-19 vaccine's second dose respectively. At the client's end, 6.7% were aware about the brand of administered COVID-19 vaccine. 46.7% were advised about the date of the second shot of vaccination. Only 13.3% of the clients were informed about the procedure of getting an official vaccination certificate. It was concluded that the knowledge and skill of the vaccination staff at AVCs is inadequate. Every vaccine has a different protocol in terms of number of doses and duration. AVCs must have a tracking system to inoculate the second dose with the same brand as the first dose. There is a need for rigorous monitoring and training of the COVID-19 vaccination staff on various protocols of vaccine to prevent losing public's trust."
https://openalex.org/W4200344935,"There has been resistance to COVID-19 public health restrictions partly due to changes and reductions in work, resulting in financial stress. Psychological reactance theory posits that such restrictions to personal freedoms result in anger, defiance, and motivation to restore freedom. In an online study (N = 301), we manipulated the target of COVID-19 restrictions as impacting self or community. We hypothesized that (a) greater pandemic-related financial stress would predict greater reactance, (b) the self-focused restriction condition would elicit greater reactance than the community-focused restriction condition, (c) reactance would be greatest for financially-stressed individuals in the self-focused condition, and (d) greater reactance would predict lower adherence to social distancing guidelines. Independent of political orientation and sense of community, greater financial stress predicted greater reactance only in the self-focused condition; the community-focused condition attenuated this association. Additionally, greater reactance was associated with lower social distancing behavior. These findings suggest that economic hardship exacerbates negative responses to continued personal freedom loss. Community-focused COVID-19 health messaging may be better received during continued pandemic conditions."

https://openalex.org/W4200548478,"New Zealand farm working dogs are supreme athletes that are crucial to agriculture in the region. The effects that low or high dietary carbohydrate (CHO) content might have on their interstitial glucose (IG) and activity during work are unknown. The goals of the study were to determine if the concentration of IG and delta-g (a measurement of activity) will be lower in dogs fed an ultra-low CHO high fat diet in comparison to dogs fed a high CHO low fat diet, and to determine if low concentrations of IG are followed by reduced physical activity. We hypothesized that feeding working farm dogs an ultra-low CHO diet would reduce their IG concentrations which in turn would reduce physical activity during work. We prospectively recruited 22 farm dogs from four farms. At each farm, dogs were randomized to one of two diets and had a month of dietary acclimation to their allocated diet. The macronutrient proportions as a percentage of metabolizable energy (%ME) for the high CHO low fat diet (Diet 1) were 23% protein, 25% fat, and 52% CHO, and for the ultra-low CHO high fat diet (Diet 2) 37% protein, 63% fat, and 1% CHO. Following the acclimation period, we continuously monitored IG concentrations with flash glucose monitoring devices, and delta-g using triaxial accelerometers for 96 h. Dogs fed Diet 2 had a lower area under the curve (±SE) for IG (AUC Diet 2 = 497 ± 4 mmol/L/96h, AUC Diet 1 = 590 ± 3 mmol/L/96h; P = 0.002) but a higher area under the curve (±SE) for delta-g (AUC Diet 2 = 104,122 ± 6,045 delta-g/96h, AUC Diet 1 = 80,904 ± 4,950 delta-g/96h; P< 0.001). Interstitial glucose concentrations increased as the activity level increased (P < 0.001) and were lower for Diet 2 within each activity level (P < 0.001). The overall incidence of low IG readings (< 3.5 mmol/L) was 119/3810 (3.12%), of which 110 (92.4%) readings occurred in the Diet 2 group (P = 0.001). In the Diet 2 group, 99/110 (90%) of the low IG events occurred during the resting period (19:00-06:00). We conclude that feeding Diet 2 (ultra-low CHO high fat diet) to working farm dogs was associated with increased delta-g despite decreased IG concentrations. Interstitial glucose concentrations were positively associated with dogs' activity levels independent of diet. Lastly, events of low IG occurred at a low incidence and were predominantly seen between 19:00-06:00 in dogs fed the ultra-low CHO high fat diet."

We further explored the costs and QALYs of different initial screening ages and different screening intervals. Cost and utility data were obtained by primary data collection in Vietnam. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated from societal and payer perspectives, while uncertainty analysis was performed to explore parameter uncertainties.Annual T2DM screening at either CHS or DHC was cost-effective in Vietnam, from both societal and payer perspectives. Annual screening at CHS was found as the best screening strategy in terms of value for money. From a societal perspective, annual screening at CHS from initial age of 40 years was associated with 0.40 QALYs gained while saving US$ 186.21. Meanwhile, one-off screening was not cost-effective when screening for people younger than 35 years old at both CHS and DHC.T2DM screening should be included in the Vietnamese health benefits package, and annual screening at either CHS or DHC is recommended."

We analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of 145 cases diagnosed as drowning, in which hemorrhage, not due to trauma, was found in the respiratory muscles and accessory respiratory muscles. Hemorrhage was observed in 31.7% of these cases, and the incidence did not differ by gender or drowning location. The frequency of hemorrhage was significantly higher in months with a mean temperature below 20°C than in months above 20°C, suggesting a relationship between the occurrence of hemorrhage and low environmental temperature. Moreover, the frequency of hemorrhage was significantly higher in the elderly (aged ≥65 years) compared to those <65 years old. In the elderly, the weakening of muscles due to aging may contribute to the susceptibility for intramuscular hemorrhage. Moreover, these intramuscular hemorrhages do not need to be considered in cases of a potential bleeding tendency due to disease such as cirrhosis or medication such as anticoagulants. Our results indicate that intramuscular hemorrhage in respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles can serve as an additional criterion to differentiate between fatal drowning and other causes of death, as long as no cutaneous or subcutaneous hematomas above the muscles with hemorrhages are observed. In addition, the epidemiological features that such intramuscular hemorrhage is more common in cold environments and in the elderly may provide useful information for the differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4200613828,"Women living with HIV (WLWH) experience psychosocial stress related to social-structural vulnerabilities. To investigate neuroendocrine pathways linking stress and increased cardiovascular disease risk among WLWH, we evaluated associations between psychosocial stress (i.e., perceived stress, posttraumatic stress, and experiences of race- and gender-based harassment) and a composite neuroendocrine biomarker index among WLWH and women without HIV.In 2019-2020, Women's Interagency HIV Study participants in Washington, DC completed a questionnaire and provided blood and 12-hour overnight urine samples for testing of serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and urinary free cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Psychosocial stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale, PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, and Racialized Sexual Harassment Scale. Latent profile analysis was used to classify participants into low (38%), moderate (44%), and high (18%) stress groups. Composite biomarker index scores between 0-4 were assigned based on participants' number of neuroendocrine biomarkers in high-risk quartiles (≥75th percentile for cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine and ≤25th percentile for DHEA-S). We evaluated associations between latent profile and composite biomarker index values using multivariable linear regression, adjusting for socio-demographic, behavioral, metabolic, and HIV-related factors.Among 90 women, 62% were WLWH, 53% were non-Hispanic Black, and median age was 55 years. In full multivariable models, there was no statistically significant association between psychosocial stress and composite biomarker index values among all women independent of HIV status. High (vs. low) psychosocial stress was positively associated with higher mean composite biomarker index values among all monoracial Black women (adjusted β = 1.32; 95% CI: 0.20-2.43), Black WLWH (adjusted β = 1.93; 95% CI: 0.02-3.83) and Black HIV-negative women (adjusted β = 2.54; 95% CI: 0.41-4.67).Despite a null association in the overall sample, greater psychosocial stress was positively associated with higher neuroendocrine biomarker concentrations among Black women, highlighting a plausible mechanism by which psychosocial stress could contribute to cardiovascular disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W4200620557,"Patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) are considered to be at increased risk for mortality when acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequently developing Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals are regarded as sites with increased risk of infection. Therefore, patient contacts are often limited to urgent indications, which could negatively affect disease monitoring. However, data regarding actual infection rates in cirrhotic patients is limited. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the incidence of COVID-19 in patients with LC with/without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with physical presentation at our University Medical Center.Patients were enrolled between 1st April and 30th June 2020 at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. Symptoms of upper airway infection at baseline and presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG/IgM/IgA) were assessed at baseline and follow-up (FU) using an Electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Elecsys). FU visits, including liver function test, clinical assessment and symptom questionnaire, were conducted after 6-8 weeks (FU-1) and 6 months (FU-2). Prior to inclusion of the first patient, obligatory face masks and personal distance were implemented as protective measures.A total of 150 patients were enrolled, 23% (n = 35) also had diagnosis of HCC (median age: 64 years, range: 19-86), 69% were male. Liver function according to Child-Pugh score (CPS) was: CPS A: 46% (n = 62); CPS B: 37% (n = 50); CPS C: 17% (n = 23). Clinical symptoms indicating upper airway infection were present in 53% (n = 77): shortness of breath (n = 40) and coughing (n = 28) were the most frequent. For the 150 patients enrolled, 284 outpatient visits were registered and 33 patients were admitted to the University Medical Center during the follow-up period. After a median of 52 days, n = 110 patients completed FU-1 and n = 72 completed FU-2 after a median of 6.1 months. Only in one patient, an 80-year-old man with stable liver function (CPS A) and advanced HCC, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected at baseline and FU-1, while antibody testing was negative in the remaining patients at baseline, FU-1 and FU-2.The incidence of COVID-19 at our tertiary medical center during the pandemic was low in LC and HCC patients, when simple protective measures were implemented. Therefore, a routine care for patients with chronic liver diseases does not increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and should be maintained with protective measures."
https://openalex.org/W4200275327,"In this paper, we introduce the concept of learning to sense, which aims to emulate a complex characteristic of human reasoning: the ability to monitor and understand a set of interdependent events for decision-making processes. Event datasets are composed of textual data and spatio-temporal features that determine where and when a given phenomenon occurred. In learning to sense, related events are mapped closely to each other in a semantic vector space, thereby identifying that they contain similar contextual meaning. However, learning a semantic vector space that satisfies both textual similarities and spatio-temporal constraints is a crucial challenge for event analysis and sensing. This paper investigates a Semantic Variational Autoencoder (SVAE) to fine-tune pre-trained embeddings according to both textual and spatio-temporal events of the class of interest. Experiments involving more than one hundred sensors show that our SVAE outperforms a competitive one-class classification baseline. Moreover, our proposal provides desirable learning requirements to sense scenarios, such as visualization of the sensor decision function and heat maps with the sensor’s geographic impact."
https://openalex.org/W4200358460,"The CIrCLE of Life Initiative was implemented to 537 grade 6 learners and their parents, in five Government-run South African primary schools. The transdisciplinary intervention was intended to increase knowledge and skills on HIV and obesity. The study aim was to assess and report on the implementation process.Data was collected on an adapted Proctor's taxonomy of implementation outcomes, and to assess participants' experiences. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through educator logbooks, researcher observations, and learner-parent workbooks.Differentiations between the various school contexts were observed. The process evaluation revealed high learner penetration (97.2%), but lower learner and parent exposure (44.3% and 55.5%, respectively). All educators thought that the intervention was a fit for both rural and urban schools, different socio-economic groups, and people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The intervention was perceived to be sustainable, and there were recommendations for adoption into the school curriculum and scale-up if found to be effective.The process evaluation facilitated the assessment of the implementation outcomes, described its processes, and acknowledged fundamental characteristics that could justify variability in the intervention impact and outcomes. The value of process evaluations and their benefit to the science of implementation were demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W4200408609,"Loudness judgments of sounds varying in level across time show a non-uniform temporal weighting, with increased weights assigned to the beginning of the sound (primacy effect). In addition, higher weights are observed for temporal components that are higher in level than the remaining components (loudness dominance). In three experiments, sounds consisting of 100- or 475-ms Gaussian wideband noise segments with random level variations were presented and either none, the first, or a central temporal segment was amplified or attenuated. In Experiment 1, the sounds consisted of four 100-ms segments that were separated by 500-ms gaps. Previous experiments did not show a primacy effect in such a condition. In Experiment 2, four- or ten-100-ms-segment sounds without gaps between the segments were presented to examine the interaction between the primacy effect and level dominance. As expected, for the sounds with segments separated by gaps, no primacy effect was observed, but weights on amplified segments were increased and weights on attenuated segments were decreased. For the sounds with contiguous segments, a primacy effect as well as effects of relative level (similar to those in Experiment 1) were found. For attenuation, the data indicated no substantial interaction between the primacy effect and loudness dominance, whereas for amplification an interaction was present. In Experiment 3, sounds consisting of either four contiguous 100-ms or 475-ms segments, or four 100-ms segments separated by 500-ms gaps were presented. Effects of relative level were more pronounced for the contiguous sounds. Across all three experiments, the effects of relative level were more pronounced for attenuation. In addition, the effects of relative level showed a dependence on the position of the change in level, with opposite direction for attenuation compared to amplification. Some of the results are in accordance with explanations based on masking effects on auditory intensity resolution."
