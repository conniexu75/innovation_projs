https://openalex.org/W2137583334,"We have observed three effects of deletion mutations on polyadenylation of late SV40 mRNAs. The first class of mutants lack segments (−3 to −14 bp) between the 5′-AAUAAA-3′ and normal poly(A) site. These mutants produce mRNAs polyadenylated at new sites, downstream from the wild-type site. The poly(A) site is moved farther downstream as the deletions become larger; as a result, polyadenylation always occurs within an 11–19 nucleotide range from the AAUAAA sequence. The second class of mutants lack segments (−12 to −30 bp) between the AAUAAA sequence and the coding region of the mRNA. The poly(A) site for only one of these mutants was studied (dl 1457, −12 bp). In this case, the spatial relationship between AAUAAA and poly(A) site is altered, dl1457 produces a class of mRNAs polyadenylated at the first CA following the AAUAAA sequence, as well as other mRNAs poly-adenylated farther downstream. Finally, a 16 bp deletion that includes the AAUAAA sequence prevents poly(A) addition."

https://openalex.org/W1522783020,"Rat brain tryptophan 5-monooxygenase was activated by incubation with ATP, Mg2+, calmodulin, and micromolar concentrations of Ca2+. The activating activity was resolved into two distinct peaks upon gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B: one, Ca2+-, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and the other, a heat-labile activator protein. The activator protein was purified to apparent homogeneity from rat brain by a procedure involving calmodulin-Sepharose 4B, Sephadex G-150, and phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column chromatography. The molecular weight of the activator protein was determined to be 70,000 by sedimentation equilibrium and by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. The protein gave a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the molecular weight of which was estimated to be 35,000, indicating that the protein might be composed of two identical subunits. Analysis of cross-linked activator protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis also suggested that the protein might be a dimer of identical subunits. Some other molecular properties of the activator protein were: sedimentation coefficient, 4.3 S; Stokes radius, 3.6 nm; diffusion coefficient, 6.0 x 10(-7) cm2/s; frictional ratio, 1.32; and partial specific volume, 0.73 cm3/g. The activator protein activated tyrosine 5-monooxygenase as well as tryptophan 5-monooxygenase in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, Ca2+, calmodulin, and Ca2+-, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2096873963,"Microtubule disrupting drugs initiated DNA synthesis in serum-free cultures of nonproliferating fibroblast-like cells. The addition of colchicine to chick, mouse and human fibroblasts in serum-free medium stimulated thymidine incorporation at least twofold, with a half-maximal concentration of 1 × 10−7 M. This stimulation represented up to 75% of the maximal stimulation by thrombin and was paralleled by an increase in the percentage of labeled nuclei. Other microtubule disrupting drugs showed similar stimulation, whereas lumicolchicine had no effect. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of tubulin showed a correlation between microtubule depolymerization and initiation of DNA synthesis by these drugs. A 2 hr treatment with 10−6 M colchicine caused complete disruption of the microtubular network and stimulated thymidine incorporation (measured 28 hr later) to an even greater extent than continuous colchicine exposure. A similar 2 hr exposure to 10−6 M colcemid also stimulated thymidine incorporation and led to a 50% increase in cell number. Taxol, a drug which stabilizes cytoplasmic microtubules, blocks initiation of DNA synthesis by colchicine, indicating that microtubule depolymerization is necessary for this initiation. To determine if microtubule depolymerization is involved in stimulation of DNA synthesis by other growth factors, highly purified human thrombin was added to cells with or without colchicine. In no case did colchicine plus thrombin increase DNA synthesis above that of the maximal stimulation by thrombin alone. Furthermore, pretreatment of cultures with taxol (5 μg/ml) inhibited approximately 30% of the stimulation of thymidine incorporation by thrombin. Together, these studies demonstrate that microtubule depolymerization is sufficient to initiate both DNA synthesis and events leading to cell division and suggest that microtubule depolymerization may be a required step in initiation of cell proliferation by growth factors such as highly purified human thrombin."

https://openalex.org/W2029604573,"Somatostatin, the growth hormone-inhibiting factor, when microinjected into the third ventricle of the rat brain, paradoxically induced the release of growth hormone. A pituitary site of action having been ruled out, this result supports the concept that exogenous somatostatin within the hypothalamus acts either to suppress the release of somatostatin from somatostatin-containing neurons, possibly via an ultrashort-loop feedback mechanism, or to augment release of hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing factor, thereby inducing a release of growth hormone. Injection of somatostatin into the third ventricle also decreased plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone, probably by inhibiting the release of luteinizing hormone-releasing factor and thyrotropin-releasing factor."
https://openalex.org/W1599529839,"Highly purified preparations of guanylate cyclase from rat lung were inactivated by several disulfide compounds in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cystamine and cystine were the most potent disulfides tested, but other compounds which contained the cysteamine moiety (NH2CH2CH2S-), including pantethine and oxidized coenzyme A, were also able to partially inactivate the enzyme. In addition to the decrease in basal activity (measured with either Mg2+-GTP or Mn2+-GTP), disulfide-inhibited enzyme was activated to a lesser extent by nitric oxide. Treatment with dithiothreitol or other reducing agents restored basal activity and increased the level of cGMP production following nitric oxide activation. Control enzyme samples exhibited a single GTP Km of 25 microM or 150 microM with Mn2+ or Mg2+, respectively. However, cystamine-treated enzyme showed these same Km values as well as an additional GTP Km of 2 to 3 microM using either metal ion as cofactor. When [35S]cystine was incubated with purified enzyme, radioactivity was incorporated into the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein, and the counts were released following dithiothreitol treatment. In addition, [35S]cystine-labeled enzyme co-migrated with native guanylate cyclase on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. These data indicate that mixed disulfides can be formed between guanylate cyclase and certain naturally occurring compounds, and that disulfide formation leads to a reversible loss of enzyme activity."

https://openalex.org/W1604289530,"The product specified by T4 bacteriophage gene 41 is known from genetic analyses to be essential for phage DNA replication in vivo. Correspondingly, the purified gene 41 protein is an essential component of an efficient in vitro DNA replication system reconstructed from seven purified T4 replication proteins; it is required both for the synthesis of short RNA primers (in conjunction with the T4 gene 61 protein) and for the rapid unwinding of the double-helical DNA template at a replication fork. The purified gene 41 protein exhibits a DNA-dependent GTPase (and ATPase) activity. In this report, we have used this associated GTPase activity as a biochemical probe for the analysis of the interactions between DNA and the 41 protein. Our results suggest that, upon binding GTP, the 41 protein monomer is induced to form a dimer, which can them form a tight complex with single-stranded DNA. Driven by the repeated hydrolysis of GTP molecules, the 41 protein dimer appears to run rapidly along the bound DNA chain. Studies with the synthetic GTP analogue, GTP gamma S, suggest that GTP hydrolysis is required for this 41 protein movement, but that it is not essential for the function of the 41 protein in RNA primer synthesis. In sum, our observations suggest that a 41 protein dimer runs along the lagging strand template at a DNA replication fork; from this position, it functions as a DNA helicase and simultaneously interacts with the T4 gene 61 protein to make the pentaribonucleotide primers which initiate Okazaki pieces at specific primer initiation sites."
https://openalex.org/W1599501444,"Biochemical evidence is presented for changes in the membrane environment of the (K+ + H+)-dependent ATPase enzyme of the oxyntic cell following in vivo gastric stimulation of young New Zealand rabbits. The changes are inferred from the marked differences in the sedimentation properties of the (K+ + H+)-ATPase when obtained from homogenates of either stimulated or nonstimulated (resting) fundic gastric epithelium. Stimulation resulted in a redistribution of K+-ATPase activity that was reduced to less than half in the microsomal pellet and concomitantly increased in the membrane fractions normally associated with nuclei and mitochondria. Density gradient fractionation of the mitochondrial pellet yield a preparation rich in (K+ + H+)-ATPase. Our studies indicated that the membranes in this preparation are far larger and apparently denser than the microsomal vesicles associated with the nonstimulated state of the cell. The specific nature of the relationship between stimulation and the observed changes is suggested by the lack of change in the distribution of enzymatic activities unrelated to the apical pole of the oxyntic cell. Preliminary, tentative information aimed at identifying the processes responsible for the observed changes is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1560023411,"A macromolecule has been partially purified which influences the choice of the neurotransmitter synthesized by sympathetic neurons. Previous studies showed that culture medium conditioned by incubation on certain types of non-neuronal cells increased [3H]acetylcholine synthesis and accumulation from [3H]choline in primary cultures of neurons dissociated from neonatal rat superior cervical ganglion and grown in the virtual absence of non-neuronal cells. A concomitant decrease of [3H]catecholamines production was observed (Patterson, P. H., and Chun, L. L. Y. (1977) Dev. Biol. 56, 263-280). The active cholinergic factor in conditioned medium from C6 glioma or primary rat heart cultures has been purified about 1500-fold by a sequence of ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-, CM-cellulose, and Sephadex G-100 chromatography. The partially purified factor is active at 1 microgram of protein/ml of culture medium and is eluted from Sephadex columns as a single peak of apparent Mr = 40,000-45,000. This material is insensitive to 0.2 M 2-mercaptoethanol, but is inactivated by 1 mM Na periodate. Its activity is partially decreased by treatment with a protease from Streptomyces griseus but is unaffected by neuraminidase. Material purified through the ammonium sulfate, DEAE- and CM-cellulose steps contains large amounts of trypsin- and chymotrypsin-inhibiting activities."

https://openalex.org/W1883762470,"Rep protein as a helicase combines its actions with those of gene A protein and single-stranded DNA binding protein to separate the strands of phi X174 duplex DNA and thereby can generate and advance a replication fork (Scott, J. F., Eisenberg, S., Bertsch, L. L., and Kornberg, A. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 193-197). Tritium-labeled rep protein is bound in an active gene A protein. phi X174 closed circular duplex supercoiled DNA complex in a 1:1 ratio. Catalytic separation of the strands of the duplex by rep protein, as measured by incorporation of tritium-labeled single-stranded DNA binding protein, requires ATP at a Km value of 8 microM, and hydrolyzes two molecules of ATP for every base pair melted. When coupled to replication in the synthesis of single-strand viral circles, a looped rolling-circle intermediate is formed that can be isolated in an active form containing gene A protein, rep protein, single-stranded DNA binding protein, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Unlike the binding of rep protein to single-stranded DNA, where its ATPase activity is distributive, binding to the replicating fork is not affected by ATP, further suggesting a processive action linked to gene A protein. Limited tryptic hydrolysis of rep protein abolishes its replicative activity without affecting significantly its binding of ATP and its ATPase action on single-stranded DNA. These results augment earlier findings by describing the larger role of rep proteins as a helicase, linked in a complex ith other proteins, at the replication fork of a duplex DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1481983702,"Approximately 8-10 mg of highly actin-activatable, CA2+-sensitive Acanthamoeba myosin II can be isolated in greater than 98% purity from 100 g of amoeba by the new procedure described in detail in this paper. The enzyme isolated by this procedure can be activated by actin because its heavy chains are not fully phosphorylated (Collins, J. H., and Korn, E. D. (1980) J. Biol Chem. 255, 8011-8014). We now show that Acanthamoeba myosin II Mg2+-ATPase activity is more highly activated by Acanthamoeba actin than by muscle actin. Also, actomyosin II ATPase is inactive at concentrations of free Mg2+ lower than about 3 mM and fully active at Mg2+ concentrations greater than 4 mM. Actomyosin II Mg2+-ATPase activity is stimulated by micromolar Ca2+ when assayed over the narrow range of about 3-4 mM Mg2+ but is not affected by Ca2+ at either lower or higher concentrations of Mg2+. The specific activity of te actomyosin II Mg2+-ATPase also increases with increasing concentrations of myosin II when the free Mg2+ concentration is in the range of 3-4 mM but is independent of the myosin II concentration at lower or higher concentrations of Mg2+ . This marked effect of the Mg2+ concentration on the Ca2+-sensitivity and myosin concentration-dependence of th specific activity of actomyosin II ATPase activity does not seem to be related to the formation of myosin filaments, and to be related to the formation of myosin filaments, and myosin II is insoluble only at high concentrations of free Mg2+ (6-7 mM) were neither of these effects is observed. Also, the Mg2+ requirements for actomyosin II ATPase activity and myosin II insolubility can be differentially modified by EDTA and sucrose."

https://openalex.org/W1864266030,"gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase (purified from rat kidney) was incubated with glutathione and a mixture of amino acids that closely approximates the amino acid composition of blood plasma, and the relative extents of transpeptidation and hydrolysis were determined by quantitative measurement of the products formed (glutamate, cysteinylglycine, gamma-glutamyl amino acids). At pH 7.4, in the presence of 50 microM glutathione and the amino acid mixture, about 50% of the glutathione that was utilized participated in transpeptidation. Studies in which the formation of individual gamma-glutamyl amino acids was determined in the presence of glutathione and the amino acid mixture showed that L-cystine and L-glutamine are the most active amino acid acceptors, and that other neutral amino acids also participate in transpeptidation to a significant extent. These in vitro experiments are consistent with a number of other findings which indicate that transpeptidation is a significant physiological function of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1628826614,"Studies on the glutamine substrate specificities of human plasma factor XIIIa and guinea pig liver transglutaminase have been made using variants of the synthetic peptide substrate, Ser-Val-Leu-Ser-Leu-Ser-Gln-Ser-Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Glu. The sequence of this effective peptide substrate corresponds to the primary site of factor XIIIa-catalyzed amine incorporation into beta-casein, the most sensitive known macromolecular substrate for this enzyme (Gorman, J.J., and Folk, J.E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 419-427). Variations in specificity observed with factor XIIIa for peptides containing single substitutions and multiple substitutions in this sequence are indications that several important determinants for enzyme recognition are contained therein. Among these are several of the hydrophobic amino acid residues and the lysine residue. Less pronounced changes in specificity occur with the liver enzyme and the differences in effects of the various substitutions reveal important differences in specificity requirements of factor XIIIa and the liver enzyme. Comparisons of the activities of the enzymes toward the synthetic peptides to their activities toward macromolecular substrates suggest that higher order macromolecular structural features contribute to specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1532688424,"The multifunctional protein which catalyzes the first three steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis in hamster cells can be cleaved by trypsin into enzymatically active fragments. When the fragments are separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, three major polypeptide bands appear. Carbamyl phosphate synthetase (EC 2.7.2.9), aspartate transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.2), and dihydroorotase (EC 3.5.2.3) activities are associated with 129,000-, 660,000-, and 94,000-dalton bands, respectively. Further analysis of these fragments by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has shown that the aspartate transcarbamylase band seen on the nondenaturing gel is actually a large aggregate of 39,000-dalton fragments and the dihydroorotase band is a dimer of 44,000-dalton fragments. The data reported here indicate that (i) this multifunctional protein is composed of three enzymatically independent domains, (ii) the sum of the molecular weights of these three domains (129,000 + 39,000 + 44,000 = 212,000) is similar to that of the undigested monomer (220,000 daltons), and (iii) a site important to the formation of the native multimeric protein is probably near the aspartate transcarbamylase domain."

https://openalex.org/W1542037148,"Abstract In the presence of any natural single-stranded DNA, the bacteriophage T4 gene 41 and gene 61 proteins catalyze the synthesis of a group of pentaribonucleotides. These RNA molecules are homogeneous in chain length, but heterogeneous in sequence. In the presence of the other five T4 replication proteins, these pentaribonucleotides are utilized with high efficiency as primers for de novo DNA chain initiations on the lagging strand in the T4 DNA replication process. By using a two-dimensional fractionation system plus a variety of enzymatic analyses, the pentaribonucleotides are found to have either a unique pppApC dinucleotide or a pppG as their starting residue, followed in both cases by many different sequences. However, when natural T4 DNA containing glucosylated 5-hydroxylmethyl cytosine is used as template, only the pppApC-initiated class of RNA primers is made. Alone, the gene 41 protein exhibits a DNA-dependent GTPase (and ATPase) activity, with nucleoside diphosphate and inorganic phosphate as products. By blocking this GTPase activity with the synthetic GTP analogue, GTP gamma S, we show that limited RNa primer synthesis can occur without this nucleotide hydrolysis by the 41 protein, but that prolonged RNA primer synthesis requires such hydrolysis. This result, viewed in the light of the observations presented in the accompanying paper, suggests that the gene 41 protein acts as a mobile promoter, perhaps leaving the gene 61 protein to perform the actual polymerization and chain termination functions in the synthetic process."

https://openalex.org/W1570553460,"Abstract Freeze-dried sections were prepared from retinas of frogs which were dark-adapted or exposed to varying periods of light. Samples of the discrete layers were dissected, weighed, and analyzed for energy metabolites, guanylate compounds, and the enzyme guanylate cyclase. ATP and P-creatine were measured in both dark- and light-adapted retinas. There was a gradient in ATP and P-creatine levels in dark-adapted retinas, with the lower concentrations in the photoreceptors, and increasing concentrations in the inner retina. After light adaptation, concentrations increased, an observation which supports the concept that transmitter release occurs in the dark and ceases in the light. The sum of GTP plus GDP, GDP, and cyclic GMP were analyzed in dark-adapted retinas and after exposure to 2 min or 2 h of room light. GDP was rather uniformly distributed in the retinal layers, was increased by 2 min of light in all layers but the outer nuclear, and remained elevated at 2 h in the inner retina. GTP values showed a marked localization in the outer nuclear layer, which increased after 2 min or 2 h of illumination; in all other layers GTP was decreased by light. Cyclic GMP in the dark was highest in the photoreceptor cells, decreasing to one-third after 2 min of light; there were significant increases in the outer plexiform and inner nuclear layers at this time. Cyclic GMP remained low in the photoreceptor cells even after 2 h of light, while the inner layers returned to dark values. Guanylate cyclase, like cyclic GMP, was largely confined to the photoreceptor cells and showed a maximal increase after 2 min of light exposure."

For this determination, the preparation is described of ATP gamma S, stereospecifically labeled in the gamma-position with both 17O and 18O. After hydrolysis of this nucleotide, the analysis of the product inorganic [16O,17O,18O]thiophosphate showed that the reaction proceeded with retention of configuration at the gamma-phosphorus atom. This result is expected since a phosphoenzyme is well characterized for this ATPase and provides support for the hypothesis that each phosphate transfer step occurs with inversion. In this case, the formation and breakdown of the phosphoenzyme occur each with inversion leading to the retention observed for the whole reaction."

Chem. 253, 3298-3304), forms binary complexes with ATP and with DNA, and ternary complexes with both. ATP (or dATP) is bound at a single site with a dissociation constant (KD) near 10(-7) M. Other ribonucleoside triphosphates and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates compete for the same site with far lower affinities. The protein forms a binary complex with single-stranded DNA and with duplex DNA, each at distinctive sites. Binding to single-stranded DNA covers a stretch of approximately 20 nucleotides, destabilizes secondary structure, and facilitates reannealing of complementary single strands. Ternary complexes of rep protein with ATP and DNA are manifested by ATP hydrolysis and by binding of labeled components. Nonhydrolyzed ATP analogs are useful aids for isolation and studies of such complexes. Unlike rep protein's processive action as a helicase at a replication fork, its action on single-stranded DNA is distributive, with ATP hydrolysis accelerating dissociation of the protein from the complex. These and related studies serve as guides to understanding the multiple interactions of rep protein with its ATP and DNA ligands that enable it to unwind duplex DNA at a replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W1542950040,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by physiological concentrations of CoA. Activation of partially purified enzyme by CoA is accompanied by a decrease in the Km for acetyl-CoA from 0.2 mM to about 4 microM, which is the physiological concentration of acetyl-CoA in the cytosol. CoA activation of the purified enzyme is accompanied by an increase in the Vmax, without changing the Km for acetyl-CoA. The Km for acetyl-CoA of the purified enzyme is about 10 to 40 microM. The purification procedure results in a decrease in the Km for acetyl-CoA; under these conditions, CoA activation does not cause further lowering of the Km. CoA activation is accompanied by polymerization of the enzyme. However, CoA activation is not causally related to polymerization. There is one CoA binding site/subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. CoA binding at that site is not affected by the presence of citrate, but palmityl-CoA inhibits CoA binding. CoA alone cannot reverse palmityl-CoA inhibition of the carboxylase. Bovine serum albumin and CoA together can activate the palmityl-CoA-inhibited enzyme.

The 10 S RNP contains a 4 S RNA species (base composition: AMP, .3%; GMP, 22.2%; CMP, 24.2%; and UMP, 23.2%), and shows three major bands in the 70-90-nucleotide size range by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 99% formamide. The 4 S RNA does not contain oligo(U)- and oligo(A)-rich tracts. The RNP has a characteristic buoyant density of 1.410 g/ml, which corresponds to an RNA/protein ratio of about 1:4. The UV absorption spectra of the RNP is very distinct from that of its RNA component. Both 4 S RNA and the 10 S RNP are potent inhibitors of translation of a variety of mRNAs such as chick muscle poly(A)+ mRNA, rabbit globin mRNA, EMC virus RNA, and poly(A)- and mRNA of rat liver in micrococcal nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The inhibitory action of the RNA and the RNP on mRNA translation appears to involve the initiation process. The RNA and RNP do not have a nuclease activity associated with them. The hyperchromicity profile of the inhibitory RNA with increasing temperature indicates that it does not contain a significant amount of double-stranded structure. This is also supported by the complete loss of biological activity of the RNA by treatment with pancreatic RNase. In contrast, the inhibitory activity of the RNP was resistant to RNase. Electrophoresis of the protein moieties of the inhibitory RNP using both one- and two-dimensional gel techniques in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate shows a complex pattern of polypeptides of Mr = 12,000-150,000. The protein pattern of the 10 S particle is quite different from those of free and polysomal mRNP and poly(A)-protein complexes of chick embryonic muscles, indicating that most, if not all of the mRNA-associated proteins, are absent in the 19 S RNP. The properties of the inhibitory RNA indicate that it is different from the various low molecular weight RNA species which are involved in the modulation of protein synthesis in cell-free systems. It is concluded that the 10 S particle represents a novel class of RNP, which may be involved in posttranscriptional regulation of protein synthesis in embryonic muscles."

Recently we identified two separate biosynthetic precursors of somatostatin (Mr = 16,000 and 14,000) among the cell-free translation products encoded by mRNAs prepared from the islets of the anglerfish. The nucleotide sequence of a cloned cDNA encoding the larger of the two pre-prosomatostatins revealed the sequence of the tetradecapeptide somatostatin at the COOH terminus of a polypeptide of 119 amino acids. We now have prepared poly(A)RNA from the intestine of the anglerfish and by immunoprecipitation analyses find a single somatostatin-related translation product that co-migrates during electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with the larger islet pre-prosomatostatin (Mr = 16,000). Analyses of the sizes of the intestinal and islet mRNAs by agarose gel electrophoresis and hybridization with 32P-labeled cDNA containing the coding sequence for the large islet pre-prosomatostatin showed that the complementary RNA in the intestine (600 bases) is 30 nucleotides smaller than that in the islet (620-630 bases). These observations indicate that a gene encoding somatostatin is expressed in the intestine and suggest that the intestinal mRNA is distinct from the two mRNAs encoding the islet somatostatins."

https://openalex.org/W1936284476,"Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were phosphorylated with [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of external Ca2+ without added Mg2+. The phosphoenzyme (EP) formed had tightly bound Ca2+ and was dephosphorylated by ADP. When the external Ca2+ was chelated after phosphorylation, Ca2+ dissociated from the EP and ADP addition no longer induced dephosphorylation. Subsequent addition of CaCl2 caused rapid recombination of Ca2+ and restoration of the ADP sensitivity. These findings show that the dissociation and recombination of Ca2+ took place on the outer surface of the membranes, indicating the existence of EP with bound Ca2+ which was exposed to the external medium (Caout.EP). The Ca2+ affinity of the Ca2+ binding site in Caout.EP was comparable to that of the high affinity Ca2+ binding site in the dephosphoenzyme (E). This shows that phosphorylation is not accompanied by an appreciable reduction in the Ca2+ affinity of the Ca2+ binding site, provided this site is exposed to the external medium. The transition from ADP-sensitive EP to ADP-insensitive induced by Ca2+ chelation was unaffected by Mg2+ in the medium. Mg2+ did not activate hydrolysis of the ADP-sensitive EP with bound Ca2+, whereas it markedly accelerated hydrolysis of the ADP-insensitive EP without bound Ca2+."

In contrast, it was greatly increased by addition of MgCl2 and became much higher than the steady state rate of the Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis. The kinetic analysis of the results gave support to the probability that the MgCl2 addition markedly shifted the equilibrium of the reaction of Caout . EP and Cain .

The increased rate of reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid is not due to activation of pre-existing HMG-CoA reductase by dephosphorylation, as the fold induction is unchanged when reductase from control and estrogen-stimulated animals is fully activated prior to assay. The estrogen-induced increase of fatty acid synthesis is paralleled by a 16- to 20-fold increase of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, indicating that estrogen regulates fatty acid synthesis at the level of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Fatty acid synthetase activity was unchanged during the induction of fatty acid biosynthesis by estrogen. The induction of HMG-CoA reductase and of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by estradiol-17 beta provides a useful model for regulation of these enzymes by steroid hormones."

https://openalex.org/W2147283829,"The reversibility of the reaction catalyzed by purified (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-dependent ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum was studied by measuring the rates of synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP observed during the ATP in equilibrium Pi exchange reaction. The ratio between the velocities of hydrolysis and synthesis of ATP was found to vary between 700 and 1.2 depending on the concentrations of ATP, Pi, Mg2+, and Ca2+ in the medium. Raising the magnesium concentration increases in parallel the calcium concentrations required for half-maximal activation of both the hydrolysis and the synthesis of ATP. The apparent Km of Pi for the ATP in equilibrium Pi exchange reaction varies, depending on the Mg2+ concentration of the medium, being lower with higher Mg2+ concentration. The ratio between the velocities of hydrolysis and synthesis of ATP decreases when the Mg2+ and Pi concentrations are increased and the ATP concentration is decreased."
https://openalex.org/W1521005768,"Removal of spectrin from erythrocyte membranes results in the simultaneous loss of a calcium-stimulated, magnesium-dependent ATPase with an apparent KD for Ca2+ of 1 microM. This ATPase activity with high Ca2+ affinity is specifically reconstituted by addition of purified spectrin to spectrin-depleted membranes, and the reconstituted activity is directly proportional to the amount of spectrin that is reassociated with the membranes. Spectrin binding and activation of the high Ca2+ affinity Mg2+-ATPase are proportionally inhibited by thermal denaturation, trypsin digestion, or treatment of the membranes with thiol-reactive reagents. Binding of calmodulin to the Ca2+ pump ATPase requires that calmodulin contains bound ca2+. By contrast, spectrin binding to the erythrocyte membrane is Ca2+-independent. Direct assay of calmodulin is purified spectrin and absence of chlorpromazine inhibition of reconstitution demonstrate that activation of the high Ca2+ affinity ATPase resulting from spectrin binding is not a result of contamination of spectrin by calmodulin. Additional evidence that the spectrin-activated ATPase is an entity separate and distinct from the Ca2+ pump is provided by other characteristics of the activation phenomenon. It is suggested that spectrin constitutes part of an ATPase which may function as a component of the cytoskeleton controlling erythrocyte shape and membrane flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W1565629497,"We have previously reported that treatment of rat liver plasma membranes with various proteases led to activation and solubilization of membrane-bound guanylate cyclase. We report here that the guanylate cyclase solubilized by proteolysis differed from the cytosolic cyclase and rather was similar to the membrane-bound form of the enzyme in that it exhibited a sigmoidal MnGTP concentration dependence and was not activated by an excess Mn2+ or by nitrosocompounds. Also, whereas the cytosolic guanylate cyclase activity was completely abolished by 10 to 100 microM Cd2+, a dithiol reagent, no inhibitory effect was observed on the trypsin-solubilized enzyme. Therefore, the differences in kinetic properties between cytosolic and membrane-bound rat liver guanylate cyclase reside in structural differences between both forms of the enzyme rather than in differences in their environment."
https://openalex.org/W1549295974,"To investigate poly(A)-lacking mRNA in mouse kidney, we studied a fraction of renal mRNA that does not bind to oligo(dT)-cellulose but can be purified by benzoylated cellulose chromatography. Nominal poly(A)-lacking mRNA and poly(A)-containing mRNA have complete nucleotide sequence homology, suggesting that kidney does not contain mRNAs that are not represented in the polyadenylated RNA fraction. Translation products directed by nominal poly(A)-lacking mRNA and poly(A)-containing mRNA are qualitatively and quantitatively similar in one-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. [3H]cDNA transcribed from poly(A)-containing mRNA hybridizes with its template and with nominal poly(A)-lacking mRNA to the same extent (95%) and with the same kinetics; reaction of [3H]cDNA to nominal poly(A)-lacking mRNA with the two mRNA populations gives the same result. The extensive homology these two mRNA populations share is important to the interpretation of mRNA lifetime and to the analysis of authentic poly(A)-lacking mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1562104259,"Cystine content of skin fibroblasts derived from patients with cystinosis was decreased by inhibitors of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, the initial enzyme in glutathione catabolism. The addition of maleate or the gamma-glutamyl hydrazone of alpha-ketobutyric acid to culture medium (1-20 mM) resulted in dose-dependent decreases of up to 55% on intracellular cystine content of cystinotic cells in 24 h. L-Serine in sodium borate buffer (40 mM each) produced similar results and further decreased cystine levels to 14% of cystinotic control values after 10 days incubation. Analysis of intracellular amino acids showed that, in general, other amino acids remained unchanged following serine-borate treatment. These results suggest that cystine storage in cystinotic tissues may be related to metabolism of glutathione."
https://openalex.org/W1573176317,"Purified virions of HVJ (Sendai virus) were found to contain a guanylate cyclase activity that converts GTP to cyclic GMP. Activities of adenylate cyclase and 5'-nucleotidase which are frequently used as marker enzymes of cell membranes were not detected in the virus. Guanylate cyclase and virion-associated activities, neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, were co-purified during a purification of virions. Guanylate cyclase activity was not detected without disruption of the virions with a detergent, Triton X-100 or Nonident P-40. Treatment of intact HVJ with a proteolytic enzyme, trypsin or chymotrypsin, destroyed both neuraminidase and hemagglutinin; however, most of the guanylate cyclase ws retained. Guanylate cyclase activity was found in fractions containing nucleocapsids after sucrose density gradient centrifugation of disrupted virions. These results indicated that the enzyme was tightly bound to cores of HVJ and, therefore, its presence could not be explained by binding of host cell enzyme to the surface of virions. Properties of the virus-derived enzyme and particulate fractions of host cell homogenates were similar. Antiserum against nucleocapsids of HVJ inhibited guanylate cyclase activity of HVJ and particulate fractions of cells such as chorioallantoic membrane and rat liver, while soluble guanylate cyclase was not inhibited by antiserum. The biological significance and origin of guanylate cyclase found in HVJ are obscure and await further study."
