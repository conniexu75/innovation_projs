https://openalex.org/W2147179807,"What will be the growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or the competitiveness of China, United States, and Vietnam in the next 3, 5 or 10 years? Despite this kind of questions has a large societal impact and an extreme value for economic policy making, providing a scientific basis for economic predictability is still a very challenging problem. Recent results of a new branch--Economic Complexity--have set the basis for a framework to approach such a challenge and to provide new perspectives to cast economic prediction into the conceptual scheme of forecasting the evolution of a dynamical system as in the case of weather dynamics. We argue that a recently introduced non-monetary metrics for country competitiveness (fitness) allows for quantifying the hidden growth potential of countries by the means of the comparison of this measure for intangible assets with monetary figures, such as GDP per capita. This comparison defines the fitness-income plane where we observe that country dynamics presents strongly heterogeneous patterns of evolution. The flow in some zones is found to be laminar while in others a chaotic behavior is instead observed. These two regimes correspond to very different predictability features for the evolution of countries: in the former regime, we find strong predictable pattern while the latter scenario exhibits a very low predictability. In such a framework, regressions, the usual tool used in economics, are no more the appropriate strategy to deal with such a heterogeneous scenario and new concepts, borrowed from dynamical systems theory, are mandatory. We therefore propose a data-driven method--the selective predictability scheme--in which we adopt a strategy similar to the methods of analogues, firstly introduced by Lorenz, to assess future evolution of countries."

Material and methods Two retrospective cohorts of OHS and OSAS were matched 1:2 according to sex, age (±10 year) and length of time since initiation of CPAP/NIV therapy (±6 months). Results Three hundred and thirty subjects (110 patients with OHS and 220 patients with OSAS) were studied. Mean follow-up time was 7±4 years. The five year mortality rates were 15.5% in OHS cohort and 4.5% in OSAS cohort (p< 0.05). Patients with OHS had a 2-fold increase (OR 2; 95% CI: 1.11–3.60) in the risk of mortality and 1.86 fold (OR 1.86; 95% CI: 1.14–3.04) increased risk of having a cardiovascular event. Diabetes, baseline diurnal SaO2 < 83%, EPAP < 7 cmH2O after titration and adherence to NIV < 4 hours independently predicted mortality in OHS. Conclusion Mortality of severe OHS is high and substantially worse than that of OSAS. Severe OHS should be considered a systemic disease that encompasses respiratory, metabolic and cardiovascular components that require a multimodal therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W2017760369,"For sessile marine invertebrates with complex life cycles, habitat choice is directed by the larval phase. Defining which habitat-linked cues are implicated in sessile invertebrate larval settlement has largely concentrated on chemical cues which are thought to signal optimal habitat. There has been less effort establishing physical settlement cues, including the role of surface microtopography. This laboratory based study tested whether surface microtopography alone (without chemical cues) plays an important contributing role in the settlement of larvae of coral reef sessile invertebrates. We measured settlement to tiles, engineered with surface microtopography (holes) that closely matched the sizes (width) of larvae of a range of corals and sponges, in addition to surfaces with holes that were markedly larger than larvae. Larvae from two species of scleractinian corals (Acropora millepora and Ctenactis crassa) and three species of coral reef sponges (Luffariella variabilis, Carteriospongia foliascens and Ircinia sp.,) were used in experiments. L. variabilis, A. millepora and C. crassa showed markedly higher settlement to surface microtopography that closely matched their larval width. C. foliascens and Ircinia sp., showed no specificity to surface microtopography, settling just as often to microtopography as to flat surfaces. The findings of this study question the sole reliance on chemical based larval settlement cues, previously established for some coral and sponge species, and demonstrate that specific physical cues (surface complexity) can also play an important role in larval settlement of coral reef sessile invertebrates."

In this study, we observed that microRNA-873 (miR-873) was expressed at low levels in GBM and that the overexpression of miR-873 dramatically reduced the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells. Our further investigations of the inhibition mechanism indicated that miR-873 negatively affected the carcinogenesis and metastasis of GBM by down-regulating the expression of IGF2BP1, which stabilizes the mRNA transcripts of its target genes. These results demonstrate that miR-873 may constitute a potential target for GBM therapy.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNA molecules consisting of 20–22 nucleotides that regulate the expression of special genes in a posttranscriptional manner (6Bartel D.P.

All of these miRNAs play important roles in the development of the malignant GBM phenotype. However, few studies have examined miR-873, a novel miRNA, in GBM development. In this study, we discovered that the low level of miR-873 in GBM was associated with the carcinogenesis and metastasis of GBM via the promotion of IGF2BP1 protein expression. Human GBM and their adjacent normal tissues were obtained from six patients. The tissues used for RNA extraction were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Written informed consent was acquired from each patient, and this research was approved by the Pingjin Hospital Medical Ethics and Human Clinical Trial Committee. Glioma cell lines (A172, T98G, U87, U373, U251, and U138) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. MTT assays were carried out to assess cell viability. Briefly, U87 and U373 cells were seeded at a concentration of 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate. miRNA mimic, negative control RNA, or eukaryotic expression plasmids were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000 the following day according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in transfection medium for 6 h. The medium was then replaced with complete medium containing MTT (final concentration, 250 μg/ml) for the subsequent assays. The plates were incubated for an additional 12, 24, or 48. The trapped MTT crystals in the cells were solubilized in 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 37 °C for 15 min. The absorbance was determined in a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) at 570 nm, with 650 nm as the reference wavelength. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The wound-healing assays were performed as follows. The cells were seeded in six-well plates and cultured to 100% confluence. A wound was then produced in the cell monolayer using a plastic pipette tip. The cells were then washed in PBS buffer and cultured for another 48 h. The wound closure rate was then observed and described using a percentage. Cells suspended in serum-free medium (105) were placed into the upper chamber of an insert precoated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the lower chamber. The cells were allowed to invade for 48 h. The cells remaining on the upper surface of the membrane were removed, whereas the cells that had invaded through the membrane were stained with 20% methanol and 0.2% crystal violet, imaged, and counted under a microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For the colony formation assays, the cells were harvested and seeded at a density of 200 cells/well in 12-well plates and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for 2 weeks. During colony growth, the culture medium was replaced every 3 days. The colony number in each well was counted and calculated. Glioma cells were harvested using trypsinization, washed in ice-cold PBS, and then fixed in 80% ice-cold ethanol in PBS. Before staining, the cells were pelleted in a chilled centrifuge and resuspended in cold PBS to a concentration of 1 × 104 cells. Bovine pancreatic RNase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To detect the cell cycle distribution, the cells were stained with 20 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at room temperature. For the cell apoptosis assays, the cells were labeled using the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. The cell cycle profiles and the cell apoptosis rates were quantified using a flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). For the Transwell migration assays, 105 cells were suspended in medium without serum and placed on the top side of a polycarbonate Transwell filter without Matrigel in the upper chamber of a QCMTM 24-well cell invasion assay plate (Cell Biolabs, Inc.); medium without serum was used in the lower chamber. For the invasion assays, the experimental procedures were similar to that for the migration assays, except that the filters were coated with Matrigel. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 8 h for the migration assays or 48 h for the invasion assays. The cells in the top chambers were removed with cotton swabs. The migrated and invaded cells on the lower membrane surface were washed twice with PBS buffer and fixed in in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The well was stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min after another wash using PBS buffer. Following at least three washes in double-distilled H2O, the membrane was dried and observed under a light microscope. The assays were performed in triplicate, and the data are presented as the means ± S.E. Five pairs of the BALB/c nude mice were used. In general, 3 × 106 U87 cells (without transfection miRNA mimics or control mimics) were suspended in 150 μl of serum-free DMEM for each mouse. The right dorsal flank of each nude mouse was then subcutaneously injected with 3 × 106 U87 cells to establish a xenograft. The tumors formed 1 week later. Ten tumor-bearing nude mice were randomly divided into two groups (miR-873 and control). The tumor was then injected with a mixture of miR-873 mimics and Lipo-2000 (transfection reagent) or a mixture of control mimics and Lipo-2000. We repeated this injection every 4 days. The animals were sacrificed after 28 days. The nude mice were handled and cared for according to the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and the Use Committee guidelines of the Experiment Animal Center of Pingjin Hospital, Tianjin, China). The miRNA targets predicted by computer-aided algorithms were obtained from miRanda – mirSVR, miRDB, miRWalk, and targetscan. The minimum free energy (mfe) structures of the RNA duplexes formed by miR-873, and its putative binding sequences were obtained using RNAhybrid. The total protein was extracted from cells using radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science) and PMSF (Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay (Pierce) and a NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The total protein extracts were separated via 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The IGF2BP1 protein was probed with specific antibodies obtained from Proteintech Co. Ltd. after the blot was blocked with 5% nonfat milk. The gray intensities of the protein bands were quantified using the ImageJ software. GAPDH antibody was purchased from Sigma. The sections of GBM cancer tissues and matched normal controls were mechanically deparaffinized and incubated in target retrieval solution (Dako, Carpentaria, CA) at 95 °C for 40 min. After the endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with methanol containing 3% hydrogen peroxide (Dako) for 30 min, the tissue sections were incubated with primary antibody to IGF2BP1 at 4 °C overnight. The sections were then incubated in secondary antibody at 37 °C for 60 min. Subsequently, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for 1 min. The data are presented as the mean ± S.D. A Student's t test was used to evaluate significant differences, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A previous study revealed via high-throughput sequencing that miR-873 was down-regulated in GBM (16Skalsky R.L. Cullen B.R. Reduced expression of brain-enriched microRNAs in glioblastomas permits targeted regulation of a cell death gene.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e24248Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To further assess the miR-873 expression in GBM and normal adjacent tissue, we measured its expression levels in six GBM tumor tissues and their adjacent counterparts in pairs using real-time RT-PCR and primer extension assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, the miR-873 expression in malignant tumor tissue was markedly lower than that in non-cancerous tissue. Specifically, the average expression level of miR-873 in GBM was only 0.25-fold that of the adjacent normal tissues. To further confirm this result, we detected the expression level of miR-873 in four normal brain tissues and six GBM cell lines, A172, T98G, U87, U373, U251, and U138, using real-time RT-PCR and primer extension assay and observed that normal brain tissues expressed significantly more miR-873 than GBM cell lines (Fig. 1B). These data indicated that miR-873 was down-regulated in GBM and may act as a tumor suppressor. To confirm that miR-873 plays a tumor suppressor role in GBM, two GBM cell lines, U373 and U87, were transfected with miR-873 mimics that shared sequences with mature miR-873. The levels of miR-873 can be significantly elevated in the U373 and U87 cells after transfection (Fig. 2A). The effect of the increased level of miR-873 on U373 and U87 cell proliferation was determined using MTT and colony formation assays. The results of the MTT assay demonstrated that miR-873 could inhibit the viability of GBM cells, whereas the results of the colony formation assays suggested that miR-873 overexpression could also reduce anchorage-independent growth in GBM cells (Fig. 2, B–E). The analysis of the cell cycle kinetics using flow cytometry indicated that miR-873 significantly induced cell cycle arrests in both U87 and U373 cells. The G0/G1 phase fractions of U87 cells and U373 cells transfected with miR-873 increased by 25 and 17%, respectively, when compared with the phase fractions of corresponding cells transfected with miR-control mimics. Moreover, the decrease in S phase populations of both cell lines transfected with miR-873 mimics exceeded 50% when compared with the control group (Fig. 2, F and G). The marked G0/G1 arrest and decrease in the S phase fraction suggested that miR-873 may act as an inhibitor by inducing cell apoptosis. To further confirm this assumption, we measured and compared the apoptosis ratios of U87 and U373 cells transfected with miR-873 mimics with the ratios of the corresponding cells with miR-control mimics using flow cytometry. We discovered that the number of apoptotic cells labeled with annexin V or 7-aminoactinomycin D increased by 1- and 0.53-fold in U87 and U373 cells, respectively, after miR-873 mimic treatment (Fig. 2H). To investigate the function of miR-873 in glioma carcinogenesis, we further assessed the influence of the elevated level of miR-873 in cells on the tumor-forming potential in vivo. Three million U87 cells transfected with either miR-873 or miR-control mimics were implanted into the right flanks of nude mice by subcutaneous injection. The mean volumes of xenograft tumors were measured every week. Four weeks after the injection, the xenograft tumors were excised and measured in vitro. We found that cells transfected with miR-873 generated smaller tumors than cells transfected with miR-control mimics (n = 5 animals/group, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, I and J). Thus, we suggest that the transfection of miR-873 into GBM cells inhibits tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Transwell migration assays were utilized to examine the effect of miR-873 on cell migration and invasion. The migration level of the U87 and U373 cells transfected with miR-873 mimics only reached ∼35% of the level of the cells transfected with miR-control mimics (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, the invasive potential of the U87 and U373 cells decreased by 0.8-fold after transfection with miR-873 mimics when compared with the potential after transfection with miR-control mimics (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, the quantification of wound closure showed that U87 cells transfected with miR-873 mimics closed 10.1% of the wound after 24 h and 39.1% of the wound after 48 h. However, U87 cells transfected with miR-control mimics closed 59.7% of the wound after 24 h and 99.2% of the wound after 48 h (Fig. 3E). In the other group, U373 cells transfected with miR-373 mimics closed 25.6% of the wound after 24 h and 61.1% of the wound after 48 h. Moreover, U373 cells transfected with control mimics closed 51.1% of the wound after 24 h and 99.4% of the wound after 48 h (Fig. 3F). These data suggest that the increased levels of miR-873 in GBM cells significantly inhibited both cell migration and invasion. MicroRNAs inhibit gene expression by binding to the mRNA transcript of the target gene to induce its degradation. To identify novel miR-873 target genes, four cited algorithms, miRanda – mirSVR, miRDB, miRWalk, and Targetscan, were used to predict the potential targets of miR-873. As a result, a potential list of targets including 21 genes was identified. Among these genes, IGF2BP1 is up-regulated in a large number of malignancies, which led us to believe that IGF2BP1 may be a direct target of miR-873 in GBM (Fig. 4A). Three putative binding sites of the microRNA in the 3′-UTR of IGF2BP1 (IGF2BP1-3′-UTR WT) are described in Fig. 4B, and the complementary seed sequences were mutated as described in the figure legend to generate the 3′-UTR mutant (IGF2BP1-3′-UTR mut), which should not bind miR-873. Moreover, we obtained three mfe structures of the RNA duplexes formed by miR-873 and its putative binding sequences using RNAhybrid and found that the miR-873 and the first putative binding site duplex featured a lower mfe than the two other duplexes (Fig. 4A). The lower mfe suggested that miR-873 might bind to the 3′-UTR of IGF2BP1 at the first putative binding site. We conducted luciferase reporter assays to confirm this hypothesis. As shown in Fig. 4C, the luciferase activity generated by the reporter vector with IGF2BP1-3′-UTR WT decreased by 52.4% after co-transfection with miR-873 when compared with the control group. However, the activity generated by the reporter vector with IGF2BP1-3′-UTR mut-1 was slightly higher than that of the control group after the co-transfection with miR-873. Furthermore, the mutation of the second and third binding sites in the 3′-UTR of IGF2BP1 did not affect the activity generated by the reporter vectors when compared with the control groups (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that miR-873 might suppress the expression of IGF2BP-1 by strongly and directly binding to the first putative site in its 3′-UTR. The following Western blot assays showed that the relative protein level of IGF2BP1 in U87 and U373 decreased by 81.3 and 73.4%, respectively, after transfection with miR-873; GAPDH was used as an internal control (Fig. 4D). However, the addition of an miR-873 antagonist increased the IGF2BP1 expression level (Fig. 4D). Similarly, the mRNA level of IGF2BP1 determined using real-time PCR in U87 and U373 decreased by 51.3 and 49.7%, respectively, after miR-873 transfection (Fig. 4E). To overexpress IGF2BP1 in GBM cells, we transfected the cells with pcMV6/IGF2BP1 vectors. The protein level of IGF2BP1 increased 4.51-fold in U87 cells co-transfected with miR-873 mimics and pcMV6/IGF2BP1 when compared with the protein level in the cells co-transfected with miR-873 and the control vector, pcMV6. Similarly, the overexpression of IGF2BP1 increased the protein level in U373 transfected with miR-873 mimics and pcMV6/IGF2BP1 by 6.67-fold when compared with the level in cells transfected with miR-873 mimics and pcMV6 (Fig. 5, A and B). These results suggested that overexpressing IGF2BP1 using the pcMV6/IGF2BP1 vector in GBM cells could partially rescue the down-regulation of IGF2BP1 expression caused by the increased cellular level of miR-873. The viability of GBM cells transfected with miR-873 mimics and pcMV6/IGF2BP1 was determined with an MTT assay. The absorbance increased 0.19-fold in U87 and 0.23-fold in U373 cells when IGF2BP1 expression was up-regulated when compared with the viability of the cells transfected with miR-873 and pcMV6, respectively (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the number of colonies formed by U87 and by U373 cells overexpressing the IGF2BP1 protein increased by 1.85- and 1.84-fold when compared with the number of colonies formed by the corresponding cells transfected with miR-873 mimics and pcMV6, respectively (Fig. 5, D and E). IGF2BP1 overexpression decreased the apoptosis rate of U87 cells expressing miR-873 by 0.27-fold and decreased the rate of U373 cells by 0.07-fold (Fig. 5F). The Transwell migration system showed that the percentage of migrated U87 cells co-transfected with miR-873 mimics and pcMV6/IGF2BP1 increased 1.17-fold and that of migrated U373 cells increased 0.98-fold when compared with their counterparts co-transfected with miR-873 and pcMV6 (Fig. 5G). In line with the previous data, the up-regulation of IGF2BP1 expression increased the invasiveness of U87 cells and U373 cells transfected with miR-873 mimics by 1.3- and 2.12-fold, respectively (Fig. 5H). IGF2BP1 helps to stabilize the mRNA transcript. As described previously, the binding of IGF2BP1 to c-MYC and MKI67 mRNA prevented mRNA degradation and increased mRNA expression (17Gutschner T.

IGF2BP1 promotes cell migration by regulating MK5 and PTEN signaling.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 176-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To verify that the down-regulation of IGF2BP1 expression due to the up-regulation of miR-873 in GBM cells could destabilize c-MYC, MKI67, CD44, and PTEN mRNA, we measured the mRNA levels of these potential target transcripts of IGF2BP1. The real-time RT-PCR assays showed that the cellular level of MKI67 mRNA and c-MYC mRNA decreased by 0.61- and 0.53-fold in U87 cells, respectively, when compared with the level in the control group, in which the tumor cells were transfected with miR-control mimics rather than miR-873 mimics (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the amount of PTEN mRNA and CD44 mRNA decreased by 0.78- and 0.81-fold in U87 cells (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, transfecting U373 cell with miR-873 mimics decreased the target transcripts when compared with the level in the control group (Fig. 6, C and D). These results suggested that miR-873 might decrease the level of c-MYC, MKI67, CD44, and PTEN mRNA by down-regulating the expression of the IGF2BP1 gene in GBM cells. Furthermore, the following Western blotting assays showed that the low level of target transcripts corresponded to a low level of protein expression in GBM cells (Fig. 6, E and F). Because IGF2BP1 overexpression partially mitigated the negative impact of miR-873 mimics on the progression of GBM, the molecular mechanism of the inhibition of miR-873 during the carcinogenesis and metastasis of GBM may involve the dysregulation of IGF2BP1 expression. To prove this hypothesis, we determined the expression level of IGF2BP1 mRNA and protein in GBM. The IGF2BP1 expression levels were significantly higher in tumor tissues than in corresponding normal adjacent tissues (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, the expression of IGF2BP1 mRNA was also increased in GBM cell lines, including A172, T98G, U87, U373, U251, and U138, when compared with the expression in normal brain tissue (Fig. 7B). Moreover, we observed a significant negative correlation between the IGF2BP1 mRNA levels and miR-873 levels (r = −0.9480, p < 0.05) in GBM tissues (Fig. 7C). The inverse relationship indicated that when IGF2BP1 turnover is decreased (more IGF2BP1 mRNA), miR-873 levels are decreased. The immunohistochemistry staining of tissue sections showed that the IGF2BP1 level was markedly higher in GBM tissues than in normal tissue (Fig. 7D). These data support that the down-regulation of miR-873 expression in GBM induced carcinogenesis and metastasis by promoting the expression of IGF2BP1, which stabilizes the mRNA transcripts of c-MYC, MKI67, PTEN, and CD44. Furthermore, the stabilization of the target mRNAs of IGF2BP1 ultimately promoted the expression of the corresponding genes (Fig. 7E).

Assessing species ranges and determination of processes underlying current species distributions are prerequisites to conservation planning and predicting faunal responses to changing environmental conditions. The abyssal central Pacific nodule belt, located between the Clarion and Clipperton Fracture Zones (CCZ), is an area prospected for mining of polymetallic nodules. We examined variations in genetic diversity and broad-scale connectivity of isopods and polychaetes across the CCZ. Faunal assemblages were studied from two mining claims (the eastern German and French license areas) located 1300 km apart and influenced by different productivity regimes. Using a reverse taxonomy approach based on DNA barcoding, we tested to what extent distance and large-scale changes in environmental parameters lead to differentiation in two macrofaunal taxa exhibiting different functions and life-history patterns. A fragment of the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit 1 (COI) was analyzed. At a 97% threshold the molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) corresponded well to morphological species. Molecular analyses indicated high local and regional diversity mostly because of large numbers of singletons in the samples. Consequently, variation in composition of genotypic clusters between sites was exceedingly large partly due to paucity of deep-sea sampling and faunal patchiness. A higher proportion of wide-ranging species in polychaetes was contrasted with mostly restricted distributions in isopods. Remarkably, several cryptic lineages appeared to be sympatric and occurred in taxa with putatively good dispersal abilities, whereas some brooding lineages revealed broad distributions across the CCZ. Geographic distance could explain variation in faunal connectivity between regions and sites to some extent, while assumed dispersal capabilities were not as important."

Due to its complex life cycle, the parasite is constantly exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS). We tested the influence of the pro-oxidant molecules H2O2 and the superoxide generator, Paraquat, as well as, metabolism products of the vector, with distinct redox status, in the proliferation and metacyclogenesis. These molecules are heme, hemozoin and urate. We also tested the antioxidants NAC and GSH. Heme induced the proliferation of epimastigotes and impaired the metacyclogenesis. β-hematin, did not affect epimastigote proliferation but decreased parasite differentiation. Conversely, we show that urate, GSH and NAC dramatically impaired epimastigote proliferation and during metacyclogenesis, NAC and urate induced a significant increment of trypomastigotes and decreased the percentage of epimastigotes. We also quantified the parasite loads in the anterior and posterior midguts and in the rectum of the vector by qPCR. The treatment with the antioxidants increased the parasite loads in all midgut sections analyzed. In vivo, the group of vectors fed with reduced molecules showed an increment of trypomastigotes and decreased epimastigotes when analyzed by differential counting. Heme stimulated proliferation by increasing the cell number in the S and G2/M phases, whereas NAC arrested epimastigotes in G1 phase. NAC greatly increased the percentage of trypomastigotes. Taken together, these data show a shift in the triatomine gut microenvironment caused by the redox status may also influence T. cruzi biology inside the vector. In this scenario, oxidants act to turn on epimastigote proliferation while antioxidants seem to switch the cycle towards metacyclogenesis. This is a new insight that defines a key role for redox metabolism in governing the parasitic life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1973292391,"Studies of animal impulsivity generally find steep subjective devaluation, or discounting, of delayed rewards - often on the order of a 50% reduction in value in a few seconds. Because such steep discounting is highly disfavored in evolutionary models of time preference, we hypothesize that discounting tasks provide a poor measure of animals' true time preferences. One prediction of this hypothesis is that estimates of time preferences based on these tasks will lack external validity, i.e. fail to predict time preferences in other contexts. We examined choices made by four rhesus monkeys in a computerized patch-leaving foraging task interleaved with a standard intertemporal choice task. Monkeys were significantly more patient in the foraging task than in the intertemporal choice task. Patch-leaving behavior was well fit by parameter-free optimal foraging equations but poorly fit by the hyperbolic discount parameter obtained from the intertemporal choice task. Day-to-day variation in time preferences across the two tasks was uncorrelated with each other. These data are consistent with the conjecture that seemingly impulsive behavior in animals is an artifact of their difficulty understanding the structure of intertemporal choice tasks, and support the idea that animals are more efficient rate maximizers in the multi-second range than intertemporal choice tasks would suggest."
https://openalex.org/W2067167273,"Prostate cancer remains the second highest contributor to male cancer-related lethality. The transition of a subset of tumors from indolent to invasive disease is associated with a poor clinical outcome. Activation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) genetic program is a major risk factor for cancer progression. We recently reported that secreted extracellular Hsp90 (eHsp90) initiates EMT in prostate cancer cells, coincident with its enhanced expression in mesenchymal models. Our current work substantially extended these findings in defining a pathway linking eHsp90 signaling to EZH2 function, a methyltransferase of the Polycomb repressor complex. EZH2 is also implicated in EMT activation, and its up-regulation represents one of the most frequent epigenetic alterations during prostate cancer progression. We have now highlighted a novel epigenetic function for eHsp90 via its modulation of EZH2 expression and activity. Mechanistically, eHsp90 initiated sustained activation of MEK/ERK, a signal critical for facilitating EZH2 transcriptional up-regulation and recruitment to the E-cadherin promoter. We further demonstrated that an eHsp90-EZH2 pathway orchestrates an expanded repertoire of EMT-related events including Snail and Twist expression, tumor cell motility, and anoikis resistance. To evaluate the role of eHsp90 in vivo, eHsp90 secretion was stably enforced in a prostate cancer cell line resembling indolent disease. Remarkably, eHsp90 was sufficient to induce tumor growth, suppress E-cadherin, and initiate localized invasion, events that are exquisitely dependent upon EZH2 function. In summary, our findings illuminate a hitherto unknown epigenetic function for eHsp90 and support a model wherein tumor eHsp90 functions as a rheostat for EZH2 expression and activity to orchestrate mesenchymal properties and coincident aggressive behavior."

SIRT1 is believed to inhibit apoptosis induced by certain types of DNA damage, including IR- and etoposide-induced double-strand breaks. However, our previous study suggests that SIRT1 promotes cell death in response to stimuli such as H2O2 (15Guan D. Lim J.H. Peng L. Liu Y. Lam M. Seto E. Kao H.Y.

Although the importance of SIRT1 in DDR is indisputable, post-translational modification regulation of SIRT1 in DDR has not been fully explored. Ubiquitin is a small, 76-amino acid protein containing 7 lysine residues, namely Lys-6, -11, -27, -29, -33, -48, and -63 (16Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6878) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is the process by which a cysteine in ubiquitin is covalently linked to a lysine in a protein or another ubiquitin. Typical Lys-48-mediated polyubiquitination usually targets the substrate protein to proteasome-mediated degradation. Atypical polyubiquitination, which is mediated by Lys-6, -11, -27, -29, -33, and -63, regulates non-proteolytic functions such as enzymatic activity, protein interaction, and cellular localization. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination are important for proper DDR. For example, p53 protein is maintained at a low level under normal conditions by ubiquitination-mediated degradation involving MDM2 E3 ligase. The stability of p53 increases after DNA damage by the loss of interaction with MDM2 and a subsequent reduction in ubiquitination (17Jackson S.P. Durocher D.

Seto E. SIRT1 deacetylates the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein and alters its activities.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4720-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using either Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or PolyJetTM (SignaGen Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. S1-KD cells were generated using RNAi, in which a SIRT1-coding DNA sequence was targeted by a pSuper shRNA construct containing interfering oligonucleotides (5′-GTTGGATGATATGACACTG-3′). To restore SIRT1 expression in HeLa S1-KD cells, the silent mutant coding DNA sequence of SIRT1, in which the GTTGGATGATATGACACTG template sequence was modified to GTTAGACGACATGACCCTC by multisite-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), was inserted into the pLenti-CMV-neo-DEST vector (Addgene plasmid 17392) using the Gateway recombination strategy (Invitrogen). 293FT cells were transfected with pLenti-CMV-neo-DEST-SIRT1 together with pLP1, pLP2, and pLP3 plasmids to package SIRT1 lentivirus as described previously (28Campeau E. Ruhl V.E. Rodier F. Smith C.L. Rahmberg B.L. Fuss J.O. Campisi J. Yaswen P. Cooper P.K. Kaufman P.D. A versatile viral system for expression and depletion of proteins in mammalian cells.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6529Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). HeLa S1-KD cells were then transduced by lentivirus harvested from 293FT culture medium in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. Twenty-four hours post-infection, culture medium was supplemented with 600 μg/ml G418 and 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. Single cell-derived clones were isolated and transferred to new dishes. SIRT1 expression in these stable clones was verified by Western blot analysis. Cellular fractionation was conducted using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). These assays were performed as described previously (26Peng L. Yuan Z. Ling H. Fukasawa K. Robertson K. Olashaw N. Koomen J. Chen J. Lane W.S. Seto E. SIRT1 deacetylates the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein and alters its activities.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4720-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Some Western blot results were quantified by densitometric analysis using Image J software (National Institutes of Health). Ubiquitination assays were performed in vivo using either the HA-tagged (29Choo Y.S. Zhang Z. Detection of protein ubiquitination.J. Vis. Exp. 2009; 30: 1293PubMed Google Scholar) or the histidine-tagged (27Pan Y. Chen J. MDM2 promotes ubiquitination and degradation of MDMX.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5113-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) ubiquitination method. In the HA-Ub method, cells were co-transfected with SIRT1 and HA-Ub. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (2% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 150 mm NaCl) and immediately boiled for 10 min. Cells were sonicated for three pulses of 10 s each, and cell lysates were diluted with 900 μl dilution buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton). SIRT1 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed for ubiquitination by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. In the His-Ub method, cells were co-transfected with FLAG-SIRT1 and His-Ub. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were dissolved in lysis buffer (6 m guanidinium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm imidazole, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). His-tagged proteins were captured using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) beads and eluted with imidazole. The presence of SIRT1 in the eluted fraction was analyzed by Western blot. The in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed as described previously (27Pan Y. Chen J. MDM2 promotes ubiquitination and degradation of MDMX.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5113-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). GST, GST-MDM2, and GST-SIRT1 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-agarose beads. Two μg of GST-SIRT1 was incubated with 40 ng of UBE1 (E1), 200 ng UBcH5C (E2), and 2 μg His-Ub together with 500 ng of GST-MDM2 or GST in reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP) at 30 °C for 2 h with agitation. The reaction mixture was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Polyubiquitination of GST-SIRT1 was detected using anti-SIRT1 antibody. The membrane was stripped using stripping buffer (Pierce) and re-probed for autoubiquitination of GST-MDM2 using anti-MDM2 antibody. For in vivo deacetylation assays, HeLa cells were co-transfected with FLAG-p53 and either WT or mutant SIRT1. At 32 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 400 ng/ml trichostatin A for 4 h. Cells were lysed in NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 20 mm sodium butyrate. Whole-cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. p53 acetylation was detected using anti-Ac-K382 p53 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). In vitro deacetylation assays were performed using a fluorometric assay kit (Fluor-de-Lys®SIRT1 fluorometric drug discovery assay kit, Enzo Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence was measured using the EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, excitation 360 nm and emission 460 nm). HeLa cells were treated with 5 μm etoposide (Sigma) for 24 h, 100 μm H2O2 for 2 h or left untreated. Twenty-four hours later, cells were detached using EDTA buffer without trypsin and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To detect apoptosis and necrosis, cells were stained with 1 μg/ml FITC-labeled annexin V (BD Biosciences) for 15 min in the dark, washed with PBS, and then incubated with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Apoptosis and necrosis were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). To examine SIRT1 ubiquitination in vivo, 293T cells were co-transfected with Myc-SIRT1 and either HA-tagged Ub or a vector control. Ubiquitination of immunoprecipitated SIRT1 was detected by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. Our data suggested that SIRT1 was ubiquitinated, as indicated by a protein ladder above the predicted SIRT1 band of 120 kDa (Fig. 1A). To exclude the possibility of contamination from a SIRT1-interacting protein, a stringent guanidinium HCl-urea denaturation method was performed as described previously (27Pan Y. Chen J. MDM2 promotes ubiquitination and degradation of MDMX.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5113-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In these experiments FLAG-SIRT1 was co-expressed with His-tagged Ub, and then ubiquitinated (His-tagged) proteins were denatured by guanidinium HCl and pulled down using nickel resin. The presence of ubiquitinated SIRT1 was detected using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1B). Because SIRT1 is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (30Jin Q. Yan T. Ge X. Sun C. Shi X. Zhai Q.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14855-14860Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), we examined the localization of ubiquitinated SIRT1 in cellular fractions. We found that ubiquitinated SIRT1 was localized in both compartments (Fig. 1C). The MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase is responsible for p53 ubiquitination and degradation and plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DDR (34Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N.

DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of p53 alleviates inhibition by MDM2.Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). To determine whether MDM2 modifies SIRT1, we first examined SIRT1 and MDM2 interaction using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 1D, exogenous Myc-SIRT1 co-immunoprecipitated with ectopically expressed MDM2 (left panel). Nutlin, which stabilizes endogenous MDM2, strengthens the endogenous interaction between MDM2 and SIRT1 (right panel). Overexpression of MDM2 dramatically enhanced SIRT1 ubiquitination in vivo (Fig. 1E). Using the guanidinium HCl-urea denaturation method, we still found that SIRT1 was ubiquitinated by MDM2 as detected after high stringency washes of the nickel matrix (Fig. 1F). To examine SIRT1 ubiquitination by MDM2 in vitro, GST-SIRT1 was incubated with either GST-MDM2 or GST in the presence of purified ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, conjugating enzyme E2, ubiquitin, and ATP. GST-SIRT1 ubiquitination occurred in the presence of GST-MDM2 but not in the presence of GST alone (Fig. 1G). Autoubiquitination of GST-MDM2 was used as a control. To further confirm that MDM2 drives SIRT1 ubiquitination, A549 cells were treated with Nutlin, and ubiquitination of endogenous SIRT1 was examined. Nutlin treatment significantly increased MDM2 protein levels and SIRT1 ubiquitination (Fig. 1H). Together, our results unequivocally demonstrate that MDM2 ubiquitinates SIRT1 both in vivo and in vitro. To determine whether SIRT1 ubiquitination is regulated by DNA damage signals, FLAG-SIRT1 was co-expressed in 293T cells with HA-Ub. SIRT1 ubiquitination was analyzed at different time points after treatment with the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, which induces double-strand breaks. SIRT1 ubiquitination significantly increased 2 h after etoposide treatment (Fig. 2A). We examined SIRT1 ubiquitination after exposure to IR. Our data demonstrate that SIRT1 ubiquitination increased dramatically 1 h after IR treatment and then returned to basal levels after 4 h (Fig. 2B). Endogenous SIRT1 ubiquitination was similarly regulated by IR (Fig. 2C). SIRT1 ubiquitination also was affected by H2O2-induced oxidative damage (Fig. 2D). Therefore, SIRT1 ubiquitination is dynamically regulated in response to different types of DNA damaging agents. We used mass spectrometry (MS) to identify the SIRT1 lysines that were modified by ubiquitination. Together with an earlier report on the global quantification of ubiquitination in cells (22Wagner S.A. Beli P. Weinert B.T. Nielsen M.L. Cox J. Mann M. Choudhary C. A proteome-wide, quantitative survey of in vivo ubiquitylation sites reveals widespread regulatory roles.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.M111.013284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar), we and others identified at least six ubiquitinated SIRT1 lysine residues (Lys-238, -311, -499, -506, -578, and -630) (data not shown). To biochemically verify the MS results, a series of lysine-to-arginine SIRT1 mutants was generated and ubiquitination examined as described previously. Mutation of Lsy-311, but not any other candidate lysine, significantly reduced SIRT1 ubiquitination (Fig. 2E). Moreover, MDM2 was unable to ubiquitinate SIRT1 if Lsy-311 was mutated (Fig. 2F). Therefore, although SIRT1 contains multiple ubiquitination sites, we conclude that Lsy-311 is the major SIRT1 lysine that undergoes ubiquitination. SIRT1 plays important regulatory roles in cell death and survival in response to DNA damage (7Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Ng Eaton E. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L.

To address the functional implication of SIRT1 ubiquitination during DDR, we produced stable SIRT1 knockdown (KD) HeLa cells and analyzed cell survival rescue after etoposide treatment in the presence of WT or K311R SIRT1. SIRT1 expression was monitored by Western blot analysis. Cell survival was analyzed as described previously (36Peng L. Ling H. Yuan Z. Fang B. Bloom G. Fukasawa K. Koomen J. Chen J. Lane W.S. Seto E. SIRT1 negatively regulates the activities, functions, and protein levels of hMOF and TIP60.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 2823-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). SIRT1 KD cells exhibited greater cell death and reduced survival after etoposide treatment than cells treated with the vehicle control (C). Expression of WT SIRT1 (KD-WT), but not K311R SIRT1, reduced apoptosis and increased cell survival after etoposide treatment compared with that of the vector control (KD-V) (Fig. 3, A and B). The role of SIRT1 in cell death and survival depends on the type of DNA damage sustained. For example, SIRT1 is required for H2O2-induced cell death (15Guan D. Lim J.H. Peng L. Liu Y. Lam M. Seto E.

Indeed, human epidemiological studies and animal experiments suggest that different type of fatty acids consumption during pregnancy affect offspring development and susceptibility to metabolic disorders. Epigenetic changes are thought to be elicited by dietary factors during critical timing of development. microRNAs (miRNAs) are versatile regulators of gene expression. Thus, we aimed to determine the influence of different fatty acids on miRNA expression in offspring when given during early pregnancy. We fed pregnant either soybean (SO), olive (OO), fish (FO), linseed (LO), or palm-oil (PO) diets from conception to day 12 of gestation; and standard diet thereafter. miRNA expression was assessed in liver an adipose tissue of pregnant rats and their virgin counterparts. While liver concentrations of fatty acids in pregnant or virgin rats replicated those of the diets consumed during early pregnancy, their pups' liver tissue marginally reflected those of the respective experimental feeds. By contrast, the liver fatty acid profile of adult offsprings was similar, regardless of the diet fed during gestation. Different parental miRNAs were modulated by the different type of fatty acid: in adult offspring, miR-215, miR-10b, miR-26, miR-377-3p, miR-21, and miR-192 among others, were differentially modulated by the different fatty acids fed during early pregnancy. Overall, our results show that maternal consumption of different types of fatty acids during early pregnancy influences miRNA expression in both maternal and offspring tissues, which may epigenetically explain the long-term phenotypic changes of the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2022616949,"We analyzed the movements of Atlantic tuna (Thunnus thynnus L.) in the Mediterranean Sea using data from 2 archival tags and 37 pop-up satellite archival tags (PAT). Bluefin tuna ranging in size from 12 to 248 kg were tagged on board recreational boats in the western Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea between May and September during two different periods (2000 to 2001 and 2008 to 2012). Although tuna migrations between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean have been well reported, our results indicate that part of the bluefin tuna population remains in the Mediterranean basin for much of the year, revealing a more complex population structure. In this study we demonstrate links between the western Mediterranean, the Adriatic and the Gulf of Sidra (Libya) using over 4336 recorded days of location and behavior data from tagged bluefin tuna with a maximum track length of 394 days. We described the oceanographic preferences and horizontal behaviors during the spawning season for 4 adult bluefin tuna. We also analyzed the time series data that reveals the vertical behavior of one pop-up satellite tag recovered, which was attached to a 43.9 kg tuna. This fish displayed a unique diving pattern within 16 days of the spawning season, suggesting a use of the thermocline as a thermoregulatory mechanism compatible with spawning. The results obtained hereby confirm that the Mediterranean is clearly an important habitat for this species, not only as spawning ground, but also as an overwintering foraging ground."
https://openalex.org/W1975597502,"Caffeine (1, 3, 7-trimethylxanthine), an alkaloid produced by plants, has antioxidant and insecticide properties that can affect metabolism and cognition. In vertebrates, the metabolites derived from caffeine have been identified, and their functions have been characterized. However, the metabolites of caffeine in insects remain unknown. Thus, using radiolabelled caffeine, we have identified some of the primary caffeine metabolites produced in the body of Drosophila melanogaster males, including theobromine, paraxanthine and theophylline. In contrast to mammals, theobromine was the predominant metabolite (paraxanthine in humans; theophylline in monkeys; 1, 3, 7-trimethyluric acid in rodents). A transcriptomic screen of Drosophila flies exposed to caffeine revealed the coordinated variation of a large set of genes that encode xenobiotic-metabolizing proteins, including several cytochromes P450s (CYPs) that were highly overexpressed. Flies treated with metyrapone—an inhibitor of CYP enzymes—showed dramatically decreased caffeine metabolism, indicating that CYPs are involved in this process. Using interference RNA genetic silencing, we measured the metabolic and transcriptomic effect of three candidate CYPs. Silencing of CYP6d5 completely abolished theobromine synthesis, whereas CYP6a8 and CYP12d1 silencing induced different consequences on metabolism and gene expression. Therefore, we characterized several metabolic products and some enzymes potentially involved in the degradation of caffeine. In conclusion, this pioneer approach to caffeine metabolism in insects opens novel perspectives for the investigation of the physiological effects of caffeine metabolites. It also indicates that caffeine could be used as a biomarker to evaluate CYP phenotypes in Drosophila and other insects."
https://openalex.org/W2032879780,"The stratum corneum (SC) provides a permeability barrier that limits the inflow and outflow of water. The permeability barrier is continuously and dynamically formed, maintained, and degraded along the depth, from the bottom to the top, of the SC. Naturally, its functioning and structure also change dynamically in a depth-dependent manner. While transepidermal water loss is typically used to assess the function of the SC barrier, it fails to provide any information about the dynamic mechanisms that are responsible for the depth-dependent characteristics of the permeability barrier. This paper aims to quantitatively characterize the depth-dependency of the permeability barrier using in vivo non-invasive measurement data for understanding the underlying mechanisms for barrier formation, maintenance, and degradation. As a framework to combine existing experimental data, we propose a mathematical model of the SC, consisting of multiple compartments, to explicitly address and investigate the depth-dependency of the SC permeability barrier. Using this mathematical model, we derive a measure of the water permeability barrier, i.e. resistance to water diffusion in the SC, from the measurement data on transepidermal water loss and water concentration profiles measured non-invasively by Raman spectroscopy. The derived resistance profiles effectively characterize the depth-dependency of the permeability barrier, with three distinct regions corresponding to formation, maintenance, and degradation of the barrier. Quantitative characterization of the obtained resistance profiles allows us to compare and evaluate the permeability barrier of skin with different morphology and physiology (infants vs adults, different skin sites, before and after application of oils) and elucidates differences in underlying mechanisms of processing barriers. The resistance profiles were further used to predict the spatial-temporal effects of skin treatments by in silico experiments, in terms of spatial-temporal dynamics of percutaneous water penetration."
https://openalex.org/W1992305088,"Background Maternity care is an integrated care process, which consists of different services, involves different professionals and covers different time windows. To measure performance of maternity care based on clients' experiences, we developed and validated a questionnaire. Methods and Findings We used the 8-domain WHO Responsiveness model, and previous materials to develop a self-report questionnaire. A dual study design was used for development and validation. Content validity of the ReproQ-version-0 was determined through structured interviews with 11 pregnant women (≥28 weeks), 10 women who recently had given birth (≤12 weeks), and 19 maternity care professionals. Structured interviews established the domain relevance to the women; all items were separately commented on. All Responsiveness domains were judged relevant, with Dignity and Communication ranking highest. Main missing topic was the assigned expertise of the health professional. After first adaptation, construct validity of the ReproQ-version-1 was determined through a web-based survey. Respondents were approached by maternity care organizations with different levels of integration of services of midwives and obstetricians. We sent questionnaires to 605 third trimester pregnant women (response 65%), and 810 women 6 weeks after delivery (response 55%). Construct validity was based on: response patterns; exploratory factor analysis; association of the overall score with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), known group comparisons. Median overall ReproQ score was 3.70 (range 1–4) showing good responsiveness. The exploratory factor analysis supported the assumed domain structure and suggested several adaptations. Correlation of the VAS rating and overall ReproQ score (antepartum, postpartum) supported validity (r = 0.56; 0.59, p<0.001 Spearman's correlation coefficient). Pre-stated group comparisons confirmed the expected difference following a good vs. adverse birth outcome. Fully integrated organizations performed slightly better (median = 3.78) than less integrated organizations (median = 3.63; p<0.001). Participation rate of women with a low educational level and/or a non-western origin was low. Conclusions The ReproQ appears suitable for assessing quality of maternity care from the clients' perspective. Recruitment of disadvantaged groups requires additional non-digital approaches."

Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of undiagnosed (sub clinical) depression and associated risk factors among hypertensive patients attending a tertiary health care clinic in Nepal.The study was based on a cross-sectional study design, with 321 hypertensive patients attending the Out-Patient Department of a central hospital in Nepal. Blood measure was recorded via a mercury column sphygmomanometer. Depression levels were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-Ia (BDI) scale. Demographics and risk factors were assessed.The proportion of participants with undiagnosed depression was 15%. Multivariable analyses demonstrated an increase in BDI scores with increased aging. Approximately a 1 point increase in the BDI score was observed for each additional decade of aging in hypertensive patients. Additional factors associated with increased risk of depression included being female (4.28 point BDI score increase), smoking (5.61 point BDI score increase), being hypertensive with no hypertensive medication (4.46 point BDI score increase) and being illiterate (4.46 point BDI score increase).Among persons with hypertension in outpatient settings in Nepal, demographic (age, sex, education), behavioural (smoking,) and adherence factors (anti-hypertensive medication) were associated with undiagnosed depression.

https://openalex.org/W2166318808,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant public health problem worldwide, but the ecology of the prevalent mycobacterial strains, and their transmission, can vary depending on country and region. Chile is a country with low incidence of TB, that has a geographically isolated location in relation to the rest of South American countries due to the Andes Mountains, but recent migration from neighboring countries has changed this situation. We aimed to assess the genotypic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains in Santiago, Chile, and compare with reports from other Latin-American countries. We analyzed MTBC isolates from pulmonary tuberculosis cases collected between years 2008 and 2013 in Central Santiago, using two genotyping methods: spoligotyping and 12-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTRs). Data obtained were analyzed and compared to the SITVIT2 database. Mean age of the patients was 47.5 years and 61% were male; 11.6% were migrants. Of 103 strains (1 isolate/patient) included, there were 56 distinct spoligotype patterns. Of these, 16 strains (15.5%) corresponded to orphan strains in the SITVIT2 database, not previously reported. Latin American and Mediterranean (LAM) (34%) and T (33%) lineages were the most prevalent strains, followed by Haarlem lineage (16.5%). Beijing family was scarcely represented with only two cases (1.9%), one of them isolated from a Peruvian migrant. The most frequent clustered spoligotypes were SIT33/LAM3 (10.7%), SIT53/T1 (8.7%), SIT50/H3 (7.8%), and SIT37/T3 (6.8%). We conclude that LAM and T genotypes are the most prevalent genotypes of MTBC in Santiago, Chile, and together correspond to almost two thirds of analyzed strains, which is similar to strain distribution reported from other countries of Latin America. Nevertheless, the high proportion of SIT37/T3, which was rarely found in other Latin American countries, may underline a specific history or demographics of Chile related to probable human migrations and evolutions."
https://openalex.org/W2000510089,"We examined six types of cells that form the ovary of the earthworm Dendrobena veneta ogonia, prooocytes, vitellogenic oocytes, trophocytes, fully grown postvitellogenic oocytes and somatic cells of the gonad. The quantitative stereological method revealed a much higher “volume density” of mitochondria in all of the types of germ-line cells except for the somatic cells. Fluorescent vital stain JC-1, however, showed a much higher oxidative activity of mitochondria in the somatic cells than in the germ-line cells. The distribution of active and inactive mitochondria within the studied cells was assessed using the computer program ImageJ. The analysis showed a higher luminosity of inactive mitochondria in all of the types of germ-line cells and a higher luminosity of active mitochondria in somatic cells. The OXPHOS activity was found in somatic cells mitochondria and in the peripheral mitochondria of the vitellogenic oocytes. The detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) revealed a differentiated distribution of ROS in the different cell types. The amount of ROS substances was lower in somatic cells than in younger germ-line cells. The ROS level was also low in the cytoplasm of fully grown postwitellogenic oocytes. The distribution of the MnSOD enzyme that protects mitochondria against destructive role of ROS substances was high in the oogonia and in prooocytes and it was very high in vitellogenic and postvitellogenic oocytes. However, a much lower level of this protective enzyme was observed in the trophocytes and the lowest level was found in the cytoplasm of somatic cells. The lower mitochondrial activity and higher level of MnSOD activity in germ-line cells when compared to somatic cells testifies to the necessity of the organisms to protect the mitochondria of oocytes against the destructive role of the ROS that are produced during oxidative phosphorylation. The protection of the mitochondria in oocytes is essential for the transfer of healthy organelles to the next generation."
https://openalex.org/W1970424644,"Defining the conformational states of cytochrome P450 active sites is critical for the design of agents that minimize drug-drug interactions, the development of isoform-specific P450 inhibitors, and the engineering of novel oxidative catalysts. We used two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC chemical shift perturbation mapping of 15N-labeled Phe residues and x-ray crystallography to examine the ligand-dependent conformational dynamics of CYP119. Active site Phe residues were most affected by the binding of azole inhibitors and fatty acid substrates, in agreement with active site localization of the conformational changes. This was supported by crystallography, which revealed movement of the F-G loop with various azoles. Nevertheless, the NMR chemical shift perturbations caused by azoles and substrates were distinguishable. The absence of significant chemical shift perturbations with several azoles revealed binding of ligands to an open conformation similar to that of the ligand-free state. In contrast, 4-phenylimidazole caused pronounced NMR changes involving Phe-87, Phe-144, and Phe-153 that support the closed conformation found in the crystal structure. The same closed conformation is observed by NMR and crystallography with a para-fluoro substituent on the 4-phenylimidazole, but a para-chloro or bromo substituent engendered a second closed conformation. An open conformation is thus favored in solution with many azole ligands, but para-substituted phenylimidazoles give rise to two closed conformations that depend on the size of the para-substituent. The results suggest that ligands selectively stabilize discrete cytochrome P450 conformational states. Defining the conformational states of cytochrome P450 active sites is critical for the design of agents that minimize drug-drug interactions, the development of isoform-specific P450 inhibitors, and the engineering of novel oxidative catalysts. We used two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC chemical shift perturbation mapping of 15N-labeled Phe residues and x-ray crystallography to examine the ligand-dependent conformational dynamics of CYP119. Active site Phe residues were most affected by the binding of azole inhibitors and fatty acid substrates, in agreement with active site localization of the conformational changes. This was supported by crystallography, which revealed movement of the F-G loop with various azoles. Nevertheless, the NMR chemical shift perturbations caused by azoles and substrates were distinguishable. The absence of significant chemical shift perturbations with several azoles revealed binding of ligands to an open conformation similar to that of the ligand-free state. In contrast, 4-phenylimidazole caused pronounced NMR changes involving Phe-87, Phe-144, and Phe-153 that support the closed conformation found in the crystal structure. The same closed conformation is observed by NMR and crystallography with a para-fluoro substituent on the 4-phenylimidazole, but a para-chloro or bromo substituent engendered a second closed conformation.

https://openalex.org/W2012038017,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly dynamic organelle that plays a critical role in many cellular processes. Abnormal ER morphology is associated with some human diseases, although little is known regarding how ER morphology is regulated. Using a forward genetic screen to identify genes that regulated ER morphology in Drosophila, we identified a mutant of Sec22, the orthologs of which in yeast, plants, and humans are required for ER to Golgi trafficking. However, the physiological function of Sec22 has not been previously investigated in animal development. A loss of Sec22 resulted in ER proliferation and expansion, enlargement of late endosomes, and abnormal Golgi morphology in mutant larvae fat body cells. However, starvation-induced autophagy was not affected by a loss of Sec22. Mosaic analysis of the eye revealed that Sec22 was required for photoreceptor morphogenesis. In Sec22 mutant photoreceptor cells, the ER was highly expanded and gradually lost normal morphology with aging. The rhabdomeres in mutants were small and sometimes fused with each other. The morphology of Sec22 mutant eyes resembled the eye morphology of flies with overexpressed eyc (eyes closed). eyc encodes for a Drosophila p47 protein that is required for membrane fusion. A loss of Syntaxin5 (Syx5), encoding for a t-SNARE on Golgi, also phenocopied the Sec22 mutant. Sec22 formed complexes with Syx5 and Eyc. Thus, we propose that appropriate trafficking between the ER and Golgi is required for maintaining ER morphology and for Drosophila eye morphogenesis."

Although studies in radiation countermeasures were initiated a half century ago, an effective therapy for a radiomitigator has not been identified. Ghrelin is a gastrointestinal hormone, and administration of ghrelin is protective in animal models of injuries including radiation combined injury. To test whether ghrelin can be protective in whole body irradiaton (WBI) alone, male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were treated with human ghrelin (20 nmol/rat) daily for 6 days starting at either 24 h or 48 h after 10 Gray (Gy) WBI and survival outcome was examined. The 10 Gy WBI produced a LD70/30 model in SD rats (30% survival in 30 days). The survival rate in rats treated with ghrelin starting at 24 h was significantly improved to 63% and when treatment was initiated at 48 h, the survival remained at 61%. At 7 days post WBI, plasma ghrelin was significantly reduced from the control value. Ghrelin treatment starting at 24 h after WBI daily for 6 days improved histological appearance of the intestine, reduced gut permeability, serum endotoxin levels and bacterial translocation to the liver by 38%, 42% and 61%, respectively at day 7 post WBI. Serum glucose and albumin were restored to near control levels with treatment. Ghrelin treatment also attenuated WBI-induced intestinal apoptosis by 62% as evidenced by TUNEL staining. The expression of anti-apoptotic cell regulator Bcl-xl was decreased by 38% in the vehicle and restored to 75% of the control with ghrelin treatment. Increased expression of intestinal CD73 and pAkt were observed with ghrelin treatment, indicating protection of the intestinal epithelium after WBI. These results indicate that human ghrelin attenuates intestinal injury and mortality after WBI. Thus, human ghrelin can be developed as a novel mitigator for radiation injury."
https://openalex.org/W2166531930,"Literature containing supra-natural, or magical events has enchanted generations of readers. When reading narratives describing such events, readers mentally simulate a text world different from the real one. The corresponding violation of world-knowledge during this simulation likely increases cognitive processing demands for ongoing discourse integration, catches readers’ attention, and might thus contribute to the pleasure and deep emotional experience associated with ludic immersive reading. In the present study, we presented participants in an MR scanner with passages selected from the Harry Potter book series, half of which described magical events, while the other half served as control condition. Passages in both conditions were closely matched for relevant psycholinguistic variables including, e.g., emotional valence and arousal, passage-wise mean word imageability and frequency, and syntactic complexity. Post-hoc ratings showed that readers considered supra-natural contents more surprising and more strongly associated with reading pleasure than control passages. In the fMRI data, we found stronger neural activation for the supra-natural than the control condition in bilateral inferior frontal gyri, bilateral inferior parietal lobules, left fusiform gyrus, and left amygdala. The increased activation in the amygdala (part of the salience and emotion processing network) appears to be associated with feelings of surprise and the reading pleasure, which supra-natural events, full of novelty and unexpectedness, brought about. The involvement of bilateral inferior frontal gyri likely reflects higher cognitive processing demand due to world knowledge violations, whereas increased attention to supra-natural events is reflected in inferior frontal gyri and inferior parietal lobules that are part of the fronto-parietal attention network."
https://openalex.org/W1991412767,"2′-deoxy-5-ethynyluridine (EdU) has been previously shown to be a cell poison whose toxicity depends on the particular cell line. The reason is not known. Our data indicates that different efficiency of EdU incorporation plays an important role. The EdU-mediated toxicity was elevated by the inhibition of 2′-deoxythymidine 5′-monophosphate synthesis. EdU incorporation resulted in abnormalities of the cell cycle including the slowdown of the S phase and a decrease in DNA synthesis. The slowdown but not the cessation of the first cell division after EdU administration was observed in all of the tested cell lines. In HeLa cells, a 10 μM EdU concentration led to the cell death in the 100% of cells probably due to the activation of an intra S phase checkpoint in the subsequent S phase. Our data also indicates that this EdU concentration induces interstrand DNA crosslinks in HeLa cells. We suppose that these crosslinks are the primary DNA damage resulting in cell death. According to our results, the EdU-mediated toxicity is further increased by the inhibition of thymidylate synthase by EdU itself at its higher concentrations."

Fab. on peanut crop at six locations in India using MarkSim, which provides General Circulation Model (GCM) of future data on daily maximum (T.max), minimum (T.min) air temperatures from six models viz., BCCR-BCM2.0, CNRM-CM3, CSIRO-Mk3.5, ECHams5, INCM-CM3.0 and MIROC3.2 along with an ensemble of the six from three emission scenarios (A2, A1B and B1). This data was used to predict the future pest scenarios following the growing degree days approach in four different climate periods viz., Baseline-1975, Near future (NF) -2020, Distant future (DF)-2050 and Very Distant future (VDF)—2080. It is predicted that more generations would occur during the three future climate periods with significant variation among scenarios and models. Among the seven models, 1–2 additional generations were predicted during DF and VDF due to higher future temperatures in CNRM-CM3, ECHams5 & CSIRO-Mk3.5 models. The temperature projections of these models indicated that the generation time would decrease by 18–22% over baseline. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to partition the variation in the predicted number of generations and generation time of S. litura on peanut during crop season. Geographical location explained 34% of the total variation in number of generations, followed by time period (26%), model (1.74%) and scenario (0.74%). The remaining 14% of the variation was explained by interactions. Increased number of generations and reduction of generation time across the six peanut growing locations of India suggest that the incidence of S. litura may increase due to projected increase in temperatures in future climate change periods."
https://openalex.org/W2010309783,"Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) causes mainly two types of disease. The first is disseminated disease in immunocompromised hosts, such as individuals infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The second is pulmonary disease in individuals without systemic immunosuppression, and the incidence of this type is increasing worldwide. M. avium subsp. hominissuis, a component of MAC, causes infection in pigs as well as in humans. Many aspects of the different modes of M. avium infection and its host specificity remain unclear. Here, we report the characteristics and complete sequence of a novel plasmid, designated pMAH135, derived from M. avium strain TH135 in an HIV-negative patient with pulmonary MAC disease. The pMAH135 plasmid consists of 194,711 nucleotides with an average G + C content of 66.5% and encodes 164 coding sequences (CDSs). This plasmid was unique in terms of its homology to other mycobacterial plasmids. Interestingly, it contains CDSs with sequence homology to mycobactin biosynthesis proteins and type VII secretion system-related proteins, which are involved in the pathogenicity of mycobacteria. It also contains putative conserved domains of the multidrug efflux transporter. Screening of isolates from humans and pigs for genes located on pMAH135 revealed that the detection rate of these genes was higher in clinical isolates from pulmonary MAC disease patients than in those from HIV-positive patients, whereas the genes were almost entirely absent in isolates from pigs. Moreover, variable number tandem repeats typing analysis showed that isolates carrying pMAH135 genes are grouped in a specific cluster. Collectively, the pMAH135 plasmid contains genes associated with M. avium’s pathogenicity and resistance to antimicrobial agents. The results of this study suggest that pMAH135 influence not only the pathological manifestations of MAC disease, but also the host specificity of MAC infection."
https://openalex.org/W2030339460,"The hangul (Cervus elaphus hanglu) is of great conservation concern because it represents the easternmost and only hope for an Asiatic survivor of the red deer species in the Indian subcontinent. Despite the rigorous conservation efforts of the Department of Wildlife Protection in Jammu & Kashmir, the hangul population has experienced a severe decline in numbers and range contraction in the past few decades. The hangul population once abundant in the past has largely become confined to the Dachigam landscape, with a recent population estimate of 218 individuals. We investigated the genetic variability and demographic history of the hangul population and found that it has shown a relatively low diversity estimates when compared to other red deer populations of the world. Neutrality tests, which are used to evaluate demographic effects, did not support population expansion, and the multimodal pattern of mismatch distribution indicated that the hangul population is under demographic equilibrium. Furthermore, the hangul population did not exhibit any signature of bottleneck footprints in the past, and Coalescent Bayesian Skyline plot analysis revealed that the population had not experienced any dramatic changes in the effective population size over the last several thousand years. We observed a strong evidence of sub-structuring in the population, wherein the majority of individuals were assigned to different clusters in Bayesian cluster analysis. Population viability analysis demonstrated insignificant changes in the mean population size, with a positive growth rate projected for the next hundred years. We discuss the phylogenetic status of hangul for the first time among the other red deer subspecies of the world and strongly recommend to upgrade hangul conservation status under IUCN that should be discrete from the other red deer subspecies of the world to draw more conservation attention from national and international bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2092684783,"Increasing evidence suggests that the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from placenta of fetal origin (fPMSCs) are superior to MSCs of other sources for cell therapy. Since the initial number of isolated MSCs is limited, in vitro propagation is often required to reach sufficient numbers of cells for therapeutic applications, during which MSCs may undergo genetic and/or epigenetic alterations that subsequently increase the probability of spontaneous malignant transformation. Thus, factors that influence genomic and epigenetic stability of MSCs following long-term expansions need to be clarified before cultured MSCs are employed for clinical settings. To date, the genetic and epigenetic stability of fPMSCs after long-term in vitro expansion has not been fully investigated. In this report, alterations to histone acetylation and consequence on the expression pattern of fPMSCs following in vitro propagation under serum-free conditions were explored. The results show that fPMSCs maintain their MSC characteristics before they reached a senescent state. Furthermore, acetylation modification patterns were changed in fPMSCs along with gradually increased global histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and expression of HDAC subtypes HDAC4, HDAC5 and HDAC6, as well as a down-regulated global histone H3/H4 acetylation during in vitro culturing. In line with the acetylation alterations, the expression of oncogenes Oct4, Sox2 and TERT were significantly decreased over the propagation period. Of note, the down-regulation of Oct4 was strongly associated with changes in acetylation. Intriguingly, telomere length in fPMSCs did not significantly change during the propagating process. These findings suggest that human fPMSCs may be a safe and reliable resource of MSCs and can be propagated under serum-free conditions with less risk of spontaneous malignancy, and warrants further validation in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2010544832,"Introduction Respiratory Muscle Weakness (RMW) has been defined when the maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) is lower than 70% of the predictive value. The prevalence of RMW in chronic heart failure patients is 30 to 50%. So far there are no studies on the prevalence of RMW in acute heart failure (AHF) patients. Objectives Evaluate the prevalence of RMW in patients admitted because of AHF and the condition of respiratory muscle strength on discharge from the hospital. Methods Sixty-three patients had their MIP measured on two occasions: at the beginning of the hospital stay, after they had reached respiratory, hemodynamic and clinical stability and before discharge from the hospital. The apparatus and technique to measure MIP were adapted because of age-related limitations of the patients. Data on cardiac ejection fraction, ECG, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and on the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) were collected. Results The mean age of the 63 patients under study was 75 years. On admission the mean ejection fraction was 33% (95% CI: 31–35) and the BNP hormone median value was 726.5 pg/ml (range: 217 to 2283 pg/ml); 65% of the patients used NIV. The median value of MIP measured after clinical stabilization was -52.7 cmH2O (range: -20 to -120 cmH2O); 76% of the patients had MIP values below 70% of the predictive value. On discharge, after a median hospital stay of 11 days, the median MIP was -53.5 cmH2O (range:-20 to -150 cmH2O); 71% of the patients maintained their MIP values below 70% of the predictive value. The differences found were not statistically significant. Conclusion Elderly patients admitted with AHF may present a high prevalence of RMW on admission; this condition may be maintained at similar levels on discharge in a large percentage of these patients, even after clinical stabilization of the heart condition."

At diagnosis 54 patients had localized appendiceal disease (f/m: 29/25). According to TNM 24% had Stage I, 70% had Stage II and 6% had Stage III. Twenty-nine patients had disseminated disease (f/m: 27/2). Chromogranin A, synaptophysin and p53 were positive in >90%. Serotonin was positive in 70%. Median Ki67 index was 32% (6-75%) and higher in Tang group C (50%) compared to group A (30%; p<0.0001), and group B (30%; p<0.004). All patients had surgery. Sixty-three (76%) had radical resections including all patients with localized disease. Median OS was 83 months. The 1-, 5- and 10-year survival rates were 90%, 58%, and 38%, respectively. For localized disease OS was 164 months and 1-, 5- and 10-year survival rates were 100%, 80%, and 55%, respectively. For disseminated disease OS was 19 months and 1-, 5- and 10-year survival rates were 73%, 18% and 6%, respectively. The 1-, 5- and 10 year-survival rates for f/m were 87%/96%, 49%/76% and 31%/57%, respectively (p = 0.02). According to the Tang classification group A, B, and C OS was 118, 83 and 20 months, respectively (p = 0.0002).The Tang classification was found to be a significant prognostic factor, while the Ki67 index was not. Localized GCCs occurred equally in males and females, while disseminated GCCs were mostly seen in females. Median age of patients with localized disease and disseminated disease was identical. Cox regression analysis found Stage IV, focally positive synaptophysin and non-radical surgery as strongest negative prognostic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2002455688,"Mammalian Plk1 is critically required for proper M phase progression. Plk1 is self-recruited to prekinetochores/kinetochores by phosphorylating and binding to the Thr-78 motif of a kinetochore scaffold protein, PBIP1 (also called CENP-U/50), which forms a stable complex with another kinetochore component, CENP-Q. However, the mechanism regulating Plk1 localization to this site remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the PBIP1·CENP-Q complex became hyperphosphorylated and rapidly delocalized from kinetochores as cells entered mitosis. Plk1 phosphorylated the CENP-Q subunit of the PBIP1·CENP-Q complex at multiple sites, and mutation of nine Plk1-dependent phosphorylation sites to Ala (9A) enhanced CENP-Q association with chromatin and prolonged CENP-Q localization to kinetochores. Conversely, mutation of the nine sites to phospho-mimicking Asp/Glu (9D/E) residues dissociated CENP-Q from chromatin and kept the CENP-Q(9D/E) mutant from localizing to interphase prekinetochores. Strikingly, both the 9A and 9D/E mutants induced a defect in proper chromosome segregation, suggesting that both timely localization of the PBIP1·CENP-Q complex to prekinetochores and delocalization from kinetochores are critical for normal M phase progression. Notably, although Plk1 did not alter the level of PBIP1 and CENP-Q ubiquitination, Plk1-dependent phosphorylation and delocalization of these proteins from kinetochores appeared to indirectly lead to their degradation in the cytosol. Thus, we propose that Plk1 regulates the timing of the delocalization and ultimate destruction of the PBIP1·CENP-Q complex and that these processes are important not only for promoting Plk1-dependent mitotic progression, but also for resetting the timing of Plk1 recruitment to prekinetochores in the next cell cycle.

Studies need to incorporate these factors with long-term data in order to link climate change to population abundance. We used 40 years of lizard abundance data and local climate data from Barro Colorado Island to ask how climate, total lizard abundance and cohort-specific abundance have changed over time, and how total and cohort-specific abundance relate to climate variables including those predicted to make the species vulnerable to climate change (i.e. temperatures exceeding preferred body temperature). We documented a decrease in lizard abundance over the last 40 years, and changes in the local climate. Population growth rate was related to the previous years’ southern oscillation index; increasing following cooler-wetter, la niña years, decreasing following warmer-drier, el nino years. Within-year recruitment was negatively related to rainfall and minimum temperature. This study simultaneously identified climatic factors driving long-term population fluctuations and climate variables influencing short-term annual recruitment, both of which may be contributing to the population decline and influence the population’s future persistence."
https://openalex.org/W1998025319,"Perception of pain in others via facial expressions has been shown to involve brain areas responsive to self-pain, biological motion, as well as both performed and observed motor actions. Here, we investigated the involvement of these different regions during emotional and motor mirroring of pain expressions using a two-task paradigm, and including both observation and execution of the expressions. BOLD responses were measured as subjects watched video clips showing different intensities of pain expression and, after a variable delay, either expressed the amount of pain they perceived in the clips (pain task), or imitated the facial movements (movement task). In the pain task condition, pain coding involved overlapping activation across observation and execution in the anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula, and the inferior parietal lobule, and a pain-related increase (pain vs. neutral) in the anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area, the right inferior frontal gyrus, and the postcentral gyrus. The 'mirroring' response was stronger in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus/superior temporal sulcus during the pain task, and stronger in the inferior parietal lobule in the movement task. These results strongly suggest that while motor mirroring may contribute to the perception of pain expressions in others, interpreting these expressions in terms of pain content draws more heavily on networks involved in the perception of affective meaning."
https://openalex.org/W2086208997,"Metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with cancer, and understanding the mechanisms of metastatic processes is essential for the development of cancer therapy. Although the role of several cell adhesion, migration or proliferation molecules in metastasis is established, a novel target for cancer therapy remains to be discovered. Previously, we reported that fad104 (factor for adipocyte differentiation 104), a regulatory factor of adipogenesis, regulates cell adhesion and migration. In this report, we clarify the role of fad104 in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. The expression level of fad104 in highly metastatic melanoma A375SM cells was lower than that in poorly metastatic melanoma A375C6 cells. Reduction of fad104 expression enhanced the migration and invasion of melanoma cells, while over-expression of FAD104 inhibited migration and invasion. In addition, melanoma cells stably expressing FAD104 showed a reduction in formation of lung colonization compared with control cells. FAD104 interacted with STAT3 and down-regulated the phosphorylation level of STAT3 in melanoma cells. These findings together demonstrate that fad104 suppressed the invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells by inhibiting activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. These findings will aid a comprehensive description of the mechanism that controls the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1969609269,"Background Bacteria of the family Rickettsiaceae are principally associated with arthropods. Recently, endosymbionts of the Rickettsiaceae have been found in non-phagotrophic cells of the volvocalean green algae Carteria cerasiformis, Pleodorina japonica, and Volvox carteri. Such endosymbionts were present in only C. cerasiformis strain NIES-425 and V. carteri strain UTEX 2180, of various strains of Carteria and V. carteri examined, suggesting that rickettsial endosymbionts may have been transmitted to only a few algal strains very recently. However, in preliminary work, we detected a sequence similar to that of a rickettsial gene in the nuclear genome of V. carteri strain EVE. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we explored the origin of the rickettsial gene-like sequences in the endosymbiont-lacking V. carteri strain EVE, by performing comparative analyses on 13 strains of V. carteri. By reference to our ongoing genomic sequence of rickettsial endosymbionts in C. cerasiformis strain NIES-425 cells, we confirmed that an approximately 9-kbp DNA sequence encompassing a region similar to that of four rickettsial genes was present in the nuclear genome of V. carteri strain EVE. Phylogenetic analyses, and comparisons of the synteny of rickettsial gene-like sequences from various strains of V. carteri, indicated that the rickettsial gene-like sequences in the nuclear genome of V. carteri strain EVE were closely related to rickettsial gene sequences of P. japonica, rather than those of V. carteri strain UTEX 2180. Conclusion/Significance At least two different rickettsial organisms may have invaded the V. carteri lineage, one of which may be the direct ancestor of the endosymbiont of V. carteri strain UTEX 2180, whereas the other may be closely related to the endosymbiont of P. japonica. Endosymbiotic gene transfer from the latter rickettsial organism may have occurred in an ancestor of V. carteri. Thus, the rickettsiae may be widely associated with V. carteri, and likely have often been lost during host evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1971241854,"Primary cilia are conserved cellular organelles that regulate diverse signaling pathways. Autophagy is a complex process of cellular degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic proteins and organelles, and plays an important role in cellular homeostasis. Despite its potential importance, the role of autophagy in ciliogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we identified sertraline as a regulator of autophagy and ciliogenesis. Sertraline, a known antidepressant, induced the growth of cilia and blocked the disassembly of cilia in htRPE cells. Following treatment of sertraline, there was an increase in the number of cells with autophagic puncta and LC3 protein conversion. In addition, both a decrease of ATG5 expression and the treatment of an autophagy inhibitor resulted in the suppression of the sertraline-induced activation of autophagy in htRPE cells. Interestingly, we found that genetic and chemical inhibition of autophagy attenuated the growth of primary cilia in htRPE cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the inhibition of autophagy suppresses sertraline-induced ciliogenesis."

Although vertically transmitted via the cytoplasm in eggs, horizontal transmission of Wolbachia among and within arthropod species has been shown to be common. Eusocial insects represent interesting models for studying Wolbachia transmission due to colonial organization and close interaction between nestmates. Here we conducted a detailed screening of Wolbachia infection for 15 colonies of the very common soil-feeding termites Cubitermes spp. affinis subarquatus (Termitidae, Termitinae) that consist of four distinct phylogenetic species in the Lopé forest Reserve, Gabon. Infection tests showed that 50% of the individuals were Wolbachia positive (N = 555) with 90% of reproductives and 48% of offspring infected. White soldiers, which are transitional stages preceding mature soldiers, had a significantly higher mean infection rate (74%) than the other castes and stages (63%, 33% and 39% for larvae, workers and mature soldiers, respectively). We used a maximum likelihood method and Akaike’s Information Criterion in order to explain the non-expected high rate of Wolbachia infection in white soldiers. The best model included a species effect for the stochastic loss of Wolbachia and a caste effect for the rate of gain. After fitting, the best model selected was for a species-specific rate of loss with a null rate of new gain for larvae, workers and soldiers and a probability of 0.72 whatever the species, that a white soldier becomes newly contaminated during that stage. The mean expected infection rate in white soldiers without a new gain was estimated to 17% instead of the 74% observed. Here we discuss the possible explanations to the high infection rate observed in white soldiers."
https://openalex.org/W2090804281,"Manuscript provides insights into the biology of long-lived plants, different from Arabidopsis, tomato or grass species that are widely studied. In the European larch the diplotene stage lasts approximately 5 months and it is possible to divide it into several substages and to observe each of them in details. The diplotene stage is a period of intensive microsporocyte growth associated with the synthesis and accumulation of different RNA and proteins. Larch microsporocytes display changes in chromatin morphology during this stage, alternating between 4 short stages of chromatin condensation (contraction) and 5 longer diffusion (relaxation) stages. The occurrence of a diplotene diffusion stage has been observed in many plant species. Interestingly, they have also been observed during spermiogenesis and oogenesis in animals. The aim of this study was to examine whether chromatin relaxation during the diplotene is accompanied by the synthesis and maturation of mRNA. The results reveal a correlation between the diffusion and chromatin decondensation, transcriptional activity. We also found decreasing amount of poly(A) mRNA synthesis in the consecutive diffusion stages. During the early diffusion stages, mRNA is intensively synthesized. In the nuclei large amounts of RNA polymerase II, and high levels of snRNPs were observed. In the late diffusion stages, the synthesized mRNA is not directly subjected to translation but it is stored in the nucleus, and later transported to the cytoplasm and translated. In the last diffusion stage, the level of poly(A) RNA is low, but that of splicing factors is still high. It appears that the mRNA synthesized in early stages is used during the diplotene stage and is not transmitted to dyad and tetrads. In contrast, splicing factors accumulate and are most likely transmitted to the dyad and tetrads, where they are used after the resumption of intense transcription.

https://openalex.org/W1964994565,"Although still debated, limb regeneration in salamanders is thought to depend on the dedifferentiation of remnant tissue occurring early after amputation and generating the progenitor cells that initiate regeneration. This dedifferentiation has been demonstrated previously by showing the fragmentation of muscle fibers into mononucleated cells and by revealing the contribution of mature muscle fibers to the regenerates by using lineage-tracing studies. Here, we provide additional evidence of dedifferentiation by showing that Pax7 (paired-box protein-7) transcripts are expressed at the ends of remnant muscle fibers in axolotls by using in situ hybridization and by demonstrating the presence of Pax7+ muscle-fiber nuclei in the early bud and mid-bud stages by means of immunohistochemical staining. During the course of regeneration, the remnant muscles did not progress; instead, muscle progenitors migrated out from the remnants and proliferated and differentiated in the new tissues at an early stage of differentiation. The regenerating muscles and remnant muscles were largely disconnected, and this left a gap between them until extremely late in the late stage of differentiation, at which point the new and old muscles connected together. Notably, Pax7 transcripts were detected in the regions of muscles that faced these gaps; thus, Pax7 expression might indicate dedifferentiation in the remnant-muscle ends and partial differentiation in the regenerating muscles. The roles of this long-duration dedifferentiation in the remnants remain unknown. However, the results presented here could support the hypothesis that long-duration muscle dedifferentiation facilitates the connection and fusion between the new and old muscles that are both in an immature state; this is because immature Pax7+ myoblasts readily fuse during developmental myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2053831552,"Ets-2, like its closely related homologue Ets-1, is a member of the Ets family of DNA binding transcription factors. Both proteins are subject to multiple levels of regulation of their DNA binding and transactivation properties. One such regulatory mechanism is the presence of an autoinhibitory module, which in Ets-1 allosterically inhibits the DNA binding activity. This inhibition can be relieved by interaction with protein partners or cooperative binding to closely separated Ets binding sites in a palindromic arrangement. In this study we describe the 2.5 Å resolution crystal structure of a DNA complex of the Ets-2 Ets domain. The Ets domain crystallized with two distinct species in the asymmetric unit, which closely resemble the autoinhibited and DNA bound forms of Ets-1. This discovery prompted us to re-evaluate the current model for the autoinhibitory mechanism and the structural basis for cooperative DNA binding. In contrast to Ets-1, in which the autoinhibition is caused by a combination of allosteric and steric mechanisms, we were unable to find clear evidence for the allosteric mechanism in Ets-2. We also demonstrated two possibly distinct types of cooperative binding to substrates with Ets binding motifs separated by four and six base pairs and suggest possible molecular mechanisms for this behavior.

Genome-wide identification and evolutionary analysis of the animal specific ETS transcription factor family.Evol. Bioinform. Online. 2009; 5: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Ets proteins share an 85-amino acid winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain (the Ets domain) that recognizes the conserved core DNA sequence GGA(A/T) through direct polar contacts mediated by residues in the highly conserved recognition helix (α3). Ets family proteins have been assigned into four classes based on the binding preferences of up to two residues upstream and downstream of the GGA(A/T) core (3.Wei G.H. Badis G. Berger M.F. Kivioja T. Palin K. Enge M. Bonke M. Jolma A. Varjosalo M. Gehrke A.R. Yan J. Talukder S. Turunen M. Taipale M. Stunnenberg H.G. Ukkonen E. Hughes T.R. Bulyk M.L. Taipale J. Genome-wide analysis of ETS-family DNA binding in vitro and in vivo.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2147-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Class I proteins (which include Ets-2) are by far the most widely represented, comprising more than half of the human Ets proteins. Despite the similarities in the mode and sequence specificity of DNA binding, the functional roles and biological processes regulated by this family of transcription factors are diverse, being able to both activate and repress the transcription of genes involved in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of various cell types. Unsurprisingly, given their importance in cellular proliferation and cell death, a number of Ets family members, (e.g. Ets-1, Pu-1, Etv-1, Etv-4, and Tel) are associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Various factors influence the functional roles of Ets proteins, including tissue-specific expression, alternate splicing, subcellular localization, presence of additional domains, post translational modifications, and the modulation of DNA binding through the formation of homomeric or heteromeric interactions with protein partners. E26 transformation-specific Ets binding site 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. Several of the Ets family members such as Ets-1, Ets-2, Etv-4, Etv-5, and Etv-6 are subject to autoinhibition in which additional structural elements outside of the core Ets domain inhibit DNA binding. Much of the knowledge of autoinhibition in Ets family proteins comes from studies on Ets-1, which is closely related to Ets-2 (84% sequence identity for the Ets domains and 55% across the entire length of the polypeptide) and, like Ets-2, contains 4 additional α-helices located immediately N-terminal (HI-1 and HI-2) and C-terminal (H4 and H5) to the core Ets domain. Deletion of these helices or expression of an alternately spliced isoform of Ets-1, which lacks these elements, results in a protein with increased DNA binding affinity (4.Hagman J. Grosschedl R. An inhibitory carboxyl-terminal domain in Ets-1 and Ets-2 mediates differential binding of ETS family factors to promoter sequences of the mb-1 gene.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A novel modulator domain of Ets transcription factors.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Structural and functional studies have established a mechanism for the autoinhibition of Ets-1 where, in the absence of DNA, the additional helices (HI-1 HI-2 and H4 H5) form a four-helix bundle that serves as an allosteric inhibitory module, packing against the opposite face from the DNA binding interface (7.Lee G.M.

The effect of this allosteric inhibition in Ets-1 is increased by phosphorylation of serine residues immediately N-terminal to HI-1 (10.Cowley D.O. Graves B.J.

A further layer of complexity was added to this model when it was discovered that the presence and phosphorylation status of an intrinsically disordered serine-rich region immediately N-terminal to HI-1 was found to stabilize the inactive state of Ets-1 to a much greater extent (10–20-fold inhibition) than the structural transitions of HI-1 (2–3-fold inhibition) (13.Lee G.M. Pufall M.A. Meeker C.A. Kang H.S. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. The affinity of Ets-1 for DNA is modulated by phosphorylation through transient interactions of an unstructured region.J. Mol.

A recent study established a possible mechanism by which this inhibition proceeds, finding that the phosphorylated serine-rich region is intrinsically disordered and forms dynamic interactions with the core Ets domain, including regions of the DNA recognition interface (15.Desjardins G.

U.S.A. 2014; 111: 11019-11024Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Another mechanism of regulation that is shared by both Ets-1 and Ets-2 is the phenomenon of cooperative binding to palindromic repeats of the Ets binding site (EBS) (16.Venanzoni M.C. Robinson L.R. Hodge D.R. Kola I. Seth A.

Structural studies on Ets-1 bound to a palindromic EBS repeat in the core GGA(A/T) motif separated by 4 bp (a sequence naturally occurring on the stromelysin-1 promoter) have identified a small predominantly polar interface between monomers that may explain the structural basis of cooperative binding (19.Lamber E.P. Vanhille L. Textor L.C. Kachalova G.S. Sieweke M.H. Wilmanns M.

Although the contact area for this interface is minimal, it is formed from residues present in the N-terminal autoinhibitory regions, and the stimulation of binding to cooperative sites was found to be approximately equal to the relief of autoinhibition (11.Goetz T.L. Gu T.L. Speck N.A. Graves B.J. Autoinhibition of Ets-1 is counteracted by DNA binding cooperativity with core-binding factor α2.Mol. Cell.

An intriguing aspect of the structural studies of Ets-1 is the propensity for the dynamic HI-1 inhibitory helix to associate with a neighboring Ets-1 molecule in a domain-swapped manner. This phenomenon has been observed for both free (PDB IDs 1MD0 (12.Garvie C.W. Pufall M.A. Graves B.J. Wolberger C.

In one of these structures (PDB ID 2NNY (19.Lamber E.P. Vanhille L. Textor L.C. Kachalova G.S. Sieweke M.H. Wilmanns M.

Wilder P.J. Shiina M. Mino K. Desler M. Ogata K. Rizzino A. Tahirov T.H. Structural basis of Ets1 cooperative binding to palindromic sequences on stromelysin-1 promoter DNA.Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 3054-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is not clear if this propensity for domain swapping has any functional significance, yet the fact that it is present in multiple structures with different crystal forms and involves the same regions that have been shown to be important for allosteric transitions suggest that it may have a functional importance for relief from autoinhibition or cooperativity. Despite the many similarities between Ets-1 and Ets-2 in their structural and regulatory mechanisms, the function of the two paralogues in vivo is distinctly different. It is clear that some of these differences can be explained by the fact that they have different tissue-specific expression profiles, with both proteins expressed in a wide range of cell types, but Ets-1 is much more highly expressed in thymus, lung, and Jurkat cells, with corresponding differences in the phenotypes of knock-out mice (22.Hollenhorst P.C. Jones D.A. Graves B.J. Expression profiles frame the promoter specificity dilemma of the ETS family of transcription factors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5693-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, significant differences have been observed in their transactivation activity and the protein-protein interactions in which they participate; for example, Ets-2 but not Ets-1 is able to interact with both ERG (23.Shaikhibrahim Z. Ochsenfahrt J. Fuchs K. Kristiansen G. Perner S. Wernert N. ERG is specifically associated with ETS-2 and ETV-4, but not with ETS-1, in prostate cancer.Int. J. Mol.

To gain insights into the structural basis for these functional differences and to further investigate the structural basis for autoinhibition and cooperativity, we have determined the crystal structure of the Ets domain of Ets-2. The structure, determined in complex with a single EBS DNA oligonucleotide, unexpectedly contains archetypes of both the autoinhibited and non autoinhibited forms, allowing us to analyze the structural and conformation differences that accompany autoinhibition. The association and interfaces formed between molecules in the asymmetric units give insights into novel aspects of the autoinhibitory mechanism and cooperative binding. Plasmid DNA templates for full-length human Ets-2 (IMAGE: 3852274) and full-length murine Ets-1 (IMAGE: 40056547) were obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (Source BioScience, Nottingham, UK). The fragments of Ets-2 and Ets-1 used in this study are: Ets-2325–464 (Ets and autoinhibition domains, crystallized fragment), Ets-2308–469 (Ets domain, autoinhibition domain and N-terminal flanking sequence, used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)), Ets-2325–469 (Ets and autoinhibition domains, used in EMSA), Ets-2360–464 (ETS domain, used in EMSA), Ets-1280–440 (Ets domain, autoinhibition domain, and N-terminal flanking sequence, used in EMSA), Ets-1300–440 (Ets and autoinhibition domains, used in EMSA), Ets-1331–440 (Ets domain, used in EMSA). The gene fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pNIC28-Bsa4 expression vector, encompassing a tobacco etch virus protease-cleavable N-terminal His tag MHHHHHHSSGVDLGTENLYFQ↓SM), as described elsewhere (25.Savitsky P.

Plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3)-R3-pRARE2, and cultures were grown in UltraYield baffled flasks (Thomson Instrument Co.) in Terrific Broth medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to an A600 of 2–3, at which point the cultures were cooled to 18 °C and expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, with cells harvested 18 h after induction. For purification of both the Ets-1 and Ets-2 domains, cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris and nucleic acids were removed by the addition of 0.15% polyethyleneimine, pH 7.5, and centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were applied to a 3-ml Ni2+-iminodiacetic acid (Ni-IDA) agarose immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography gravity flow column, washed with wash buffer (buffer A with 30 mm imidazole), and eluted with 5 column volumes of elution buffer (buffer A with 300 mm imidazole). Proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of tobacco etch virus protease (1:40 mass ratio) while being dialyzed using 3.5-kDa molecular weight cutoff snakeskin membrane (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) into buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). Tobacco etch virus protease and contaminating proteins were removed by reapplication of dialyzed proteins to a Ni2+-iminodiacetic acid agarose immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography column (2-ml column volume). Proteins passing through the column were pooled and concentrated using a 10-kDa molecular weight cutoff centrifugal concentrator to 1 ml before loading onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex S75 gel filtration column equilibrated in buffer B. Proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE and confirmed by mass spectrometry, and concentrations were determined by absorbance measurement at 280 nm (Nanodrop) using the calculated molecular mass and extinction coefficients. For crystallization of the Ets domain DNA complex, the oligonucleotides ACCGGAAGTG and CACTTCCGGT were resuspended to 900 μm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, mixed in a 1:1 ratio, heated to 95 °C for 5 min in a heating block, and allowed to cool slowly over several hours. The Ets-2 Ets domain protein was concentrated to 300 μm (5 mg/ml) and mixed with an equal volume of double-stranded DNA (1:1.5 molar ratio) before being concentrated on a 3-kDa molecular weight cutoff centrifugal concentrator to 15 mg/ml for crystallization. Sitting drop vapor diffusion crystallization trials were set up with a Mosquito (TTP Labtech) crystallization robot. Crystals grew at 20 °C from conditions containing 0.1 m BisTris, pH 5.5, 0.25 m NaCl, and 15% PEG 3350 and were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution consisting of well solution supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol before being loop-mounted and plunged into a pool of liquid nitrogen.

Open table in a new tab The affinity and cooperativity of Ets-2 Ets domain DNA binding was measured using EMSAs. The probes consisted of the following oligonucleotide sequences annealed to the complementary strands (the core Ets binding sites are underlined): single site (ATCTCACCGGAAGTGTAGCA) and palindromes (4-bp, AGCGGAAGTACTTCCGGA; 5-bp, AGCGGAAGTGACTTCCGGA; 6-bp, AGCGGAAGTGCACTTCCGGA; 7-bp, AGCGGAAGTGACACTTCCGGA; 8-bp, AGCGGAAGTGATCACTTCCGGA). Radiolabeled double-stranded DNA probes were prepared by incubating the forward strand oligonucleotides for 1 h at 37 °C with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Complementary (non-radiolabeled) oligonucleotides were added, and the mixture was heated to 95 °C and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The double-stranded DNA probes were purified before use on a Bio-Rad P6 micro-biospin column. EMSAs were performed by incubating radiolabeled probe (at a concentration of 0.1 nm for Ets-2 and 0.02 nm for Ets-1) with protein titrated by serial dilution. The buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 50 mm l-arginine-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol (inclusion of arginine in the buffer prevented the precipitation of protein-DNA complexes). Reactions were performed for 15 min at room temperature, and 5 μl of each reaction was mixed with loading dye to 0.25% and resolved by 12% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in Tris borate EDTA buffer at 180 V for 1 h on ice. Gels were visualized using phosphorimaging, quantitation was performed using quantity one 1-D analysis software (Bio-Rad), and apparent dissociation constants were calculated using a sigmoidal four-parameter logistic nonlinear regression model in PRISM (GraphPad). To assess potential interactions between Ets-2 molecules on the various palindromic DNA substrates, we have superposed chain A of the Ets-2 structure as a rigid body onto successive positions on the pseudo-contiguous DNA duplex (formed by chains E, F, H, and I in the Ets-2 structure) as dictated by the spacing requirements of the GGAA motifs of the Ets-2 consensus sequence using the program COOT (28.Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17064) Google Scholar). For the case of substrates with the GGAA motifs separated by 4 bp, the result of this superposition was found to be almost identical to the arrangement of the chains in the Ets-1 stromelysin-1 promoter DNA complex (20.Babayeva N.D. Wilder P.J. Shiina M. Mino K. Desler M. Ogata K. Rizzino A. Tahirov T.H. Structural basis of Ets1 cooperative binding to palindromic sequences on stromelysin-1 promoter DNA.Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 3054-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Crystals of the Ets-2 DNA complex were obtained with an Ets-2 construct spanning residues 325–464, including the N-terminal (HI-1 and HI-2) and C-terminal (H4 and H5) autoinhibitory regions and the DNA oligonucleotides 5′-ACCGGAAGTG and 5′-CACTTCCGGT. The crystals belong to a primitive monoclinic crystal system, space group P 21, and diffracted to 2.5 Å resolution with 3 copies of Ets-2 and three 10-bp DNA duplexes in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of FEV DNA complex (PDB ID 3ZP5) as a search model. The three DNA duplexes in the asymmetric unit pack with base-stacking interactions that are extended through contacts with symmetry mates to form a pseudo-contiguous double helix spanning the length of the crystal (Fig. 1A). The electron density map is of overall high quality for both DNA and protein chains, with the final model containing 301 of a possible 417 protein residues, and was refined to a crystallographic Rfactor of 0.235 (Rfree of 0.255). A summary of the data collection and refinement statistics can be found in Table 1. An examination of the three Ets-2 molecules in the asymmetric unit reveals that, although they all share the same core Ets family fold and interact with double-stranded DNA in a similar manner, the autoinhibitory regions are significantly different, being well ordered in chain A but almost completely disordered in the other two chains (D and G) (Fig. 1B). The core Ets family fold, common to all chains in the asymmetric unit, consists of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, (strand order β1, β2, β4, β3) flanked on one side by three α-helices with an additional short helix immediately preceding the first β strand, which is of intermediate character (α and 310). The recognition helix (H3) inserts deep into the major groove of the DNA and forms a number of base pair-specific interactions with the DNA, with additional contacts to the DNA backbone being formed from residues in the C terminus of H2, the H2-H3 loop, β3, and the β3-β4 loop (Fig. 1C). Overall the protein DNA interface is very similar to that described in other structural investigations of Ets family proteins (12.Garvie C.W. Pufall M.A. Graves B.J. Wolberger C. Structural analysis of the autoinhibition of Ets-1 and its role in protein partnerships.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45529-45536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and as such is not described in detail here. In chain A the entire autoinhibitory module can be seen to form a complete folded helical structure and associates with the core of the Ets domain via an extensive interface formed by H1 and the β1-β2 loop. The contact area for the interface is ∼790 Å2 with 7 hydrogen bonds being formed between the core and autoinhibitory module, although the majority of the contacts are hydrophobic in nature, with the core Ets domain providing several aromatic residues (Trp-366, Leu-370, Leu-373, Trp-384, Trp-389, and Phe-442) that contact predominantly branched chain amino acids on the autoinhibitory module (Ile-34"
https://openalex.org/W1985674298,"The functional importance of threonine 5 (T5) in modulating the activity of sarcolipin (SLN), a key regulator of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump was studied using a transgenic mouse model with cardiac specific expression of threonine 5 to alanine mutant SLN (SLNT5A). In these transgenic mice, the SLNT5A protein replaces the endogenous SLN in atria, while maintaining the total SLN content. The cardiac specific expression of SLNT5A results in severe cardiac structural remodeling accompanied by bi-atrial enlargement. Biochemical analyses reveal a selective downregulation of SR Ca2+ handling proteins and a reduced SR Ca2+ uptake both in atria and in the ventricles. Optical mapping analysis shows slower action potential propagation in the transgenic mice atria. Doppler echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements demonstrate a reduced atrial contractility and an impaired diastolic function. Together, these findings suggest that threonine 5 plays an important role in modulating SLN function in the heart. Furthermore, our studies suggest that alteration in SLN function can cause abnormal Ca2+ handling and subsequent cardiac remodeling and dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2120350077,"The microtubule-targeting maytansinoids accumulate in cells and induce mitotic arrest at 250- to 1000-fold lower concentrations than those required for their association with tubulin or microtubules. To identify the mechanisms of this intracellular accumulation and exceptional cytotoxicity of maytansinoids we studied interaction of a highly cytotoxic maytansinoid, S-methyl DM1 and several other maytansinoids with cells. S-methyl DM1 accumulated inside the cells with a markedly higher apparent affinity than to tubulin or microtubules. The apparent affinities of maytansinoids correlated with their cytotoxicities. The number of intracellular binding sites for S-methyl DM1 in MCF7 cells was comparable to the number of tubulin molecules per cell (~ 4–6 × 107 copies). Efflux of 3 [H]-S-methyl DM1 from cells was enhanced in the presence of an excess of non-labeled S-methyl DM1, indicating that re-binding of 3 [H]-S-methyl DM1 to intracellular binding sites contributed to its intracellular retention. Liposomes loaded with non-polymerized tubulin recapitulated the apparent high-affinity association of S-methyl DM1 to cells. We propose a model for the intracellular accumulation of maytansinoids in which molecules of the compounds diffuse into a cell and associate with tubulin. Affinities of maytansinoids for individual tubulin molecules are weak, but the high intracellular concentration of tubulin favors, after dissociation of a compound-tubulin complex, their re-binding to a tubulin molecule, or to a tip of a microtubule in the same cell, over their efflux. As a result, a significant fraction of microtubule tips is occupied with a maytansinoid when added to cells at sub-nanomolar concentrations, inducing mitotic arrest and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2049862780,"HIV type 1 (HIV-1) is characterized by its rapid genetic evolution, leading to challenges in anti-HIV therapy. However, the sequence variations in HIV-1 proteins are not randomly distributed due to a combination of functional constraints and genetic drift. In this study, we examined patterns of sequence variability for evidence of linked sequence changes (termed as coevolution or covariation) in 15 HIV-1 proteins. It shows that the percentage of charged residues in the coevolving residues is significantly higher than that in all the HIV-1 proteins. Most of the coevolving residues are spatially proximal in the protein structures and tend to form relatively compact and independent units in the tertiary structures, termed as “protein sectors”. These protein sectors are closely associated with anti-HIV drug resistance, T cell epitopes, and antibody binding sites. Finally, we explored candidate peptide inhibitors based on the protein sectors. Our results can establish an association between the coevolving residues and molecular functions of HIV-1 proteins, and then provide us with valuable knowledge of pathology of HIV-1 and therapeutics development."
https://openalex.org/W1977764059,"Objective To determine whether treatments for precancerous cervical lesions were associated with lower pregnancy rates compared to rates in unexposed women and women who had a diagnostic cervical biopsy or colposcopy. Design Matched, retrospective cohort study. Setting Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Oregon and Washington. Patients Women 14 to 53 years old with KPNW enrollment during the period 1998 through 2009. Main Outcome Measure Pregnancy after exposure or index date. Pregnancy was defined using a validated algorithm and electronic medical records data. Results We observed 570 pregnancies following cervical treatment in 4,137 women, 1,533 pregnancies following a diagnostic procedure in 13,767 women, and 7,436 pregnancies in a frequency-matched sample of 81,435 women unexposed to treatment or diagnostic procedures. After adjusting for age and contraceptive use, we observed a higher rate of pregnancies in the treatment group compared to unexposed women (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.30–1.55), but no difference in pregnancy rates between the treatment and diagnostic procedure groups (HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.93–1.13). Conclusions No adverse effects of cervical procedures on subsequent rates of pregnancy were observed in this cohort with up to twelve years of follow-up time."
https://openalex.org/W2014110212,An understanding of dynamic processes of proteins on the electrode surface could enhance the efficiency of bioelectronics development and therefore it is crucial to gain information regarding both physical adsorption of proteins onto the electrode and its electrochemical property in real-time. We combined high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) with electrochemical device for simultaneous observation of the surface topography and electron transfer of redox proteins on an electrode. Direct electron transfer of cytochrome c (cyt c) adsorbed on a self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) formed electrode is very attractive subject in bioelectrochemistry. This paper reports a real-time visualization of cyt c adsorption processes on an 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid-modified Au electrode together with simultaneous electrochemical measurements. Adsorbing cyt c molecules were observed on a subsecond time resolution simultaneously with increasing redox currents from cyt c using EC-HS-AFM. The root mean square roughness (RRMS) from the AFM images and the number of the electrochemically active cyt c molecules adsorbed onto the electrode (Γ) simultaneously increased in positive cooperativity. Cyt c molecules were fully adsorbed on the electrode in the AFM images when the peak currents were steady. This use of electrochemical HS-AFM significantly facilitates understanding of dynamic behavior of biomolecules on the electrode interface and contributes to the further development of bioelectronics.
https://openalex.org/W2024854494,"Spatial organization of a chromosome in a nucleus is very important in biology but many aspects of it are still generally unresolved. We focused on tissue-specific features of chromosome architecture in closely related malaria mosquitoes, which have essential inter-specific differences in polytene chromosome attachments in nurse cells. We showed that the region responsible for X-chromosome attachment interacts with nuclear lamina stronger in nurse cells, then in salivary glands cells in Anopheles messeae Fall. The inter-tissue differences were demonstrated more convincingly in an experiment of two distinct chromosomes interposition in the nucleus space of cells from four tissues. Microdissected DNA-probes from nurse cells X-chromosome (2BC) and 3R chromosomes (32D) attachment regions were hybridized with intact nuclei of nurse cells, salivary gland cells, follicle epithelium cells and imaginal disсs cells in 3D-FISH experiments. We showed that only salivary gland cells and follicle epithelium cells have no statistical differences in the interposition of 2BC and 32D. Generally, the X-chromosome and 3R chromosome are located closer to each other in cells of the somatic system in comparison with nurse cells on average. The imaginal disсs cell nuclei have an intermediate arrangement of chromosome interposition, similar to other somatic cells and nurse cells. In spite of species-specific chromosome attachments there are no differences in interposition of nurse cells chromosomes in An. messeae and An. atroparvus Thiel. Nurse cells have an unusual chromosome arrangement without a chromocenter, which could be due to the special mission of generative system cells in ontogenesis and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1970060967,"We evaluated the extent to which manipulation of early olfactory environment can influence social behaviours in the South American Hystricognath rodent Octodon degus. The early olfactory environment of newborn degus was manipulated by scenting all litter members with eucalyptol during the first month of life. The social behaviour of sexually mature animals (5–7 months old) towards conspecifics was then assessed using a y-maze to compare the response of control (naïve) and treated animals to two different olfactory configurations (experiment 1): (i) a non-familiarized conspecific impregnated with eucalyptol (eucalyptol arm) presented against (ii) a non-familiarized unscented conspecific (control arm). In addition, in dyadic encounters, we assessed the behaviour of control and eucalyptol treated animals towards a non-familiarized conspecific scented with eucalyptol (experiment 2). We found that control subjects explored and spent significantly less time in the eucalyptol arm, indicating neophobic behaviours towards the artificially scented conspecific. Treated subjects explored and spent similar time in both arms of the maze, showing the same interest for both olfactory stimuli presented. During dyadic encounters in experiment 2, an interaction effect between early experience and sex was observed. Control males escaped and avoided their scented partner more frequently than eucalyptol treated male subjects and than females. Both groups did not differ in the exploration of their scented partners, suggesting that avoidance within agonistic context does not relate to neophobic behaviours. Our results suggest that the exposure to eucalyptol during early ontogeny decreases evasive behaviours within an agonistic context as a result of olfactory learning. Altogether, these results indicate that olfactory cues learned in early ontogeny can influence olfactory-guided behaviours in adult degus."
https://openalex.org/W2077205037,"As commercial human immunodeficiency virus type 1 drug resistance assays are expensive, they are not commonly used in resource-limited settings. Hence, a more affordable in-house procedure was set up taking into account the specific epidemiological and economic circumstances of Cuba. The performance characteristics of the in-house assay were evaluated using clinical samples with various subtypes and resistance patterns. The lower limit of amplification was determined on dilutions series of 20 clinical isolates and ranged from 84 to 529 RNA copies/mL. For the assessment of trueness, 14 clinical samples were analyzed and the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System v2.0 was used as the reference standard. The mean nucleotide sequence identity between the two assays was 98.7% ± 1.0. Additionally, 99.0% of the amino acids at drug resistance positions were identical. The sensitivity and specificity in detecting drug resistance mutations was respectively 94.1% and 99.5%. Only few discordances in drug resistance interpretation patterns were observed. The repeatability and reproducibility were evaluated using 10 clinical samples with 3 replicates per sample. The in-house test was very precise as nucleotide sequence identity among paired nucleotide sequences ranged from 98.7% to 99.9%. The acceptance criteria were met by the in-house test for all performance characteristics, demonstrating a high degree of accuracy. Subsequently, the applicability in routine clinical practice was evaluated on 380 plasma samples. The amplification success rate was 91% and good quality consensus sequences encoding the entire protease and the first 335 codons in reverse transcriptase could be obtained for 99% of the successful amplicons. The reagent cost per sample using the in-house procedure was around € 80 per genotyping attempt. Overall, the in-house assay provided good results, was feasible with equipment and reagents available in Cuba and was half as expensive as commercial assays."
https://openalex.org/W2088172980,"Proteomics is a powerful approach used for investigating the complex molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and progression. An important challenge in modern protein profiling approaches involves targeting of specific protein activities in order to identify altered molecular processes associated with disease pathophysiology. Adenosine-binding proteins represent an important subset of the proteome where aberrant expression or activity changes of these proteins have been implicated in numerous human diseases. Herein, we describe an affinity-based approach for the enrichment of adenosine-binding proteins from a complex cell proteome. A novel N6-biotinylated-8-azido-adenosine probe (AdoR probe) was synthesized, which contains a reactive group that forms a covalent bond with the target proteins, as well as a biotin tag for affinity enrichment using avidin chromatography. Probe specificity was confirmed with protein standards prior to further evaluation in a complex protein mixture consisting of a lysate derived from mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 cells. Protein identification and relative quantitation using mass spectrometry allowed for the identification of small variations in abundance of nucleoside- and nucleotide-binding proteins in these samples where a significant enrichment of AdoR-binding proteins in the labeled proteome from the neuroblastoma cells was observed. The results from this study demonstrate the utility of this method to enrich for nucleoside- and nucleotide-binding proteins in a complex protein mixture, pointing towards a unique set of proteins that can be examined in the context of further understanding mechanisms of disease, or fundamental biological processes in general."
https://openalex.org/W2016177843,"Background Quality of life (QL) assessments of children with incapacitating diseases, such as cerebral palsy (CP), have often been conducted with the help of the representatives of a child, making QL assessment more subjective. TheAutoquestionnaireQualité de Vie Enfant Imagé (AUQEI) is a QL assessment designed for children to self-report—it uses images to facilitate the reporting process. Objective evaluate the psychometric properties of AUQEI when responses are given by children with CP. Findings Children aged 4 to 12 years (45 with CP and 45 healthy children) gave responses to the questionnaire. The data quality, reliability and validity were assessed. The data loss rate ranged from 8.8% to 46.7%, and was highest for the “autonomy” factor. No floor or ceiling effect was detected. The success rate for reliability of the internal consistency of the items was less than 80% for the “autonomy” factor. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.71 for the instrument and less than 0.5 for the factors. All the factors had a success rate of greater than 80% for the discriminating validity of the items. The factors did not have correlations between each other, thus indicating adequate discriminating validity. Convergent validity was tested and a significant correlation was demonstrated only between the AUQEI “functioning” factor and the Child Health Questionnaire—50-Item (CHQ-PF50) physical summary score (r = 0.31, p = 0.042). The AUQEI scores did not have correlations with the gross motor function scores (p>0.05) as expected for divergent validity. Regarding construct validity, the total AUQEI score obtained by the CP group was lower (median: 47.3) than that of the healthy group (median: 51.0) (p<0.01). Conclusion The AUQEI was shown to be a reliable and valid instrument for assessing children with CP when the total score was used. Convergent validity should continue to be tested in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W1972793955,"Approximately 40% of patients who survive acute episodes of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) associated with severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency experience one or more relapses. Risk factors for relapse other than severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and ADAMTS13 autoantibodies are unknown. ADAMTS13 autoantibodies, TTP episodes following infection or type I interferon treatment and reported ensuing systemic lupus erythematosus in some patients suggest immune dysregulation. This cross-sectional study asked whether autoantibodies against RNA-binding proteins or peripheral blood gene expression profiles measured during remission are associated with history of prior relapse in acquired ADAMTS13-deficient TTP. Peripheral blood from 38 well-characterized patients with autoimmune ADAMTS13-deficient TTP in remission was examined for autoantibodies and global gene expression. A subset of TTP patients (9 patients, 24%) exhibited a peripheral blood gene signature composed of elevated ribosomal transcripts that associated with prior relapse. A non-overlapping subset of TTP patients (9 patients, 24%) displayed a peripheral blood type I interferon gene signature that associated with autoantibodies to RNA-binding proteins but not with history of relapse. Patients who had relapsed bimodally expressed higher HLA transcript levels independently of ribosomal transcripts. Presence of any one potential risk factor (ribosomal gene signature, elevated HLA-DRB1, elevated HLA-DRB5) associated with relapse (OR = 38.4; p = 0.0002) more closely than any factor alone or all factors together. Levels of immune transcripts typical of natural killer (NK) and T lymphocytes positively correlated with ribosomal gene expression and number of prior episodes but not with time since the most recent episode. Flow cytometry confirmed elevated expression of cell surface markers encoded by these transcripts on T and/or NK cell subsets of patients who had relapsed. These data associate elevated ribosomal and immune transcripts with relapse history in acquired, ADAMTS13-deficient TTP."
