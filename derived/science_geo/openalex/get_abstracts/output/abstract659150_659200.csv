https://openalex.org/W3082963850,"The enteric nervous system (ENS) coordinates diverse functions in the intestine but has eluded comprehensive molecular characterization because of the rarity and diversity of cells. Here we develop two methods to profile the ENS of adult mice and humans at single-cell resolution: RAISIN RNA-seq for profiling intact nuclei with ribosome-bound mRNA and MIRACL-seq for label-free enrichment of rare cell types by droplet-based profiling. The 1,187,535 nuclei in our mouse atlas include 5,068 neurons from the ileum and colon, revealing extraordinary neuron diversity. We highlight circadian expression changes in enteric neurons, show that disease-related genes are dysregulated with aging, and identify differences between the ileum and proximal/distal colon. In humans, we profile 436,202 nuclei, recovering 1,445 neurons, and identify conserved and species-specific transcriptional programs and putative neuro-epithelial, neuro-stromal, and neuro-immune interactions. The human ENS expresses risk genes for neuropathic, inflammatory, and extra-intestinal diseases, suggesting neuronal contributions to disease."
https://openalex.org/W3083058958,"We report on molecular analyses of baseline tumor samples from the phase 3 JAVELIN Renal 101 trial (n = 886; NCT02684006 ), which demonstrated significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) with first-line avelumab + axitinib versus sunitinib in advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). We found that neither expression of the commonly assessed biomarker programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) nor tumor mutational burden differentiated PFS in either study arm. Similarly, the presence of FcɣR single nucleotide polymorphisms was unimpactful. We identified important biological features associated with differential PFS between the treatment arms, including new immunomodulatory and angiogenesis gene expression signatures (GESs), previously undescribed mutational profiles and their corresponding GESs, and several HLA types. These findings provide insight into the determinants of response to combined PD-1/PD-L1 and angiogenic pathway inhibition and may aid in the development of strategies for improved patient care in aRCC. Biomarker analysis of the phase 3 JAVELIN Renal 101 trial uncovers molecular determinants of therapy-specific outcomes, which may inform personalized treatment strategies for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W3083496521,"The human proteome is a major source of therapeutic targets. Recent genetic association analyses of the plasma proteome enable systematic evaluation of the causal consequences of variation in plasma protein levels. Here we estimated the effects of 1,002 proteins on 225 phenotypes using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization. Of 413 associations supported by evidence from MR, 130 (31.5%) were not supported by results of colocalization analyses, suggesting that genetic confounding due to linkage disequilibrium is widespread in naïve phenome-wide association studies of proteins. Combining MR and colocalization evidence in cis-only analyses, we identified 111 putatively causal effects between 65 proteins and 52 disease-related phenotypes ( https://www.epigraphdb.org/pqtl/ ). Evaluation of data from historic drug development programs showed that target-indication pairs with MR and colocalization support were more likely to be approved, evidencing the value of this approach in identifying and prioritizing potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W3081723269,"Summary During respiration, humans breathe in more than 10,000 liters of non-sterile air daily, allowing some pathogens access to alveoli. Interestingly, alveoli outnumber alveolar macrophages (AMs), which favors alveoli devoid of AMs. If AMs, like most tissue macrophages, are sessile, then this numerical advantage would be exploited by pathogens unless neutrophils from the blood stream intervened. However, this would translate to omnipresent persistent inflammation. Developing in vivo real-time intravital imaging of alveoli revealed AMs crawling in and between alveoli using the pores of Kohn. Importantly, these macrophages sensed, chemotaxed, and, with high efficiency, phagocytosed inhaled bacterial pathogens such as P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, cloaking the bacteria from neutrophils. Impairing AM chemotaxis toward bacteria induced superfluous neutrophil recruitment, leading to inappropriate inflammation and injury. In a disease context, influenza A virus infection impaired AM crawling via the type II interferon signaling pathway, and this greatly increased secondary bacterial co-infection."
https://openalex.org/W3083230937,"Here we describe the LifeTime Initiative, which aims to track, understand and target human cells during the onset and progression of complex diseases, and to analyse their response to therapy at single-cell resolution. This mission will be implemented through the development, integration and application of single-cell multi-omics and imaging, artificial intelligence and patient-derived experimental disease models during the progression from health to disease. The analysis of large molecular and clinical datasets will identify molecular mechanisms, create predictive computational models of disease progression, and reveal new drug targets and therapies. The timely detection and interception of disease embedded in an ethical and patient-centred vision will be achieved through interactions across academia, hospitals, patient associations, health data management systems and industry. The application of this strategy to key medical challenges in cancer, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, and infectious, chronic inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases at the single-cell level will usher in cell-based interceptive medicine in Europe over the next decade. The LifeTime initiative is an ambitious, multidisciplinary programme that aims to improve healthcare by tracking individual human cells during disease processes and responses to treatment in order to develop and implement cell-based interceptive medicine in Europe."
https://openalex.org/W3083694860,"Cooperation between DNA, RNA and protein regulates gene expression and controls differentiation through interactions that connect regions of nucleic acids and protein domains and through the assembly of biomolecular condensates. Here, we report that endoderm differentiation is regulated by the interaction between the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) DIGIT and the bromodomain and extraterminal domain protein BRD3. BRD3 forms phase-separated condensates of which the formation is promoted by DIGIT, occupies enhancers of endoderm transcription factors and is required for endoderm differentiation. BRD3 binds to histone H3 acetylated at lysine 18 (H3K18ac) in vitro and co-occupies the genome with H3K18ac. DIGIT is also enriched in regions of H3K18ac, and the depletion of DIGIT results in decreased recruitment of BRD3 to these regions. Our findings show that cooperation between DIGIT and BRD3 at regions of H3K18ac regulates the transcription factors that drive endoderm differentiation and suggest that protein-lncRNA phase-separated condensates have a broader role as regulators of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W3084113028,"Since SARS-CoV-2-based disease (COVID-19) spreads as a pandemic, the necessity of a highly sensitive molecular diagnosis that can drastically reduce false negatives reverse transcription PCR (rtPCR) results, raises as a major clinical need. Here we evaluated the performance of a ddPCR-based assay to quantify SARS-CoV-2 titer in 55 suspected COVID-19 cases with negative rtPCR results thanks to in-house ddPCR assay (targeting RdRp and host RNaseP). Samples were collected at ASST-GOM Niguarda between February and May 2020 at hospital admission. Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging and definition of disease severity. Patients were mainly female (45.5%) with a median age of 73 (57–84) years. ddPCR-based assay detected SARS-CoV-2 genome in nasopharyngeal samples of 19 (34.5%) patients (median viral-load: 128 copies/mL, IQR: 72–345). In 15 of them (78.9%), chest CT showed a classical COVID-19 bilateral interstitial pneumonia; 14 patients (73.7%) showed severe COVID-19 manifestations. ddPCR did not identify any trace of SARS-CoV-2 genome in the respiratory samples of the remaining 36 patients. The serological assay performed in a subgroup of 34 patients at the later stage of illness (from 3 days to 90 days after) confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in all patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in ddPCR (100%). Contrariwise, negative tests were observed in 95.0% ddPCR negative patients (P<0.001). Thanks to a ddPCR-based assay, we achieved a rapid and accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in rtPCR-negative respiratory samples of individuals with COVID-19 suspect, allowing the rapid taking care and correct management of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3082173734,"Throughout a 24-h period, the small intestine (SI) is exposed to diurnally varying food- and microbiome-derived antigenic burdens but maintains a strict immune homeostasis, which when perturbed in genetically susceptible individuals, may lead to Crohn disease. Herein, we demonstrate that dietary content and rhythmicity regulate the diurnally shifting SI epithelial cell (SIEC) transcriptional landscape through modulation of the SI microbiome. We exemplify this concept with SIEC major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, which is diurnally modulated by distinct mucosal-adherent SI commensals, while supporting downstream diurnal activity of intra-epithelial IL-10+ lymphocytes regulating the SI barrier function. Disruption of this diurnally regulated diet-microbiome-MHC class II-IL-10-epithelial barrier axis by circadian clock disarrangement, alterations in feeding time or content, or epithelial-specific MHC class II depletion leads to an extensive microbial product influx, driving Crohn-like enteritis. Collectively, we highlight nutritional features that modulate SI microbiome, immunity, and barrier function and identify dietary, epithelial, and immune checkpoints along this axis to be potentially exploitable in future Crohn disease interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3083459141,"Dynamic regulation is a promising strategy for fine-tuning metabolic fluxes in microbial cell factories. However, few of these synthetic regulatory systems have been developed for central carbon metabolites. Here we created a set of programmable and bifunctional pyruvate-responsive genetic circuits for dynamic dual control (activation and inhibition) of central metabolism in Bacillus subtilis. We used these genetic circuits to design a feedback loop control system that relies on the intracellular concentration of pyruvate to fine-tune the target metabolic modules, leading to the glucaric acid titer increasing from 207 to 527 mg l−1. The designed logic gate-based circuits were enabled by the characterization of a new antisense transcription mechanism in B. subtilis. In addition, a further increase to 802 mg l−1 was achieved by blocking the formation of by-products. Here, the constructed pyruvate-responsive genetic circuits are presented as effective tools for the dynamic control of central metabolism of microbial cell factories. Pyruvate-responsive circuits based on an orthologous transcription factor and adaptation of an antisense transcriptional circuit were developed to sense pyruvate in Bacillus subtilis and redirect metabolism for optimized glucaric acid production."
https://openalex.org/W3083030002,"How astrocytes grow and integrate into neural circuits remains poorly defined. Zebrafish are well suited for such investigations, but bona fide astrocytes have not been described in this system. Here we characterize a zebrafish cell type that is remarkably similar to mammalian astrocytes that derive from radial glial cells and elaborate processes to establish their territories at early larval stages. Zebrafish astrocytes associate closely with synapses, tile with one another and express markers, including Glast and glutamine synthetase. Once integrated into circuits, they exhibit whole-cell and microdomain Ca2+ transients, which are sensitive to norepinephrine. Finally, using a cell-specific CRISPR–Cas9 approach, we demonstrate that fgfr3 and fgfr4 are required for vertebrate astrocyte morphogenesis. This work provides the first visualization of astrocyte morphogenesis from stem cell to post-mitotic astrocyte in vivo, identifies a role for Fgf receptors in vertebrate astrocytes and establishes zebrafish as a valuable new model system to study astrocyte biology in vivo. Chen et al. define previously unreported zebrafish astrocytes, provide new insights into vertebrate astrocyte development and lay the foundation for studying astrocyte function in the entire nervous system of an intact and behaving animal."
https://openalex.org/W3083146163,"Monitoring the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in health and disease can provide key insights into adaptive immune responses, but the accuracy of current TCR sequencing (TCRseq) methods is unclear. In this study, we systematically compared the results of nine commercial and academic TCRseq methods, including six rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends (RACE)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and three multiplex-PCR approaches, when applied to the same T cell sample. We found marked differences in accuracy and intra- and inter-method reproducibility for T cell receptor α (TRA) and T cell receptor β (TRB) TCR chains. Most methods showed a lower ability to capture TRA than TRB diversity. Low RNA input generated non-representative repertoires. Results from the 5′ RACE-PCR methods were consistent among themselves but differed from the RNA-based multiplex-PCR results. Using an in silico meta-repertoire generated from 108 replicates, we found that one genomic DNA-based method and two non-unique molecular identifier (UMI) RNA-based methods were more sensitive than UMI methods in detecting rare clonotypes, despite the better clonotype quantification accuracy of the latter. A comparison of T cell receptor repertoire profiling methods shows substantial differences in their outputs."
https://openalex.org/W3083497411,"Recent studies show that aneuploidy and driver gene mutations precede cancer diagnosis by many years1-4. We assess whether these genomic signals can be used for early detection and pre-emptive cancer treatment using the neoplastic precursor lesion Barrett's esophagus as an exemplar5. Shallow whole-genome sequencing of 777 biopsies, sampled from 88 patients in Barrett's esophagus surveillance over a period of up to 15 years, shows that genomic signals can distinguish progressive from stable disease even 10 years before histopathological transformation. These findings are validated on two independent cohorts of 76 and 248 patients. These methods are low-cost and applicable to standard clinical biopsy samples. Compared with current management guidelines based on histopathology and clinical presentation, genomic classification enables earlier treatment for high-risk patients as well as reduction of unnecessary treatment and monitoring for patients who are unlikely to develop cancer."

KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in epithelial cancers. Limited understanding of the biology of KRAS and its downstream effectors in epithelial cells likely contributes to the limited therapeutic targets for KRAS mutant cancers. Oncogenic KRAS is associated with poor prognosis and therapy resistance (Haigis, 2017Haigis K.M. KRAS Alleles: The Devil Is in the Detail.Trends Cancer. 2017; 3: 686-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Tumor cell line experiments revealed that the rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathways are activated upon overexpression of oncogenic KRAS, but pathway activation is distinct when oncogenic KRAS is expressed at physiological levels from its endogenous promoter (Tuveson et al., 2004Tuveson D.A.

Golay H.G. Barbie D.A. Targeting pathways downstream of KRAS in lung adenocarcinoma.Pharmacogenomics. 2014; 15: 1507-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Oncogenic KRAS mutations are driving events in lung cancer and are present in 30% of lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) (Collisson et al., 2014Collisson E.A. Campbell J.D. Brooks A.N. Berger A.H. Lee W.

Danilova L. et al.Comprehensive molecular profiling of lung adenocarcinoma: The cancer genome atlas research network.Nature. 2014; 511: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of oncogenic KRASG12D is sufficient to initiate LUAD in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) (Jackson et al., 2001Jackson E.L. Willis N. Mercer K. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Montoya R. Jacks T. Tuveson D.A. Analysis of lung tumor initiation and progression using conditional expression of oncogenic K-ras.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3243-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Despite the significant effect of KRAS mutations in lung cancer, the effect of oncogenic KRAS on epithelial cells shortly after its activation, besides initiation of proliferation, has not been explored. Recent advances in technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and organoids make it possible to study transcriptional changes that follow oncogenic KRAS activation with single-cell resolution in a controlled environment. Previously published lung tumor organoids were derived from tumor cell lines or from tumors (Kaisani et al., 2014Kaisani A. Delgado O. Fasciani G. Kim S.B. Wright W.E. Minna J.D. Shay J.W.

We demonstrated previously that primary murine lung progenitor cells survive in vitro activation of oncogenic KRAS in organoid cultures (Zhang et al., 2017aZhang H. Brainson C.F. Koyama S. Redig A.J. Chen T. Li S. Gupta M. Garcia-de-alba C. Paschini M. Herter-sprie G.S. et al.Lkb1 inactivation drives lung cancer lineage switching governed by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specific effect of oncogenic KRAS on transcriptional states was not studied in any of these reports. To facilitate study of oncogenic KRAS-induced changes, we analyzed data from an early-stage KrasG12D GEMM, in-vitro-induced KrasG12D alveolar epithelial progenitor (AT2) cell-derived murine lung organoids, in-vitro-induced KRASG12D human lung organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and lesions from stage IA LUAD patients, all at single-cell resolution. Characterization of the data revealed that a reduction in AT2 cell lineage marker gene expression is an early consequence of oncogenic KRAS. Our organoid systems are tools to rapidly and accurately model LUAD progression in vitro, and our datasets useful resources for the cancer research community. We used scRNA-seq to define transcriptional changes in distal epithelial cell populations during early-stage LUAD in the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter containing KrasLSL-G12D; Rosa26LSL-YFP (KY) LUAD GEMM (Jackson et al., 2001Jackson E.L. Willis N. Mercer K. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Montoya R. Jacks T. Tuveson D.A. Analysis of lung tumor initiation and progression using conditional expression of oncogenic K-ras.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3243-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). KY mice were infected with an adenovirus 5 vector containing Cre recombinase driven by the ubiquitous cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Ad5-CMV-Cre) (Figure 1A). After 7 weeks, we observed small clusters of YFP+ cells consistent with atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (Figure S1A). Viable, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) positive, recombined (CD31−/CD45−/EPCAM+/YFP+ [YFP+]) and non-recombined (CD31−/CD45−/EPCAM+/YFP− [YFP−]) cells were collected using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figure S1B). We used 10X Genomics scRNA-seq to examine gene expression during early-stage LUAD and analyzed the data using ScanPy (Wolf et al., 2018Wolf F.A. Angerer P. Theis F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis.Genome Biol. 2018; 19: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). After pre-processing, we focused on clusters containing more than 100 cells, leaving four clusters for further analysis (Figures 1B, S1C, and S1D; STAR Methods). Cluster 1 (C1) was comprised primarily of YFP+ cells and C0 of YFP− cells, whereas C2 and C3 had equivalent contributions from YFP+ and YFP− cells (Figures 1C and 1D). Expression of the AT2 cell markers Sftpc and Lyz2 was highest in C0 and C1, of the ciliated cell markers Foxj1 and Cd24a in C2, and of the club cell markers Scgb1a1 and Scgb3a2 in C3 (Figure 1E). Although YFP+ and YFP− cells were present in C2 and C3, only C0 and C1 with elevated AT2 cell marker expression formed transcriptionally distinct YFP− and YFP+ clusters (Figures 1B–1D). Correlation analysis of all clusters revealed that C0 and C1 had some degree of similarity, whereas C2 and C3 were more distinct (Figure S1E). AT2 cells have been proposed previously as the LUAD cells of origin (Lin et al., 2012Lin C. Song H. Huang C. Yao E. Gacayan R. Xu S.-M. Chuang P.-T. Alveolar type II cells possess the capability of initiating lung tumor development.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e53817Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar; Xu et al., 2012Xu X. Rock J.R. Lu Y. Futtner C.

USA. 2012; 109: 4910-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and are the only lung epithelial cell type that forms a transcriptionally distinct cluster upon KRASG12D expression. Hence, we focused our studies on the consequences of KRAS activation in AT2 cells. To test whether the transcriptional changes in YFP+ C1 agree with previously published data, we calculated Z scores using gene signatures we expected to be elevated in YFP+ C1. Consistent with published observations, KRAS and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) target gene signatures were elevated in C1 cells, as was a proliferation signature, indicating that the cluster is transcriptionally primed to proliferate (Figures 1F–1H; Table S1; Barbie et al., 2009Barbie D.A.

Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16833) Google Scholar), had elevated expression in C1. Hence, upon KRASG12D expression, AT2 cells downregulate TF/TFCs that maintain AT2 cell identity, whereas factors known to promote cancer growth, important for developmental processes, and induce pluripotency have increased expression. We tested whether the expression of these TF/TFCs correlated with a transition to a less differentiated state, as often observed in late-stage cancers. Indeed, a signature consisting of 46 murine AT2 cell marker genes (Franzén et al., 2019Franzén O. Gan L.-M. Björkegren J.L.M. PanglaoDB: a web server for exploration of mouse and human single-cell RNA sequencing data.Database (Oxford). 2019; 2019: baz046Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was significantly lower in C1 compared with C0 (Figure 1I; Table S1). It has been shown recently that primary human LUAD contains cells that express multiple lineage-specific signatures (Laughney et al., 2020Laughney A.M. Hu J. Campbell N.R. Bakhoum S.F. Setty M. Lavallée V.P. Xie Y. Masilionis I. Carr A.J. Kottapalli S. et al.Regenerative lineages and immune-mediated pruning in lung cancer metastasis.Nat. Med. 2020; 26: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, we looked for “lineage infidelity” in our early-stage GEMM data. We found that C1 had lower expression of the AT2 cell markers Sftpc, Lyz2, and Etv5, consistent with loss of AT2 cell identity. Strikingly, the alveolar type 1 (AT1) markers Aqp5 and Pdpn and the club cell markers Scgb1a1 and Scgb3a2 were upregulated, indicating transcriptional priming for other lung epithelial cell types. Furthermore, Ly6a (SCA1), a marker of lung stem cells in mice (Kim et al., 2005Kim C.F. Jackson E.L. Woolfenden A.E. Lawrence S. Babar I. Vogel S. Crowley D. Bronson R.T. Jacks T. Identification of bronchioalveolar stem cells in normal lung and lung cancer.Cell. 2005; 121: 823-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar) and tumor-propagating cells in the KrasLSL-G12D/+; p53fl/fl (KP) lung cancer model (Curtis et al., 2010Curtis S.J.

Primary tumor genotype is an important determinant in identification of lung cancer propagating cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 127-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was also upregulated in some C1 cells (Figure S1H). Finally, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on differentially expressed genes in C0 and C1 to identify pathways altered in AT2 cells after KRAS activation. In total, we found 8 common, 73 C0-specific and 160 C1-specific enriched GO pathways (Figure S1I; Table S2). Unique terms in C1 included “NIK/NF-κB signaling” (NIK: NF-κB-inducing kinase), consistent with our finding (Figure 1G), and terms that indicate upregulated ribosome biogenesis and translation. Unique terms in C0 included cholesterol, alcohol, and lipid metabolism pathways, suggesting that these processes have an essential role in AT2 cell biology. To better understand transcriptional programs that follow KRASG12D activation, we developed an in vitro organoid system that allowed us to rapidly model changes in primary lung AT2 cells shortly after induction of oncogenic KRAS. We hypothesized that KrasG12D activation alone mimics an early tumor stage phenotype, whereas additional loss of the tumor suppressor Tp53 models a more advanced stage, as is the case in GEMMs (Jackson et al., 2001Jackson E.L.

We generated organoids by dissecting lungs of adult KY, KrasLSL-G12D/+; p53fl/fl; Rosa26LSL-YFP (KPY), and Rosa26LSL-YFP(Y) control mice and used FACS to isolate AT2 cells (CD45−/CD31−/EPCAM+/SCA1−) (Kim et al., 2005Kim C.F.

Upon Cre expression, almost all organoids were YFP+, suggesting high Cre induction efficiency (Figure 2B). Histological analysis revealed that our tumor organoid model recapitulated in vivo tumor progression. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections of organoids demonstrated that Y-CRE control organoids maintained normal nuclei, whereas the nuclei of KY-CRE and KPY-CRE cells became enlarged and abnormal, with giant multinucleated cancer cells in KPY organoids (Figure 2C). This observation is reminiscent of documented in vivo tumor cell phenotypes in the KrasLSL-G12D/+ and KP mouse models (Jackson et al., 2001Jackson E.L. Willis N. Mercer K. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Montoya R. Jacks T. Tuveson D.A.

The differential effects of mutant p53 alleles on advanced murine lung cancer.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10280-10288Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Next, we interrogated the effect of KRASG12D on proliferation. On day 7 of organoid culture, there was no significant difference in the percentage of KI67+ cells per organoid between the Y-CRE control and KY-CRE, whereas there were 1.3-fold and 1.6-fold increases in KPY-CRE organoids compared to Y-CRE and KY-CRE, respectively (Figures 2D and S2A). On day 14, most of the Y-CRE control organoids stained negative for KI67, whereas KY-CRE and KPY-CRE organoids still contained cells that stained positive for KI67 (Figures 2E and S2B). Thus, organoids from all three genotypes contained a high number of proliferating cells on day 7, but although most of the cells in the control organoids had stopped proliferating by day 14, cells in KY and KPY organoids continued to proliferate. To test whether KRASG12D-expressing organoids form tumors in vivo, we performed orthotopic transplantation assays. We transplanted single-cell suspensions from Y-CRE control, KY-CRE, and KPY-CRE organoids into the lungs of bleomycin-injured mice (n = 4, n = 6, and n = 4, respectively). After 4 weeks, we evaluated tumor formation by histology. The lungs of Y-CRE control-transplanted mice did not show any signs of aberrant epithelial cell growth or tumor formation (Figure 2F). In contrast, in KY-CRE- and KPY-CRE-transplanted lungs, we found tumors that contained cells with pleomorphic features and giant cancer cells in KPY-CRE-transplanted lungs, comparable with observations in the organoid cultures (Figures 2G and 2H). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining for YFP confirmed that these tumor lesions contained transplanted cells (Figures S2C and S2D). Hence, cells derived from our in-vitro-induced tumor organoids formed tumors within 4 weeks, dramatically reducing the time required to model lung cancer in vivo compared with traditional GEMMs. To further investigate transcriptional changes following KRASG12D activation, we performed RNA-seq on cells from our organoid cultures. KY- and KPY-derived AT2 cells received the Ad5-CMV-Empty virus (Emp, control), no virus (control), or CRE (Figure 3A). Because we sought to reveal transcriptional changes that follow KRASG12D activation but not proliferation, we analyzed the organoids on day 7 of organoid culture, when proliferation was observed in all organoid types. After 7 days in culture, single-cell suspensions were enriched for epithelial cells by FACS for EPCAM+ cells (Figure S3A). 87% ± 7% and 95% ± 2% of EPCAM+ cells of the KY-CRE and KPY-CRE samples, respectively, were YFP+, further confirming the high efficiency of in vitro Cre induction. Next we performed RNA-seq on EPCAM+ cells. Sample-sample correlation analysis revealed that all control samples were highly correlated, whereas KY-CRE and KPY-CRE samples had high correlation and were transcriptionally distinct from the controls (Figure S3B). To perform DE analysis, we compared the CRE samples with their respective Emp controls (henceforth, KY-Differential [KY-Dif] and KPY-Differential [KPY-Dif]; Table S3). To determine genes that were altered by KRASG12D expression, we compared KY-Dif with KPY-Dif and found 1,206 genes that were shared upregulated and 1,464 genes that were shared downregulated (Figure S3C; Table S3). Because we saw downregulation of AT2 cell differentiation genes in our GEMM data, we investigated the expression of known AT2 cell markers and lung development genes. When we compared the top 100 up- and downregulated genes in our RNA-seq data, we found that Cd74 and Lyz2, two AT2 cell marker genes, were among the top shared downregulated genes (Figures 3B and 3C). Conversely, the developmental genes Hmga2 and Sox9 were upregulated. Furthermore, we found increased expression of Ly6a (SCA1), consistent with our findings in vivo (Figures S1H, 3B, and 3C). Moreover, we found that other known AT2 cell markers, Sftpc, Sftpd, and Nkx2-1, were significantly downregulated in organoids from both genotypes (Figure 3C). Next, we investigated whether these changes also occurred at the protein level. IF staining for surfactant protein C (SPC; Sftpc) showed that the percentage of SPC+ cells per organoid decreased 6.7-fold in KY-CRE and 20-fold in KPY-CRE compared with Y-CRE control organoids on day 7 (Figures 3D and 3E). On day 14, there was a 1.1-fold decrease in KY-CRE and a 1.6-fold decrease in KPY-CRE compared with Y control organoids (Figures S3E and S3F). Furthermore, staining for the lung epithelial marker NKX2-1 and the developmental marker HMGA2 was negatively correlated; individual cells that gained HMGA2 expression had reduced levels of NKX2-1 (Figure 3F). Thus, we demonstrated that transcriptional downregulation of AT2 cell markers and upregulation of developmental markers correlated with altered expression of the respective proteins. To further characterized our KY-CRE organoids, we performed scRNA-seq. As before, we characterized day 7 EPCAM+ cells from KY-CRE and KY-Emp organoids (Figures 4A and S4A). After filtering and preprocessing the data, we identified three clusters: C0org, C1org, and C2org (Figures 4B, S4B, and S4C). C1org was composed mostly of KY-Emp cells, representing the control cluster, whereas C0org and C2org mostly contained KY-CRE cells (Figures 4B–4D). Correlation analysis revealed that all three clusters were distinct and that C0org and C1org were negatively correlated (Figure S4D). As with our GEMM data, we checked the expression of previously published gene signatures upregulated in NSCLC. As expected, the KRAS activation signature was upregulated in C0org and C2org compared with control cluster C1org (Figure 4E; Table S1). The NF-κB activation signature was lower in C2org and higher in C0org compared with C1org, indicating that only one of the Cre clusters had upregulated NF-κB signaling (Figure 4F; Table S1). Interestingly, the proliferation signature was only elevated in C2org but not in C0org, indicating that only one of the Cre clusters had a higher proliferation signature than the control, despite high Kras activation signatures in both clusters (Figure 4G; Table S1). Next, we performed DE analysis followed by identification of TF/TFCs (Figures S4E and S4F; Tables S1 and S4). Similar to our GEMM data, control C1org had elevated expression of Etv5, providing additional evidence of loss of AT2 cell transcriptional identity. One TF highly expressed in both Cre clusters compared with the control was Foxq1, and C2org had high expression of Id1"

Here we describe NucleaSeq-nuclease digestion and deep sequencing-a massively parallel platform that measures the cleavage kinetics and time-resolved cleavage products for over 10,000 targets containing mismatches, insertions and deletions relative to the guide RNA. Combining cleavage rates and binding specificities on the same target libraries, we benchmarked five SpCas9 variants and AsCas12a. A biophysical model built from these data sets revealed mechanistic insights into off-target cleavage. Engineered Cas9s, especially Cas9-HF1, dramatically increased cleavage specificity but not binding specificity compared to wtCas9. Surprisingly, AsCas12a cleavage specificity differed little from that of wtCas9. Initial DNA cleavage sites and end trimming varied by nuclease, guide RNA and the positions of mispaired nucleotides. More broadly, NucleaSeq enables rapid, quantitative and systematic comparisons of specificity and cleavage outcomes across engineered and natural nucleases."
https://openalex.org/W3083200957,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a leading cause of termination in drug development programs and removal of drugs from the market; this is partially due to the inability to identify patients who are at risk1. In this study, we developed a polygenic risk score (PRS) for DILI by aggregating effects of numerous genome-wide loci identified from previous large-scale genome-wide association studies2. The PRS predicted the susceptibility to DILI in patients treated with fasiglifam, amoxicillin–clavulanate or flucloxacillin and in primary hepatocytes and stem cell-derived organoids from multiple donors treated with over ten different drugs. Pathway analysis highlighted processes previously implicated in DILI, including unfolded protein responses and oxidative stress. In silico screening identified compounds that elicit transcriptomic signatures present in hepatocytes from individuals with elevated PRS, supporting mechanistic links and suggesting a novel screen for safety of new drug candidates. This genetic-, cellular-, organoid- and human-scale evidence underscored the polygenic architecture underlying DILI vulnerability at the level of hepatocytes, thus facilitating future mechanistic studies. Moreover, the proposed ‘polygenicity-in-a-dish’ strategy might potentially inform designs of safer, more efficient and robust clinical trials. Polygenic risk scores can predict susceptibility to drug-induced liver injury in patients and can stratify cellular viability of iPSC-derived liver organoids and primary hepatocytes from multiple donors."

The current standard of care is to administer broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting pathogen susceptibilities to guide treatment decisions. However, blood cultures are not always attainable, and it may take several days to deduce antibiotic susceptibilities. Any delay in intervention exacerbates patient mortality, especially in sepsis (Dellinger et al., 2013Dellinger R.P. Levy M.M. Rhodes A. Annane D. Gerlach H. Opal S.M. Sevransky J.E. Sprung C.L.

In the case of vancomycin, while resistance is rare, clinical failure is common, revealing shortcomings in predictive power of standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Ersoy et al., 2017Ersoy S.C.

Herein, we explore whether host responses measured within hours of clinical presentation can accurately predict mortality risk, which could ultimately inform appropriate and personalized therapy.

Care Med. 2016; 44: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). While these findings represent starting points for “precision medicine” in SaB, the host response to infection is highly complex and extends beyond immunological parameters. For example, lactic acidosis and acute kidney injury are associated with SaB mortality and are potential markers of mitochondrial dysfunction, reflecting effects on host metabolism (Mikkelsen et al., 2009Mikkelsen M.E. Miltiades A.N. Gaieski D.F. Goyal M. Fuchs B.D. Shah C.V. Bellamy S.L. Christie J.D. Serum lactate is associated with mortality in severe sepsis independent of organ failure and shock.Crit.

The role of mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis-induced multi-organ failure.Virulence. 2014; 5: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of host factors altered during SaB may elucidate additional features that can predict patient outcomes and guide therapeutic development. Here, we construct a molecular snapshot of SaB patient serum collected upon clinical presentation, providing the earliest view possible of the in vivo human response to infection. Using metabolomics and multiplexed quantitative proteomics, we analyzed samples from two cohorts (>200 individuals), including uninfected controls. Through multiple rounds of biomarker analyses, we defined features with strong individual predictive value, which increases when used in combination. The depth of analysis was enhanced through computational methods, which identified prevalent post-translational modifications (PTMs) and inferred underlying cytokine signaling networks. These techniques revealed glycopeptides as more precise biomarkers and uncovered carbamylation on serum proteins in patients who succumbed to infection. Ultimately, we provide a starting point for a rapid clinical test that identifies patients with high mortality risk. Further refinement of SaB biomarkers will enable clinicians to identify patients who need intensified monitoring and therapy, rather than responding post hoc to failures in standard of care. We employed a multi-omic approach to gain a comprehensive view of the SaB host-pathogen interaction (Figure 1A). First, a discovery cohort was analyzed by standard multiplexed proteomics to assess the ability of serum proteins to predict SaB patient phenotypes. This initial analysis identified 1,405 proteins with a false discovery rate (FDR) <1% and yielded biomarker candidates associated with various disease features including mortality (Table S1). Based on this analysis, a power calculation was performed and, together with reported recommendations (Frantzi et al., 2014Frantzi M. Bhat A. Latosinska A. Clinical proteomic biomarkers: relevant issues on study design & technical considerations in biomarker development.Clin. Transl. Med. 2014; 3: 7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we designed a validation cohort of 200 samples (25 control, 99 SaB survival, 76 SaB mortality). To deepen our comprehension of the molecular features related to SaB, the expanded cohort was analyzed through standard proteomic workflows as well as PTM-tolerant and metabolomic approaches (Figure 1A). Overall, 1,088 proteins (294 across all samples; Table S2), 5,280 metabolomic features (720 across all samples; Table S3), and 6,700 modified peptides (332 across all samples; Table S4) were quantified in this experiment. The resultant >10,000 features were analyzed with binary comparisons to identify biomarkers, and through clustering and network based approaches to define disease associations within our primary sample groups (control groups: NN, non-hospital, non-infected; HN, hospital, non-infected; infection groups: HS, hospital, survival; HM, hospital, mortality). Hierarchical clustering of the proteomics data showed clear segregation of the control and infected samples (Figure 1B). In contrast, SaB survival and mortality groups were intermixed, indicating that the differences between SaB mortality and survival are subtle. Nevertheless, stratification of mortality and survival groups was observed in the clustered dendrogram, indicating the potential to define mortality biomarkers. As a proof of principle for distinguishing disease states, we first selected a highly discriminating protein for predicting infection, rather than mortality. SERPINA5 emerged as a top hit (Figure 1C), with a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9891 (Figure 1D). This protein had a higher AUC than the standard infection marker, C-reactive protein (CRP) (WHO, 2014WHOC-reactive protein concentrations as a marker of inflammation or infection for interpreting biomarkers of micronutrient status.https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/indicators_c-reactive_protein/en/Date: 2014Google Scholar), in the current dataset (AUC = 0.9691) as well as reported values (maximum AUC = 0.92) (Liu et al., 2010Liu A.

This example demonstrates the power of unbiased proteomics for biomarker discovery. Our first goal was to define high-confidence biomarkers to predict SaB patient mortality. To rank biomarkers, we took an ensemble feature selection (EFS) approach (Neumann et al., 2017Neumann U. Genze N. Heider D. EFS: an ensemble feature selection tool implemented as R-package and web-application.BioData Min. 2017; 10: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which applied multiple feature selection algorithms, then aggregated and ranked the results. This method can avoid biases associated with individual feature selection algorithms (He and Yu, 2010He Z. Yu W. Stable feature selection for biomarker discovery.Comput. Biol. Chem. 2010; 34: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and was applied to the two primary datasets to rank top biomarkers (Proteomics Figure 2A; Metabolomics Figure 2D). Due to the incompatibility of EFS with missing values, features with missing values were ranked using Mann-Whitney U (MWU) tests and the average from both strategies was taken for final biomarker rankings (Tables S2 and S3). Importantly, biomarker ranks by EFS and MWU tests were concordant (Figures S1A and S1B). The highest ranked protein biomarkers were fetuin B (Figure 2B), heparin cofactor II (SERPIND1, Figure S1C), and carnosine dipeptidase 1 (CNDP1, Figure S1D), all with decreased serum levels. The decrease in serum fetuin B was also captured in the initial cohort, despite a low number of mortality samples analyzed (Figure S1E). Our top biomarkers with increased serum levels were SVEP1 (Figure 2C), cystatin B (CSTB, Figure S1F) and pulmonary surfactant-associated protein B (SFTPB, Figure S1G). Applying a similar approach to the metabolomics data, we found that the highest ranked biomarkers were unidentified MS features (Figure 2D). However, these molecules showed considerable predictive utility (Figures 2E and 2F), similar to our top-ranked protein biomarkers (ROC AUC = ∼0.75; p < 0.0001). The top ranked, identified metabolites include 2-Hexadecanoylthio-1-Ethylphosphorylcholine (HEPC, Figure S1H) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P, Figure S1I) by EFS and thyroxine (T4, Figure S1J) and decanoyl-carnitine (Figure S1K) by MWU test.Figure S1Additional Biomarkers Analysis and Validation of Top Markers, Related to Figure 2Show full captionCorrelation of Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test and ensemble feature selection (EFS) rankings for (A) proteins and (B) metabolites.

The EFS approach ensures that the top-ranked biomarkers are not correlated to one another and therefore could be used in combination for the enhanced prediction of SaB patient mortality (Williams, 2009Williams F.M. Biomarkers: in combination they may do better.Arthritis Res. Ther. 2009; 11: 130Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Using the top two markers from both workflows enhanced predictive power relative to the individual markers alone (Figure 2G). To support the proteomics workflow, we validated fetuin B (Figure 2H) and other top biomarkers (Figures S1L and S1M) in a subset of samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (fetuin B AUC = 0.8945). Our results indicate that patients with low fetuin B (<2.2 μg/mL) had significantly reduced survival compared to patients with high fetuin B (Figure 2I). An important factor to consider when performing biomarker analyses is the influence of confounding factors (Ensor, 2014Ensor J.E. Biomarker validation: common data analysis concerns.Oncologist. 2014; 19: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To investigate this matter, we performed a metadata-wide assessment for every multi-omic feature detected (Proteomics Table S5; Metabolomics Table S6). We found that all top biomarkers (up and downregulated) are predominantly associated with infection and mortality, with minimal associations to other clinical metadata (Proteomics Figures 2J and S2A–S2G; Metabolomics Figures S2H–S2M). The next most common metadata associated with the top biomarkers are dialysis and serum creatinine levels, both related to kidney function (Levey et al., 1988Levey A.S. Perrone R.D. Madias N.E. Serum creatinine and renal function.Annu. Rev. Med. 1988; 39: 465-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mortality in bacteremia (Nielsen et al., 2015Nielsen L.H. Jensen-Fangel S. Benfield T. Skov R.

Indeed, there was negligible influence of typical confounding variables (e.g., age, gender) on the top SaB mortality biomarkers. Overall, these results provide an extensive list of biomarkers associated with SaB mortality. Serum is a notoriously difficult sample to analyze via proteomics (Chandramouli and Qian, 2009Chandramouli K. Qian P.Y. Proteomics: challenges, techniques and possibilities to overcome biological sample complexity.Hum. Genomics Proteomics. 2009; 2009: 239204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Geyer et al., 2017Geyer P.E. Holdt L.M. Teupser D. Mann M. Revisiting biomarker discovery by plasma proteomics.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2017; 13: 942Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), attributed to the large dynamic range of proteins and high numbers of PTMs. Thus, standard serum proteomic searches fail to identify greater than 90% of the spectra acquired from mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics (Dey et al., 2019Dey K.K. Wang H. Niu M. Bai B. Wang X. Li Y. Cho J.H. Tan H. Mishra A. High A.A. et al.Deep undepleted human serum proteome profiling toward biomarker discovery for Alzheimer’s disease.Clin. Proteomics. 2019; 16: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that predicating abundant PTMs could facilitate a PTM-inclusive analysis and identify more spectra. PTM identification and localization is optimally derived from high-resolution mass spectra (Chick et al., 2015Chick J.M. Kolippakkam D. Nusinow D.P. Zhai B. Rad R. Huttlin E.L. Gygi S.P. A mass-tolerant database search identifies a large proportion of unassigned spectra in shotgun proteomics as modified peptides.Nat.

Elias J.E. TagGraph reveals vast protein modification landscapes from large tandem mass spectrometry datasets.Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, all subsequent PTM analyses was performed on high-resolution MS2 data acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer. The high-resolution data displayed similar results to low-resolution data when matching unmodified peptides in terms of peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) (Figure S3A), identification of peptides (Figure S3B) and proteins (Figure S3C), and quantification by both spectral counting (Figure S3D) and TMT-based quantification (Figure S3E). To identify global modifications in the serum proteome, we used molecular networking to group similar spectra that differ by regular mass shifts (Wang et al., 2016Wang M. Carver J.J. Phelan V.V. Sanchez L.M. Garg N. Peng Y. Nguyen D.D. Watrous J. Kapono C.A. Luzzatto-Knaan T. et al.Sharing and community curation of mass spectrometry data with Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 828-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Overall, we networked >80% of the MS2 spectra (Figure 3A), suggesting that many of the peptides identified in the standard database search have variant forms. We observed highly abundant PTMs present in our data (Figure 3B), including expected artifacts such as oxidation of methionine (+15.99), alkylation of cysteine (+57.02) as well as unanticipated modifications such as carbamylation (+43.005), dioxidation (+31.99), and formylation (+27.99). Notably, the glycan moieties fucose (+146.06), hexose (+162.05), and sialic acid (+291.1) were also highly abundant. This suggests that the peptides captured in our MS analysis are rich in PTMs, complicating identification through traditional strategies.Figure 3PTM-Tolerant Analysis of SaB Patient SerumShow full caption(A) Pie chart of networked MS2 spectra.(B) Network edge histogram with top mass shifts highlighted.(C) Percentage of MS2 spectra matched in both workflows.(D) Correlation of network edges and PTMs detected in PTM-tolerant workflow.(E) Abundance and ROC curve of AHSG N156 HexNAc(4)Hex(5)NeuAc(2) (control versus infected).(F) Abundance and ROC curve of AHSG N156 HexNAc(4)Hex(5)NeuAc(1) (survival versus mortality).(G) Fold changes of total AHSG protein and glycosylations of N156 for infection and mortality samples.(H) Multi-omic ROC curve (survival versus mortality).(I) Abundance of modified peptides assigned to the mortality-specific cluster.(J) Distribution of peptide counts and modifications types of albumin (ALB) and serotransferrin (TF).(K) Albumin mortality associated PTM plot depicting modified peptide abundance (left) and modified peptide abundance normalized to protein levels (right).Error bars represent interquartile range (IQR).

To capitalize on these discovered modifications, we employed a PTM-tolerant search strategy, which achieved a doubling of the serum PSM rate (Figure 3C). Non-glycan modifications called in the PTM-tolerant search were correlated with the number of edges from the GNPS analysis (Figure 3D). Further, >85% of glycosylation sites detected have been previously reported in Uniprot (Figure S4A), supporting their identification as true glycopeptides. The distribution of mass errors from the modified peptides was nearly identical to the standard search (Figure S4B), indicating spectral identification quality is maintained. We also found that the total PSMs and unique peptides per protein were highly correlated between the standard and the PTM-tolerant search (Figures S4C and S4D). We noted that the PTM-tolerant search increased the number of unique peptides detected for low-abundant proteins; proteins with the fewest unique peptides in the standard search gained more unique peptides in the PTM-t"

https://openalex.org/W3083729285,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is associated with both familial and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease. Despite its importance, the role of APP family in neuronal function and survival remains unclear because of perinatal lethality exhibited by knockout mice lacking all three APP family members. Here we report that selective inactivation of APP family members in excitatory neurons of the postnatal forebrain results in neither cortical neurodegeneration nor increases in apoptosis and gliosis up to ∼2 years of age. However, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory are impaired in these mutant mice. Furthermore, hippocampal neurons lacking APP family exhibit hyperexcitability, as evidenced by increased neuronal spiking in response to depolarizing current injections, whereas blockade of Kv7 channels mimics and largely occludes the effects of APP family inactivation. These findings demonstrate that APP family is not required for neuronal survival and suggest that APP family may regulate neuronal excitability through Kv7 channels."
https://openalex.org/W3083658372,"Understanding the mechanisms of neural computation and learning will require knowledge of the underlying circuitry. Because it is difficult to directly measure the wiring diagrams of neural circuits, there has long been an interest in estimating them algorithmically from multicell activity recordings. We show that even sophisticated methods, applied to unlimited data from every cell in the circuit, are biased toward inferring connections between unconnected but highly correlated neurons. This failure to ‘explain away’ connections occurs when there is a mismatch between the true network dynamics and the model used for inference, which is inevitable when modeling the real world. Thus, causal inference suffers when variables are highly correlated, and activity-based estimates of connectivity should be treated with special caution in strongly connected networks. Finally, performing inference on the activity of circuits pushed far out of equilibrium by a simple low-dimensional suppressive drive might ameliorate inference bias. The authors demonstrate that strongly recurrent circuits inferred from neural activity, even with unlimited data from every neuron, are biased. Synapses are inferred between unconnected but correlated neurons. Inference based on non-equilibrium activity may help remedy this."

https://openalex.org/W3083145782,"Manganese (Mn)-induced neurotoxicity resembles Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanisms underpinning its effects remain unknown. Mn dysregulates astrocytic glutamate transporters, GLT-1 and GLAST, and dopaminergic function, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Our previous in vitro studies have shown that Mn repressed GLAST and GLT-1 via activation of transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1). Here, we investigated if in vivo astrocytic YY1 deletion mitigates Mn-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, attenuating Mn-induced reduction in GLAST/GLT-1 expression in murine substantia nigra (SN). AAV5-GFAP-Cre-GFP particles were infused into the SN of 8-week-old YY1 flox/flox mice to generate a region-specific astrocytic YY1 conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model. 3 weeks after adeno-associated viral (AAV) infusion, mice were exposed to 330 μg of Mn (MnCl2 30 mg/kg, intranasal instillation, daily) for 3 weeks. After Mn exposure, motor functions were determined in open-field and rotarod tests, followed by Western blotting, quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry to assess YY1, TH, GLAST, and GLT-1 levels. Infusion of AAV5-GFAP-Cre-GFP vectors into the SN resulted in region-specific astrocytic YY1 deletion and attenuation of Mn-induced impairment of motor functions, reduction of TH-expressing cells in SN, and TH mRNA/protein levels in midbrain/striatum. Astrocytic YY1 deletion also attenuated the Mn-induced decrease in GLAST/GLT-1 mRNA/protein levels in midbrain. Moreover, YY1 deletion abrogated its interaction with histone deacetylases in astrocytes. These results indicate that astrocytic YY1 plays a critical role in Mn-induced neurotoxicity in vivo, at least in part, by reducing astrocytic GLAST/GLT-1. Thus, YY1 might be a potential target for treatment of Mn toxicity and other neurological disorders associated with dysregulation of GLAST/GLT-1."

https://openalex.org/W3083002811,"Climbing fibers from the inferior olive make strong excitatory synapses onto cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) dendrites and trigger distinctive responses known as complex spikes. We found that, in awake mice, a complex spike in one PC suppressed conventional simple spikes in neighboring PCs for several milliseconds. This involved a new ephaptic coupling, in which an excitatory synapse generated large negative extracellular signals that nonsynaptically inhibited neighboring PCs. The distance dependence of complex spike–simple spike ephaptic signaling, combined with the known CF divergence, allowed a single inferior olive neuron to influence the output of the cerebellum by synchronously suppressing the firing of potentially over 100 PCs. Optogenetic studies in vivo and dynamic clamp studies in slice indicated that such brief PC suppression, as a result of either ephaptic signaling or other mechanisms, could effectively promote firing in neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei with remarkable speed and precision. Han et al. find that, in addition to powerfully exciting Purkinje cells, climbing fibers rapidly suppress firing in nearby Purkinje cells. Current from glutamate receptor activation generates large extracellular signals that inhibit neighboring cells."
https://openalex.org/W3083652177,"O-GlcNAcylation is a form of posttranslational modification, and serves various functions, including modulation of location, stability, and activity for the modified proteins. O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is an essential cellular enzyme that posttranslationally modifies the cellular proteins with O-GlcNAc moiety. Early studies reported that the decreased O-GlcNAcylation regulates cellular autophagy, a process relevant for hepatitis B virus replication (HBV) and assembly. Therefore, we addressed the question how O-GlcNAcylation regulates cellular autophagy and HBV replication. Inhibition of OGT activity with a small molecule inhibitor OSMI-1 or silencing OGT significantly enhanced HBV replication and HBsAg production in hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). Western blotting analysis showed that inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cellular autophagy, two processes subsequently leading to enhanced HBV replication. Importantly, the numbers of autophagosomes and the levels of autophagic markers LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 in hepatoma cells were elevated after inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation. Further analysis revealed that inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation blocked autophagosome-lysosome fusion and thereby prevented autophagic degradation of HBV virions and proteins. Moreover, OSMI-1 further promoted HBV replication by inducing autophagosome formation via inhibiting the O-GlcNAcylation of Akt and mTOR. In conclusion, decreased O-GlcNAcylation enhanced HBV replication through increasing autophagosome formation at multiple levels, including triggering ER-stress, Akt/mTOR inhibition, and blockade of autophagosome-lysosome fusion."
https://openalex.org/W3083705050,"Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is an essential nutrient for human health. Due to the changes in our dietary pattern, dietary Pi overload engenders systemic phosphotoxicity, including excessive Pi-related vascular calcification and chronic tissue injury. The molecular mechanisms of the seemingly distinct phenotypes remain elusive. In this study, we investigated Pi-mediated cellular response in HEK293 and HeLa cells. We found that abnormally high Pi directly mediates diverse cellular toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Up to 10 mM extracellular Pi promotes cell proliferation by activating AKT signaling cascades and augmenting cell cycle progression. By introducing additional Pi, higher than the concentration of 40 mM, we observed significant cell damage caused by the interwoven Pi-related biological processes. Elevated Pi activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, encompassing extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 and Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), which consequently potentiates Pi triggered lethal epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Synergistically, high Pi-caused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress also contributes to apparent apoptosis. To counteract, Pi-activated AKT signaling promotes cell survival by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and blocking ER stress. Pharmacologically or genetically abrogating Pi transport, the impact of high Pi-induced cytotoxicity could be reduced. Taken together, abnormally high extracellular Pi results in a broad spectrum of toxicity by rewiring complicated signaling networks that control cell growth, cell death, and homeostasis."

Cell specific deletion of IL-10 in T regulatory cells and dendritic cells was accomplished using Foxp3 and CD11c driven cre recombination in IL10flox/flox mice, respectively. Upon treatment with cisplatin, both the IL10flox/flox and the Foxp3YFP-Cre x IL10flox/flox mice developed similar degrees of kidney injury. However, mice with the dendritic cell deletion of IL-10 showed more severe structural and functional changes in the kidney compared to the IL10flox/flox mice.

https://openalex.org/W3084188602,"Background Millions of people have undergone direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT), but little is known about individuals' motivations and experiences (e.g., discussion topics and emotions after obtaining the test results) in engaging with DTC-GT services. Previous studies either involved only a small number of DTC-GT consumers or were based on hypothetical scenarios. Objective Our study aimed to fill this gap by investigating online discussions about DTC-GT that developed naturally among tens of thousands of social media users. Methods We focused on the posts that were published in the r/23andme and r/AncestryDNA subreddits, which correspond to the two companies with the largest number of consumers in the DTC-GT market. We applied computational methods to infer and examine the topics discussed, temporal trends in posting rates and themes (e.g., aggregation of related topics), and emotions expressed in these online forums. Results We collected 157,000 posts published by 16,500 Reddit users between 2013 and 2019. We found that the posting rates increased sharply after popular promotional events (e.g., each Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday) and most posts were inquiries into, or status updates about, testing progress. The inferred themes of Ancestral Origin and Kinship/Feelings were the two most frequently discussed, while discussions about the Health Risks theme focused primarily on submitting DTC-GT raw data to third parties for interpretation. The Kinship/Feelings theme exhibited the largest range of emotional response. A qualitative review of the posts with extreme emotions showed that some people became excited because they found their biological parents or other kin, while others became upset because they unexpectedly found that their parents or other kin were not biologically related to them. Conclusion This research demonstrates that online social media platforms can serve as a rich resource for characterizing actual DTC-GT experiences. The findings suggest that DTC-GT consumers' purchasing behaviors are associated with societal events and that future investigations should consider how DTC-GT challenges our understanding of kinship structure and function, genomic privacy, and the interpretation of health risks."

Aim The SOLID study aimed to investigate the feasibility of a definitive randomised controlled trial, comparing two behaviour change interventions to reduce risky substance use (illicit drugs and alcohol), and improve mental health, in young people in care. Methods We recruited young people in care aged 12–20 years, self-reporting substance use within the previous 12 months and residing in 1 of 6 participating local authority sites in the North East of England. Participants were randomised to either i. Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), ii. Social Behaviour and Network Therapy (SBNT) or iii. Control (usual care). All interventions were delivered by trained drug and alcohol workers. Follow-up data were collected 12 months post recruitment. Feasibility for trial progression was compared to pre-specified stop: go criteria (recruitment of 60% of eligible participants, 80% of participants attending 60% of offered sessions and retention of 70% of participants at 12 month follow up). Results Of 1450 eligible participants, 860 (59%) were screened for drug and alcohol use by social workers, 211 (24.5%) met inclusion criteria for the trial and 112 young people (7.7%) consented and were randomised. Sixty of these 112 participants (54%) completed 12-month follow-up questionnaires. Only 15 out of the 76 (20%) participants allocated to an intervention arm attended any of the offered MET or SBNT sessions. Conclusion By reference to pre-specified stop: go criteria it is not feasible to conduct a definitive trial for SOLID in its current format. Despite co-designing procedures with staff and young people in care, the screening, referral and treatment pathway did not work here. Future work may require dedicated clinically embedded research resource to evaluate effectiveness of new interventions in services."

In the second, experimental study (N = 303) we measured the participants' fear and goal-orientation in relation to AVs. Then, after the manipulation of the AV advertisement (imbued with communal vs agentic content), technology acceptance components (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and behavioral intention) were verified. The comparative analysis of the structural model estimates showed that the both participants' fear and goal-orientation in relation to AVs were associated much more with the acceptance components of the communal AV rather than the agentic one. Therefore, people want to know both whether AVs are communal and agentic, but they are more prone to accept a communal AV than agentic one."
https://openalex.org/W3084078300,"Background Regional variations in gastric cancer incidence are not explained by prevalence of Helicobacter pylori, the main cause of the disease, with several areas presenting high H. pylori prevalence but low gastric cancer incidence. The IARC worldwide H. pylori prevalence surveys (ENIGMA) aim at systematically describing age and sex-specific prevalence of H. pylori infection around the world and generating hypotheses to explain regional variations in gastric cancer risk. Methods We selected age- and sex-stratified population samples in two areas with different gastric cancer incidence and mortality in Chile: Antofagasta (lower rate) and Valdivia (higher rate). Participants were 1–69 years old and provided interviews and blood for anti-H. pylori antibodies (IgG, VacA, CagA, others) and atrophy biomarkers (pepsinogens). Results H. pylori seroprevalence (Age-standardized to world population) and antibodies against CagA and VacA were similar in both sites. H. pylori seroprevalence was 20% among children <10 years old, 40% among 10–19 year olds, 60% in the 20–29 year olds and close to or above 80% in those 30+ years. The comparison of the prevalence of known and potential H. pylori cofactors in gastric carcinogenesis between the high and the low risk area showed that consumption of chili products was significantly higher in Valdivia and daily non-green vegetable consumption was more common in Antofagasta. Pepsinogen levels suggestive of gastric atrophy were significantly more common and occurred at earlier ages in Valdivia, the higher risk area. In a multivariate model combining both study sites, age, chili consumption and CagA were the main risk factors for gastric atrophy. Conclusions The prevalence of H. pylori infection and its virulence factors was similar in the high and the low risk area, but atrophy was more common and occurred at younger ages in the higher risk area. Dietary factors could partly explain higher rates of atrophy and gastric cancer in Valdivia. Impact The ENIGMA study in Chile contributes to better understanding regional variations in gastric cancer incidence and provides essential information for public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3084415917,"Fibrosis is a pathological feature of chronic kidney disease and its progression correlates with declining renal function. Kidney fibrosis is driven by multiple profibrotic factors. This project examined the regulatory function of WNT1-inducible-signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) in the development of kidney fibrosis. Induction of WISP1 by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), and the role of WISP1 in TGF-β1/Smad signaling and fibrotic responses, was examined in multiple kidney cells. Kidney expression of WISP1 was examined in mouse models of unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. WISP1 antibody was administered to UUO mice during the induction of kidney injury and the impact on kidney fibrosis was examined. WISP1 expression was upregulated in both mouse models. TGF-β1-induced expression of WISP1 and profibrotic genes in cultured kidney cells via TGF-βR1. Recombinant WISP1-induced expression of TGF-βR1 in kidney cells. Suppression of WISP1 by shRNA or neutralizing antibody reduced TGF-β1-mediated activation of Smad3, fibrotic gene expression, and fibroblast proliferation. Treatment with WISP1 antibody inhibited the development of kidney fibrosis in UUO mice. WISP1 mediates the profibrotic effects of TGF-β1 in kidney cells and in kidney disease. Pharmacological blockade of WISP1 exhibits potential as a novel therapy for inhibiting kidney fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3083017306,"We hypothesized that pre-exercise may effectively prevent cancer cachexia-induced muscle atrophy in both fast- and slow-twitch muscle types. Additionally, the fast-twitch muscle may be more affected by cancer cachexia than slow-twitch muscle. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of pre-exercise on cancer cachexia-induced atrophy and on atrophy in fast- and slow-twitch muscles. Twelve male Wistar rats were randomly divided into sedentary and exercise groups, and another 24 rats were randomly divided into control, pre-exercise, cancer cachexia induced by intraperitoneal injections of ascites hepatoma AH130 cells, and pre-exercise plus cancer cachexia groups. We analyzed changes in muscle mass and in gene and protein expression levels of major regulators and indicators of muscle protein degradation and synthesis pathways, angiogenic factors, and mitochondrial function in both the plantaris and soleus muscles. Pre-exercise inhibited muscle mass loss, rescued protein synthesis, prevented capillary regression, and suppressed hypoxia in the plantaris and soleus muscles. Pre-exercise inhibited mitochondrial dysfunction differently in fast- and slow-twitch muscles. These results suggested that pre-exercise has the potential to inhibit cancer-cachexia-induced muscle atrophy in both fast- and slow-twitch muscles. Furthermore, the different progressions of cancer-cachexia-induced muscle atrophy in fast- and slow-twitch muscles are related to differences in mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W3084140520,"Background Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of NPC1 or NPC2, which encode the proteins that are responsible for intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Loss of this function results in the accumulation of cholesterol-related products, such as oxysterols, sphingolipids, and NPC-related bile acids, which were recently used as biochemical biomarkers for the diagnosis of NPC. Bile acid-408 is a new significant compound we found in Japanese NPC patients, and it likely belongs to the category of bile acids. However, the diagnosis of NPC using a single biomarker is not satisfactory for clinical application because of the high instance of false negatives or positives. Therefore, we proposed an application of NPC diagnosis using a combination of 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC), lysosphingomyelin (lysoSM), bile acid-408 and/or glucosylsphingosine (lysoGL-1). Methods and findings 7-KC, lysoSM and lysoGL-1 in sera and bile acid-408 in dried blood spots (DBS) were quantified within 17 minutes using tandem mass spectrometry and high-resolution mass spectrometry, respectively. We measured these biomarkers in NPC patients (n = 19), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) patients (n = 5), patients with other lysosomal diseases (n = 300), newborns (n = 124) and healthy people (n = 74). Our results showed a promising accuracy (97%) for NPC diagnosis using the combination of 7-KC, lysoSM and bile acid-408. However, contrary to our expectations, lysoGL-1 levels did not present at a significantly greater amount in NPC patients than other patients and negative controls. Conclusions The combination of 7-KC, lysoSM and bile acid-408 improves the accuracy of NPC diagnosis and is feasible for mass screening due to its simple sample preparation and measurement. Future research should investigate the chemical structure of bile acid-408 to further facilitate its advantage in diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3084399272,"Renal fibrosis is the common pathological process of various chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Recent studies indicate that mitochondrial fragmentation is closely associated with renal fibrosis in CKD. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to mitochondrial fragmentation remain to be elucidated. The present study investigated the role of regulators of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) in mitochondrial fission and renal interstitial fibrosis using conditional knockout mice in which RCAN1 was genetically deleted in tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TEC-specific deletion of RCAN1 attenuated tubulointerstitial fibrosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotype change after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) through suppressing TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway. TEC-specific deletion of RCAN1 also reduced the tubular apoptosis after UUO by inhibiting cytochrome c/caspase-9 pathway. Ultrastructure analysis revealed a marked decrease in mitochondrial fragmentation in TECs of RCAN1-deficient mice in experimental CKD models. The expression of mitochondrial profission proteins dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) was also downregulated in obstructed kidney of TEC-specific RCAN1-deficient mice. Furthermore, TEC-specific deletion of RCAN1 attenuated the dysfunctional tubular autophagy by regulating PINK1/Parkin-induced mitophagy in CKD. RCAN1 knockdown and knockout similarly improved the mitochondrial quality control in HK-2 cells and primary cultured mouse tubular cells stimulated by TGF-β1. Put together, our data indicated that RCAN1 plays an important role in the progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis through regulating the mitochondrial quality. Therefore, targeting RCAN1 may provide a potential therapeutic approach in CKD."
https://openalex.org/W3084296497,"Nurse turnover is a significant issue and complex challenge for all healthcare sectors and is exacerbated by a global nursing shortage. Nurse-Family Partnership is a community health program for first-time pregnant and parenting girls and young women living in situations of social and economic disadvantage. In Canada, this program is delivered exclusively by public health nurses and only within a research context. The aim of this article is to explore and describe factors that contribute to recruitment, retention, and turnover of public health nurses delivering Nurse-Family Partnership in British Columbia, Canada between 2013 and 2018.Interpretive description was used to guide sampling, data collection and analytic decisions in this qualitative component drawn from the British Columbia Healthy Connections Project mixed methods process evaluation. Semi-structured, individual interviews were conducted with 28 public health nurses who practiced in and then exited Nurse-Family Partnership.Nurses were motivated to join this program because they wanted to deliver an evidence-based program for vulnerable young mothers that fit with their personal and professional philosophies and offered nurse autonomy. Access to program resources attracted nursing staff, while delivering a program that prioritizes maintaining relationships and emphasizes client successes was a positive work experience. Opportunities for ongoing professional development/ education, strong team connections, and working at full-scope of nursing practice were significant reasons for nurses to remain in Nurse-Family Partnership. Personal circumstances (retirement, family/health needs, relocation, career advancement) were the most frequently cited reasons leading to turnover. Other factors included: involuntary reasons, organizational and program factors, and geographical factors.Public health organizations that deliver Nurse-Family Partnership may find aspects of job embeddedness theory useful for developing strategies for supporting recruitment and retention and reducing nurse turnover. Hiring nurses who are the right fit for this type of program may be a useful approach to increasing nurse retention. Fostering a culture of connectivity through team development along with supportive and communicative supervision are important factors associated with retention and may decrease turnover. Many involuntary/external factors were specific to being in a study environment. Program, organizational, and geographical factors affecting nurse turnover are modifiable."
https://openalex.org/W3084353979,"Functional genomic screening of KRAS-driven mouse sarcomas was previously employed to identify proliferation-relevant genes. Genes identified included Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (Ube2c), Centromere Protein E (Cenpe), Hyaluronan Synthase 2 (Has2), and CAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein 3 Like 2 (Creb3l2). This study examines the expression and chemical inhibition of these candidate genes, identifying variable levels of protein expression and significant contributions to rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell proliferation. Chemical treatment of human and murine RMS cell lines with bortezomib, UA62784, latrunculin A and sorafenib inhibited growth with approximate EC50 concentrations of 15-30nM for bortezomib, 25-80nM for UA62784 and 80-220nM for latrunculin A. The multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib increased in vitro proliferation of 4 of 6 sarcoma cell lines tested. Latrunculin A was further associated with disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Together, this work advances opportunities for developing therapies to block progression of soft-tissue sarcomas and demonstrates that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in sarcoma cells by latrunculin A is associated with a reduction in RMS cell growth.

https://openalex.org/W3083559740,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is critical for the development and maintenance of the peripheral sympathetic neurons. NGF is also involved in the ovarian sympathetic innervation and in the development and maintenance of folliculogenesis. Women with the endocrine disorder, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), have an increased sympathetic nerve activity and increased ovarian NGF levels. The role of ovarian NGF excess in the PCOS pathophysiology and in the PCOS-related features is unclear. Here, using transgenic mice overexpressesing NGF in the ovarian theca cells (17NF mice), we assessed the female embryonic development, and the reproductive and metabolic profile in adult females. Ovarian NGF excess caused growth restriction in the female fetuses, and a delayed gonocyte and primary oocyte maturation. In adulthood, the 17NF mice displayed irregular estrous cycles and altered ovarian expression of steroidogenic and epigenetic markers. They also exhibited an increased sympathetic output with increased circulating dopamine, and metabolic dysfunction reflected by aberrant adipose tissue morphology and function, impaired glucose metabolism, decreased energy expenditure, and hepatic steatosis. These findings indicate that ovarian NGF excess leads to adverse fetal development and to reproductive and metabolic complications in adulthood, mirroring common features of PCOS. This work provides evidence that NGF excess may be implicated in the PCOS pathophysiology."

Recent work has identified a F392V mutation causing hereditary folate malabsorption. However, the residue properties responsible for this loss of function remains unknown. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we observed complete loss of function with charged (Lys, Asp, and Glu) and polar (Thr, Ser, and Gln) Phe-392 substitutions and minimal function with some neutral substitutions; however, F392M retained full function. Using the substituted-cysteine accessibility method (with N-biotinyl aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate labeling), Phe-392 mutations causing loss of function, although preserving membrane expression and trafficking, also resulted in loss of accessibility of the substituted cysteine in P314C-PCFT located within the aqueous translocation pathway. F392V function and accessibility of the P314C cysteine were restored by insertion of a G305L (suppressor) mutation. A S196L mutation localized in proximity to Gly-305 by homology modeling was inactive. However, when inserted into the inactive F392V scaffold, function was restored (mutually compensatory mutations), as was accessibility of the P314C cysteine residue. Reduced function, documented with F392H PCFT, was due to a 15-fold decrease in methotrexate influx Vmax, accompanied by a decreased influx Kt (4.5-fold) and Ki (3-fold). The data indicate that Phe-392 is required for rapid oscillation of the carrier among its conformational states and suggest that this is achieved by dampening affinity of the protein for its folate substrates.

Zhao R. Lin K. Shin D.S. Fiser A. Goldman I.D. Substitutions that lock and unlock the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT-SLC46A1) in an inward-open conformation.J. Biol.

Using the substituted-cysteine accessibility method, the loss of function associated with substitutions at Asp-109 locked the protein in an inward-open conformation, as manifested by the loss of accessibility of residues that are accessible in WT PCFT to a water-soluble sulfhydryl reagent. The current study, focused on the role of Phe-392 in PCFT function, complements a report of a F392V mutation in cohort of Japanese subjects with HFM (21Tozawa Y. Abdrabou S.S.M.A. Nogawa-Chida N.

Although a loss of function was observed in this report, the basis for the functional loss was not pursued, nor was the role this residue plays in PCFT function clarified. The current study demonstrates that Phe-392 is critical to sustaining oscillation of the PCFT protein among its conformational states and suggests that this is achieved by dampening the affinity of the protein for its folate substrates. Like residues in Motif A in the first intracellular loop (15Aluri S. Zhao R. Lin K. Shin D.S. Fiser A. Goldman I.D. Substitutions that lock and unlock the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT-SLC46A1) in an inward-open conformation.J. Biol.

A recent report described a F392V PCFT mutation in a subject with HFM (21Tozawa Y. Abdrabou S.S.M.A. Nogawa-Chida N. Nishiuchi R. Ishida T. Suzuki Y. Sano H. Kobayashi R. Kishimoto K. Ohara O.

Phe-392, one of twelve fully conserved (human, monkey, horse, mouse, rat, dog, bovine, opossum, Xenopus, and zebrafish) phenylalanine residues, is located in the 11th transmembrane segment near the cytoplasmic interface (Fig. 1, green fill). Fig. 2A illustrates the lack of [3H] MTX MTX transport activity when F392V PCFT was transiently transfected into HeLa cells that lack endogenous PCFT or reduced folate carrier activity, at concentrations an order of magnitude below and above the influx Kt, the latter reflecting the influx Vmax. A Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2B) indicates that expression of the mutant PCFT in the crude membrane fraction and at the cell surface is comparable with that of PCFT-WT. Hence, the stability of the protein and its trafficking to the plasma membrane is intact; loss of function is attributed entirely to an intrinsic defect in the protein. To further explore the structural requirements at this residue, particularly in view of the loss of function with a relatively conservative mutation, a variety of other substitutions were assessed as indicated in the next section.Figure 2Function and expression of the F392V PCFT mutant. A, [3H] MTX influx was assessed in transient transfectants at pH 5.5 and 37 °C over 1 min at concentrations of 0.5 µm and 50 µm. Activity was normalized to PCFT-WT. Data are the mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments.

As indicated in Fig. 3A, all mutants were expressed at the cell surface at levels comparable with PCFT-WT. There was a complete loss of function (Fig. 3B) for all charged substitutions studied (Glu, Asp, and Lys) and Thr at the low and high concentrations; the His substitution retained 30% of PCFT-WT activity at the low concentration. Activity was also preserved primarily at the low concentration for Ala and residues with aromatic side chains (Ala, Trp, and Tyr). The specificity of the Phe-392 residue was further assessed with additional neutral substitutions. Again, none of the substitutions altered expression of mutants in the crude and membrane fractions (Fig. 3C). However, whereas there was marked loss of function with Leu, Ile, and Gln substitutions, there was complete retention of activity with the Met substitution (Fig. 3D). To further explore the basis for the loss of function with substitutions at Phe-392, influx kinetics were determined for F392H PCFT. This mutant was chosen because although function was markedly impaired, it was sufficient for accurate influx measurements over a broad concentration range. As illustrated in Fig. 3E and indicated in Table 1, the [3H] MTX influx Vmax for F392H PCFT was decreased 15-fold as compared with PCFT-WT, consistent with markedly impaired oscillation of the carrier, whereas the influx Kt was decreased 4.5-fold. The decrease in influx Kt for F392H can be attributed at least in part to an increase in the affinity of the transporter for this substrate as indicated by the much lower influx Ki relative to PCFT-WT for MTX (Table 1). The loss of function was much greater at the high versus low MTX concentrations for all the substitutions at Phe-392 where some function was retained. This is consistent with a decrease in influx Kt because a decrease in Vmax alone should result in a proportionate decrease in influx irrespective of substrate concentration. Hence, changes in influx kinetics observed with F392H likely reflect the pattern of change in influx for all mutant PCFTs that retain partial activity.Table 1MTX influx kinetics for PCFT-WT and the F392H mutantInflux measurementsF392HPCFT-WTF392H/ PCFT-WTMTX Kt (µm)0.65 ± 0.112.93 ± 0.594.5 ↓Vmax (pmol/mg protein/min)33 ± 5497 ± 10315 ↓MTX Ki (µm)0.55 ± 0.121.60 ± 0.272.9 ↓Influx kinetic parameters (Vmax and Kt) were derived from the nonlinear regression best fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation.

Human PCFT has seven endogenous cysteine residues; of these, two (Cys-66 and Cys-298) are extracellular and form a spontaneous disulfide bond (Fig. 1, orange fill) (22Zhao R. Unal E.S. Shin D.S. Goldman I.D. Membrane topological analysis of the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT-SLC46A1) by the substituted cysteine accessibility method.Biochemistry. 2010; 49 (20225891): 2925-293110.1021/bi9021439Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The remaining five cysteine residues are located either within the transmembrane segments or in the cytosol. Consistent with their location, the native cysteines lack accessibility to MTSEA-biotin (N-biotinyl aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate), a water-soluble sulfhydryl-reactive reagent that does not penetrate the cell membrane (22Zhao R. Unal E.S. Shin D.S. Goldman I.D. Membrane topological analysis of the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT-SLC46A1) by the substituted cysteine accessibility method.Biochemistry. 2010; 49 (20225891): 2925-293110.1021/bi9021439Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Shin D.S.

The cysteine residue in the F392C mutant was not accessible to MTSEA-biotin from the extracellular compartment, consistent with its location near the membrane-cytosol interface (not shown). However, this cysteine residue was labeled with MTSEA-biotin after permeabilization of the cell membrane. Hence, when F392C was introduced into a Cys-less PCFT scaffold (PCFT-CL), as indicated in Fig. 3F, the F392C-CL mutant was labeled only after the cells were permeabilized with digitonin, as was the case for the positive control, T240C-CL, located in the intracellular loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane segments (22Zhao R. Unal E.S. Shin D.S. Goldman I.D. Membrane topological analysis of the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT-SLC46A1) by the substituted cysteine accessibility method.Biochemistry. 2010; 49 (20225891): 2925-293110.1021/bi9021439Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hence, the cysteine residue in the F392C-CL mutant is accessible only to the cytosol and appears to be located in the translocation pathway. The observation that F392V PCFT lost all function but the level of expression at the cell membrane was not altered as compared with PCFT-WT raised the possibility that this mutation may have locked the transporter in one of its conformational states, as observed for mutations in residues (Asp-109 and Gly-112) in the first intracellular loop (15Aluri S. Zhao R. Lin K. Shin D.S. Fiser A. Goldman I.D. Substitutions that lock and unlock the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT-SLC46A1) in an inward-open conformation.J. Biol.

To evaluate this further, a second cysteine mutation, P314C, was introduced into the F392V mutant scaffold and function and accessibility assessed. Previous studies showed that (i) P314C is accessible to the membrane-impermeant MTSEA-biotin at room temperature, consistent with its accessibility to the extracellular milieu (18Aluri S. Zhao R.

It can be seen in Fig. 4A that the P314C substitution alone markedly increased MTX influx at the saturating concentration, consistent with a marked increase in the Vmax. The much smaller change at the low MTX concentration is consistent with an increase in influx Kt as described above. However, when F392V was introduced into the P314C PCFT scaffold, influx was completely abolished. Fig. 4B indicates that introduction of P314C into the F392V scaffold does not alter PCFT expression in the crude membrane fraction or at the cell membrane. However, whereas the single Cys-substituted P314C was biotinylated by MTSEA-biotin, this was not the case when the Cys-substituted PCFT (P314C) was inserted into the F392V scaffold. Hence, the F392V mutation results in the loss of accessibility to MTSEA-biotin of the substituted cysteine located at P314C. To determine whether these changes are specific to the Val substitution, experiments were conducted with F392K and F392D as the inactivating residues (Fig. 3B). As indicated in Fig. 4C, when F392D or F392K were inserted into the P314C scaffold, function was lost. As indicated in Fig. 4D, expression of the double mutants at the cell surface and in the crude membrane extracts was comparable or slightly less than expression of the single mutants. However, whereas the single Cys-substituted P314C was biotinylated by MTSEA-biotin, accessibility of the Cys residue in the double mutants was lost. Taken together, these results imply that these loss-of-function mutations at Phe-392 also lock the protein in the inward-open conformation. In a prior study, introduction of G305L resto"

Here, we report this perspective in this group.The data were derived from a large cross-sectional study conducted among low-tier FSWs using a structured questionnaire in 21 counties in Zhejiang province, China. The prevalence of oral sex and its associated factors among 2645 low-tier FSWs were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate analysis.Of all participants, 579 (21.9%) had performed oral sex with clients over the previous month. Multivariate analysis revealed that oral sex is related to being unmarried, low income, early initiation of commercial sex, having conducted commercial sex in more counties, longer duration of commercial sex, larger number of clients, ever having engaged in anal sex, less use of condoms and oral contraceptives during the previous month, low rate of adoption for contraception at the present time, and STI-related symptoms during the previous half year.Oral sex practitioners among low-tier FSWs in China are at a higher risk of STI, HIV, and unwanted pregnancy compared to those who did not engage in oral sex. Behavioral interventions carried out among low-tier FSWs should specifically target low-tier FSWs who practice oral sex, should carefully take into account the characteristics of these FSWs, provide risk awareness education and training for condom use negotiation, and promote the availability of condom and reproductive health care, timely diagnosis, and treatment of STIs."
https://openalex.org/W3084362822,"A growing body of literature has documented that community-based early childhood development (ECD) interventions can improve child developmental outcomes in vulnerable communities. One critical element of effective community-based programs is consistent program participation. However, little is known about participation in community-based ECD interventions or factors that may affect participation. This paper examines factors linked to program participation within a community-based ECD program serving 819 infants and their caregivers in 50 rural villages in northwestern China. The results find that more than half of families did not regularly attend the ECD program. Both village-level social ties within the program and proximity to the program significantly predict program participation. Increased distance from the program site is linked with decreased individual program participation, while the number of social ties is positively correlated with participation. The average program participation rates among a family’s social ties is also positively correlated with individual participation, indicating strong peer effects. Taken together, our findings suggest that attention should be given to promoting social interactions and reducing geographic barriers among households in order to raise participation in community-based ECD programs."
https://openalex.org/W3083528097,"The transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel is widely distributed in the retina. Activation of the TRPV4 channel enhances excitatory signaling from bipolar cells to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), thereby increasing RGC firing rate and membrane excitability. In this study, we investigated the effect of TRPV4 channel activation on the miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) in rat RGCs. Our results showed that perfusion with HC-067047, a TRPV4-channel antagonist, significantly reduced the amplitude of RGC mIPSCs. Extracellular application of the TRPV4 channel agonist GSK1016790A (GSK101) enhanced the frequency and amplitude of mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs; pre-application of HC-067047 blocked the effect of GSK101 on mIPSCs. Furthermore, TRPV4 channels were able to enhance the frequency and amplitude of glycine receptor (GlyR)-mediated mIPSCs and inhibit the frequency of type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAA R)-mediated mIPSCs. Upon intracellular administration or intravitreal injection of GSK101, TRPV4 channel activation reduced the release of presynaptic glycine and enhanced the function and expression of postsynaptic GlyRs; however, it inhibited presynaptic release of GABA, but did not affect postsynaptic GABAA Rs. Our study results provide insight regarding the effect of TRPV4 channel activation on RGCs and offer a potential interventional target for retinal diseases involving TRPV4 channels."
https://openalex.org/W3083849099,"The relationships between host-pathogen population dynamics in wildlife are poorly understood. An impediment to progress in understanding these relationships is imperfect detection of diagnostic tests used to detect pathogens. If ignored, imperfect detection precludes accurate assessment of pathogen presence and prevalence, foundational parameters for deciphering host-pathogen dynamics and disease etiology. Respiratory disease in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) is a significant impediment to their conservation and restoration, and effective management requires a better understanding of the structure of the pathogen communities. Our primary objective was to develop an easy-to-use and accessible web-based Shiny application that estimates the probability (with associated uncertainty) that a respiratory pathogen is present in a herd and its prevalence given imperfect detection. Our application combines the best-available information on the probabilities of detection for various respiratory pathogen diagnostic protocols with a hierarchical Bayesian model of pathogen prevalence. We demonstrated this application using four examples of diagnostic tests from three herds of bighorn sheep in Montana. For instance, one population with no detections of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae (PCR assay) still had an 6% probability of the pathogen being present in the herd. Similarly, the apparent prevalence (0.32) of M. ovipneumoniae in another herd was a substantial underestimate of estimated true prevalence (0.46: 95% CI = [0.25, 0.71]). The negative bias of naïve prevalence increased as the probability of detection of testing protocols worsened such that the apparent prevalence of Mannheimia haemolytica (culture assay) in a herd (0.24) was less than one third that of estimated true prevalence (0.78: 95% CI = [0.43, 0.99]). We found a small difference in the estimates of the probability that Mannheimia spp. (culture assay) was present in one herd between the binomial sampling approach (0.24) and the hypergeometric approach (0.22). Ignoring the implications of imperfect detection and sampling variation for assessing pathogen communities in bighorn sheep can result in spurious inference on pathogen presence and prevalence, and potentially poorly informed management decisions. Our Shiny application makes the rigorous assessment of pathogen presence, prevalence and uncertainty straightforward, and we suggest it should be incorporated into a new paradigm of disease monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3083853887,"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive functional brain imaging technique. NIRS is suitable for monitoring brain activation during social interactions. One of the omnipresent social interactions for employees is saying thank you and being thanked. It has been demonstrated that expressing and receiving gratitude leads to employees’ well-being and performance. To date, there have been no neuroimaging studies that monitor brain activity when receiving gratitude. Thus, we designed an experiment using NIRS to monitor brain function while listening to a letter of gratitude read by a coworker. We hypothesized that listening to a letter of gratitude read aloud by a co-worker in a face-to-face setting would have different effects on PFC activity than listening to a conversation about a neutral topic. We recruited 10 pairs of healthy right-handed employees. They were asked to write a letter of gratitude to their partner 1 week before the experiment. In the experiment, each pair sat face-to-face and read their letters aloud to each other. We evaluated changes in mood state before and after the experiment. NIRS was measured in each participant while they listened to their peers in the experimental condition (gratitude letter) and control condition (talking about the weather and date). The results suggested that negative mood state decreased after the experiment. Moreover, there were interaction effects between conditions and periods. Although further studies are needed to confirm the interpretation, our findings suggested that experience of being thanked was accompanied by prefrontal cortex activation."

This study investigates 105 pollen allergic subjects for the presence of specific IgE to honeybee or wasp venom, pollen, the MUXF3 carbohydrate epitope from bromelain and recombinant Hymenoptera venom components. In addition, in a subgroup of patients (n = 10) a basophil activation test (BAT) using bee and wasp venom was performed. Specific IgE to Hymenoptera venom was detected in 45.7% of the pollen allergic subjects and in 26.7% of the non-atopic controls, both without a history of systemic allergic reactions to Hymenoptera stings. The high sensitization rate in atopic patients could partially be explained by cross-sensitization between pollen and Hymenoptera venom due to specific IgE to CCDs. In our study population, only 20% showed a sensitization to CCDs. Primary sensitization due to sting exposure, high total IgE values or unspecific binding and detection of low affinity antibodies in the test procedure could be reasons. Thus, determination of specific IgE to Hymenoptera venom in patients without a history of systemic allergic reactions as screening test is not recommended."

We aimed to examine the opportunity of using routine facility data to describe the CS use in conflict settings.We conducted a facility-based cross-sectional study in 8 health zones (HZ) of South Kivu province in eastern DR Congo. We reviewed patient hospital records, maternity registers and operative protocol books, from January to December 2018. Data on direct conflict fatalities were obtained from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. Based on conflict intensity and chronicity (expressed as a 6-year cumulative conflict death rate), HZ were classified as unstable (higher conflict death rate), intermediate and stable (lower conflict death rate). To describe the Caesarean section practice, we used the Robson classification system. Based on parity, history of previous CS, onset of labour, foetal lie and presentation, number of neonates and gestational age, the Robson classification categorises deliveries into 10 mutually exclusive groups. We performed a descriptive analysis of the relative contribution of each Robson group to the overall CS rate in the conflict stratum.Among the 29,600 deliveries reported by health facilities, 5,520 (18.6%) were by CS; 5,325 (96.5%) records were reviewed, of which 2,883 (54.1%) could be classified. The overall estimated population CS rate was 6.9%. The proportion of health facility deliveries that occurred in secondary hospitals was much smaller in unstable health zones (22.4%) than in intermediate (40.25) or stable health zones (43.0%). Robson groups 5 (previous CS, single cephalic, ≥ 37 weeks), 1 (nulliparous, single cephalic, ≥ 37 weeks, spontaneous labour) and 3 (multiparous, no previous CS, single cephalic, ≥ 37 weeks, spontaneous labour) were the leading contributors to the overall CS rate; and represented 75% of all CS deliveries. In unstable zones, previous CS (27.1%) and abnormal position of the fetus (breech, transverse lie, 3.3%) were much less frequent than in unstable and intermediate (44.3% and 6.0% respectively) and stable (46.7%and 6.2% respectively). Premature delivery and multiple pregnancy were more prominent Robson groups in unstable zones.In South Kivu province, conflict exposure is linked with an uneven estimated CS rate at HZ level with at high-risks women in conflict affected settings likely to have lower access to CS compared to low-risk mothers in stable health zones."

Through social media and our reviewer networks, we met some early-career stem cell investigators impacted by the closures. Here, they introduce themselves and their research to our readers. Chromosomes are paradoxical molecules. On the one hand, they provide stability, enabling faithful propagation of the DNA sequence. On the other hand, they provide flexibility in how this DNA sequence is used, enabling the emergence and memorization of alternative states during cell differentiation. Our group researches how the constellation of non-coding regulatory elements scattered across chromosomes, such as enhancers, patterns the transcription of protein-coding genes. We are especially interested in deciphering the molecular mechanisms driving 3D chromatin folding and understand the roles they play as pluripotent stem cells differentiate. (More details are on https://noralab.ucsf.edu.) While the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on our work is obviously a source of great frustration, I find inspiration in my colleagues who use it as an opportunity to reevaluate some of our default research habits. We have to come up with creative ways to better share reagents and resources within and between groups, for example by incorporating video demonstrations in our protocols and training procedures. I noticed changes in peer review, with some journal editors engaging more actively in evaluating the feasibility and legitimacy of requested revisions. Online seminars, conferences, and communities are emerging as creative new ways to connect. Sharing lab space with two other new chromatin groups, led by Abigail Buchwalter and Daniele Canzio, is immensely helpful to myself and my trainees during these times. Adult stem and progenitor cells (SCs) maintain our tissues in health and disease. My group studies the impact of inflammation on skin and intestinal epithelial SCs and the enduring memory that forms thereafter. Just as SCs learn from adversity, so too have my experiences with the ongoing pandemic been educational. 1 year and 9 months after starting my lab, I found myself in an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. The city that never sleeps shut down. Our studies had only started taking off and exciting results were beginning to emerge when research operations came to a screeching halt. Animal colonies were contracted, cell lines were frozen, equipment was unplugged, and, most disheartening of all, students and postdocs were stranded. At first, I responded by trying to be as efficient as possible. I encouraged trainees to write fellowships, learn to code, and compile manuscripts. Exhausted by quarantine and a self-imposed sense of urgency, I quickly realized that productivity was a misplaced priority. Our data-heavy lab meetings morphed into ad hoc discussions of personal struggles, interesting papers, and cool experimental avenues to explore in the future. I learned that people are what make the science fun and worth doing. While the last 5 months have been barren of data, I am energized by the lab’s stimulating discussions. Despite the physical separation, seven remarkable individuals have come together as a team and I see my lab becoming greater than the sum of its parts. Molecular and cytotoxic therapies in leukemia can often induce remission without achieving complete disease eradication, potentially resulting in relapse. A better understanding of cell-to-cell heterogeneity is crucial for the rational design of therapeutic strategies accounting for myeloid leukemia complexity. One aspect of this heterogeneity is its hierarchical structure, with leukemic stem cells (LSCs) being the only cells capable of sustaining and propagating the tumor. My group’s research revolves around understanding the biological mechanisms that make LSCs unresponsive to conventional therapies and identifying novel therapeutic targets allowing for their selective immunotherapeutic targeting. By combining single-cell genomics and proteomics with stem cell functional assays, we aim to develop novel strategies to prevent and treat leukemia progression. The COVID-19 pandemic had a tremendous impact on many aspects of our lives, including our research dynamics. Beyond inevitable experimental delays due to labs closure, my biggest concern as a new PI was the weakening of group cohesion and collaborative networks, vital to a young lab. I am proud that everyone in the lab impressively and quickly adjusted to these unprecedented times by shifting their focus to data analysis and creatively finding alternative ways to progress with their projects. A bumpy start in our group’s journey may have turned us into more experienced drivers, well equipped to achieve our next goals. In 2019, I started my lab to study the interplay between stem cells, metabolism, and cancer. As a junior PI, I am lucky to have a highly motivated international team sharing my enthusiasm for this topic. We study the intestine, a fascinating organ of fast cell renewal supported by dividing stem cells and their well-defined differentiated progeny. Former and ongoing research in my lab showed that metabolic changes in stems cells can trigger and determine epithelial differentiation trajectories. This exciting concept points to factors such as diet, gut microbiota, and even derailed cancer metabolism as potential remodelers of tissue composition. Hence, we investigate both homeostatic and tumorigenic tissue, aiming to contribute to the improvement of conventional therapies. We use a broad range of tools, e.g. live imaging of organoids engineered with fluorescent-based reporters, to dissect the crosstalk between metabolism and stem cell behavior at the single-cell level and with high temporal resolution. COVID-19 took us by surprise; we went quickly from social distancing protocols to a complete lockdown and cessation of lab work. Despite the growing feeling of uncertainty, we continued our research from home. Our regular online meetings were key to keeping our science going and also served for social support. From this situation we have learned to embrace the unexpected by making the best out of it. Importantly, we learned that difficult times do not appease our passion for science. The functionality of each organ in our bodies is determined by the structure and correct organization of each tissue component. Tissue architecture is ensured by a perfect equilibrium between each individual cell, its neighbors, and the physical environment. In particular, this is tightly regulated in epithelia that are naturally subjected to different mechanical perturbations and constantly renewed through our lives thanks to stem cells and progenitors able to regenerate entire tissues. My research focuses on understanding how mechanical forces shape tissue architecture and change epithelial stem cell dynamics during homeostasis and organ growth. After 8 years of postdoctoral training first at the University of Padova in Italy and then at the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, I was thrilled to move to Denmark to establish my laboratory at DanStem, University of Copenhagen. But while I was starting to plan the new beginning, the world was shocked by the pandemic crisis and my relocation was postponed. I was very glad about the support I received during the shutdown from my previous and current institutions, and I was impressed by the courage with which all my colleagues have faced the situation, cooperating to efficiently solve countless organizational problems. Now, I am finally ready to start, with the renewed belief that establishing a collaborative and friendly environment is a fundamental step to shape a productive team capable of facing future challenges. Do leukemic cells have a particular niche, and if so, how do they interact with it? That was the question I chased during my wonderful time in Cristina Lo Celso’s lab in London. It still is the question I am asking today. In 2018, I relocated back to Portugal to resume my clinical training, initiate a faculty position at the University of Porto, and start my research program at i3S. After securing funding, our team established key experimental tools to explore niche-leukemia interactions and to add a new element, iron. I was fortunate to have the unique mentorship of the iron expert Graça Porto and fantastic core facilities that helped us kickstart our work. To be literally between the bench and the bedside was and is a challenge. But the brilliant group of researchers that embarked on this journey with me and a newly arrived baby made my work as a PI a bit like a functional hematopoietic stem cell after 5-FU treatment: productive but in place—only possible with the proper microenvironment. COVID-19 was an unexpected insult. It made us stop our beloved wet lab work, downsize mouse colonies, and interrupt rederivations. We lost funding time. But it also gave us the opportunity to analyze and re-interpret data. And more importantly, it gave us a place to “walk the idea.” We looked at our questions from new angles and it gave us new perspectives. The return has been slow but newly guided. We hope the latest experiments will help us turn the ideas into concepts."
