Resistance developed gradually in a medium containing hypoxanthine (AH cells; 67-fold resistant), and in a medium containing thymidine (AT cells; 174-fold resistant). The rate of decrease of resistance in the absence of the drug was independent of the type of medium used; after one month of cultivation, the cells were about half as resistant. The requirement for folic or folinic acids for growth was not altered during the development of resistance. Folinic acid prevented competitively the inhibition of growth caused by amethopterin; 9 times more amethopterin than folinic acid was necessary for inhibition of the growth of sensitive Sarcoma 180 cells, whereas 600 times more was necessary for inhibition of AH cells and 1500 times more for inhibition of AT cells. The relationship between folinic acid and amethopterin is discussed and a suggestion is made concerning the possible site of action involved. The sensitivity to the growth-inhibitory effects of 6-mercaptopurine, 6-diazo-5-oxo-n-norleucine, and 5-fluoro- deoxyuridine remained unchanged despite the development of amethopterin resistance. The resistant AH cells were found to contain 65 times more folic acid reductase than the sensitive Sarcoma 180 cells, and the AT cells contained 155 times more. Only the quantity of this enzyme had increased (or the number of active sites per enzyme molecule) whereas the kinetic characteristics, Michaelis constant, K,, value for folic acid (1.1 to 1.25 X 1O-5"

https://openalex.org/W2055323889,The teratogenic effect of audiovisual and immobilization stress was studied in rats. Groups of 15 animals were subjected from the 9th to the 12th day of pregnancy to one or the other of these types of stress or to stress combined with administration of vitamin A. It was shown that the stresses alone had no effect on congenital malformations. Immobilization stress seemed to potentiate the teratogenic effect of vitamin A.

X-ray fluorescence analysis is not the most sensitive method for the assay of minor elements, but it is the instrumental technique of choice both for certain clinical studies and for certain research problems. The technique will be more widely used as it becomes more widely known (25)."

From conjunctival scrapings a virus resembling trachoma was grown in eggs. When instilled into monkey eyes, it produced an acute conjuctivitis resembling the human disease. Nine other patients with inclusion conjunctivitis of similar intensity failed to yield viruses."

However, its further metabolism has not been investigated until recently. The formation of quinaldic acid from kynurenic acid in mammals has been re- ported by Brown and Price (3). Its extensive degradation by a pseudomonad has been described (4), but the exact metabolic sequence has not been elucidated. In preliminary reports from our laboratory, we have described briefly an enzyme system in extracts of tryptophan-adapted cells of Pseudomonas that catalyzed the formation of L-glutamic acid from kynurenic acid (5, 6). A similar preliminary observation was independently reported by Behrman and Tanaka (7,8). The purpose of this paper is to describe in detail the preparation and properties of a kynurenic acid-degrading crude extract from cells of Pseudomonas jluorescens, an organism which uses the so-called “quinoline pathway” of tryptophan degradation (9), L-Glutamic acid,"

This virus differs in this respect from Chikungunya virus to which it is immunologically similar and from other Thai hemorrhagic fever viruses."

https://openalex.org/W2018976571,The average daily dietary intake of Sr/sup 90/ in Britain during 1958 was assessed at about 6 - - /g calcium. Measurements were made on the Sr/sup 90/ content per gram of calcium in samples of human pooled plasma prepared from whole blood collected between November 1958 and March 1959. The observed concentration oi Sr/sup 90/ in plasma was consistent with the calculations for daily dietary intake. (C.H.)

https://openalex.org/W1968822183,"THE bacterial pyrogens (lipopolysaccharides) are reported to have a marked influence on the resistance of experimental animals to bacterial challenge1. The reaction follows a particular pattern : during the first few hours after injection there is a drop in the resistance to infection, followed by an increase which can be quite considerable. Halpern et al. 2 have shown that the injection of lipopolysaccharides in mice is followed by increased phagocytic activity of the reticulo-endothelial system. On the other hand, when increased phagocytic activity is achieved by some other procedure, namely, immunization with BCG, the lethal effect of bacterial endotoxins is greatly enhanced3. The explanation for this may be found in the fact that a stimulated reticulo-endothelial system will have a greater ability to phagocytize the endotoxins without the concordant ability to neutralize their toxic effect on the organism. After finding that a particular leucocytosis-promoting liver fraction had the properties of stimulating the resistance against bacterial challenge in mice, as well as in human beings, we found it of great interest to investigate whether this fraction would have some influence on the phagocytic activity in mice."

https://openalex.org/W1993122878,"IN a previous paper1 we reported the finding of glutamotransferase (an enzyme catalysing the transfer of the γ-glutamyl residue of glutamine to hydroxylamine)2 in cell-free extracts of M. phlei. The enzyme required the presence of manganese ions, which could not be substituted by magnesium ions. No glutamine synthetase (an enzyme catalysing the synthesis of glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia) activity was found in the M. phlei preparations, when tested in the presence of magnesium ions under conditions optimal for this enzyme in preparations of bacterial2, plant3 and animal4 origin. The M. phlei extracts possessed only traces, if any, of glutaminase activity and did not hydrolyse glutamohydroxamic acid at all. On the other hand, these preparations showed very high asparaginase activity, lacking any asparto-transferase and asparagine synthetase activities. Aspartohydroxamic acid was very strongly hydrolysed by the M. phlei extracts; however, this activity. We have, therefore, concluded that in M. phlei the reactions of transfer, synthesis and hydrolysis are due to the action of different enzymes."
