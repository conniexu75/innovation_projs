https://openalex.org/W2050668705,Geostrophic contour-following bottom currents involved in the deep thermohaline circulation of the world ocean appear to be the principal agents which control the shape of the continental rise and other sediment bodies.
https://openalex.org/W2005157062,"The effects of inbreeding and local mate competition have often been confounded in theoretical and empirical studies of sex ratio. A general model considering the interplay of their influences on sex ratio evolution is presented, and its predictions are compared with data collected from three fig wasp species. The results indicate that female fig wasps adjust the sex ratio of their offspring in response to both the intensity of proximate local mate competition and the level of inbreeding in the population."

The accumulation process appears to be characterized by impact of bodies as large as three times the mass of Mars at velocities of about 9 kilometers per second. These giant impacts on Earth may have supplied the material and angular momentum that formed the moon, should have heated Earth to the melting point, and may have been responsible for the differences in the content of inert gases of the atmospheres of Earth and Venus."

https://openalex.org/W2057363418,When bivalves burrow into soft substrates the foot is first extended and then dilated to obtain a firm anchorage before retraction pulls the shell downward. Pedal dilation is principally caused by adduction of the valves. The hinged shell functions as a hydraulic machine in which the strength of the adductor muscles is transferred to the distal part of the foot by means of the body fluids.

https://openalex.org/W1979318589,"The mineral rhodizite could not be assigned a chemical formula on the basis of chemical analyses. The solution of the crystal structure reported here reveals that CsB12Be4Al4O28 is the ideal formula. The oxygen atoms occupy all but four sites per cell of cubic close packing whose period is ½a. The boron, beryllium, and aluminum atoms occupy interstices of this array, the first two in tetrahedral coordination, the last in octahedral coordination. Together these atoms form a continuous network whose composition is B12Be4Al4O28, which should be neutral. The alkali atom is enclosed in a cage in this network and presumably is not behaving as an ion."
https://openalex.org/W2006280712,"Experiments with a lycosid spider demonstrated that courtship behavior is displayed by males independently of whether sperm induction had occurred following the final molt. Contrary to earlier suggestions, proprioceptive feedback from sperm-filled palps is not essential for the onset of reproductive display."
https://openalex.org/W2032130593,"A successive pattern of nuclear divisions that result in mitotic waves has been observed within the coenocytic nonarticulated laticifers of embryos of Euphorbia marginata Pursh. These waves originate independently in the cotyledonary or hypocotyl portion of the laticifer and exhibit uni-or bidirectional movement at variable velocities. Individual nuclei or groups of neighoring nuclei in a laticifer were observed in a sequence of mitotic stages ranging from prophase to telophase; division activity varied with individual laticifers in an embryo. Two mitotic patterns were apparent in the embryo: a random pattern associated with various cells in the meristematic area, and a successive pattern restricted to the laticifer. A substance, synthesized by and restricted to the laticifer, may be associated with this mitotic pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2079473857,"Oxidation of carbon monoxide was studied in a static reactor at 123° ± 1°C, with NiO as catalyst. An alternating electric field of about 22,000 volts per centimeter, peak to peak, was applied normal to the catalytic surfaces. The rate of oxidation was thereby enhanced by a factor of 6 at 100 cycles per second, with maximum enhancement at between 100 and 200 cycles per second."
