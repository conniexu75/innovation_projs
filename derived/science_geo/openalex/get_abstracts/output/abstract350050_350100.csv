https://openalex.org/W2170659903,"Activated macrophages play an important role in many inflammatory diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling macrophage activation are not completely understood. Here we report that a novel CCCH-zinc finger protein family, MCPIP1, 2, 3, and 4, encoded by four genes, Zc3h12a, Zc3h12b, Zc3h12c, and Zc3h12d, respectively, regulates macrophage activation. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of MCPIP1 and MCPIP3 was highly induced in macrophages in response to treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although not affecting cell surface marker expression and phagocytotic function, overexpression of MCPIP1 significantly blunted LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine and NO2·¯ production as well as their gene expression. Conversely, short interfering RNA-mediated reduction in MCPIP1 augmented LPS-induced inflammatory gene expression. Further studies demonstrated that MCPIP1 did not directly affect the mRNA stability of tumor necrosis factor α and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) but strongly inhibited LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor α and inducible nitric-oxide synthase promoter activation. Moreover, we found that forced expression of MCPIP1 significantly inhibited LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB activation. These results identify MCP-induced proteins, a novel CCCH-zinc finger protein family, as negative regulators in macrophage activation and may implicate them in host immunity and inflammatory diseases.

Macrophages play an important role in many inflammatory disease states, including atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic pancreatitis. In these disease settings activated macrophages elaborate a large array of cytokines, growth factors, and proteolytic enzymes that are critical for tissue damage and repair (1Burke B. Lewis C.E. 2nd. The Macrophage. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002: 1-3Google Scholar). Numerous extracellular inducers of macrophage activation have been identified, among the most studied of which are lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 2The abbreviations used are:LPSlipopolysaccharideIFNγinterferon γTNFαtumor necrosis factor αIL-1βinterleukin 1βAREAU-rich elementFBSfetal bovine serumTTPtristetraproliniNOSinducible nitric-oxide synthaseNF-κBnuclear factor κBEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineac-LDLacetylated low-density lipoproteinPPREperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element.2The abbreviations used are:LPSlipopolysaccharideIFNγinterferon γTNFαtumor necrosis factor αIL-1βinterleukin 1βAREAU-rich elementFBSfetal bovine serumTTPtristetraproliniNOSinducible nitric-oxide synthaseNF-κBnuclear factor κBEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineac-LDLacetylated low-density lipoproteinPPREperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element. and interferon γ (IFNγ) (2Ma J.

LPS is a structurally heterogenous material contained within the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria and is recognized by animals as a molecule correlating to infection. It binds to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), triggering multiple signaling cascades including those mediated through the transcription factor NF-κB and the Janus N-terminal kinase and p38 kinase pathways (3Beutler B.

Much attention has focused on the pro-inflammatory signaling in activated macrophages but little is known about the mechanisms that negatively control inflammation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the inflammatory processes in macrophages is essential to the development of novel drug therapies against inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis. Previously, we identified a novel CCCH-zinc finger-containing protein that was significantly induced by MCP-1 in human peripheral blood monocytes and thus designated as MCP-induced protein (MCPIP) (4Zhou L. Azfer A. Niu J. Graham S. Choudhury M. Adamski F.M. Younce C. Binkley P.F. Kolattukudy P.E. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). By searching the similar sequences in GenBank™, we found that four members belong to this protein family, designated as MCPIP1, 2, 3, and 4 and encoded by four genes, Zc3h12a, Zc3h12b, Zc3h12c, and Zc3h12d, respectively. The obvious feature of this protein family is that they all contain a single CCCH-type zinc finger and their function remains unknown. Zinc finger proteins comprise a large superfamily. It is estimated that 1% of all mammalian genes encode zinc fingers. There are at least 14 different types of fingers, categorized by the nature and spacing of their zinc-chelating residues. Most zinc fingers are CCHH or CCCC type (referred to as classical zinc fingers). CCCH-type zinc finger-containing proteins are very unusual in mammalian genomes and represent ∼0.8% of all zinc finger-containing proteins (5Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 6Matthews J.M. Sunde M. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A well studied CCCH-zinc finger protein family is the tristetraprolin (TTP, also known as Zfp36) family, which also contains four members, TTP, Zfp36l1, Zfp36l2, and Zfp36l3. This protein family contains two tandem CCCH-zinc fingers and binds to AU-rich elements in mRNA, leading to the removal of the poly(A) tail from that mRNA and increased rates of mRNA turnover (7Carrick D.M. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Arthritis. Res. Ther. 2004; 6: 248-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 8Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell.

ZAP, which is also a CCCH-type zinc finger protein, can bind to viral RNA to cause profound and specific loss of viral mRNA (10Gao G. Guo X. Goff S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 1703-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Roquin, another CCCH-zinc finger protein, functions as a ubiquitin ligase and is required to repress autoimmunity (11Vinuesa C.G. Cook M.C. Angelucci C. Athanasopoulos V. Rui L. Hill K.M. Yu D. Domaschenz H. Whittle B. Lambe T. Roberts I.S. Copley R.R. Bell J.I. Cornall R.J. Goodnow C.C. Nature. 2005; 435: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the members of the MCPIP family were dramatically induced by LPS in macrophages. Overexpression of MCPIP1 significantly attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine and NO2·¯ production and their gene expression, perhaps by antagonizing NF-κB signaling. These results indicate that they may be novel regulators in macrophage activation. Mice—Male C57BL/6 wild-type mice (∼6-8 weeks old) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed in a temperature-controlled environment with 12-h light/dark cycles at the University of Central Florida Transgenic Animal Facility in accordance with the principles of animal care of the National Institutes of Health. These studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Central Florida. Cells—The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (endotoxin <1 ng/ml) (Sigma). The human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate and supplemented with 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% FBS. THP-1 cells were stimulated with 100 nm/liter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 5 days to differentiate into macrophages and then were quiescent for 16-24 h by being cultured in macrophage serum-free medium (Invitrogen). Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were generated from bone marrow stem cells obtained from femurs of male C57BL/6 mice (2-4 months old). After lysis of the red blood cells, 4 × 106 of bone marrow stem cells were inoculated in 6-well plates with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium culture medium containing 10% FBS, 30% L929 conditional medium, and standard supplements. After 7 days of culture, the fully differentiated and matured bone marrow-derived macrophages were quiescent for 24 h in macrophage serum-free medium and then treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for different time points. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% FBS. Plasmids—Human MCPIP1 expression plasmid (pMCPIP1) was generated as described previously (4Zhou L. Azfer A. Niu J. Graham S. Choudhury M. Adamski F.M. Younce C. Binkley P.F. Kolattukudy P.E. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). An open reading frame of human MCPIP1 was ligated to the N terminus of EGFP within the vector pEGFP-N1 by using EcoRI and BamHI. In the transient transfection experiment, pEGFP-N1 was used as a control. βWt (containing human β-globin gene) and βWt-TNFα (containing β-globin gene and the potent ARE from tumor necrosis factor α mRNA in the 3′-untranslated region) were kindly provided by Dr. Jens Lykke-Andersen (University of Colorado, Boulder) (12Lykke-Andersen J. Wagner E. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). TNFα-Luc plasmid was a gift from Dr. Dmitry Kuprash (Russian Academy of Science) (13Kuprash D.V. Udalova I.A. Turetskaya R.L. Kwiatkowski D. Rice N.R. Nedospasov S.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4045-4052PubMed Google Scholar). iNOS-Luc and PPRE-TK-Luc were from the laboratory of Dr. Mangelsdorf (UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX). NF-κB-TK-Luc was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Reagents—The MCPIP1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was prepared against the human recombinant MCPIP1 protein as described previously (4Zhou L. Azfer A. Niu J. Graham S. Choudhury M. Adamski F.M. Younce C. Binkley P.F. Kolattukudy P.E. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). B7-1 (sc-1632) and actin antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). LPS (Escherichia coli 026:B6-derived), human recombinant interferon-γ, and actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma. Doxycycline was from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Transfection—For functional study, transient transfection into Raw264.7 cells was performed by electroporation following the manufacturer's instruction (Amaxa). Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were grown to confluence in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were collected and washed once with RPMI 1640 medium and resuspended with the electroporation buffer (Amaxa). After electroporation, the cells were plated on 6-well plates and the transfection efficiency was monitored by fluorescent microscopy. Over 60% cells were GFP-positive. Transient transfection into HEK293 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instruction. For promoter analysis, Raw264.7 cells were seeded into 12-well plates and transfected with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instruction. The total amount of plasmid DNA was kept constant within each experiment. Luciferase activity was measured by the luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity by co-transfecting the pCMV-βgal plasmid in all experiments. All transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated at least two times. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot—Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) following the manufacturer's instruction. 15 μg of total RNA was denatured and electrophoresed on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels. The uniformity of sample loading was verified by UV visualization of the ethidium bromide-stained gel before transfer to Nylon membrane. The cDNA probes for MCPIP1, 2, 3, and 4 were amplified by PCR using individual cDNA clones from ATCC as templates. 32P-labeled cDNA was prepared using the random priming method (Invitrogen). Hybridization was performed using QuickHyb buffer (Stratagene) at 65 °C for 2 h or overnight. The membranes were then washed once with 2× SSC and once with 0.1× SSC, 1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C. Quantitative Real-time PCR—After removing the genomic DNA using DNase I (Ambion), 2.4 μg of total RNA from RAW264.7 or bone marrow-derived macrophage cells was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a commercially available kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with iCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) using 2× SYBR Green master mix (Bio-Rad). Forty cycles were conducted as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, preceded by 1 min at 95 °C for polymerase activation. Primer sequences for all genes we measured in this report are available upon request. Quantification was performed by the delta cycle time method, with β-actin used for normalization. Protein Isolation and Western Blot—After washing twice with PBS, cells were gently scraped with a rubber policeman into 5 ml of ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells from each 10-cm dish were then resuspended and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysate was left on ice for ∼20 min and then sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instruction. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. For Western blotting, proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in transfer buffer containing 0.1% SDS. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TTBS) for 2 h and incubated with the primary antiserum at a 1:1,000 dilution in the blocking buffer for 1 h. After being washed with TTBS three times for 10 min each, the membranes were incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution of secondary antibody in TTBS for 1 h. Following three 10-min washes with TTBS, membranes were incubated with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film. Immunocytochemistry—THP-1 cells were grown on glass coverslips under the conditions described above. After differentiation into macrophages, the cells were treated with or without LPS (1 μg/ml) for 16 h. The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS three times before being fixed at room temperature for 10 min in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were again washed with PBS twice and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in TBS at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight in anti-MCPIP1 serum (1:200 dilution) and 1% normal goat serum in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Following two washes with 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in TBS, the cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in goat anti-rabbit IgG rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200 dilution; Chemicon) and 25% normal goat serum in TBS. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS for 10 min each time before being mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The slides were examined and imaged with a Nikon fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Determination of TNFα, IL-6, and NO Production—NO release was spectrophotometrically determined by measuring the accumulation of nitrite in the medium 8 h after cell activation using Griess Reagent System (Promega). TNFα and IL-6 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (eBioscience). Ac-LDL Uptake—Raw264.7 cells were transfected with pMCPIP1 and pEGFP-N1. 24 h later the cells were treated with Dil-labeled ac-LDL (Biomedical Technologies, Inc.) for the time periods indicated, subsequently washed twice with PBS, and lysed in isopropanol. After sonication followed by 10 min of centrifugation (13,000 × g), Dil-labeled ac-LDL content was measured by fluorometry. For microscopy, cells were cultured on glass slides and treated with Dil-labeled ac-LDL. mRNA Stability Assay—Two approaches were used to measure the mRNA stability. First, Raw264.7 cells were transfected with pMCPIP1 and pEGFP-N1. After 8 h of stimulation with LPS (1 μg/ml), transcription was stopped by adding 5 μg/ml actinomycin D. The cells were harvested and RNA was isolated at different time points as indicated. mRNA level was measured by Northern blot. Second, HeLa Tet-off cells were transfected with βWt or βWt-TNFα reporters and pMCPIP1 or pEGFP-N1 in the presence of 50 ng/ml doxycycline using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 24 h later, a transcription pulse from the reporter mRNA expression plasmid was initiated by washing cells with PBS and feeding with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% FBS, containing no doxycycline. 6 h later, 3 μg/ml of doxycycline was added to stop transcription. The cells were harvested and RNA was isolated at different time points as indicated. β-Globin mRNA level was measured by Northern blot (12Lykke-Andersen J. Wagner E. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Short Interference RNA—The pre-designed short interference RNA targeting to mouse MCPIP1 (ID number 170484) as well as its negative control were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). The short interference RNA was transfected into Raw264.7 cells by electroporation using Amaxa Electroporation Unit following the manufacturer's instruction. 24 h later, the cells were treated with or without LPS (1 μg/ml) for 8 h. The cells were then harvested and RNA was isolated to assess for MCPIP1 knock down and target gene expression. Statistics—Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. For comparison between two groups, the unpaired Student's test was used. For multiple comparisons, analysis of variance followed by unpaired Student's test was used. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Identification of the MCPIP Protein Family—MCP-1 not only attracts monocytes from the blood stream into the vascular wall but also actively regulates gene expression and contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. In an effort to search MCP-1-induced genes in human monocytes using gene microarray analysis, we previously identified a highly MCP-1-induced gene, which was designated MCPIP (as MCP-1 Induced Protein) (4Zhou L. Azfer A. Niu J. Graham S. Choudhury M. Adamski F.M. Younce C. Binkley P.F. Kolattukudy P.E. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This gene encodes a novel CCCH-zinc finger-containing protein. By searching similar sequences in GenBank™, we have found that four members belong to this protein family that are designated as MCPIP1, 2, 3, and 4 and encoded by four genes, Zc3h12a, Zc3h12b, Zc3h12c, and Zc3h12d, respectively. The obvious feature of this protein family is that they all contain a single CCCH-type zinc finger (Fig. 1A). In addition to the central CCCH-zinc finger, MCPIP1 contains two proline-rich domains at the N- and C-terminals, which may mediate interaction with Src homology 3 domain-containing proteins. MCPIP2 has a RasGEF domain at the C-terminal of the zinc finger motif, suggesting its potential involvement in signal transduction. No other specific motifs are observed in MCPIP3 and 4. It is worth noting that the zinc finger in MCPIP family is C(X)5C(X)5C(X)3H type and very conserved among this family, which is somewhat different from the two fingers in TTP that were C(X)8C(X)5C(X)3H type (Fig. 1B). The bioinformatics of human and mouse MCPIP family was summarized in Fig. 1C. Their mRNA length represents the longest mRNA in GenBank™, which may not be the actual full length. The protein weight is predicted and not yet confirmed experimentally. Proteins containing CCCH-zinc finger have been identified from metazoan organisms, yeast, and plant. It seems that the MCPIP family is much conserved during evolution as we identified cDNA sequences that encode proteins highly similar to MCPIPs from Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans to Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus. The homology between human and mouse MCPIPs varies from 81 to 92%. The amino acid identity between different mouse MCPIP family members is ∼40%, but the homology of their zinc finger motif is >80%. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that MCPIP2 and MCPIP3 are more closely related to each other than to other MCPIP family members (data not shown). Induction of the MCPIP Family during Macrophage Activation—Macrophage activation is an essential cellular process underlying innate immunity, enabling the body to combat bacteria and other pathogens. In addition to host defense, activated macrophages play a central role in atherogenesis, autoimmunity, and a variety of inflammatory diseases. To explore whether the MCPIP family is involved in the regulation of macrophage activation, we examined the expression of MCPIPs during LPS- or IFNγ-induced macrophage activation, which are the most studied two inducers for macrophage activation. As shown in Fig. 2A, Northern blot revealed that both MCPIP1 and MCPIP3 were highly induced in LPS-, but not IFNγ-, stimulated murine macrophage cell line Raw264.7. Their expression was raised after 1 h of LPS treatment, peaked at 2 h by >20-fold above basal line, and was sustained at a high level for at least 16 h. MCPIP4 was also induced to some extent by LPS over a 16-h time course, whereas MCPIP2 was not induced at all during the time periods of both LPS and IFNγ stimulation. LPS also stimulated expression of MCPIP1 in THP-1-derived macrophages over the time course of 1 to 24 h with a pattern similar to Raw264.7 (Fig. 2B). Both MCPIP1 and MCPIP3 were also induced by endogenous cytokines TNFα and IL-1β in THP-1 cells (Fig. 2C). We further explored the effect of LPS on the expression of MCPIPs in mouse primary bone marrow-derived macrophages. Consistent with the results from Raw264.7, both MCPIP1 and MCPIP3 transcripts increased a remarkable 25-fold over basal levels at 2 h after LPS stimulation and then declined a little bit but sustained a substantial level for 24 h. The basal levels of both MCPIP2 and MCPIP4 seemed very low and did not change after exposure to LPS in the 24-h time period (Fig. 2D). To validate our LPS stimulations, we also assessed the temporal expression of macrophage inflammatory mediators IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and TNFα. Consistent with the previous report, they were all potently induced by ten- to thousands-fold after LPS treatment (Fig. 2D). It is interesting to note that with the exception of IL-1β, which constantly increased during the 24 h of stimulation, the mRNA of IL-6, MCP-1, and TNFα reached a peak at 2 or 8 h of stimulation and then declined to basal level at 24 h, suggesting that a negative regulatory mechanism may terminate the proinflammatory signals. Next we examined macrophage MCPIP1 protein expression in response to LPS. Western blot analysis detected a band around 65.5 kDa, which is the expected protein size of MCPIP1. MCPIP1 protein was increased by 8-fold within 8 h of LPS stimulation in THP-1-derived macrophages (Fig. 2E). MCPIP1 protein expression was further studied using immunofluorescence microscopy. Treatment of THP-1 macrophages with LPS led to a marked increase in MCPIP1 protein expression. MCPIP1 protein seems predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2F). No specific staining was seen by control serum (Fig. 2G). MCPIP1 Negatively Regulates LPS-induced Macrophage Activation but Does Not Affect Lipid Uptake—MCPIP1 was significantly induced during LPS-induced macrophage activation, suggesting that it may be involved in the regulation of this important process. To test this idea, the murine macrophage cell line Raw263.7 cells were transiently transfected with pMCPIP1 or pEGFP-N1 by electroporation. Overexpression of MCPIP1 was confirmed by microscopy as well as quantitative PCR and Western blot (Fig. 3A). In cells overexpressing MCPIP1, we observed a marked reduction in the LPS-induced production of TNFα, IL-6, and NO2·¯ (Fig. 3B). However, it was noted that overexpression of MCPIP1 did not affect Dil-ac-LDL uptake (Fig. 3C). MCPIP1 Negatively Regulates LPS-induced Inflammatory Gene Expression but Does Not Affect the Cell Surface Marker Expression in Macrophages—Next, we further investigated the effect of MCPIP1 on LPS-stimulated gene expression. As shown in Fig. 4A, LPS dramatically induced inflammatory cytokine (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1) expression by several- to thousands-fold. Interestingly, MCPIP1 overexpression significantly blunted the induction of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1 by LPS. Conversely, knocking down of MCPIP1 using specific short interference RNA strongly augmented the induction of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1 by LPS (Fig. 4A). The efficient knocking down of MCPIP1 by siRNA was confirmed by Northern blotting (Fig. 4C). We further observed the expression changes of TNFα and MCP-1 during a time period of LPS stimulation in green fluorescent protein- or MCPIP1-transfected cells by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 4B, significant decrease in TNFα and MCP-1 mRNA was observed in MCPIP1 overexpressed cells after 4 h of stimulation. Consistent with the functional examination above, MCPIP1 negatively regulated iNOS expression but did not affect the expression of scavenger receptor A, CD36, ABCA1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in LPS-treated macrophages (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, although two members of costimulatory molecule B7 family, B7-1 and B7-2, were also substantially induced by LPS in macrophages, overexpression of MCPIP1 inhibited B7-1, but not B7-2, induction (Fig. 4, E and F). MCPIP1 Does Not Affect mRNA Degradation of Inflammatory Cytokines—The expression of inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1, is tightly regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. It is noted that the TTP family, a well studied CCCH-zinc finger protein family, can bind to the ARE at the 3′-untranslated region of TNFα mRNA and promote its decay (7Carrick D.M. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Arthritis. Res. Ther. 2004; 6: 248-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 8Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell.

To explore the mechanisms of the MCPIP1 effect on inflammatory cytokines, we first evaluated the potential influence of MCPIP1 on the mRNA stability of TNFα and MCP-1 in LPS-stimulated Raw264.7 cells. In the experiment shown in Fig. 5A, the cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml; Sigma) for 8 h and then treated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml; Sigma). The RNA was isolated at different time points as indicated. Surprisingly, although both TNFα and MCP-1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in MCPIP1-overexpressing cells, the half-lives of both TNFα and MCP-1 mRNA were barely affected by overexpression of MCPIP1 (48 and 110"
https://openalex.org/W1972266008,"Transcription factors belonging to the NF-κB family regulate inflammation by inducing pro-inflammatory molecules (e.g. interleukin (IL)-8) in response to cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, IL-1) or other stimuli. Several negative regulators of NF-κB, including the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, participate in the resolution of inflammatory responses. We report that Cezanne, a member of the A20 family of the deubiquitinating cysteine proteases, can be induced by TNFα in cultured cells. Silencing of endogenous Cezanne using small interfering RNA led to elevated NF-κB luciferase reporter gene activity and enhanced expression of IL-8 transcripts in TNFα-treated cells. Thus we conclude that endogenous Cezanne can attenuate NF-κB activation and the induction of pro-inflammatory transcripts in response to TNF receptor (TNFR) signaling. Overexpression studies revealed that Cezanne suppressed NF-κB nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity by targeting the TNFR signaling pathway at the level of the IκB kinase complex or upstream from it. These effects were not observed in a form of Cezanne that was mutated at the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys209), indicating that the deubiquitinating activity of Cezanne is essential for NF-κB regulation. Finally, we demonstrate that Cezanne can be recruited to activated TNFRs where it suppresses the build-up of polyubiquitinated RIP1 signal adapter proteins. Thus we conclude that Cezanne forms a novel negative feedback loop in pro-inflammatory signaling and that it suppresses NF-κB activation by targeting RIP1 signaling intermediaries for deubiquitination. Transcription factors belonging to the NF-κB family regulate inflammation by inducing pro-inflammatory molecules (e.g. interleukin (IL)-8) in response to cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, IL-1) or other stimuli.

The transcription factor NF-κB drives inflammatory responses by inducing pro-inflammatory molecules including adhesion proteins, cytokines, and chemokines (e.g. IL-8) 2The abbreviations used are:ILinterleukinTNFtumor necrosis factorTNFRTNF receptorsiRNAsmall interfering RNAIKKIκB kinaseE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellCTnumber of thermal cycles that were necessary to generate threshold amounts of product.

In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IκB molecules that bind its nuclear localization sequence. Signaling through TNF receptors (TNFR) leads to the recruitment of several signaling intermediaries including RIP1, TRAF2/5, and NEMO (IKKγ), which control the activation of TAK1, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that can activate IKKs through phosphorylation. Activation of IKKβ triggers phosphorylation of IκBα, which is subsequently destabilized, thus releasing free NF-κB for nuclear translocation and stimulation of transcription (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that pro-inflammatory signaling is regulated by ubiquitin, a small protein that can be covalently attached to lysine residues of cellular proteins through a chain reaction co-ordinated by E1, E2, and E3 proteins (3Evans P.C. Exp. Rev. Mol. Med. 2005; 7: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Sun L.J. Chen Z.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Multiple rounds of ubiquitination, where ubiquitin is itself ubiquitinated on lysine residues, generate isopeptide-linked branched chains that play a key role in signaling to NF-κB. Specifically, activation of NF-κB in response to TNFR or IL-1/Toll-like receptor signaling relies on modification of RIP1 or TRAF6 signaling intermediaries, respectively, with a distinct structural form of polyubiquitin that contains ubiquitin Lys63 linkages (5Wu C.J.

Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Pro-inflammatory signaling also leads to Lys63-polyubiquitination of NEMO, an adaptor protein that binds IKK and is essential for NF-κB activation (9Tang E.D. Wang C.Y. Xiong Y. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37297-37305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Lys63 chains signal to NF-κB by interacting with TAB2 signaling intermediaries, thus triggering the oligomerization and activation of TAK1 and IKKβ (10Kanayama A. Seth R.B.

Polyubiquitin chains linked through Lys48 also play a vital role during NF-κB activation by targeting phosphorylated IκB proteins for proteasomal degradation, thus liberating NF-κB for nuclear entry (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). TNFα induces several negative regulators of NF-κB including A20, a protein that interacts with TRAFs (11Song H.Y.

Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Recent work demonstrated that A20 is a deubiquitinating cysteine protease that can cleave ubiquitin monomers from modified proteins (8Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H.L. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 16Evans P.C. Ovaa H. Hamon M. Kilshaw P.J. Hamm S. Bauer S. Ploegh H.L. Smith T.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus it has been suggested that A20 suppresses signaling to NF-κB by targeting signaling intermediaries for ubiquitin editing. We have previously described a novel protein called Cezanne that belongs to the A20 family of deubiquitinating enzymes and can modulate TNFR signaling when overexpressed (17Evans P.C. Taylor E.R.

Here we demonstrate that Cezanne can be induced by TNFα in cultured epithelial or endothelial cells. Gene silencing revealed that endogenous Cezanne attenuates NF-κB activation and the induction of pro-inflammatory transcripts in TNFα-treated cells, thus completing a novel negative feedback loop. Finally, we provide evidence that Cezanne suppresses NF-κB upstream of IKK activation by targeting RIP1 signaling intermediaries for deubiquitination. Reagents and Antibodies—Human recombinant TNFα was obtained commercially (R & D, Minneapolis, MN). Biotinylated human TNFα was kindly provided by Prof. G. Cohen (University of Leicester). Anti-RelA (p65) (sc372; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-IκBα (sc-847; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphoIκBα Ser32/36 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-RIP (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, Oxford, UK), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-IKKα (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, Oxford, UK), anti-IKKγ (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, Oxford, UK), anti-RIP (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, Oxford, UK), anti-TNFR (Invitrogen), and anti-tubulin (Sigma) were obtained commercially. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a peptide that was conserved between human and mouse versions of Cezanne but not encoded by other mammalian genes (C+YSNGYREPPEPDGWA-CONH2) and were subsequently affinity purified (Eurogentech, Liege, Belgium). Anti-Cezanne antibodies were validated by Western blotting of cytosolic lysates made from cells transfected with epitope-tagged forms of Cezanne (supplemental Fig. S1). Other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Plasmids—Expression vectors encoding HA epitope-tagged Cezanne (pHM6-Cezanne), GFP-tagged Cezanne (pEGFP-Cezanne) and enzymatically inactive forms mutated at the catalytic cysteine (pHM6-Cezanne C209S and pEGFP-Cezanne C209S) have been described previously (17Evans P.C.

Expression plasmids containing HA-tagged ubiquitin or versions of ubiquitin containing single Lys residues (Lys48 or Lys63) were described previously (16Evans P.C. Ovaa H. Hamon M. Kilshaw P.J. Hamm S. Bauer S. Ploegh H.L. Smith T.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Endothelial Cells and Exposure to Flow—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were collected using collagenase and cultured as described previously (19Partridge J. Carlsen H. Enesa K. Chaudhury H. Zakkar M. Luong L. Kinderlerer A. Johns M. Blomhoff R. Mason J.C. Haskard D.O. Evans P.C. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3553-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Confluent HUVEC cultures were exposed to high shear (12 dynes/cm2) unidirectional laminar flow for 16 h using a parallel-plate flow chamber (Cytodyne, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (19Partridge J. Carlsen H. Enesa K. Chaudhury H. Zakkar M. Luong L. Kinderlerer A. Johns M. Blomhoff R. Mason J.C. Haskard D.O. Evans P.C. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3553-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cell Lines and Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin G/100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection of cells was achieved using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable expression of GFP or GFP-Cezanne in HEK293 cells was achieved by culturing cells transfected transiently using pEGFP or pEGFP-Cezanne, respectively, with neomycin. After 4 weeks, transfected cells expressing similar amounts of GFP or GFP-Cezanne were selected further by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and used in experiments. RNA Interference—RNA interference was carried out using a specific siRNA that is known to silence Cezanne in HEK293 cells without altering the expression of related molecules. 3H. Tran, F. Hamada, T. Schwarz-Romand, and M. Bienz, submitted for publication. Cezanne-specific double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides with 3′-dTdT (Cez 5′-GAATCTATCTGCCTTTGGA-3′; Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) or nontargeting scrambled controls (Silencer Negative control 1 siRNA; Ambion) were synthesized. Cell cultures that were 80-90% confluent were transfected with siRNA (final concentration, 10 nm) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions and then incubated in complete growth medium for 48 h before analysis. Comparative Real Time PCR—Transcript levels were quantified by comparative real time PCR using gene-specific primers for Cezanne (sense, 5′-ACAATGTCCGATTGGCCAGT-3′; antisense, 5′-ACAGTGGGATCCACTTCACATTC-3′), IL-8 (sense, 5′-TGCCAAGGAGTGCTAAAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTCCACAACCCTCTGCAC-3′), and β-actin (sense, 5′-CTGGAACGGTGAAGGTGACA-3′; antisense, 5′-AAGGGACTTCCTGTAACAATGCA-3′). Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed as described previously (19Partridge J. Carlsen H. Enesa K. Chaudhury H. Zakkar M. Luong L. Kinderlerer A. Johns M. Blomhoff R. Mason J.C. Haskard D.O. Evans P.C. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3553-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Real time PCR was carried out using the iCycler system and SYBR green master mix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 3 min before thermal cycling at 95 °C for 10 s and 56 °C for 45 s. The reactions were performed in triplicate. Relative gene expression was calculated by comparing the number of thermal cycles that were necessary to generate threshold amounts of product (CT) as described previously (19Partridge J. Carlsen H. Enesa K. Chaudhury H. Zakkar M. Luong L. Kinderlerer A. Johns M. Blomhoff R. Mason J.C. Haskard D.O. Evans P.C. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3553-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). CT was calculated for the genes of interest and for the housekeeping gene β-actin. For each cDNA sample, the CT for β-actin was subtracted from the CT for each gene of interest to give the parameter DCT, thus normalizing the initial amount of RNA used. The amount of each target was calculated as 2-DDCT, where DDCT is the difference between the DCT of the two cDNA samples to be compared. Immunostaining to Detect Cezanne—Immunostaining was performed by fixing cells using methanol for 10 min prior to the application of rabbit anti-Cezanne antibodies (1:50) and goat anti-rabbit Alexafluor488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500) followed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM 510 META; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Immunostaining to Detect NF-κB and IκB—Intracellular localization of RelA NF-κB subunits was assessed by immunostaining of paraformaldehyde-fixed cells using anti-RelA antibodies and Alexafluor 568-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM 510 META; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Image analysis was performed using Velocity software (Improvision, Coventry, UK) to calculate the ratio of RelA present in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm. Levels of IκBα were measured by immunostaining of paraformaldehyde-fixed cells using anti-IκBα antibodies and Alexafluor 568-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM 5105 META; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Assay of NF-κB Transcriptional Activity—NF-κB transcriptional activity was measured in HEK293 cells using an NF-κB reporter (pGL2) supplied by Dr. Martin Turner (The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK). The cells were co-transfected with pNF-luc and pRL-TK (encoding Renilla luciferase to normalize transfection efficiency) using Lipofectamine and incubated for 16 h. The cells were then treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 16 h before measurement of NF-κB activity. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was assessed using a dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and luminescence counter (Top-count Microplate Scintillation; Packard). IKK Kinase Assay—Cultured cells were lysed using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm EDTA. The debris was removed from lysates by high speed centrifugation. IKKβ kinase was purified from lysates by immunoprecipitation using anti-IKKγ antibodies (BD Pharmingen, Oxford, UK), and its activity was assessed using glutathione S-transferase-IκBα as substrate as described previously (20Alford K.A. Glennie S. Turrell B.R. Rawlinson L. Saklatvala J. Dean J.L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6232-6241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Precipitation of TNFR Complexes—HEK293 cells were treated with biotinylated TNFα (200 ng/ml) for varying durations and then lysed using 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgCl2 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μm N-ethylmaleimide, 20 nm MG132 plus a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were clarified by low speed centrifugation and precleared using protein G-Sepharose before precipitation of TNFR complexes using streptavidin-coated beads (Roche Applied Science). The beads were then washed extensively using lysis buffer. Precipitated material or lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using specific primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent detection. Assay of Deubiquitination in Cultured Cells—The effect of Cezanne on ubiquitinated proteins was assessed using HEK293 cells cultured in 60-mm dishes. They were transfected with 0.5 μg of mammalian expression vector containing HA-tagged wild-type ubiquitin or containing HA-tagged, mutated forms of ubiquitin that contained single Lys residues for polyubiquitin chain assembly i.e. Lys63 only or Lys48 only. Some cultures were co-transfected with 1 μg of pEGFP-Cezanne or pEGFP-Cezanne C209S. Polyubiquitin and Cezanne were detected in cytosolic lysates by Western blotting using anti-HA (1:1000) and anti-GFP (1:1000) primary antibodies, respectively, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescent detection. The effect of Cezanne on RIP1 ubiquitination was also measured. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids containing either wild-type or catalytically inactive forms of Cezanne using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. After 48 h, the cells were treated with biotinylated TNFα (200 ng/ml) for varying durations before precipitation of TNFR complexes as above. Precipitated material or lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using specific primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescent detection. Statistics—The differences between samples were analyzed using a paired Student's t test and analysis of variance (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). Regulation of Cezanne Expression by Pro-inflammatory Stimuli—We observed by comparative real time PCR that Cezanne transcripts were induced rapidly in response to TNFα in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). The expression of Cezanne was also assessed in HUVEC cultured either in static conditions or under physiological levels of laminar shear stress (12 dynes/cm2). Interestingly, although shear stress had relatively modest effects on Cezanne mRNA levels, it primed HUVEC for enhanced expression of Cezanne transcripts in response to TNFα (Fig. 1B). The effects of TNFα on Cezanne transcripts were paralleled by rapid and sustained increases in Cezanne protein levels in HUVEC as demonstrated by Western blotting (Fig. 1C) or immunostaining (Fig. 1D) using anti-Cezanne antibodies. Our observation that Cezanne can be induced in cultured cells by TNFα or shear stress suggests that it may regulate cellular responses to these stimuli. Cezanne Limits Pro-inflammatory Cellular Activation by Suppressing NF-κB—We used RNA interference to assess the potential role of endogenous Cezanne in regulating pro-inflammatory responses to TNFα. We observed that Cezanne-specific siRNA suppressed Cezanne mRNA and protein by at least 70% in culture cells, whereas a nontargeting scrambled control had no effect (Fig. 2, A and B). Silencing of Cezanne in HUVEC had no effect on basal levels of IL-8 transcripts in unstimulated cells but enhanced the subsequent induction of IL-8 transcripts by TNFα (Fig. 2C, compare treatments 2 and 6), whereas a scrambled control sequence had no effect (compare treatments 2 and 4). Similarly, reporter gene assays revealed that NF-κB transcriptional activation in response to TNFα was significantly enhanced by Cezanne-specific siRNA in HEK293 cells but was not altered by scrambled control sequences (Fig. 2D, compare treatments 3 and 4). We observed that silencing of Cezanne using an alternative siRNA also enhanced NF-κB activity in TNFα-treated cells (Fig. 2D, compare treatments 3 and 5). Thus we conclude that endogenous Cezanne functions as a negative regulator of NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory transcriptional responses in cells exposed to TNFα. The Deubiquitinating Activity of Cezanne Is Essential for NF-κB Suppression—We determined whether the deubiquitinating cysteine protease activity of Cezanne is required for its inhibitory effects on NF-κB. Reporter gene experiments or assays of NF-κB localization were performed in HEK293 cells transfected transiently with expression plasmids containing either wild-type Cezanne or a catalytically inactive form in which the active site cysteine (Cys209) has been mutated to serine (Cezanne C209S). We observed that wild-type Cezanne reduced NF-κB transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293 cells stimulated with TNFα (Fig. 3A, upper panel, compare bars 3-5 with bar 2) or IL-1 (lower panel, compare bars 3-5 with bar 2). Compared with wild-type Cezanne, the catalytically inactive form was ineffective in reducing NF-κB activity in response to TNFα (Fig. 3A, upper panel, compare bar 5 with bar 8) or IL-1 (lower panel, compare bar 5 with bar 8). To understand the level at which Cezanne regulates NF-κB transcriptional activity, we investigated whether it could inhibit nuclear translocation of RelA NF-κB subunits in response to TNFα. Immunostaining revealed that RelA localized predominantly to the cytoplasmic compartment of unstimulated HEK293 cells and translocated to the nucleus in response to 15 min of treatment with TNFα (Fig. 3B, compare treatments 1 and 4). Overexpression of wild-type Cezanne significantly reduced nuclear localization of RelA in response to TNFα treatment for 15 min, whereas a catalytically inactive form had no effect (Fig. 3B, compare levels of nuclear RelA (red) in transfected cells (green) for treatments 5 and 6). It is well established that RelA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in cells exposed to pro-inflammatory stimuli for prolonged periods via NF-κB-dependent resynthesis of IκBs (21Nelson D.E. Ihekwaba A.E.C. Elliott M. Johnson J.R. Gibney C.A. Foreman B.E. Nelson G. See V. Horton C.A. Spiller D.G. Edwards S.W. McDowell H.P. Unitt J.F. Sullivan E. Grimley R. Benson N. Broomhead D. Kell D.B. White M.R.H. Science. 2004; 306: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our observation that nuclear RelA levels were reduced in untransfected cells or cells containing catalytically inactive Cezanne following 2 h of stimulation with TNFα (Fig. 3B, lower panel, compare treatments 4 and 7 and treatments 6 and 9). However, residual nuclear RelA was not exported from cells that overexpressed wild-type Cezanne following 2 h of stimulation (Fig. 3B, lower panel, compare treatments 5 and 8), possibly because of the suppression by Cezanne of NF-κB transcriptional activity, which is essential for RelA export. Collectively, our data indicate that the catalytic properties of Cezanne are required for suppression of NF-κB nuclear localization and transcriptional activation in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Cezanne Suppresses Nuclear Translocation of NF-κB by Inhibiting IKK Activity—The level at which Cezanne modulates TNFR signaling to NF-κB was assessed further by biochemical studies using HEK293 cells that stably expressed similar quantities of either GFP-Cezanne or GFP alone. Western blotting of cytosolic lysates revealed that IκBα was entirely degraded by 15-30 min of TNFα treatment in untransfected cells (Fig. 4A, compare treatments 3 and 4 with treatment 1) and in cells that expressed GFP (compare treatments 7 and 8 with treatment 5), but it was largely preserved in cells that expressed GFP-Cezanne (compare treatments 11 and 12 with treatments 3, 4, 7, and 8). Given the role of IKKβ in phosphorylating IκBα, we assessed whether its activation by TNFα can be modulated by Cezanne. We observed that IKK activity was elevated sharply by TNFα in control cells that expressed GFP, occurring maximally following 15 min of treatment (Fig. 4B). By comparison, IKK activation in response to TNFα treatment was significantly reduced in cells that expressed GFP-Cezanne (Fig. 4B, compare treatments 8 and 3). We conclude therefore that Cezanne targets the TNFR signaling pathway at the level of the IKK complex or upstream from it, thus suppressing NF-κB by stabilizing IκBα. We determined whether the deubiquitinating activity of Cezanne is required for its inhibitory effects on IκBα phosphorylation and degradation using cells transfected transiently with expression plasmids containing either wild-type Cezanne or a catalytically inactive form (Cezanne C209S). We observed by immunostaining and confocal microscopy that wild-type Cezanne suppressed degradation of IκB in response to TNFα, whereas overexpression of Cezanne C209S had no effect (Fig. 4C, compare treatments 3 and 4 and treatments 5 and 6). Similarly, Western blotting revealed that wild-type Cezanne suppressed Ser phosphorylation of IκBα in response to TNFα, whereas Cezanne C209S did not (Fig. 4D, compare treatments 5 and 6). Thus we conclude that the deubiquitinating activity of Cezanne is essential for suppression of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in activated cells. Cezanne Deubiquitinates Lys48- or Lys63-polyubiquitinated Cellular Proteins—We examined the effects of Cezanne on the modification of cellular proteins with Lys63- or Lys48-polyubiquitin chains, which are essential processes during NF-κB activation (Fig. 5). Polyubiquitin chains linked through Lys48, Lys63, or multiple Lys residues were generated in cells using expression vectors containing mutated, single Lys versions of ubiquitin or wild-type ubiquitin, respectively. We observed that the levels of cellular proteins modified with either Lys48-, Lys63-, or mixed Lys-polyubiquitin chains were reduced in HEK293 cells that stably expressed GFP-Cezanne compared with cells that stably expressed GFP alone (Fig. 5A, compare treatments 7-9 with treatments 4-8) and untransfected cultures (Fig. 5A, compare treatments 7-9 with treatments 1-3). In addition, the build-up of Lys63- or Lys48-polyubiquitin chains was suppressed in HEK293 cells that expressed wild-type Cezanne compared with cells that expressed a catalytically inactive version (Cezanne C209S) (Fig. 5B, compare treatments 1 and 2 and treatments 3 and 4). Collectively, these data imply that Cezanne has the capacity to deubiquitinate proteins modified with either Lys63- or Lys48-polyubiquitin in cultured cells. Cezanne Is Recruited to the TNFR Where It Targets RIP1 for Deubiquitination—Recent reports suggest that Lys63-polyubiquitination of RIP1 is essential for the activation of IKKβ in response to TNFR signaling. Given that Cezanne suppresses IKK activation, we assessed whether it could be recruited to the"

The epidermal growth factor receptor (or ErbB) family is an important class of receptor tyrosine kinases involved in transmission of biochemical signals governing cell fate (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 281: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3556) Google Scholar). Four human ErbB family members form numerous homo- and heterodimer combinations and bind different epidermal growth factor-related ligands, thus performing diverse functions in a complex signaling network (2Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of peptide growth factors to the extracellular domain of the receptor triggers the dimerization of receptor monomers or a change in the relative orientation of monomers in preformed receptor dimers, leading to autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic kinase domain (3Tanner K.G.

Recent molecular modeling and solid-state NMR studies performed to predict the spatial structures of the dimeric TM domains of the human ErbB2 receptor and its rat homolog have disclosed two possible dimer conformations with interfaces located at either the N or C terminus of the α-helical TM segment, employing different GG4-like motifs for dimerization (7Mendrola J.M.

Nevertheless, an experimental spatial structure of the dimeric TM domain for ErbB2 as well as for any other receptor tyrosine kinase family members has not been reported so far. transmembrane molecular dynamics dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine nuclear Overhauser effect NOE spectroscopy. Here, we present the high resolution structure of the homodimeric ErbB2 TM domain in a membrane-mimicking lipid environment solved by a heteronuclear NMR technique combined with molecular dynamics (MD) relaxation in an explicit membrane. Our results distinguish one of the potential conformations of the homodimer, which can be ascribed to the active state of the tyrosine kinase. On the basis of the analysis of the local conformation of the dimerization interface, we propose a molecular mechanism of action of some ErbB2 pro-oncogenic mutations, assuming overstabilization of the described TM domain conformation. Protein Expression and Purification—The DNA sequence encoding ErbB2 TM fragment 641–684 (referred to as ErbB2tm) was synthesized from six oligonucleotides by PCR. The TrxA-ErbB2tm fusion protein was constructed by fusing the gene for thioredoxin from Escherichia coli with an N-terminal His tag extension to the gene for ErbB2tm in the pGEMEX1 vector (Promega). To facilitate purification, the His tag and enterokinase cleavage site were placed between the genes for thioredoxin and ErbB2tm. The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells and grown in 2-liter flasks at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium containing (15NH4)2SO4 or (15NH4)2SO4/[U-13C]glucose (both from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) for the production of uniformly 15N- or 15N/13C-labeled protein samples. After induction with 50 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and an additional 40 h of growth at 13 °C, the cells were harvested and stored at -20 °C. Cell pellets (1-liter equivalents) were resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, 15 mm Triton X-100, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by ultrasonication. Centrifugally clarified lysate was applied to Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) pretreated with NiSO4 and eluted with 200 mm imidazole. After overnight incubation with the recombinant human enterokinase light chain, the cleaved ErbB2tm fragment was passed through Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow, loaded onto an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a gradient of NaCl. Yields of ∼10 mg of protein/liter of cell culture could be obtained by this procedure. Protein identity and purity were confirmed by gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy in a 1:1 methanol/chloroform mixture containing 5–10% water. NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculations—NMR experiments were performed using a 600-MHz (1H) Varian UNITY spectrometer equipped with a pulsed-field gradient unit and a triple-resonance probe. NMR spectra were acquired at 40 °C using 1 mm samples of ErbB2tm incorporated into 1:4 dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC)/dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC) lipid bicelles (at a lipid/protein molar ratio of 35) dissolved in buffer (pH 5.0) containing 20 mm deuterated sodium acetate, 6 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 μm sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA, and either 5 or 99.9% D2O unless specified otherwise. Three ErbB2tm samples were prepared: uniformly 15N/13C-labeled, 15N-labeled, and a 1:1 mixture of uniformly 15N/13C-labeled and unlabeled proteins (“heterodimer” sample). The samples were initially subjected to several freeze/thaw cycles, resulting in uniform protein distribution among the lipid bicelles. To verify the validity of the NMR experimental conditions, dynamic light scattering and circular dichroism studies of ErbB2tm solubilized with the DMPC/DHPC bicelles and DMPC unilamellar liposomes (phospholipid bilayer) were performed (see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Fig. S1). The backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of ErbB2tm were assigned using standard triple-resonance techniques (14Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 15Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. 2nd Ed. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2006Google Scholar). Two- and three-dimensional 1H-15N (Fig. 1A) and 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence, 15N-edited total correlation (40-ms mixing time), HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH spectra in H2O provided backbone and partial side chain assignments, whereas HCCH total correlation spectroscopy (15.6- and 23.4-ms mixing times) and 1H homonuclear nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy (NOESY; 60-ms mixing time) experiments in D2O facilitated side chain assignments. Resonance assignments were performed with CARA software. The value of the heteronuclear 15N{1H} steady-state NOE and the 15N longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times were obtained for the 15N-labeled sample as described (16Bocharov E.V. Sobol A.G. Pavlov K.V. Korzhnev D.M. Jaravine V.A. Gudkov A.T. Arseniev A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17697-17706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The effective rotation correlation times (τR) for the individual 15N nuclei were calculated from the T1/T2 ratio using DASHA (17Orekhov V.Y. Nolde D.E. Golovanov A.P. Korzhnev D.M. Arseniev A.S. Appl. Magn. Reson. 1995; 9: 581-588Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The effective molecular mass of the ErbB2tm dimer embedded into the bicelle was estimated according to the empirical dependence (18Daragan V.A. Mayo K.H. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1997; 31: 63-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (223) Google Scholar) from the overall rotation correlation time (TR) averaged over 15N nuclei with 1H{15N} NOE > 0.6. NMR spatial structures of the ErbB2tm dimer were calculated using the CYANA program (19Güntert P. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 2003; 43: 105-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Intramonomeric NOE distance restraints (supplemental Fig. S2) were identified with CARA through the analysis of three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY experiments (60- and 80-ms mixing times) (15Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. 2nd Ed. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2006Google Scholar) performed for 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled samples in H2O and D2O, respectively. The two-dimensional 1H NOESY (80-ms mixing time) spectrum acquired for the unlabeled sample was used as an additional source of structural information concerning aromatic ring protons. Ten (per monomer) unambiguous intermonomeric distance restraints (Figs. 1B and 2B) were derived from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY, two-dimensional 15N-13C F1-filtered/F3-edited NOESY, and three-dimensional 13C F1-filtered/F3-edited NOESY spectra (20Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J.F. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (539) Google Scholar) acquired with a 80-ms mixing time for the 15N-labeled and heterodimer samples in H2O and D2O, respectively. Protein-lipid NOE contacts (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S3) were identified from the three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY and three-dimensional 13C F1-filtered/F3-edited NOESY spectra acquired with a 80-ms mixing time for the 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled samples in H2O and D2O, respectively. Stereospecific assignments and torsion angle restraints for φ, ψ, and χ1 were obtained by analysis of the local conformation in CYANA using sequential NOE data and the available 3JHNα and 3JNβ coupling constants evaluated quantitatively from three-dimensional 1H-15N HNHA and qualitatively from three-dimensional 1H-15N HNHB experiments (15Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. 2nd Ed. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2006Google Scholar). Backbone dihedral angle restraints were also estimated based on the assigned chemical shifts using the TALOS program (21Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). The 24 slowly (per monomer) exchanging amide protons (supplemental Fig. S2) were assigned as hydrogen bond donors with related hydrogen acceptor partners on the basis of preliminary structure calculations. Corresponding hydrogen bond restraints were employed in subsequent calculations for d(O,N), d(O,HN), and d(C,HN) distances as described (22Baker E.N. Hubbard R.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The standard CYANA simulated annealing protocol was applied to 100 random structures, and the resulting 12 structures with the lowest target function were selected. Structure Refinement via Molecular Dynamics Relaxation—Constrained energy relaxation of the NMR structure of the ErbB2tm dimer was performed by molecular dynamics in a hydrated explicit DMPC bilayer using the GROMACS 3.3.3 package (23Lindahl E. Hess B. der Spoel van D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). The protein-lipid system construction and MD protocol are described in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” The 5-ns MD run for the representative model of the ErbB2tm dimer was carried out with NMR-derived intra- and intermonomeric distance restraints adapted for GROMACS by modification from proton-proton distance restraints to restraints between carbon atoms and polar protons. Furthermore, two additional MD simulations were performed starting from coordinates of the resulting systems. In the first one, the 5-ns continuation MD run without restraints was carried out to check the stability of the dimer. The second simulation (1-ns MD with NMR distance restraints, followed by 5-ns free molecular dynamics) was done for V659E mutant ErbB2tm with a protonated (uncharged) carboxyl group of Glu659 in both dimer subunits. Equilibrium parts of MD trajectories (last 2 ns) were analyzed using original software developed by us and utilities supplied with the GROMACS package. Hydrophobic properties of α-helices were calculated using the molecular hydrophobicity potential approach (see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for details) (24Efremov R.G. Vergoten G. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 10658-10666Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The resulting structures of the ErbB2tm dimer were visualized with MOLMOL (25Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and PyMOL (35DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). The contact area between the dimer subunits was calculated using the DSSP program (26Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1985; 22: 2577-2637Crossref Scopus (12414) Google Scholar) as a difference between the accessible surface areas of ErbB2tm residues in the monomer and dimer. Tertiary Fold of the ErbB2tm Dimer in Lipid Bicelles—Recombinant 44-residue ErbB2 fragment 641–684 (named ErbB2tm), including the hydrophobic TM segment flanked by polar N- and C-terminal regions, was solubilized in an aqueous suspension of bicelles consisting of DMPC and DHPC lipids with deuterated hydrophobic tails using DMPC/DHPC and lipid/protein molar ratios of 0.25 and 35, respectively, and then studied with a conventional 15N-13C heteronuclear NMR technique. Circular dichroism spectra (recorded to validate the NMR experimental conditions) proved virtually identical for ErbB2tm incorporated into the DMPC/DHPC bicelles and DMPC unilamellar liposomes (phospholipid bilayer), revealing an α-helical structure of the fragment in the membrane mimetics (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, the observed protein-lipid NOE contacts with polar lipid heads suggested that the fragment spans the hydrophobic phase of the bicelle (supplemental Fig. S3), therefore mimicking the embedding of the ErbB2 TM domain into a double-layer lipid membrane reasonably well. The 15N{1H} NOE and 15N T1 and T2 values (supplemental Fig. S4) reflecting internal dynamics of the protein backbone were indicative of stable TM segment 651–677, whereas the flanking N- and C-terminal regions had nearly unrestricted mobility. The overall rotation correlation time estimated from the T1/T2 ratio on the TM region is ∼17 ns, which corresponds well with the molecular mass (∼44 kDa) of the ErbB2tm dimer surrounded by ∼70 lipid molecules composing a bicelle with an effective hydrodynamic radius of 24 ± 2 Å measured by dynamic light scattering (supplemental Fig. S1). The unique set of intra- and intermonomeric NOE contacts identified in NMR spectra (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2) confirmed the helical structure of ErbB2tm in bicelles and directly demonstrated that the TM fragment forms a symmetrical dimer on the NMR time scale with parallel subunits. Therefore, the NMR-derived dihedral angle restraints and both intra- and intermonomeric distance restraints were assigned for each subunit that resulted in a dimer with 2-fold symmetry averaged over the ensemble of calculated structures (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S5). The representative structure of the ErbB2tm dimer was subjected to energy relaxation by molecular dynamics in an explicit hydrated lipid bilayer of DMPC with the experimentally derived distance restraints that allowed adaptation of the structure to the explicit membrane. After constrained energy relaxation, the membrane-spanning α-helices of ErbB2tm cross at an angle θ of -42° with the distance d = 7.7 Å between helix axes, forming a right-handed parallel symmetrical dimer tilted slightly from the membrane normal, whereas the flexible N and C termini of ErbB2 are exposed to water (Fig. 2C). The continuation of molecular dynamics without restraints did not cause considerable change in the dimer structure, indicating its stability in the membrane. A survey of the structural statistics for the final ensemble of the 12 NMR-derived structures of the ErbB2tm dimer and for the representative dimer structure relaxed in the explicit membrane is provided in Table 1.TABLE 1Structural statistics for the ensemble of the 12 best NMR structures of the ErbB2tm dimer and of a representative structure of the ErbB2tm dimer after MD relaxation r.m.s.d., root meant square deviation.NMR distance and dihedral restraints Total unambiguous NOE restraints448Intraresidue186Interresidue264Sequential (|i – j| = 1)142Medium-range (1 < |i – j| ≤ 4)106Long-range (|i – j| > 4)0Intermonomeric NOE20 Hydrogen bond restraints (upper/lower)144/144 Total torsion angle restraints152Backbone φ56Backbone ψ56 Side chain χ140Structure calculation statistics CYANA target function (Å2)0.11 ± 0.01 Restraint violationsDistance (>0.2 Å)0Dihedral (>5°)0 Average pairwise r.m.s.d.

Being embedded into the DMPC/DHPC bicelles, the ErbB2tm fragment self-associates through a tandem variant of the GG4-like motif Thr652-X3-Ser656-X3-Gly660, located in the N-terminal part of the TM helix (Fig. 2C). The polar contact area of this motif is shielded from lipid tails by the side chains of Leu651, Ile655, Ala657, Val659, and Ile661 (Fig. 2, D–F), whereas the slightly polar concave surface of the C-terminal GG4-like motif Gly668-X3-Gly672 is exposed to the hydrophobic lipid environment (Fig. 2, C–E). The side chains of the opposite Ser656 and Thr652 residues of both dimer subunits are closely packed in the ErbB2tm dimerization interface. Constrained MD relaxation of the ErbB2tm dimer structure revealed two possible configurations of transient intermonomeric hydrogen bonds occurring between the side chains of the Ser656/Ser656* or Thr652/Thr652* pair (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, the side chain of Ser656 is sometimes involved in intramonomeric hydrogen bonding with the backbone carbonyl group of Thr652. The local conformation of the ErbB2tm dimerization interface is asymmetrical; however, in the course of MD relaxation, hydrogen bond switching occurs. It is accompanied by a change in the hydrogen bond partners through minor rearrangements, so the dimer would be symmetrical on the NMR time scale. Hence, the (Thr652/Ser656)2 hydrophilic motif in the N-terminal part of the dimerization interface forms a node of switching inter- and intramonomeric hydrogen bonds mediating the ErbB2tm helix packing. The C-terminal TM part of the ErbB2tm dimer is stabilized by intermonomeric contacts of the side chains of Leu663, Val664, and Leu667, forming a hydrophobic cluster flanked by the aromatic rings of the opposite Phe671 residues participating in an intermolecular edge-face stacking interaction (Fig. 3C). In addition, during MD relaxation of the ErbB2tm dimer in an explicit DMPC bilayer, multiple transient intermonomeric interactions of the flexible N termini were observed, especially between the strong polar residues Glu645 and Arg647 (Fig. 3D). The existence of such interactions was confirmed experimentally by higher local correlation times compared with the unfolded C termini of ErbB2tm (supplemental Fig. S4D). Thus, the ErbB2 TM helices surrounded by the lipid bicelle interact via the N-terminal tandem GG4-like motif, whereas the C-terminal GG4-like motif is not employed. Apart from these dimerization motifs, presumably associated with the active and inactive states of the receptor (7Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol.

Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 31: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This potential dimerization site (28Beevers A. Kukol A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) is located on the lipid-exposed surface of the dimer (Fig. 2, C–E), implying the possibility of the involvement of the ErbB2 TM segment in additional helix-helix interactions with other partners (e.g. in heterodimers or higher order oligomers). ErbB2 TM Domain Conformation and Receptor Activity—The structural properties of the ErbB2tm dimer with a flexible network of hydrogen bonds in the dimerization interface appear to enable the ErbB2 TM domain to undergo conformational switching (4Moriki T.

According to the obtained structure, both residues participate in dimerization of the ErbB2 TM helices. The I655V variant can excessively stabilize the ErbB2 active dimeric state due to substitution of the bulk side chain of Ile with a smaller one of Val, thus allowing tighter TM helix packing. The V659E mutation can cause the intermonomeric hydrogen bonding of the glutamate side chains with the opposite hydroxyl and backbone carbonyl groups or directly with one another, which would overstabilize dimerization via the N-terminal TM motif, resulting in uncontrolled receptor activation and subsequent cell transformation. Magic angle spinning solid-state NMR studies of the activated pro-oncogenic mutant of the ErbB2 rat homolog revealed that the glutamate carboxyl group is protonated and hydrogen-bonded in the dimerization interface of the TM domain (32Smith S.O. Smith C.S. Bormann B.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Indeed, MD simulation of the NMR-derived ErbB2tm dimer with a substitution of the Val659 side chains with protonated glutamate side chains revealed that the Glu659 residues can participate in intermonomeric hydrogen bonding without distortion of the helix-packing interface (Fig. 3, E and F), i.e. the ErbB2 TM domain configuration corresponding to the receptor active state is preserved and strengthened. Thus, the obtained ErbB2tm dimer structure explains the biochemical and oncogenic properties of the human ErbB2 receptor and provides a basis to control its kinase activity, which is critical in many disease states. However, additional structural studies of the mutant forms of the ErbB2 TM domain may prove to be essential in the search for related therapeutic agents specifically recognizing the TM helices (33Yin H.

This promise has been limited by the absence of potent inhibitors or agonists that are specific for individual human Notch receptors (NOTCH1-4). Using an unbiased functional screening, we identified monoclonal antibodies that specifically inhibit or induce activating proteolytic cleavages in NOTCH3. Remarkably, the most potent inhibitory and activating antibodies bind to overlapping epitopes within a juxtamembrane negative regulatory region that protects NOTCH3 from proteolysis and activation in its resting autoinhibited state. The inhibitory antibodies revert phenotypes conveyed on 293T cells by NOTCH3 signaling, such as increased cellular proliferation, survival, and motility, whereas the activating antibody mimics some of the effects of ligand-induced Notch activation. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of Notch autoinhibition and activation and pave the way for the further development of specific antibody-based modulators of the Notch receptors, which are likely to be of utility in a wide range of experimental and therapeutic settings.

In line with these distinct functions, inherited defects in Notch receptors or ligands cause a number of human developmental disorders, including congenital bicuspid aortic valve (NOTCH1) (17Garg V.

The best example is T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is commonly associated with acquired gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH1 (22Weng A.P. Ferrando A.A. Lee W. Morris J.P. Silverman L.B. Sanchez-Irizarry C. Blacklow S.C. Look A.T. Aster J.C. Science. 2004; 306: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar), but other Notch receptors are also suspected to act as oncoproteins. For example, activated NOTCH3 is a potent inducer of leukemia in murine models (23Bellavia D. Campese A.F. Alesse E. Vacca A. Felli M.P. Balestri A. Stoppacciaro A. Tiveron C. Tatangelo L.

Of note, NOTCH3-deficient mice are viable and fertile (27Domenga V. Fardoux P. Lacombe P. Monet M. Maciazek J. Krebs L.T. Klonjkowski B. Berrou E. Mericskay M. Li Z. Tournier-Lasserve E. Gridley T. Joutel A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2730-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), suggesting that NOTCH3-selective inhibitors should be well tolerated. The fortuitous development of γ-secretase inhibitors as possible therapeutic agents in Alzheimer disease has enabled clinical trials of these drugs in cancers associated with hyperactive Notch signaling, such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, such compounds inhibit the proteolysis of multiple transmembrane proteins, including all four Notch receptors (28Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), and cause significant toxicities when given chronically, most notably severe secretory diarrhea that results from colonic goblet cell metaplasia (29Wong G.T. Manfra D. Poulet F.M. Zhang Q. Josien H. Bara T. Engstrom L. Pinzon-Ortiz M. Fine J.S. Lee H.J. Zhang L. Higgins G.A. Parker E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12876-12882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). This gastrointestinal toxicity is believed to stem from inhibition of NOTCH1 and/or NOTCH2 (30Fre S. Huyghe M. Mourikis P. Robine S. Louvard D. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nature. 2005; 435: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), which promote the differentiation of progenitor cells in the colonic crypts into absorptive enterocytes. Soluble Notch agonists are also of potential interest for purposes of tissue engineering (e.g. to grow T cells (31de Pooter R.F. Schmitt T.M. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 330: 113-121PubMed Google Scholar) and stem cells) and other applications related to cell growth, development, and immune function. However, soluble ligands generally appear to behave as antagonists rather than agonists of Notch signaling unless they are fixed to plates or multimerized (32Varnum-Finney B. Wu L. Yu M.

Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development. 1997; 124: 3439-3448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and apparently lack specificity for individual Notch receptors. In principle, specific inhibitors of individual Notch receptors may avoid or reduce the therapeutic complications caused by non-selective Notch inhibitors, and selective soluble Notch agonists would be useful experimental tools with possible therapeutic applications. In the studies reported here, we describe the discovery of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that appear to specifically inhibit or activate NOTCH3. Beginning with unbiased screens, we identified two potent blocking antibodies and one apparent activating antibody, each of which binds to overlapping epitopes on one face of the NRR of NOTCH3. These antibodies are highly specific for NOTCH3 and appear to mimic or inhibit certain effects of DSL ligands on cells. Our findings further highlight the importance of the NRR in regulating Notch activation and establish an avenue for the development of new, specific therapeutic agents directed at this important pathway. Cell Lines and cDNAs—A full-length NOTCH3 cDNA was generated by RT-PCR using human thymus RNA (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) as a template. JAGGED1 and NOTCH1 cDNAs were obtained from a commercial source (OriGene, Rockville, MD). Human JAGGED2 cDNA was generated by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from the human T-cell leukemia cell line HH (ATCC# CRL-2105). cDNAs for NOTCH3, JAGGED1, JAGGED2, ΔEGF-N3 (a construct encoding a form of NOTCH3 lacking the ligand binding EGF repeats), and LD-TM (a construct encoding the NOTCH3 leader peptide fused to the residues spanning the NRR region and the transmembrane domain (residues 1378-1711)) were cloned into pcDNA3.1-Hyg (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines carrying pcDNA3.1-Hyg plasmids were generated from 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA). “Tet-on” U2OS flp-in cells (the kind gift of Dr. Jeff Parvin) were co-transfected with pOG44 (which encodes Flp recombinase) and pcDNA5-FRT-TO plasmids encoding the ectodomains and transmembrane domains of human NOTCH1-3 fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and the transcriptional activation domain of NOTCH1. OP9 control cells and OP9-DLL1 expressing feeder cells were the kind gift of J. C. Zuniga-Pflucker (31de Pooter R.F. Schmitt T.M. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 330: 113-121PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of NOTCH3 Ectodomain mAbs—cDNAs encoding (i) the NRR region (residues 1378-1640) and (ii) the EGF repeat region (residues 43-1377) of NOTCH3 were ligated in-frame between the NOTCH3 signal peptide sequence and the 5′-end of a cDNA encoding the Fc of human IgG1. The resulting chimeric cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1 and expressed in 293T cells. The secreted fusion proteins were purified from conditioned media by protein A affinity chromatography (Pierce) and injected into male A/J mice (Harlan, Houston, TX), which were subsequently harvested for hybridoma generation (37Fung M. Lu M. Fure H. Sun W. Sun C. Shi N.Y. Dou Y. Su J. Swanson X. Mollnes T.E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2003; 133: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked Immunoabsorbent Assays—ELISA was performed as described (37Fung M. Lu M. Fure H. Sun W. Sun C. Shi N.Y. Dou Y. Su J. Swanson X. Mollnes T.E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2003; 133: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). mAbs were mixed with 50 μl of blocking buffer and added to a well coated with immunogen, which was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated, Fc-specific goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 60 min. The HRP substrate solution containing 0.1% 3,3,5,5-tetramethyl benzidine, and 0.0003% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) was added for 30 min. Color development was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To measure the release of the ectodomain of NOTCH3 into conditioned medium, an ELISA was developed that relies on HRP-linked antibodies specific for non-overlapping epitopes in NOTCH3-EGF repeat region. Compounds—The metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The γ-secretase inhibitor compound E was purchased from Calbiochem. Western Blot Analyses—Polypeptides in whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. NOTCH3 polypeptides were detected on blots with a polyclonal antibody specific for the C terminus of the intracellular domain (Orbigen, San Diego, CA) or NOTCH3 mAbs A2 and A13. Luciferase Reporter Assays—293T-NOTCH3 cells stably transfected with a Notch-sensitive-luciferase reporter gene plasmid were co-cultivated with control cells or 293T-JAGGED1 cells at 1:1 ratio or cultured on plates coated with JAGGED1-IgG Fc fusion protein or DLL4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), for 28-40 h. The Notch-sensitive luciferase reporter gene used contains eight tandem repeats of the CSL-consensus binding motif positioned 5′ of the firefly luciferase gene in the pTA-Luc vector (Clontech, Mountainview, CA). Luciferase reporter activities were assayed using the Stable Luciferase Assay kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI) and a TD-20 luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, CA). To determine the specificity of activating and inhibitory antibodies, U2OS Tet-on flp-in cells bearing isogenic transgenes encoding NOTCH1-, NOTCH2-, or NOTCH3-Gal4 chimeric receptors were transfected with a 5 μg of Gal4-firefly luciferase and 100 ng of pRL-TK-Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids. After 24 h, the cells were split onto OP9 or OP9-DLL1 feeder cells in 24-well plates in the presence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml) and control or NOTCH3 mAbs (10 μg/ml). Following 24 h of co-culture, luciferase activities were measured in whole cell lysates using a dual luciferase kit (Promega) and a Turner TD-20 luminometer. Normalized luciferase activities for each well were expressed as the ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase. RNA Extraction and QRT-PCR—Extraction of total RNA from cell lines or tumor samples was done using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed in duplicate with the ABI Prism 7900 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) sequence detection system and TaqMan reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Epitope Mapping—Soluble Notch-Fc fusion protein expression constructs were generated by PCR. Domain and subdomain swaps between NOTCH3 and NOTCH1 were carried out based on sequence alignments performed using LaserGene DNAStar (Madison, WI). cDNAs were assembled in pcDNA3.1-Hyg. Polypeptides were produced by transfection of pcDNA3.1 plasmids into Chinese hamster ovary cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After culture for 2-3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum, conditioned media were collected, cleared by centrifugation, and subjected to analysis by ELISA as described above. The amounts of various polypeptides recovered from conditioned media were assessed semi-quantitatively by ELISAs performed with an antibody specific for human IgG Fc. Binding results for each antibody to individual polypeptides were expressed relative to binding of the same antibody to the NRR region of NOTCH3 (which was considered 100% binding activity). Antibody Competition Assay—Immulon II (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) microtest plates were coated overnight with a NOTCH3 NRR-Fc fusion polypeptide at 0.2 μg/ml in PBS (100 μl/well). After blockade of nonspecific binding sites with 200 μl of 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS (PBS-B buffer), the wells were washed with PBS-T buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). A 1:20,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated monoclonal antibody was then mixed with a dilution series of various competitor antibodies in “U” bottom 96-well plates. After 15 min at room temperature, 100 μl/well of these mixtures was transferred to the ELISA plate wells for 1 h. The wells were then washed with PBS-T, and the amount of HRP-labeled mAb bound to the NOTCH3 LNR-HD domain-Fc fusion polypeptide was determined by ELISA. Structural Modeling—The homology model of the human NOTCH3 NRR (residues 1387-1631) was generated with the Swiss Model web interface (38Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsh M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4447) Google Scholar), using the coordinates of the human NOTCH2 NRR (pdb code: 2OO4) as an input model. The input NOTCH3 sequence used for modeling lacked the non-conserved loop containing the furin cleavage site, because this unstructured region was excised from the crystallized NOTCH2 NRR (39Gordon W.R. Vardar-Ulu D. Histen G. Sanchez-Irizarry C. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The first approach mode was used to generate an initial homology model and accompanying sequence alignment, which was then manually modified to account for residues absent from the initial model. These additional residues were added to the C terminus of the model coordinates using Coot (40Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23012) Google Scholar). A final correction of the alignment was then performed in Swiss Pdb Viewer. This model and the accompanying corrected sequence alignment were then input into the Optimization Mode of Swiss Model. The resultant pdb file was used to display the antibody epitope locations. Apoptosis and Proliferation Assay—293T-NOTCH3 cells were seeded in IgG Fc- or JAGGED1-Fc-coated 96-well plates in the presence of different antibodies in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. Cells with active caspase 3 were detected by staining with NucView™ 488-conjugated DEVD (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA) followed by flow cytometry. To assess proliferation, 3 × 103 293T-NOTCH3 cells were seeded in the presence of different antibodies in 96-well plates coated with JAGGED1-Fc or IgG Fc. After growth for 24-48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7% fetal calf serum, viable cells were enumerated under the microscope by trypan blue exclusion. Migration Assay—293T-NOTCH3 cell migration assays were carried out in 24-well Transwell plates (Corning, Acton, MA). Insert membranes (average pore size, 8 μm) were coated with JAGGED1-Fc or IgG Fc or mock treated on the upper surface, and 10% fetal bovine serum medium was added to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Cells were seeded on the upper surface in the presence of different antibodies. Cell migration to the lower chamber was determined by counting under the microscope. Sphere Formation Assay—The 293T-NOTCH3 cells were cultured in 96-well plate coated with IgG Fc or JAGGED1-Fc in the presence of different antibodies in serum-free medium. Cell morphology was documented after 15-20 h. Sphere formation was quantified by wash-off experiments, in which the floating spheres were removed by aspiration of the medium. The remaining cells were stained with crystal violet in 40% methanol and 60% PBS for 15 min. After washing three times with deionized water, the dye retained in the cells was extracted with 30% acetic acid and measured by absorption at 590 nm. Identification and Characterization of Inhibitory and Activating NOTCH3 mAbs—To perform an unbiased search for functional NOTCH3 antibodies, we generated mAbs against two NOTCH3 polypeptides consisting of (i) the EGF repeat region or (ii) the NRR, which together span the entire NOTCH3 ectodomain. NOTCH3 mAbs were first identified using ELISA and high throughput fluorescence cell staining assays (FMAT™), and then tested for functional effects in cell-based assays using a Notch-sensitive luciferase reporter gene. Both strong inhibitory and activating antibodies were identified, all of which were raised against the NRR (summarized in Fig. 1A). The two most potent antagonist mAbs were designated 256A-4 (A4) and 256A-8 (A8). At doses of 0.1-0.3 μg/ml, A4 and A8 completely inhibited the activation of NOTCH3 by multiple DSL ligands, including cell-associated JAGGED1 (Fig. 1B), JAGGED2 (supplemental Fig. S1A) and DLL1 (Fig. 2C), and soluble DLL4 (supplemental Fig. S1B) and JAGGED1 adsorbed to the surface of culture dishes (supplemental Fig. S1C). A4 and A8 also inhibited JAGGED1-induced up-regulation of HES5 and HEY2, two well characterized Notch genes, in 293T cells overexpressing NOTCH3 (293T-NOTCH3 cells) (Fig. 1C). In addition, A4 and A8 did not affect the binding of soluble ligand to NOTCH3 (supplemental Fig. S1D; data not shown), indicating that inhibition by these mAbs does not involve competition with ligand for access to ligand-binding sites. As anticipated, we also identified antibodies specific for the EGF repeat region that inhibited NOTCH3 activation, perhaps through competition for ligand binding. However, in direct comparisons, mAbs A4 and A8 were substantially more potent than the most active mAbs (A45 and A79) raised against the EGF repeat region, which were only weak antagonists of JAGGED1- and DLL4-induced NOTCH3 signaling (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S3, A and B), and completely inactive against JAGGED2-induced NOTCH3 signaling (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S3C). Among mammalian Notch receptors (NOTCH1-4), NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 have the highest homology to NOTCH3 within the NRR region. To establish the specificity of A4 and A8, we tested their activities against isogenic cell lines that express NOTCH1-, NOTCH2-, or NOTCH3-Gal4 chimeric receptors (Fig. 2A). In response to DSL ligands, these receptors stimulate Gal4-luciferase reporter gene activity in a γ-secretase-dependent fashion (data not shown). A4 and A8 inhibited the DLL1-induced activation of the NOTCH3-Gal4 receptor, while having minimal effects on the activation of the NOTCH1- and NOTCH2-Gal4 receptors (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that these antibodies are specific NOTCH3 antagonists. We also identified four mAbs that activated NOTCH3 signaling in the absence of ligand (Figs. 1D and 2D; data not shown). The most potent agonist antibody 256A-13 (A13) was characterized further. A13 strongly activated the chimeric NOTCH3-Gal4 receptor but did not affect the NOTCH1- or NOTCH2-Gal4 chimeric receptors (Fig. 2D). Treatment of cells expressing NOTCH3 with mAb A13 resulted in increased shedding of NOTCH3 ectodomains into conditioned medium in a manner that was sensitive to the metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 (Fig. 3A). In addition, mAb A13 stimulated the cleavage of NOTCH3 at site S2, based on the accumulation of N™* (the product of S2 cleavage) in the presence of a γ-secretase inhibitor (which stabilizes N™*). Notably, A13 was more effective at inducing the accumulation of N™* than immob"

We find a decrease in ADAR2 editing activity that seems to correlate with the grade of malignancy in children. Despite the loss of ADAR2 editing activity in tumor tissues, the high grade astrocytomas do not exhibit alterations in ADAR2 expression when compared with their specific control tissues. However, high expression levels of ADAR1 and ADAR3 were found in tumors when compared with normal tissues dissected in the same area of the brain. We reintroduced either ADAR2 or the inactive version of ADAR2 in three astrocytoma cell lines (U118, A172, U87). The “reverted” editing status is necessary and sufficient for a significant decrease in cell malignant behavior as measured by proliferation, cell cycle, and migration assays. We show that elevated levels of ADAR1, as found in astrocytomas, do indeed interfere with ADAR2 specific editing activity. Furthermore, we show that the endogenous ADAR1 can form heterodimers with ADAR2 in astrocytes.

(adenosine deaminases that act on RNA) are enzymes responsible for adenosine (A) to inosine (I) conversion in pre-mRNA. This deamination is the most widespread type of RNA editing in higher eukaryotes. Since the translation machinery reads inosine as guanosine (1Basilio C. Wahba A.J. Lengyel P. Speyer J.F. Ochoa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the ADARs can modify protein codons and thus modulate protein sequence and function of several gene products. The editing of a specific adenosine is not usually 100% efficient and as a consequence, the ADARs can generate different protein isoforms in the same cell.The ADAR gene family includes three members in mammals. ADAR1 and ADAR2 are widely expressed and catalytically active (2Wagner R.W. Yoo C. Wrabetz L. Kamholz J. Buchhalter J. Hassan N.F. Khalili K. Kim S.U. Perussia B. McMorris F.A. Nishikura K. Mol.

RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1997; 3: 453-463Google Scholar), whereas ADAR3 is exclusively expressed in the brain and is inactive on all substrates tested (5Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R.

RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2000; 6: 755-767Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of ADAR1, a longer 150-kDa protein that is interfer-on-inducible and a 110-kDa protein that differs at the amino terminus and is constitutively expressed. The ADARs bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formed between a sequence containing an editing site and a downstream or upstream editing complementary sequence (7Higuchi M. Single F.N. Kohler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). All ADARs have a similar domain structure with a catalytic domain at the carboxyl terminus and two or three dsRNA binding domains at the amino terminus. It has been reported that they can form dimers (8Chilibeck K.A. Wu T. Liang C. Schellenberg M.J. Gesner E.M. Lynch J.M. MacMillan A.M. J. Biol.

The edited mammalian transcripts that have been best characterized are expressed in the central nervous system and include transcripts encoding the subunits GluR-B, GluR-C, and GluR-D of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor (AMPA), the subunits GluR-6 and GluR-5 of the kainate receptor (Kainate), and the serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) (for a review, see Refs. 12Nishikura K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and 13Keegan L.P. Gallo A. O'Connell M.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The transcripts encoding GluR-B (AMPA subunit) and GluR-6 (Kainate subunit) are essential for the intracellular Ca2+ wave propagation and neurotransmitter release and are also involved in neuron/glial differentiation (14Steinhauser C. Gallo V. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 339-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 15Patneau D.K. Wright P.W. Winters C. Mayer M.L. Gallo V. Neuron. 1994; 12: 357-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). GluR-B dominates major AMPA receptor transmission properties via arginine 607, which is not coded by its gene but generated by RNA editing. This editing changes the glutamine to arginine in all the GluR-B transcripts (100% editing efficiency), making this editing event unique. The inability to edit this site can be dramatic as ADAR2-/- mice are prone to seizures and die soon after birth (16Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). As most of the known ADAR substrates are expressed in the central nervous system, defects in ADAR activity have been observed mainly in neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, schizophrenia, stroke, and epilepsy (for reviews, see Refs. 13Keegan L.P.

RNA Biol. 2006; 3: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Astrocytomas are the most common tumor type affecting the central nervous system. They originate from astrocytes, a type of glial cell, and are classified into increasing grades of malignancy with the most aggressive form being grade IV, the glioblastoma multiforme (or GBM), which is almost invariably fatal (18Ichimura K. Ohgaki H. Kleihues P. Collins V.P. J. Neurooncol. 2004; 70: 137-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A decrease in editing at the GluR-B Gln/Arg site in astrocytomas in adult patients has been reported (19Maas S. Patt S. Schrey M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Herein we studied the RNA editing activity in pediatric astrocytomas and in astrocytoma cell lines to elucidate mechanisms that connect ADAR activity and tumor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTumor and Control Tissues—We included 14 tissue samples from 10 children (age range at the time of diagnosis 9-15 years). None of the patients previously received radio- or chemotherapy. Tumor tissue samples were dissected from the core of the tumors. Malignancy grade (from grade I to IV) was defined according to the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) (see Table 1). For this study, we used only de novo (or primary) GBM. Low grade tumors were cystic astrocytomas with mural node and expansive growth (20Koeller K.K. Rushing E.J. Radiographics. 2004; 24: 1693-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mixed lineage, giant cell astrocytomas and gliosarcomas were excluded to avoid the presence of cell types other than astrocytes. To further decrease the possibility of contamination from cells other than astrocytes, we used only tissue samples with >90% astrocytes/10 random fields per slide. Control samples of normal white matter tissue were dissected close to the tumor during surgery. Astrocytes are particularly abundant in white matter. The study was approved by the local committee on the use of human samples for experimental studies.TABLE 1Summary of all the tumor and control tissues analyzed in this study identified by ID numbersLocationID sampleWHO grades and controlsAgeGluR-B% Gln/ArgGluR-B% Arg/GlyGluR-6% Ile/ValGluR-6% Tyr/CysGluR-6% Gln/ArgyearsSopratentorial astrocytomasTemporal lobe1C151007771.773.978.52I1510056.642.55062.83C121007567.381.691.64III129229.63644285IV10973.82.24.54.5Frontal lobe6C15100830.83230.87I1510087.214.512.58IV10983.82.24.34.5Subtentorial astrocytomasCerebellum9C1410092.345.460.660.610I141006718.84744.411IV1210042.48.32520.6Spinal cord12I14100nd12.512.51313III91001591314IV994221112 Open table in a new tab RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from the tumors, control brain tissues, cultured astrocytoma cell lines, and the HEK 293T cell line, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA pools were generated by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using random hexamer primers. The GluR-B cDNA encompassing both the Gln/Arg and the Arg/Gly editing positions was amplified by the following PCR primers: hGluR-Bfw, 5′-TTTAGCCTATGAGATCTGGATGTGC-3′; hGluR-Brev, 5′-CAAGGATGTAGAATACTCCAGCAAC-3′. For the analysis of the Ile/Val, Tyr/Cys, and Gln/Arg editing sites of the GluR-6, the following primers were used: hGluR-6fw, 5′-ACCTTGCAGTTGCTCCACTGG-3′; hGluR-6rev, 5′-ATACGAAGAAATGATGATAAGTG-3′.Analysis of RNA Editing—Direct sequencing was performed on cDNA pools, and editing was calculated as described previously (21Larder B.A. Kohli A. Kellam P. Kemp S.D. Kronick M. Henfrey R.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 671-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), or the PCR products were subcloned into the T-easy vector (Promega), and ∼50 individual cDNA clones were sequenced for each sample. A to G changes in the individual clones were analyzed. For each sample, 2-3 independent RT-PCR reactions were performed.Astrocytoma Cell Line Transfection—Human astrocytoma cell lines A172 (ATCC CRL-1620™), U118 (ATCC HTB-15™), and U87 (ATCC HTB-14™) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) plus antibiotics. Stable polyclonal cell lines were generated by Geneticin selection using standard protocols. cDNA encoding the shorter and more active human isoform ADAR2a (henceforth ADAR2) was subcloned into pEGFP C3 vector (V-EGFP) (Clontech) with in-frame enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the amino terminus. Geneticin-resistant cell clones (EGFP, EGFP-ADAR2, and EGFP-ADAR2 Glu/Ala) were generated and analyzed by Western blot using polyclonal anti-ADAR2 antibody (kindly provided by M. Ohman) or anti-EGFP (Clontech). All the cell lines generated in this study were stable polyclonal cell lines to avoid problems due to positional insertion effects. EGFP-ADAR2 and EGFP-ADAR2 Glu/Ala cell lines showed similar EGFP expression units (mean index fluorescent), and their RNA and protein levels were comparable as analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot.Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry—1 × 106 of A172, U118, and U87 cell lines stably transfected with EGFP, EGFP-ADAR2, and EGFP-ADAR2 Glu/Ala were trypsinized, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol. The cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline 1× and then treated with RNase A (75 units/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then propidium iodide was added at a 100 ng/ml final concentration. After staining, the cells were analyzed by a FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using the CELLQuest™ software (BD Biosciences) for both cell cycle profiles and apoptosis. Dead cells were excluded from analysis by side/forward scatter gating.Proliferation Assay—5 × 104 of A172, U118, and U87 cell lines and polyclonal cell lines stably transfected with EGFP, EGFP-ADAR2, and EGFP-ADAR2 Glu/Ala were seeded in 60-mm cell culture dishes. Alive adherent cells (Trypan blue dye exclusion) were determined daily, from day 1 to day 4. The assay was repeated four times in duplicates.Cell Migration Assay—The Boyden chamber chemotaxis/migration assay was performed to measure cell migration. Polycarbonate 8-μm filters were coated with 5 μg/ml gelatin, and NIH-3T3-conditioned medium was used as a chemo-attractant in the bottom chamber. The cell lines stably transfected with EGFP or with EGFP-ADAR2, and EGFP-ADAR2 Glu/Ala were placed in the upper compartment of the Boyden chamber at the density of 5 × 104 or 1 × 105 cells/well. After 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells that had migrated to the lower surface were fixed, stained, and counted under a light microscope (×200 magnification). 10 random fields per slide were counted. Assays were carried out in triplicate and repeated at least four times in independent experiments.Site-directed Mutagenesis to Generate Inactive EGFP-ADAR2 Glu/Ala—A single point mutation in the catalytic domain was introduced using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to change the amino acid Glu-396 into Ala-396 (changing the sequence from GAA to GCA). The oligonucleotides used for the mutagenesis were: hADAR2 Glu/Ala forward, 5′-GACTGCCATGCAGCAATAATATCTCGG-3′; hADAR2 Glu/Ala reverse, 5′-CCGAGATATTATTGCTGCATGGCAGTC-3′. The PCR reaction was performed following the manufacturer's instructions.Editing Activity of ADAR2 and ADAR2 Glu/Ala in HEK 293T Cell Line—HEK 293T cells were chosen for the assessment of EGFP-ADAR2 and EGFP-ADAR2 Glu/Ala editing activity as the endogenous editing activity in this cell line is undetectable. They were transiently co-transfected independently with 4 and 8 μg of EGFP-ADAR2, EGFP-ADAR2 Glu/Ala, and pEGFP (V-EGFP) and 3 μg of GluR-B minigeneB13 (miniB13), which was used as the substrate. The miniB13 encodes a portion of the editing-competent murine glutamate receptor GluR-B gene that includes the Gln/Arg site that is edited by ADAR2 and the hot-spot site edited by ADAR1 (7Higuchi M. Single F.N. Kohler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol reagent and reverse-transcribed by specific miniB13-vector primers. The transfection was tested by both real-time PCR and Western blot.Sequence Analysis of ADAR1 and ADAR2 in Astrocytoma Cell Lines and Pediatric Astrocytomas—For the sequence analysis of both ADAR1 and ADAR2 cDNAs, total RNA was isolated from cell lines and tissues as described, and the specific PCR products were analyzed by direct sequencing or subcloned into the T-easy vector (Promega), and 30-40 independent clones were sequenced. ADAR1 cDNA was reverse-transcribed using the hADAR1 8 reverse specific primer, hADAR1 8 reverse, 5′-CACTGGAGCATACATTACTGGG-3′. For the PCR of the ADAR1, the following primers were used: hADAR1 4 forward, 5′-CCTGTGAGTTCAACATGATAGAGC-3′; hADAR1 5 forward, 5′-GATAACTTGGAATCCATGATGCCC-3′; hADAR1 8, reverse, 5′-CACTGGAGCATACATTACTGGG-3′. ADAR2 cDNA was reverse-transcribed with hADAR2 7 reverse, 5′-ATGTCTGCCCGGGTCAGGGCG-3′. For the ADAR2, the following primers were used: hADAR2 2 forward, 5′-GTATTTTGCCATGGATATAGAAGATG-3′; hADAR2 4, forward 5′-GGGAGAGCCATGCCAAGAGCTTC-3′; hADAR2 6 reverse, 5′-TCAGGGCGTGAGTGAGAACTGGTCC-3′.Analysis of ADAR Expression—Quantitative Real-time PCR was performed on all ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3 mRNAs. Gene-specific exon-exon boundary PCR products (TaqMan gene expression assays, Applied Biosystems) were measured by means of a PE Applied Biosystems PRISM 7700 sequence detection system during 40 cycles. β-actin RNA or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA were used for normalization, and relative quantification of gene expression was performed according to the 2-ΔΔCt method (35PE Applied Biosystems ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System, User Bulletin Number 2, Relative Quantification of Gene Expression. PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA1997Google Scholar). Real-time assays were repeated in triplicates from two independent RTs. The primers used were supplied by Applied Biosystems: ADAR1, all isoforms, identification number (ID) Hs00241666_m1 spanning exons 2-3 boundary (NM_ 001025107.1); ADAR1 p150 ID Hs01020780_m1, exons 1A-2 (NM_001111.3); ADAR2, ID Hs00953730_m1, exons 5-6 (NM_ 001112.2); ADAR3, ID Hs01024866_m1, exons 9-10 (NM_018702.1); β-actin, ID Hs99999903_m1; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ID Hs9999905_m1.Competition Experiments—∼7 × 105 HEK 293T cells at 60% confluence were co-transfected with constant amounts of the GluR-B miniB13 (3 μg) and of EGFP-ADAR2 (8 μg) so that 50% editing of the Gln/Arg site was obtained, and an increasing amount of EGFP-ADAR1 (4, 8, 16, and 24 μg). pEGFP (V-EGFP) was also transfected so that the total concentration of exogenous DNA transfected was equal (total DNA transfected at each experimental point was 35 μg). After 24 h, the cells were collected, and cDNA was analyzed for RNA editing. The transfection was tested by real-time PCR and Western blot.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Total protein extracts from both wild type astrocytoma cell lines (U118 and A172) and those stably transfected were isolated with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Total proteins were extracted from frozen tumor samples by homogenizing the tissues in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8) in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (22Nie Y. Ding L. Kao P.N. Braun R. Yang J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6956-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Antibodies—The antibodies used in this study were: anti-ADAR1 (monoclonal antibody 15.8.6, kind gift of K. Nishikura), anti ADAR2 (kind gift of M. Ohman), anti-EGFP (Clontech), and anti-tubulin α (Abcam). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The polyclonal antibodies raised against ADAR1 were produced in our laboratory in rabbit using a full-length 110-kDa ADAR1 protein glutathione S-transferase-tagged and overexpressed in Escherichia coli.Deletion Analysis of ADAR1 in Astrocytomas and Astrocytoma Cell Lines—Deletion analysis of ADAR1 exon 2 was performed on total RNA treated with DNase and on genomic DNA (DNA Qiagen kit) from cell lines and tissues, and the primers used were: ADAR1 exon 2 reverse, 5′-AGTCCCAAGTTTCCCAGACAGATC-3′; ADAR1 exon 2 forward 5′-AATAGAATTTCTCAAGGGGCAGCTC-3′.RESULTSDecreased RNA Editing in Pediatric Astrocytomas—RNA editing analysis was performed on both GluR-B and GluR-6 substrates in pediatric astrocytomas and controls. Although the GluR-B Gln/Arg site is always edited at 100%, the RNA editing of other sites varies with age and in different regions of the brain (23Paupard M.C. O'Connell M.A. Gerber A.P. Zukin R.S. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 869-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested patients with a limited age range (Table 1), and results were compared from each tumor tissue with the normal tissue dissected from the same area of the brain. Each tissue sample was identified with an ID (Table 1). Importantly, levels of editing among normal control tissues varied dependent upon which area of the brain they were dissected from (see differences in editing in control tissues in Table 1, highlighted in bold and underlining). We found 100% editing at the Gln/Arg site of the GluR-B transcript in controls and in low grade astrocytomas. Among the high grade tumors, four out of six showed a mild decrease in editing activity at this site (Table 1). The RNA editing of the GluR-B transcript at the Arg/Gly site and of the GluR-6 transcript at the Ile/Val, Tyr/Cys, and Gln/Arg sites varied among different regions of the brain, as expected from observations in mice (24Bernard A. Ferhat L. Dessi F. Charton G. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Khrestchatisky M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The percentage of editing at all the sites analyzed was lower in astrocytomas when compared with the corresponding normal control tissue.The relationship between grade of malignancy and percentage of editing at the GluR-B Arg/Gly site and at the GluR-6 Ile/Val, Tyr/Cys, Gln/Arg sites was evaluated with a regression analysis. For this analysis, RNA editing in pediatric tumors was expressed as a percentage of the editing in the corresponding normal control tissue. The decrease in RNA editing was correlated with the grade of malignancy of the tumors (R2 values ranging from 0.457 to 0.714 at the four editing sites), with the high grade tumors showing lower editing (Fig. 1).Extra Copies of ADAR2 Enzyme Restores RNA Editing in Astrocytoma Cell Lines—Since GluR-6 and GluR-B transcripts are mainly edited by ADAR2 (16Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 25Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), the decrease in RNA editing at these sites suggests an alteration in ADAR2 activity in pediatric astrocytomas. To investigate whether the loss of ADAR2 editing activity played a role in astrocytomas, we reverted the RNA editing status in three astrocytoma cell lines (U118, A172, and U87) by ADAR2 overexpression. Astrocytoma cell lines showed an undetectable or very low level of RNA editing, similar to the supratentorial high grade tumors at all the editing sites in both GluR-B and GluR-6 transcripts (see below and data not shown), including the Gln/Arg site of the GluR-B (Fig. 2B). Polyclonal cell lines stably transfected with ADAR2 fused with EGFP at the amino terminus were generated in U118, A172, and U87. As a control, EGFP was also transfected, and stable polyclonal cell lines were generated. Here we show results for the U118 cell line (Fig. 2), but similar results were also obtained with A172 and U87 transfected cell lines (see supplemental Fig. 1). The transfected EGFP-ADAR2 was analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis in all the three cell lines. The exogenous ADAR2 did not alter the expression of the other ADARs (Fig. 2A). The EGFP-ADAR2 fused protein was also analyzed using fluorescence microscopy, and the correct nucleolar localization of the EGFP-ADAR2 (26Desterro J.M. Keegan L.P. Lafarga M. Berciano M.T. O'Connell M. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1805-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was observed (Fig. 2C, panels V and VI). EGFP-ADAR2 enzymatic activity was determined by direct sequencing on cDNA pools of the endogenous GluR-B and GluR-6 substrates. No random/nonspecific editing was found in these transcripts due to ADAR2 overexpression. However, the overexpression of the EGFP-ADAR2 restored the RNA editing at all the specific editing sites in both GluR-B and GluR-6. In particular, the EGFP-ADAR2 fully restored the editing level at the GluR-B Gln/Arg site (100%) (Fig. 2B) and increased the editing level at the GluR-B Arg/Gly site (to ∼70%), at the GluR-6 Gln/Arg site (to ∼75%), at the GluR-6 Tyr/Cys site (to ∼90%), and at the GluR-6 Ile/Val site (to ∼40%), as analyzed by direct sequencing on cDNA pools. The editing levels observed in cells transfected with EGFP-ADAR2 were similar to the editing observed in control tissues dissected from the temporal lobe (Table 1) and demonstrates that the overexpressed EGFP-ADAR2 is active on endogenous substrates.FIGURE 2Overexpression of ADAR2 in astrocytoma cell line.

B, sequence chromatograms of the endogenous GluR-B transcript in cell lines U118 and U118 stably transfected with EGFP and EGFP-ADAR2. An arrow indicates the Gln/Arg editing position. C, cell morphology changes after transfection with EGFP-ADAR2 (panel IV) when compared with the control (panel I). In particular, in panel I, we showed the shape of control astrocytoma cell line U118 EGFP, in panel II, we showed the diffuse distribution of the EGFP protein, and in panel III, we showed the merge image. In panel IV, we showed the shape of U118-EGFP-ADAR2 cell line, in panel V, we showed EGFP-ADAR2 specifically localized within the nucleolus, and in panel VI, we showed the merge image. Cultured cells were directly analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted microscope, at ×400 magnification. D, cell proliferation was analyzed by measuring live cells for 4 days after seeding.

The EGFP-ADAR2 cell line, but not the control cell lines (untransfected and EGFP only), displayed a strong inhibition in cell proliferation (Fig. 2D). This difference was evident 48 h after seeding, and it was even more dramatic after 4 days, with >50% decrease in cell number (Fig. 2D). Similar results were observed using the A172 and U87 astrocytoma cell lines (supplemental Fig. 1A). Next, we studied the cell cycle to elucidate the differences in growth rate between ADAR2-overexpressing cell lines and controls. Flow cytometry analysis in the presence of propidium iodide was performed, and we found that cells overexpressing ADAR2 showed a different cell cycle profile when compared with the controls in astrocytoma cell lines U118, A172 (Fig. 3A), and U87 (supplemental Fig. 1C). In particular, a larger cell population was observed at the S/G2-phase, when ADAR2 was overexpressed, and this correlated with a decrease in the cell population at the G1-phase (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Effects of the overexpression of ADAR2 on cell cycle and cell migration. A, cell cycle analysis was performed with 1 × 106 cells using a FACSCalibur™. Untransfected A172 and U118 cell lines as well as polyclonal cells stably transfected with EGFP and EGFP-ADAR2 are shown. Cell cycle profiles of A172 cell lines are shown. A172 and U118 cell lines were counted and expressed as percentages. B, the motile activity assay was performed four times in triplicates and at different cell concentrations (5 × 104 and 1 × 105). The assay performed at 5 × 104 cell concentration is shown here.

Here we test the possibility that the precise spatial positioning of focal adhesions governs the direction in which cells spread and move. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured on circular or linear ECM islands, which were created using a microcontact printing technique and were 1 microm wide and of various lengths (1 to 8 microm) and separated by 1 to 4.5 microm wide nonadhesive barrier regions. Cells could be driven proactively to spread and move in particular directions by altering either the interisland spacing or the shape of similar-sized ECM islands. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that focal adhesions assembled preferentially above the ECM islands, with the greatest staining intensity being observed at adhesion sites along the cell periphery. Rac-FRET analysis of living cells revealed that Rac became activated within 2 min after peripheral membrane extensions adhered to new ECM islands, and this activation wave propagated outward in an oriented manner as the cells spread from island to island. A computational model, which incorporates that cells preferentially protrude membrane processes from regions near newly formed focal adhesion contacts, could predict with high accuracy the effects of six different arrangements of micropatterned ECM islands on directional cell spreading. Taken together, these results suggest that physical properties of the ECM may influence directional cell movement by dictating where cells will form new focal adhesions and activate Rac and, hence, govern where new membrane protrusions will form."

In this report, we compared the ability of the six human anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members to suppress apoptosis induced by overexpression of Bax or Bak, correlating findings with protein interactions measured by three different methods: co-immunoprecipitation, glutathione S-transferase pulldown, and fluorescence polarization assays employing synthetic BH3 peptides from Bax and Bak. Bcl-B and Mcl-1 showed strong preferences for binding to and suppression of Bax and Bak, respectively. In contrast, the other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, and Bfl-1) suppressed apoptosis induced by overexpression of either Bax or Bak, and they displayed an ability to bind both Bax and Bak by at least one of the three protein interaction methods. Interestingly, however, full-length Bax and Bak proteins and synthetic Bax and Bak BH3 peptides exhibited discernible differences in their interactions with some anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, cautioning against reliance on a single method for detecting protein interactions of functional significance.

Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of mitochondrial-related apoptosis pathways and function to either promote or suppress mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, thereby providing a checkpoint for the release into the cytosol of mitochondrial proteins responsible for downstream apoptotic mechanisms (3Reed J.C.

To date, six human anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins have been reported, including Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, Bcl-W, Bcl-B, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1 (6Reed J.C. Doctor K.S. Godzik A. Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: re9PubMed Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are divided into two groups, the BH3-only and multidomain groups. The BH3-only proteins usually act as initial apoptosis signal sensors. More than 12 BH3-only proteins have been reported (e.g. Bid, Bad, Bim, Noxa, and Puma), and they convey different stress signals to the core cell death machinery (7Huang D.C. Strasser A.

The multidomain Bcl-2 family proteins (Bax, Bak, and perhaps Bok) contain BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains and function to promote mitochondrial leakage if not suppressed by the binding of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (11Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins may nullify the function of the BH3-only proteins by binding and inhibiting the downstream interactions of BH3-only proteins with Bax and Bak (4Reed J.C.

Experiments with Bax/Bak double knock-out mice showed that Bax and Bak are downstream checkpoint proteins that are capable of regulating the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane (11Wei M.C.

Interactions between anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and Bax or Bak, therefore, constitute a final step in determining mitochondria-induced cell death. Thus, it is of interest to elucidate the functional and physical interactions among anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family with Bax and Bak. For this reason, we tested the ability of all six human anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to suppress apoptosis induced by Bax or Bak and correlated these results with protein binding, using immunoprecipitation (IP), GST pulldown, and fluorescence polarization assays (FPAs). Of the six anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-B and Mcl-1 showed clear preferences for binding to and suppressing apoptosis induced by Bax and Bak, respectively, whereas the other family members (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and Bcl-W) were far less selective. Thus, Bcl-B and Mcl-1 stand apart from the other anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, suggesting that these proteins have specific roles in the suppression of cell death pathways that predominantly involve Bax or Bak, respectively. Plasmid Constructions—Plasmids encoding Myc-tagged, anti-apoptotic human Bcl-2 family proteins were cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3-Myc vector as previously reported (12Luciano F.

Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) Assays—HEK293T cells were cultured in 6-well plates and were transiently transfected with 1 μg of GFP control plasmid and 1 μg of plasmids encoding GFP-Bax or -Bak, together with 1 μg of pcDNA3-Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, Bcl-W, Bcl-B, Bfl-1, or Mcl-1. The cells were cultured for 20 h in 50 μm benzoyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Bachem) to avoid apoptosis and then suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 142.4 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2% CHAPS containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The cell lysates were subjected to IP using anti-Myc-coated beads incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal anti-GFP and -Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Protein Purification—The Bax and Bak proteins were produced in bacteria and purified similar to a previous report (14Zhai D. Luciano F. Zhu X. Guo B. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, the cells were grown in 2 liters of LB media with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 1.0 followed by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) and incubated at 25 °C for 6 h. The cells were then recovered in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA followed by sonication. The cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 27,500 × g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatants were incubated with 10 ml of glutathionine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed three times with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, followed by elution of GST fusion proteins in 10 mm of reduced glutathione dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). GST Pulldown Assays—GST or GST-Bcl-XL, -Bcl-2, -Bcl-W, -Bcl-B, -Bfl-1, or -Mcl-1 (1 μg each) were preincubated separately with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin for 2 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 142.4 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 2% CHAPS. The resins were washed once in lysis buffer, followed by the addition of 1 μg of purified Bax or Bak protein. The reactions were performed in 500 μl of lysis buffer with overnight incubation at 4 °C. The resins were washed with lysis buffer three times, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using GST (mouse monoclonal antibody made in our laboratory), Bax (N20; Santa Cruz), or Bak (06-536; Upstate) antibodies. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Apoptosis Assays—HEK293T and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 m l-glutamine, and antibiotics. For transient transfection apoptosis assays, the cells at ∼80% confluence (5 × 105) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates with 0.5 μg of plasmids encoding GFP or 3 μg of pcDNA3 Bcl-2, or GFP-Bax, GFP-Bak, alone, or in combination with 1, 2, or 3 μg of either pcDNA3-Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, Bcl-W, Bcl-B, Bfl-1, or Mcl-1. Apoptosis was assessed by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of cells. Briefly, at 20 h after transfection, both floating and adherent cells were collected, fixed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3.7% formaldehyde, and stained with DAPI in phosphate-buffered saline. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by UV microscopy, counting GFP-positive cells that displayed nuclear fragmentation and/or chromatin condensation. All of the assays were performed in triplicate. For caspase assays, cell lysates were prepared 20 h post-transfection and normalized for protein content, and 10-μg aliquots of cell lysates were incubated with 100 μm DEVD-AFC, measuring enzyme activity by the generation of AFC fluorescence. The data are reported as relative fluorescence units of product produced per minute/10 μg of total protein. Peptide Synthesis—Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated or nonlabeled Bax and Bak BH3 peptides and FITC-Bim BH3 peptide were synthesized on an Advanced Chem Tech 350 multiple peptide synthesizer (Aapptec, Louisville, KY) using 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (DIC/HOBt) as coupling reagent for Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase peptide synthesis. The amino acid sequences of the BH3 peptides were: Bax, QDASTKKLSECLKRIGDELDS; Bak, PSSTMGQVGRQLAIIGDDINRRYDS; and Bim, DMRPEIWIAQELRRIGDEFNAYYAR. The crude peptides were purified with a Gilson HPLC instrument, with detection at 210 nm. Analytical reverse phase HPLC was routinely performed on a Vydac 218TP54 or 238TP54 column (C18, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) over 20 min (0–100% B). Preparative reverse phase HPLC was performed on a Cosmosil column (5C18-AR, 20 × 250 mm) at a flow rate of 8 ml/min using a gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 90% acetonitrile. The purified peptide was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using an Applied Biosystems Voyager System 6264 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Fluorescence Polarization Assays—FPAs were performed according to published procedures (13Zhai D. Ke N. Zhang H. Ladror U. Joseph M. Eichinger A. Godzik A. Ng S.C. Reed J.C. Biochem.

Briefly, various concentrations of GST-Bcl-2 family proteins were incubated with 10–15 nm of FITC-conjugated Bax BH3 peptide (FITC-Ahx-QDASTKKLSECLKRIGDELDS), FITC-Bak BH3 peptide (FITC-Ahx-PSSTMGQVGRQLAIIGDDINRRYDS), or FITC-Bim BH3 peptide (FITC-Ahx-DMRPEIWIAQELRRIGDEFNAYYAR). Fluorescence polarization was measured using an AnalystTM AD assay detection system (LJL Biosystem, Sunnyvale, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) after incubating for 10 min in a 96-well black plate (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC). EC50 determinations were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, Inc., San Diego, CA). Competition Assays—Using the same procedure described above, 100 nm of GST-Bcl-2 family proteins were incubated with various concentrations of unlabeled Bax and Bak BH3 peptides, followed by 15 nm of FITC-Bax, 10 nm of FITC-Bak, or 15 nm of FITC-Bim. Fluorescence polarization was measured after 10 min as described above. IC50 determinations were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, Inc.). Selective Association of Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 Family Proteins with Bax and Bak—We previously showed that human anti-apoptotic Bcl-B protein binds and regulates Bax- but not Bak-induced cell death (13Zhai D.

In this report, we further extend the studies to all six human anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, Bcl-W, Bcl-B, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1. To explore the binding of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to Bax and Bak, co-IP assays were performed following transient transfection of HEK293T cells. For these experiments, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins were expressed with N-terminal Myc epitope tags, whereas Bax and Bak were expressed with N-terminal GFP tags. CHAPS-containing lysis solution was used, because of reports that this nonionic detergent better preserves natural conformations of Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bax (18Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). co-IP experiments showed that Bax binds to Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, Bcl-W, and Bcl-B, but not Mcl-1. In contrast, binding of Bak was detected by co-IP to only Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 (Fig. 1). The results regarding the ability of Bfl-1 to bind Bax or Bak were unclear because of its low expression level in these experiments. The detected interactions between the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and GFP-Bax or -Bak proteins were specific, in as much as no nonspecific association of GFP was observed with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Fig. 1). Immunoblot analysis of GFP, GFP-Bax, and GFP-Bak served as a loading control. Because use of cellular lysates for co-IP experiments cannot exclude the possibility of involvement of indirect partners in the observed protein associations, we further investigated the interaction of Bcl-2 family proteins with Bax and Bak using recombinant purified proteins in vitro. All six anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins were expressed as N-terminal GST fusion proteins without their C-terminal transmembrane domains (∼20 amino acids). GST pulldown results were similar to IP findings in that Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, Bcl-W, and Bcl-B associated with Bax. We also confirmed that recombinant Bfl-1 can bind to Bax, which was not evident from the IP experiments because of poor expression (Fig. 2A). The results from GST pulldown assays for Bak correlated with IP results, with only Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 demonstrating associations with Bak (Fig. 2B). GST alone demonstrated only background binding to Bax or Bak, indicating the specificity of the binding results. Differential Protection of Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 Family Proteins against Cell Death Induced by Bax or Bak—To correlate protein interaction data with anti-apoptotic function, we tested the ability of the six anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to suppress apoptosis induced by Bax and Bak overexpression. When plasmids encoding Bax and Bak were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells, roughly 90% of the transfected cells (marked by GFP) underwent apoptosis within 20 h, as determined by DAPI staining. Co-expression of Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, Bcl-B, and Bfl-1, but not Mcl-1, markedly suppressed apoptosis induced by Bax in HEK293T cells, as shown by DAPI staining and caspase activity assays (Fig. 3, A and C). For Bak, co-expression of Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1 demonstrated protection from Bak-mediated apoptosis, whereas Bcl-B did not (Fig. 3, B and D). The relatively high quantity of Bcl-2 plasmid used in these experiments (ranging from 1 to 3 μg) resulted in significant background cell death. When the quantity of Bcl-2 plasmid was reduced (ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 μg), co-expression of Bcl-2 with Bax or Bak displayed impressive protection in HEK293T and HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Protection by Bcl-2 against Bax- and Bak-induced cell death. HEK293T (A) or HeLa (B) cells were transfected at ∼80% confluence in 12-well dishes with 0.2 μg of plasmids encoding GFP or 0.5 μg of pc DNA3-Bcl-2 plus 0.2 μg of plasmids encoding GFP (control) or 0.1 μg of GFP-Bax, GFP-Bak, alone or in combination with 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5μg of pcDNA3-Bcl-2. For apoptosis assays, floating and adherent cells were collected, fixed, and stained with 0.1 μg/ml DAPI.

However, unexpected outcomes occurred regarding the ability of Bcl-2, Bcl-W, and Bfl-1 to protect from Bak-mediated cell death, given that no binding of these proteins to Bak was observed in IP or GST pulldown experiments. To address this discrepancy, FPAs were carried out to elucidate the binding of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to Bax and Bak BH3 peptides. FPAs were performed using recombinant purified anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and FITC-conjugated Bax or Bak BH3 peptides as previously reported (13Zhai D. Ke N. Zhang H. Ladror U. Joseph M. Eichinger A. Godzik A. Ng S.C. Reed J.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Zhai D. Jin C. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1419-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Our FPA results showed that for Bax BH3 peptide, the rank order of binding affinities were Bcl-B > Bfl-1/Bcl-2/Bcl-XL > Mcl/Bcl-2. Bcl-B had an apparent EC50 for Bax BH3 of 40 nm, whereas Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 showed only background binding, similar to GST alone. For Bak, the rank order of binding affinities was Bcl-XL/Mcl-1 > Bfl-1/Bcl-2/Bcl-2 > Bcl-B. Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 bound the best, with apparent EC50 of ∼20 nm, followed by moderate binding of Bak to Bfl-1, Bcl-W, and Bcl-2, with affinities of ∼100 nm. No binding of Bak BH3 peptide was observed for Bcl-B. GST control protein showed only background binding to Bax and Bak peptides in these assays (Fig. 5). Unlabeled Bax and Bak BH3 peptides were used to compete with binding of FITC-Bax and FITC-Bak BH3 peptides to assess the specificity of the binding results obtained by FPA. Unlabeled Bax BH3 peptide competed effectively with FITC-Bax peptide for binding Bcl-B and unlabeled Bak BH3 peptide competed with FITC-Bak BH3 peptide for binding to Mcl-1 (Fig. 6). These data thus confirm competitive binding that was suppressed by unlabeled peptide to nearly the background level observed with FITC-Bax peptide alone (i.e. no Bcl-2 family proteins), with IC50 values in the range of 1–10 μm. We then extended these peptide competition studies, taking advantage of the ability of FITC-Bim BH3 peptide to bind all six anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins with high affinity (9Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J. Fletcher J.I. Hinds M.G. Colman P.M. Day C.L. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). The inhibitory concentrations of unlabeled Bax and Bak required to suppress FITC-Bim-peptide binding by 50% (IC50) were calculated for each protein (Table 1). In these assays where FITC-Bim binding to Bcl-B was measured, unlabeled Bax BH3 peptide effectively competed, whereas significant inhibition was not observed with unlabeled Bak BH3 peptide. Conversely, in FPAs with Mcl-1, binding of FITC-Bim was effectively suppressed with unlabeled Bak BH3 peptide, whereas unlabeled Bax BH3 peptide was >15-fold less effective (Table 1). Thus, these peptide competition studies corroborate the direct FITC-BH3 peptide binding results and confirm that Bcl-B and Mcl-1 have strong preferences for Bax BH3 and Bak BH3, respectively. Interestingly, both unlabeled Bax and Bak BH3 peptides were effective in competing FITC-Bim peptide from Bcl-2 (Table 1), providing evidence that both Bax and Bak BH3 peptides are capable of competing for occupancy of the cleft on Bcl-2 where BH3 peptides bind. Although varying from the results obtained by direct binding of FITC-conjugated BH3 peptides, these FPA competition results are in agreement with the observation that Bcl-2 suppresses apoptosis induced by overexpression of either Bax or Bak.TABLE 1FPA data summaryProteinBinding EC50Competition IC50F-BaxF-BakBaxBaknmμmBcl-XL45.420.913.21.5Bcl-2>1000119.510.410.7Bcl-W24.7101.97.82.8Bcl-B40.1>100015.8>50Bfl-117.345.52.37.1Mcl-1>100022.532.91.8GST>1000>1000 Open table in a new tab Several studies have been performed regarding the relationship between BH3-only proteins and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (8Letai A.

However, little is known regarding the mechanisms by which the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins regulate the activity of the downstream multidomain family members, Bax and Bak. In this report, we examined the relationship between the heterotypic interactions of Bax and Bak with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and correlate the protein interaction data with their abilities to prevent Bax- and Bak-induced cell death. We observed that Bcl-B and Mcl-1 stand apart from the other anti-apoptotic human Bcl-2 family proteins in their differential binding to and suppression of the apoptotic activity of Bax and Bak, respectively. Unlike Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, and Bfl-1, which suppressed apoptosis induced by either Bax or Bak and which demonstrated physical interactions with both Bax and Bak by at least one of the three protein interaction methods employed, Bcl-B and Mcl-1 showed strong preferences for binding to and suppressing Bax and Bak, respectively. IP and GST pulldown experiments are widely used to detect interactions between proteins, including the Bcl-2 family proteins. In our studies, we observed that Bax bound five of six anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (all except Mcl-1) as assessed by IP and GST pulldown binding assays. Similarly, we found that Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, Bfl-1, and Bcl-B could all suppress Bax-induced apoptosis, whereas Mcl-1 did not. Thus, for Bax, binding data based on co-IP and GST pulldown correlated nicely with cell death induced by overexpression of Bax. In contrast, by FPA, no direct interaction was observed between the FITC-conjugated BH3 peptide of Bax and the Bcl-2 protein. However, in BH3 peptide competition experiments, unlabeled Bax BH3 peptide effectively competed with FITC-Bim BH3 peptide for binding to Bcl-2, suggesting that the BH3 peptide of Bax is competent to bind Bcl-2. For Bak, five of the six Bcl-2 family members (all but Bcl-B) suppressed apoptosis induced by Bak overexpression, and these same five family members displayed interactions with the BH3 peptide of Bak by FPA. In contrast, only two of these anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-XL; Mcl-1) demonstrated interactions with full-length protein by co-IP and GST pulldown assays. Thus, FPA data were more indicative of functional interactions for Bak than co-IP or GST pulldown. Note that our IP and GST pulldown results concerning the interactions of Bcl-2 family proteins with Bak are nearly identical to those recently published (20Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) in that only Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 displayed detectable associations with Bak. Thus, these results are independently verifiable. Interestingly, the cytoprotection observed with the three Bcl-2 family proteins that demonstrated interactions only by FPA (Bcl-2, Bfl-1, Bcl-W) was comparable with that observed with the two proteins that demonstrated strong binding to Bak in IP and GST pulldown assays (Bcl-XL and Mcl-1), thus showing that FPA and cytoprotection data nicely correlate for Bak. Several factors could contribute to the differential protein interaction results obtained by various methods (co-IP, GST pulldown, and FPA). Foremost among them is protein conformation. Bcl-2 family proteins are known to assume different conformational states that impact their ability to form homo- or hetero-dimers or oligomers in solution and in association with intracellular membranes. For example, the BH3 domains of Bax and Bak are known to mediate their physical interactions with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. The BH3 domains are comprised of amphipathic α-helices that bind primarily via their hydrophobic face to a hydrophobic pocket on anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (21Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). To expose the hydrophobic surface of the BH3 peptide, Bax and Bak presumably must undergo profound conformational changes, given that the three-dimensional structure of the full-length Bax protein shows the BH3 domain rotated so that the hydrophobic surface is buried (22Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). In FPAs, the isolated BH3 peptide is used, thus obviating the influence of conformational differences in Bax or Bak for purposes of detecting potential interactions partners among the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. With co-IP and GST pulldown experiments, in contrast, full-length Bax and Bak proteins were used. Presumably at least some of the Bax and Bak expressed by transfection in cells is in the active conformation, given that these proteins displayed interactions with selected anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. In this regard, we used CHAPS detergent for our protein interaction studies because of indications that it preserves the endogenous conformation of Bax. Thus, it should be considered that use of harsher detergents such as SDS might have forced more Bax and Bak into active conformations and thereby might have revealed additional protein interactions not detected here. At least for cell death induced by overexpression of Bak, FPA data correlate far better than co-IP or GST pulldown assays with the cellular function of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in terms of their ability to antagonize Bak. In the case of Bax-induced apoptosis, co-IP and GST pulldown data correlated well with functional antagonism by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. In fact, FPA data were less reliable indicators of function for Bax, in that recombinant Bcl-2 protein displayed little interaction with synthetic Bax BH3 peptide, yet Bcl-2 suppressed apoptosis induced by Bax overexpression. This observation implies that the mechanism by which Bcl-2 suppresses Bax in cells may differ from other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Bcl-2, for example, could bind and titrate out upstream activators of Bax (such as Bid and Bim), or interact with Bax in membranes of mitochondria to prevent Bax oligomerization, yet not bind Bax BH3 peptides in solution. Although it is also possible that the GST fusion version of Bcl-2 used here for FPAs is artificially impaired in its ability to bind Bax BH3 peptides, this recombinant protein displays high affinity interactions with several other BH3 peptides, including Bid and Bim, with EC50 ≅ 10–80 nm (Ref. 16Zhai D. Jin C. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1419-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar and data not shown). In this regard, the ability of some anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to form dimers in solution could theoretically impact binding to BH3 peptides but still seems an inadequate explanation for differential binding of Bax and Bak. Of course, it is possible that the conformation of the synthetic Bax BH3 peptide differs from the conformation of the BH3 domain in the context of the full-length Bax protein, but the isolated Bax BH3 peptide nevertheless bound to several anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins with high affinity. Of note, although FITC-conjugated Bax BH3 peptide failed to bind Bcl-2, unconjugated Bax peptide effectively competed with another FITC-BH3 peptide (pig Bim) for binding to Bcl-2, thus implying that the addition of the FITC moiety may have uniquely impacted binding to Bcl-2 but not other members of the Bcl-2 family. Altogether, the correlations of anti-apoptotic function with protein interaction data reported here argue that reliance on any one method for assessing interactions of Bax and Bak with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins can be limiting and suggest that several methods should be compared before drawing firm conclusions. This therefore sets Bax and Bak apart from the BH3-only branch of the Bcl-2 family, where binding and function appear to be readily correlated by a variety of standard methods (reviewed in Refs. 23Labi V. Erlacher M. Kiessling S. Villunger A. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1325-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar and 24Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 stands apart from the other five anti-apoptotic human Bcl-2 family proteins in its propensity to induce apoptosis when overexpressed by transfection. As shown here, studies of the function of Bcl-2 as an anti-apoptotic protein required that we reduce plasmid concentrations by ∼10-fold relative to Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, Bcl-W, Bfl-1, and Bcl-B to avoid apoptosis induction. Bcl-2 has been shown to display pro-apoptotic phenotypes under certain conditions. For example, upon interaction with the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77/TR3, Bcl-2 undergoes conformational changes that exposes its BH3 domain, making it analogous to pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (25Lin B. Kolluri S.K. Lin F. Liu W. Han Y.H. Cao X. Dawson M.I. Reed J.C. Zhang X.K. Cell. 2004; 116: 527-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). We presume that excessive overexpression of Bcl-2 favors pro-apoptotic conformations of this protein. It remains to be determined whether different conformational states of Bcl-2 impacted the interaction data obtained here for Bax and Bak full-length proteins and for Bax and Bak BH3 peptides, as measured by co-IP, GST pulldown, and FPA. In summary, we show that Bax and Bak differ in their physical and functional interactions with the six human anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. The greatest differences in cellular and biochemical behavior were seen for Bcl-B and Mcl-1. Bcl-B bound Bax but not Bak by all methods tested (co-IP, GST pulldown, and FPA), and Bcl-B suppressed apoptosis induced by overexpression of Bax but not Bak. Conversely, Mcl-1 bound Bak but not Bax by all methods tested, and Mcl-1 suppressed apoptosis induced by overexpression of Bak but not Bax. In contrast, setting aside quantitative differences in relative affinities, at a qualitative level, the other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, and Bfl-1) demonstrated interactions with both Bax and Bak by at least one method, and they all demonstrated an ability to suppress apoptosis induced by overexpression of either Bax or Bak. These findings thus suggest strong preferences of Bcl-B and Mcl-1 for Bax and Bak, respectively, and should help to stimulate further investigations of the relationships of the endogenous Bcl-B and Mcl-1 proteins in the context of cell death programs that are dependent on either Bax or Bak.

Laminins are heterotrimeric proteins composed of α, β, and γ chains that are essential components of all basement membranes.

This cleavage is thought to expose a cryptic site on the α3 chain that is promigratory for breast epithelial cells (13Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 80-kDa γ2x form has been associated with tissues undergoing remodeling, whereas full-length γ2 is found in quiescent tissues (13Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O.

Other MMPs, including MMP-3, -12, -13, -14, -19, and -20, have also been shown to cleave the γ2 chain, generating the γ2x fragment, inducing epithelial cell migration (15Koshikawa N. Giannelli G.

In addition to this cleavage site near the coiled-coil region, MMP-14 cleaves the short arm of the γ2 chain at an additional site (15Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 19Koshikawa N. Minegishi T. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 88-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), releasing an ∼20-kDa D3 domain fragment containing three EGF repeats. Cleavage at this site alone by MMP-14 without removal of the D3 domain generates a 100-kDa fragment still bound to the α3 and β3 subunits known as γ2′. BMP-1, the enzyme that processes the C terminus of type I procollagen, also has also been shown to cleave near the N-terminal side of the D3 domain in the γ2 chain (20Amano S. Scott I.C. Takahara K. Koch M. Champliaud M.F. Gerecke D.R. Keene D.R. Hudson D.L. Nishiyama T. Lee S. Greenspan D.S. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22728-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A recombinant D3 fragment has been shown to bind the EGF receptor, stimulating activation of MAPK and cell migration (14Schenk S. Hintermann E. Bilban M. Koshikawa N. Hojilla C. Khokha R. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the serine protease neutrophil elastase (NE) cleaves all three chains of laminin-332 and generates a γ2 fragment similar in size to the γ2x fragment generated by MMPs. The similarity between the digestion patterns of laminin-332 induced by degranulated neutrophil supernatant and with NE alone, the ability of an inhibitor of NE to block these digestions, and the lack of laminin-332 digestion by NE-deficient neutrophil supernatants collectively suggest that NE is the major enzyme in neutrophils capable of digesting laminin-332. In addition, laminin γ2 fragments were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent inducer of neutrophil inflammation, but the fragmentation pattern of the γ2 chain is different in NE-deficient mice, suggesting a role of NE in the digestion of laminin-332 in vivo. A peptide containing the MMP-2 cleavage site in the γ2 chain is cleaved by NE at the same location as MMP-2, suggesting that NE cleavage of laminin-332 may also result in the generation of promigratory fragments. Digestion of purified laminin-332 with NE produces fragments that are chemotactic for neutrophils, in contrast to the intact trimer, revealing a new activity for cryptic sites in laminin-332 in addition to effects on epithelial cell migration. Reagents—Rat laminin-332 was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Mouse laminin-111 and human laminin-511 were purchased from Sigma. Human MMP-2, -8, -9, and -12 were purchased from R & D Systems. Human NE, proteinase-3 (PR3), and cathepsin G (CG) were purchased from Elastin Products Co. (Owensville, MO). Mouse Strains—Six- to eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Taconic Farms (Hudson, NY). NE-deficient mice (21Belaaouaj A. McCarthy R. Baumann M. Gao Z. Ley T.J. Abraham S.N. Shapiro S.D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. C. Pham (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Mice were housed in a barrier facility under the veterinary care of the Department of Comparative Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine. All procedures involving mice were approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Animal Studies Committee and were performed in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Cleavage of Laminin-332—Purified laminin-332 (100 ng) was digested at protease concentrations ranging from 15 pm to 50 nm in 15 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 6 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 13.3 μl. Prior to digestion, MMP-2, -8, and -9 were activated with 1 mm aminophenylmercuric acetate (1, 2, and 8 h, respectively) at 37 °C. MMP-12 was auto-activated by incubation at 37 °C for 12 h. Activation was confirmed prior to incubation with laminin-332 (data not shown). Digestion products of laminin-332 were separated on 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and analyzed by silver staining or immunoblotting. Digestions of laminin-111 and laminin-511 were performed similarly using 1500 and 250 ng, respectively, of purified laminin. Immunoblotting Analysis—Laminin digestion products were analyzed by immunoblotting using laminin chain-specific antibodies after proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore) and the membranes blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Monoclonal antibodies against the α3 (CM6) and β3 (FM3) chains were gifts from Dr. G. Plopper (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) (22Plopper G. Falk-Marzillier J. Glaser S. Fitchmun M. Giannelli G. Romano T. Jones J.C. Quaranta V. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1965-1973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were used at a 1:6000 dilution. A polyclonal antibody against the γ2 chain was a gift from Dr. G. Meneguzzi (INSERM U634, France) (23Spirito F. Chavanas S. Prost-Squarcioni C. Pulkkinen L. Fraitag S. Bodemer C. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J. Biol.

To detect laminin-111 chains, monoclonal antibodies to the human β1 (Chemicon, catalog number 1920) and γ1 chains (Chemicon, catalog number 1921) were used at 1:5000. A polyclonal antibody (8B3) against the α1 chain was a gift from Dr. D. Abrahamson (University of Kansas Medical Center) (24Abrahamson D.R. Prettyman A.C. Robert B. St. John P.L. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 826-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and was used at 1:5000. A monoclonal antibody against the human α5 chain (Chemicon catalog number 1924) was used at 1:4000. Of note, this antibody was described by the vendor as effective for immunoblot analysis only under nonreducing conditions. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at 1:20,000, and blots were developed using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequent autoradiography. Isolation of Neutrophils from Human Peripheral Blood and Mouse Bone Marrow—Neutrophils were isolated from blood from healthy volunteers by dextran sedimentation, hypotonic lysis of red blood cells, and Histopaque density centrifugation. Procedures using human subjects were approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Human Studies Committee. Neutrophils were isolated from the bone marrow collected from the femurs and tibias of wild-type and NE-deficient mice as described previously (25Bylund J. Macdonald K.L. Brown K.L. Mydel P. Collins L.V. Hancock R.E. Speert D.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, distal and proximal tips were cut off and washed with cold PBS buffer using a 1-ml syringe and 27-gauge needle. After dispersing cell clumps with a 1-ml pipette on ice, the suspension was centrifuged (200 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of sterile PBS. The cell suspension was carefully layered on the top of a discontinuous Percoll gradient (72, 63, and 50%; 2 ml each). After centrifugation at 500 × g for 30 min, the lowest band was transferred into 10 ml of PBS in a new tube. Residual erythrocytes were eliminated by hypotonic lysis. The neutrophils were adjusted to a concentration of 5 × 106/ml and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Preparation of Degranulated Neutrophil Supernatants—Degranulation of neutrophils was performed by incubation for 15 min in cytochalasin B (5 μg/ml) followed by 30 min with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP, 10 nm). Neutrophil supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Specific colorimetric substrates (Sigma) were used to assess the activity of NE (N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide) and CG (N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide) in these supernatants. Briefly, 100 μl of supernatant was added to 100 μl of substrate mixture resulting in a final concentration of 0.5 mm substrate in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5). Reactions were read at 405 nm every 30 s for 30 min. An NE standard was used to calculate Vmax/min. Supernatants were adjusted to contain ∼50 nm NE activity for incubation with laminin-332. In some experiments, digestions were performed in the presence of 0.1 mm N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone, an NE-specific inhibitor. Intranasal Instillation of LPS—Adult wild-type C57BL/6 or NE-deficient mice (21Belaaouaj A. McCarthy R. Baumann M. Gao Z. Ley T.J. Abraham S.N. Shapiro S.D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) were anesthetized, placed supine, and dropwise inoculated intranasally with 50 μl of PBS containing 100 μgof Escherichia coli LPS (Sigma). Following the inoculation, the mice were kept supine 1–2 min to ensure inhalation of the sample. After 24 h, the mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide narcosis, and BAL fluid was retrieved by injecting three times 0.7 ml of saline through the trachea and pooling the fractions. Protein concentrations of the BAL samples were determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added to each BAL fluid to prevent ex vivo proteolysis. BAL samples were analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody against the γ2 chain as described above. This experiment was performed using three mice per condition three independent times. Digestion and Analysis of Human Laminin γ2 Peptide—A peptide derived from the region surrounding the MMP-2 cleavage site in human laminin γ2 (FGGPNCEHGAFSCPACYNQVKI) was synthesized on an ABI-431A synthesizer using Fast-Moc chemistry on Wang-capped resins. After cleavage, the peptide was dissolved in MilliQ water with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and purified with reverse phase HPLC on a Vydak 218TP1022 C-18 column using a linear 0–50% acetonitrile gradient. Peak fractions were dried by rotary evaporation, dissolved in MilliQ water, and lyophilized. The peptide was dissolved in water, and disulfide bonds were allowed to form before use. LC-mass spectrometry was performed to verify the identity of the purified peptide by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory at Washington University School of Medicine. The concentration was determined by amino acid analysis using a Beckman 6300 high performance amino acid analyzer. The susceptibility of the peptide to NE cleavage was determined by incubation of the peptide (125 μg at 0.5 μg/μl) with 50 nm NE for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 0.8 mm, and the digests were analyzed by HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, Washington University). Neutrophil Chemotaxis Assay—Human neutrophils were isolated as described above. Chemotaxis was assayed in modified Boyden chambers as described previously (26Senior R.M. Hinek A. Griffin G.L. Pipoly D.J. Crouch E.C. Mecham R.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1989; 1: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Intact laminin-332 (800 ng/ml; 1 nm), NE-digested laminin-332 (1 nm incubated with 50 nm NE, 6 h at 37 °C), or NE alone (50 nm) was placed in the lower compartment of the chambers. fMLP (10 nm) and IL-8 (5 nm) were used as positive controls. Neutrophils (1 × 105/well) were placed in the upper compartment. Upper and lower compartments were separated by polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters (Osmonics, Liverpool, CA) with 3-μm pore size. Following a 90-min incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the filter was stained with Wright's stain, and nonmigrated cells from the upper side of the filter were removed, and the number of migrated neutrophils on the underside of the filter were counted in 10 random high powered fields (×400) for each of the triplicate wells. Cell counts were averaged and standard errors calculated. Data are representative of three independent experiments. Laminin-332 Chains Are Differentially Susceptible to Cleavage by Neutrophil and Macrophage Proteases—The γ2 chain of laminin-332 is cleaved by a number of MMPs, leading to the production of fragments that are promigratory for epithelial cells (13Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). As neutrophilic inflammation is a major contributor to the acute inflammatory response that the basement membrane encounters following initial injury, we investigated whether the individual chains of laminin-332 are also susceptible to cleavage by serine proteases found in neutrophils. The serine proteases NE, CG, and PR3 were all capable of degrading the α3 chain of rat laminin-332, as indicated by alterations in banding pattern or reduction in the band intensities upon immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). The β3 and γ2 chains were substrates for cleavage by NE but were resistant to cleavage by CG and PR3 (Fig. 1A). The α3 and β3 chains of laminin-332 were marginally susceptible to cleavage by the MMPs tested. The widened appearance of the α3 band after digestion with MMPs-2, -8, and -9 likely resulted from a cleavage that slightly alters the size of the α3 chain. MMP-12 and NE had the most potent activity against the γ2 chain of those proteases tested. NE was found to have some activity against laminin-332, particularly the β3 chain, at enzyme concentrations as low as 15 pm (Fig. 1B), representing an enzyme to substrate ratio of ∼1:1000, supporting a physiologic role for NE in degrading laminin-332 in vivo. Importantly, like the MMPs that have been shown to cleave the γ2 chain liberating promigratory fragments, NE also generates a stable product of 80-kDa, the size of the γ2x fragment (13Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 15Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Laminins-332, -111, and -511 Are Differentially Susceptible to Cleavage by Neutrophil and Macrophage Proteases—The ability of individual proteases or classes of proteases to degrade different laminin isoforms is specific and unpredictable. For example, although the MMPs we tested were only marginally able to degrade the α3 chain of laminin-332 (Fig. 1A), most were very active against the α1 chain of laminin-111, with MMP-12 being the exception (Fig. 2A). In contrast, among the MMPs we tested, only MMP-12 showed the ability to degrade the α5 chain (Fig. 2B). The serine proteases as a group appear capable of degrading all three α chains. Of note, the immunoblot for the α5 chain was performed under nonreducing conditions, and only digested fragments were detected. No bands were detected when the gels were done in reducing conditions (data not shown), supporting that this α5 antibody does not work on reduced samples. Although MMP-12 and NE are curiously unique in their ability to degrade the β3 chain (Fig. 1A), striking differences exist between these MMPs and serine proteases in their capacity to cleave the β1 chain of laminin-111 (Fig. 2A) or laminin-511 (Fig. 2B). These MMPs showed little or no activity against the β1 chain of either of these laminin isoforms, whereas all serine proteases tested were active against this chain. Unlike the unique ability of NE among the serine proteases to degrade the γ2 chain, all three serine proteases tested appear equally capable of degrading the γ1 chain of laminin-111 (Fig. 2A) or laminin-511 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, MMP-8 and -9 are relatively unable to degrade the γ1 chain of laminin-111, whereas MMP-8 and -9 demonstrate significant activity against the same chain in the context of laminin-511. This raises the possibility that the context or complement of other chains present affects the susceptibility of the γ1 chain to degradation by these MMPs. Alternatively, the fact that laminin-511 is mildly digested with pepsin during its isolation may predispose it to degradation that does not occur in the native protein. MMP-12 displayed little or no activity against this chain in either of these laminin isoforms. NE Is the Major Enzyme in Neutrophils Capable of Degrading Laminin-332—To determine the contribution of NE to total neutrophil-mediated degradation of laminin-332, we compared the digestion patterns observed when laminin-332 was cleaved by NE versus a degranulated neutrophil supernatant (Fig. 3). By immunoblotting, the digestion patterns for all three laminin-332 chains were very similar when produced by either NE alone or degranulated neutrophil supernatant. As the cleavage patterns of laminin-332 differ between NE and other neutrophil-derived serine proteinases (Fig. 1A), this suggested that NE is the primary enzyme released by neutrophil responsible for cleavage of laminin-332. To investigate this further, we performed the experiment in the presence of a specific chloromethyl ketone inhibitor of NE (Fig. 4A). This inhibitor not only blocked digestion of laminin-332 by NE, but blocked digestion by degranulated neutrophil supernatants as well. The idea that NE is the major neutrophil-derived protease capable of degrading laminin-332 is most clearly supported in Fig. 4B, where neutrophil supernatants derived from NE-deficient mice were largely unable to cleave laminin-332. NE-dependent Cleavage of the Laminin γ2 Chain in Vivo—To determine whether NE contributes to laminin-332 degradation in vivo, we intranasally instilled LPS, a potent inducer of neutrophilic inflammation, into the lungs of wild-type and NE-deficient mice. BAL fluids were collected 24 h after LPS administration, a time point where there is significant neutrophil recruitment to the lungs, and assayed for the presence of laminin γ2 fragments by immunoblot analysis. The neutrophil counts in the BAL of NE-deficient mice treated with LPS were consistently higher than those of wild-type mice (3.3-, 2.9-, and 5.3-fold in three experiments), with higher doses of LPS associated with more neutrophils and laminin-332 degradation. In Fig. 5, two laminin γ2 bands were detected in the BAL fluid of LPS-treated wild-type mice, which"
https://openalex.org/W2046351358,"Palladin is a recently described phosphoprotein that plays an important role in cell adhesion and motility. Previous studies have shown that palladin overexpression results in profound changes in actin organization in cultured cells. Palladin binds to the actin-associated proteins α-actinin, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, profilin, Eps8, and ezrin, suggesting that it may affect actin organization indirectly. To determine its molecular function in generating actin arrays, we purified palladin and asked if it is also capable of binding to F-actin directly. In co-sedimentation and differential sedimentation assays, palladin was found to both bind and cross-link actin filaments. This bundling activity was confirmed by fluorescence and electron microscopy. Palladin fragments were then purified and used to determine the sequences necessary to bind and bundle F-actin. The Ig3 domain of palladin bound to F-actin, and a palladin fragment containing Ig3, Ig4, and the region linking these domains was identified as a fragment that was able to bundle F-actin. Because palladin has multiple Ig domains, and only one of them binds to F-actin, this suggests that different Ig domains may be specialized for distinct biological functions. In addition, our results suggest a potential role for palladin in generating specialized, actin-based cell morphologies via both direct actin cross-linking activity and indirect scaffolding activity.

The organization of actin networks within the cell is tightly controlled by a variety of regulatory proteins that either cross-link actin filaments into robust bundles or regulate the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments by: 1) capping/uncapping or severing the filament ends or 2) promoting the polymerization of actin at specific sites (7dos Remedios C.G.

To date, more than 23 classes of proteins have been shown to cross-link actin filaments into tight parallel bundles, loosely spaced bundles, or flexible networks (8Kreis T. Vale R. 2nd Edition Ed.

Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) play important roles in maintaining cell shape and allowing cells to move and adhere to a substrate. In addition, in differentiated cells in vivo, actin cross-linking proteins have a critical function in generating specialized actin-based structures such as sarcomeres, microvilli, and stereocilia (reviewed in Refs. 13Adams J.C.

Thus, the extraordinary diversity of actin-binding proteins provides cells with a wide variety of molecular tools for constructing both dynamic and stable arrays of actin filaments. Palladin is a recently described phosphoprotein that is widely expressed in vertebrate cells and tissues (15Parast M.M. Otey C.A. J.

Palladin exists as three major isoforms, which display apparent molecular masses of 90, 140, and 200 kDa by SDS-PAGE (15Parast M.M. Otey C.A. J.

Palladin is the most widely expressed member of a novel subfamily of actin-associated proteins (18Otey C.A. Rachlin A. Moza M. Arneman D. Carpen O. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 246: 31-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The two other members of this family of proteins, myotilin (19Salmikangas P. Mykkanen O.M. Gronholm M. Heiska L. Kere J. Carpen O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and myopalladin (20Bang M.L. Mudry R.E. McElhinny A.S. Trombitas K. Geach A.J. Yamasaki R. Sorimachi H. Granzier H. Gregorio C.C. Labeit S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), are primarily expressed in striated muscle. Palladin has been detected in structures that contain contractile bundles of actin filaments, such as stress fibers and sarcomeres (15Parast M.M. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 17Mykkanen O.M. Gronholm M. Ronty M. Lalowski M. Salmikangas P. Suila H. Carpen O. Mol. Biol.

Palladin also localizes to anchoring structures such as focal adhesions and podosomes, and motile structures such as neuronal growth cones and dorsal ruffles (15Parast M.M. Otey C.A. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Within smooth muscle and non-muscle cells, palladin localizes to actin filaments in regularly spaced puncta that have also been found to contain α-actinin (23Ronty M. Taivainen A. Moza M. Otey C.A.

Palladin possesses a large number of molecular partners, including a cohort of proteins that bind directly to actin: α-actinin (23Ronty M. Taivainen A. Moza M. Otey C.A. Carpen O.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Palladin also binds to a second cohort of proteins that indirectly influence actin organization: ArgBP2 (26Ronty M. Taivainen A. Moza M. Kruh G.D. Ehler E. Carpen O. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 310: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), LPP (27Jin L. Kern M.J. Otey C.A. Wamhoff B.R. Somlyo A.V. Circ.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The observation that palladin binds to an unusually large number of actin-binding proteins suggests that it may function as an actin-associated scaffolding molecule. vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein immunoglobulin dithiothreitol 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid size exclusion chromatography-multiple angle light scattering. vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein immunoglobulin dithiothreitol 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid size exclusion chromatography-multiple angle light scattering. Although the precise cellular function and mode of subcellular localization for palladin is still under investigation, results to date indicate that palladin plays an important role in organizing the actin arrays needed for normal cell adhesion, motility, and changes in morphology during cell development. Palladin expression has been explored in a variety cell types and a mouse model organism. With antisense and small interfering RNA knockdown approaches, loss of palladin expression is associated with a failure of cells to assemble stress fibers, focal adhesions, dorsal ruffles, and podosomes (15Parast M.M. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Goicoechea S. Arneman D. Disanza A. Garcia-Mata R. Scita G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of palladin correlates with changes in cell morphology and the formation of the actin cytoskeleton in maturing peripheral blood monocytes (17Mykkanen O.M. Gronholm M. Ronty M. Lalowski M. Salmikangas P. Suila H. Carpen O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3060-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Decreased palladin expression correlates with the loss of filamentous actin as polygonal astrocytes become stellate (29Boukhelifa M. Hwang S.J. Valtschanoff J.G. Meeker R.B. Rustioni A. Otey C.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, up-regulation of palladin and increased stress fibers are both seen in stellate astrocytes in response to injury (29Boukhelifa M. Hwang S.J. Valtschanoff J.G. Meeker R.B. Rustioni A. Otey C.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The function of palladin has also been explored in a knock-out mouse model. The palladin null mice die at about embryonic day 15, demonstrating that palladin is essential for normal mammalian embryonic development (30Luo H. Liu X. Wang F. Huang Q. Shen S. Wang L. Xu G. Sun X. Kong H. Gu M. Chen S. Chen Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Palladin null embryos exhibit striking defects in body wall closure, both dorsally and ventrally, which supports the view that cell motility is impaired in the absence of palladin expression. In addition, palladin null mouse embryo fibroblasts are defective in their ability to move, adhere, and assemble stress fibers (30Luo H. Liu X. Wang F. Huang Q. Shen S. Wang L. Xu G. Sun X. Kong H. Gu M. Chen S. Chen Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Liu X.S. Luo H.J. Yang H. Wang L. Kong H. Jin Y.E. Wang F. Gu M.M. Chen Z. Lu Z.Y. Wang Z.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 1288-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that palladin is required for normal assembly and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. A common feature of the palladin family of proteins is the presence of multiple immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains. The three isoforms of palladin are transcribed from a series of nested promoters within a single gene; consequently, the three C-terminal Ig domains (Ig3, Ig4, and Ig5) are present in all three isoforms (16Rachlin A.S. Otey C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The 140- and 200-kDa isoforms contain an additional fourth Ig domain (Ig2) near the N terminus, whereas the 200-kDa isoform contains a total of 5 Ig domains (Ig1–Ig5) (16Rachlin A.S. Otey C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Myotilin has two Ig domains that are homologous to the Ig4 and Ig5 domains of palladin (20Bang M.L. Mudry R.E. McElhinny A.S. Trombitas K. Geach A.J. Yamasaki R. Sorimachi H. Granzier H. Gregorio C.C. Labeit S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), whereas myopalladin has five Ig domains that are in the same relative positions and homologous to the five Ig domains of the 200-kDa isoform of palladin (16Rachlin A.S. Otey C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20Bang M.L. Mudry R.E. McElhinny A.S. Trombitas K. Geach A.J. Yamasaki R. Sorimachi H. Granzier H. Gregorio C.C. Labeit S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The Ig-fold is a modular domain that appears in both extracellular and intracellular proteins and is often involved in protein-protein interactions (32Barclay A.N. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 33Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu, Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Ig domains typically contain about 100 amino acids and consist of 7–9 β strands that adopt a sandwiched β sheet fold (34Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to being a signature domain of this protein family, Ig domains have been described in a small number of other intracellular proteins that are associated with actin and myosin in vertebrates, including myosin light chain kinase, myomesin, titin, MyBP-C, and MyBP-H (35Linke W.A. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 799-811PubMed Google Scholar, 36Okagaki T. Weber F.E. Fischman D.A. Vaughan K.T. Mikawa T. Reinach F.C. J.

The majority of these Ig-containing proteins are specifically expressed in striated muscle, suggesting that this particular type of Ig domain may play a special role in creating the highly ordered cytoskeleton of the sarcomere (37Vaughan K.T. Weber F.E. Einheber S. Fischman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3670-3676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Gilbert R. Cohen J.A. Pardo S. Basu A. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 69-79PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that inherited forms of heart disease are associated with mutations affecting the Ig domains of either titin or MyBP-C, suggesting that the Ig domains have a key role in maintaining sarcomere integrity (40Gerull B. Atherton J. Geupel A. Sasse-Klaassen S. Heuser A. Frenneaux M. McNabb M. Granzier H. Labeit S. Thierfelder L. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 478-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 41Gerull B.

Currently, the precise molecular function of palladin family Ig domains is a matter of debate. The binding site of ezrin has been mapped to the Ig4 and Ig5 domains of palladin (17Mykkanen O.M. Gronholm M. Ronty M. Lalowski M. Salmikangas P. Suila H. Carpen O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3060-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, a number of recent reports suggest the interesting possibility that certain Ig domains can function as actin-binding modules. Isolated protein fragments containing Ig domains and flanking sequence derived from the palladin relative to myotilin have been shown to bind directly to F-actin (44Salmikangas P. van der Ven P.F. Lalowski M. Taivainen A. Zhao F. Suila H. Schroder R. Lappalainen P. Furst D.O. Carpen O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 45von Nandelstadh P. Gronholm M. Moza M. Lamberg A. Savilahti H. Carpen O. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 310: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Myotilin even appears to function as an actin-bundling protein in vitro, as purified myotilin promotes the formation of large, multifilament aggregates that have been imaged by electron microscopy and also detected in differential sedimentation assays (44Salmikangas P. van der Ven P.F. Lalowski M. Taivainen A. Zhao F. Suila H. Schroder R. Lappalainen P. Furst D.O. Carpen O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In certain invertebrate species, skeletal muscle also contains a protein called kettin, which has 31 copies of a similar Ig domain (46Hakeda S. Endo S. Saigo K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, a fragment containing four of the Ig domains of kettin were shown to bind directly to F-actin (47Ono K. Yu R. Mohri K. Ono S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2722-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This suggests, first, that binding of actin by Ig domains may be a highly conserved molecular mechanism shared by both vertebrate and invertebrate proteins, and second, that Ig domains within the same molecule may be specialized for different functions. Yet, although these results strongly suggest that certain Ig domains could function as F-actin binding sites, no previous study has shown this conclusively using an isolated Ig domain. The high degree of homology between palladin and myotilin in their Ig domains raises the possibility that palladin may also function as a direct binding partner for F-actin, and we undertook to test this idea using a combination of biochemical and microscopy-based assays. In this report, we show that purified 90-kDa palladin generates actin bundles directly in vitro and that one of its Ig domains possesses actin-binding activity. These results support the view that Ig domains can function as conserved actin-binding modules, and add further support to accumulating evidence that multiple Ig domains within the same protein can have specialized functions. Identification and Cloning of Palladin Immunoglobulin Domains—The three tandem Ig domains of the 90-kDa palladin isoform were identified using a BLAST search and were initially characterized as C2-type Ig domains. However, secondary structure prediction using PSIPredict (48Bryson K. McGuffin L.J. Marsden R.L. Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. Jones D.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W36-W38Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 49McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar) and ClustalX (50Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35414) Google Scholar) alignment with telokin (1TLK), titin I1 (1G1C), and twitchin (1WIT) indicated that the three Ig domains of the palladin 90-kDa isoform are members of the I-type immunoglobulin-like domains (51Harpaz Y. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The Ig domains of palladin were originally described as the C2-type, based on their high homology to other Ig domains that had been classified as C2-type Ig domains, including titin, myosin-light chain kinase, and myotilin (15Parast M.M. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The reclassification of Ig domains into four sets (V, C1, C2, and I) was initiated by a structural analysis of telokin (51Harpaz Y. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and subsequently, the Ig domains of titin and many other muscle proteins have been reclassified as members of the I-set (52Kenny P.A. Liston E.M. Higgins D.G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Domain boundaries of the palladin Ig domains were determined from the secondary structure prediction using PSi-Predict (48Bryson K. McGuffin L.J. Marsden R.L. Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. Jones D.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W36-W38Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 49McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences and the translated protein sequences for the palladin Ig domains are included in the supplemental section. Expression and Purification of Palladin Fragments—Full-length 90-kDa palladin was expressed as His6 fusion protein in Sf9 insect cells using a commercially generated baculovirus (BD Biosciences), and purified using a commercial affinity purification kit (BD Biosciences) (25Boukhelifa M. Moza M. Johansson T. Rachlin A. Parast M. Huttelmaier S. Roy P. Jockusch B.M. Carpen O. Karlsson R. Otey C.A. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). DNA sequences encoding: 1) the individual Ig3, Ig4, and Ig5 domains; 2) a fragment containing the linker sequence between the Ig3 and Ig4 domain; and 3) the tandem Ig3-Ig4 and Ig4-Ig5 domains of palladin were inserted into a modified pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs) expression vector with the sequence ENLYFQG encoding a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site inserted between the maltose-binding protein affinity tag and the palladin inserts. The plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RIPL Escherichia coli (Stratagene) and colonies were selected from agar plates containing 75 mg/ml ampicillin. Cell cultures were grown in Luria broth supplemented with 10 g/liter of glucose at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6–0.8 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Following induction, cells were grown at 30 °C for 4 h, then harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 3,000 × g. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× BAL (1000× BAL = 10 mg/ml benzamidine, 2 mg/ml antipain, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin)) and the cell membranes were lysed by sonication using a Fisher Scientific model 550 Sonic Dismembrator. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 1 h to pellet any insoluble contents. The soluble contents of the cell lysate were loaded at ∼2 ml/min on a column of amylose-functionalized agarose resin (New England Biolabs). The column was washed with 50 ml of column buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA) after which the fusion protein was eluted with an elution buffer (column buffer + 10 mm maltose) and collected in 3-ml fractions. Fractions containing protein were identified by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and checked by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing the fusion protein were combined, the affinity tag was cleaved overnight at room temperature in the elution buffer with 1× BAL, and 0.6 mg of tobacco etch virus protease (pRK793, Addgene, Inc.) added. The following day, the cleaved protein was diluted 3-fold with a dilution buffer (25 mm KH2PO4, pH 5.5, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% NaN3) to lower the pH and salt concentration. The diluted protein sample was purified by ion-exchange on anÁKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare) with a HiPrep™ SP XL column. The protein was loaded on the column with Buffer A (25 mm KH2PO4, pH 5.5, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% NaN3) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 2 column volumes and then the protein was eluted using a gradient with a target concentration of 100% Buffer B (25 mm KH2PO4, pH 5.5, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% NaN3) over 10 column volumes. Fractions containing protein were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm and confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. Actin Co-sedimentation Assay—A solution of 6.4 mg/ml actin purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder was diluted 2-fold with an equal volume of 2× F-actin buffer (20 mm Tris pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm DTT) and allowed to polymerize at room temperature for 30 min. Purified palladin was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min to pellet any insoluble protein immediately before the co-sedimentation samples were prepared. Samples were prepared that contained 10 μm of the polymerized actin and 10 μm of the palladin proteins in a total volume of 200 μl. A control sample was prepared substituting the palladin protein solution with an equal volume of buffer. The samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were collected and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. The pellets were washed quickly with 1× F-actin buffer and re-suspended in 200 μl of water, which was also boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Twenty-five microliters of each sample was loaded onto a BisTris 4–12% gradient polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis in MES running buffer. The gels were stained with Simply Blue Safe Stain (Invitrogen) and destained with water. Gel images were acquired by scanning the gels with Licor's Odyssey infrared scanner, which allows for quantitative measurements. For the differential sedimentation assay of actin bundle formation, one additional centrifugation step was added. The samples were first centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The 5,000 × g pellets were washed quickly with 1× M buffer and re-suspended in 100 μl of water before being boiled with Laemmli buffer. The supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min and treated as described above. To determine actin bundling ratios, increasing concentrations of the Ig3-Ig4 fragments of palladin were combined with 10 μm F-actin and samples were subjected to differential sedimentation as described above. For each sample, the ratio of actin appearing in bundles, supernatant, and pellet were measured by densitometry of SDS-PAGE bands.

Seven distinct subunits have been identified so far. For each of those, specific functions have been proposed based on structural prediction or experimental evidence. Three of those subunits possess modules that could act as redox-active regulatory components in the import process. To date, however, the mode of redox regulation of the import process remains enigmatic. To investigate how the chloroplast redox state influences translocon behavior and composition, we studied the Tic component and the putative redox sensor Tic62 in more detail. The experimental results provide evidence that Tic62 can act as a bona fide dehydrogenase in vitro, and that it changes its localization in the chloroplast dependent on the NADP+/NADPH ratio in the stroma. Moreover, the redox state influences the interactions of Tic62 with the translocon and the flavoenzyme ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase. Additionally, we give initial experimental insights into the Tic62 structure using circular dichroism measurements and demonstrate that the protein consists of two structurally different domains.

Our results indicate that Tic62 possesses redox-dependent properties that would allow it to fulfill a role as redox sensor protein in the chloroplast. Redox regulation plays a crucial role in virtually all metabolic or developmental pathways present in the chloroplast. Numerous studies have presented evidence that electron transfer processes are not only restricted to the photochemical reactions linked to photosynthesis, providing the reducing power for e.g. carbon fixation, NO–2 assimilation or fatty acid biosynthesis, but are also prominent in a regulatory manner. They activate or inactivate many metabolic enzymes (e.g. via the thioredoxin/glutaredoxin systems, Ref. 1Buchanan B.B. Balmer Y. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2005; 56: 187-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) or act as part of a signaling pathway to the nucleus to regulate transcription (2Fey V. Wagner R. Brautigam K. Wirtz M.

Furthermore, the involvement of thioredoxins, e.g. in the regulation of chloroplast translation and protein folding, has been demonstrated (3Trebitsh T. Levitan A. Sofer A. Danon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and thus redox signaling and regulation seem to influence many steps from transcription to post-translational enzyme activity.An indication that protein import to the chloroplasts is also regulated by a redox-related process in a substrate-dependent manner was demonstrated by Hirohashi et al. (4Hirohashi T. Hase T. Nakai M. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 2154-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), who reported a differential import behavior of the non-photosynthetic ferredoxin (Fd) 3The abbreviations used are:FdferredoxinAscascorbic acidAtArabidopsis thalianaCDcircular dichroismCPchloroplastFNRferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductaseHARhexammineruthenium trichlorideIEinner envelopeLeLycopersicon esculentum; NBT, nitroblue tetrazoliumPCphosphatidylcholineSDRshort-chain dehydrogenaseTictranslocon at the inner envelope of chloroplastsToctranslocon at the outer envelope of chloroplastsCaMcalmodulinNTAnitrilotriacetic acidBN-PAGEblue-native PAGE.3The abbreviations used are:FdferredoxinAscascorbic acidAtArabidopsis thalianaCDcircular dichroismCPchloroplastFNRferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductaseHARhexammineruthenium trichlorideIEinner envelopeLeLycopersicon esculentum; NBT, nitroblue tetrazoliumPCphosphatidylcholineSDRshort-chain dehydrogenaseTictranslocon at the inner envelope of chloroplastsToctranslocon at the outer envelope of chloroplastsCaMcalmodulinNTAnitrilotriacetic acidBN-PAGEblue-native PAGE. FdIII and the ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase isoform II (FNRII) in maize chloroplasts in light compared with dark. Thus, diurnal changes in the thylakoids and/or the stromal redox system (e.g. the NADP+/NADPH pool) seem to have an impact on the import characteristics of the organelle.Taking this into account, it is not surprising that proteins with redox-active properties are also found at the stage of protein translocation, as is the case for the translocon at the inner envelope of chloroplasts, the Tic complex. Together with the protein import translocon present in the outer envelope of the chloroplast (the Toc complex) the Tic complex mediates the translocation of the vast majority of all nuclear-encoded pre-proteins destined for the chloroplast into the organelle (5Jarvis P. Robinson C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R1064-R1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Kessler F. Schnell D.J. Traffic. 2006; 7: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Stengel A. Soll J. Bolter B. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Seven Tic components have been described so far: Tic110, Tic40, Tic22, Tic20, and the three potentially redox-active components Tic62, Tic55, and Tic32. One of them, Tic55, had been found to co-purify with Tic110 in blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) as well as in co-immunoprecipitations with Tic110 and precursor protein and represents a member of CAO/PAO-like oxygenases containing a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster and an additional mononuclear iron binding site (8Caliebe A. Grimm R. Kaiser G. Lubeck J. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7342-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Another possible redox-acting component is Tic32, which had been identified as an interaction partner of the N-terminal domain of Tic110 and belongs to the conserved class of short chain dehydrogenases (SDRs, Ref. 9Hormann F. Kuchler M. Sveshnikov D. Oppermann U. Li Y. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34756-34762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, the dehydrogenase activity of the recombinantly expressed protein was demonstrated in vitro, and it was found to be the target of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-regulation of protein import (10Chigri F. Hormann F. Stamp A. Stammers D.K. Bolter B. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16051-16056Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).The third Tic protein with redox-active properties is Tic62, which had been found in close proximity to Tic110 and Tic55 in BN-PAGE (11Küchler M. Decker S. Hörmann F. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6136-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and consists of two distinct structural domains. While the N-terminal module features a pyridine nucleotide binding site (comparable to Tic32) and is conserved in all oxyphototrophic organisms down to green sulfur bacteria, the C-terminal region is found only in vascular plants (12Balsera M. Stengel A. Soll J. Bolter B. BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It contains a series of unique Ser/Pro-rich repeats, which allow specific binding of Tic62 to FNR, a flavoenzyme best known for catalyzing the final step of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. FNR transfers electrons from Fdred to NADP+ generating NADPH, and thus reduces the chloroplast pool of redox equivalents. Interestingly, FNR is subject to a positional equilibrium within the chloroplast with a large amount of the protein also present in the stroma (13Lintala M. Allahverdiyeva Y. Kidron H. Piippo M. Battchikova N. Suorsa M. Rintamaki E. Salminen T.A. Aro E.M. Mulo P. Plant J. 2007; 49: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) as well as in the inner envelope (11Küchler M. Decker S. Hörmann F. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6136-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Upon oxidative stress, a re-localization takes place, which probably leads to a change in the electron distribution to pathways involved in chloroplast redox state maintenance such as e.g. the ascorbate peroxidase system or thioredoxins (14Palatnik J.F. Valle E.M. Carrillo N. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).It was also reported that Tic62 dissociates from the Tic complex after addition of NADPH to isolated inner envelope vesicles (10Chigri F. Hormann F. Stamp A. Stammers D.K. Bolter B. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16051-16056Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Together with its ability to bind pyridine nucleotides and its association with FNR, this finding would make Tic62 an ideal candidate to be involved in the redox regulation of the Tic complex. These considerations, therefore, led us to take a closer look at Tic62 and investigate its redox-dependent behavior as well as its interactions with FNR and the Tic complex in more detail.We report here that Tic62 shuttles between the chloroplast membranes and the stroma, depending on the redox state of the plastidic NADP+/NADPH pool. Oxidized conditions lead to a stronger attachment to the membrane as well as to the Tic complex, whereas reducing conditions favor a soluble localization in the stroma and association with FNR as an interaction partner. We demonstrate that the central amino acids (Ala-247 to Val-346) of Tic62 are sufficient for mediating binding to the Tic complex and that the N terminus with the predicted NADPH binding site is active as a bona fide dehydrogenase in vitro. The activity is specific for NADPH as electron donor and requires the presence of a lipid environment. Furthermore, we give the first experimental data on the structure of Tic62 derived from circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic measurements of heterologously expressed and purified Tic62 constructs, demonstrating that the N and C terminus of Tic62 are not only functionally but also structurally different.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIn Vitro Transcription and Translation—The coding region for PsTic62 from Pisum sativum either with or without the transit peptide was cloned into the vector pSP65 (Promega, Madison, WI) under the control of the SP6 promoter. Transcription of linearized plasmids was carried out in the presence of SP6 polymerase (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Roth, Germany). Translation was carried out using the Flexi Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine for radioactive labeling. After translation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 50.000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the post-ribosomal supernatant was used for import experiments.Chloroplast Isolation and Protein Import—Chloroplasts were isolated from the leaves of 9–11-day-old pea seedlings (P. sativum var. Arvica) and purified through Percoll density gradients as previously described (15Keegstra K. Yousif A.E. Weissbach A. Weissbach H. Methods in Enzymology - Plant Molecular Biology. 118. Academic Press, New York1986: 316-325Google Scholar, 16Waegemann K. Soll J. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A standard import reaction contained chloroplasts equivalent to 15–20 μg of chlorophyll in 100 μl of import buffer (330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm Hepes/KOH pH 7.6, 3 mm MgSO4, 10 mm Met, 10 mm Cys, 20 mm K-gluconate, 10 mm NaHCO3, 2% bovine serum albumin (w/v)), up to 3 mm ATP, and maximal 10% (v/v) 35S-labeled translation products. Import reactions were initiated by the addition of chloroplasts to the import mixture and carried out for 15 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by the separation of chloroplasts from the reaction mixture by centrifugation through a 40% (v/v) Percoll cushion. Chloroplasts were washed once, incubated with 20 mm HAR (hexammineruthenium trichloride) or ascorbic acid (Asc) for 10 min at 25 °C, ruptured in 25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6 for 30 min on ice, and separated into membrane and soluble fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Import products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by a phosphorimager.Chloroplast Treatment and Fractionation—Isolated pea chloroplasts (20 μg of chlorophyll) were incubated with 0–20 mm oxidizing (HAR or oxidized glutathione GSSG) or reducing (Asc or reduced glutathione GSH) compounds for 20 min at 25 °C. For the rescue experiments, the HAR-treated chloroplasts were washed once in wash medium (330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm Hepes/KOH pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2) and then treated with 20 mm of the reducing agents or incubated in ambient light for 20 min, while one sample was kept in the dark. In the reverse rescue, HAR treatment followed incubation with Asc. After subsequent washing, chloroplasts were disrupted in 25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5 by incubation on ice for 10 min, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 100,000 × g or for 2 h at 600,000 × g, respectively. The pellet (membranes) and supernatant (stroma) were loaded completely and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antiserum against PsTic62 and PsTic110.Overexpression and Purification of PsTic62-IA1, PsTic62-IA3, LeTic62 Full-length, LeTic62-Nt, and LeTic62-Ct—The constructs PsTic62-IA1 (IA1, Ala-247 to Leu-388) and PsTic62-IA3 (IA3, Val-346 to Ser-534) are described in Ref. 11Küchler M. Decker S. Hörmann F. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6136-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar. Use of the Lycopersicon esculentum (Le) constructs was necessary, because the corresponding ones from P. sativum (Ps, the full-length and the N-terminal domain, respectively) failed to express in the bacterial system presented here. The EST clone cLER19P1 was used as template for PCR. The mature LeTic62 full-length (Ala-1 to Ala-682), LeTic62-Nt (Ala-1 to Leu-260), and LeTic62-Ct (Gly-278 to Ala-682) constructs were cloned into pET21a vector using the restriction sites NheI/NotI, NdeI/XhoI, and NdeI/NotI, respectively. All constructs contained a C-terminal His6 tag and were verified by DNA sequencing. For heterologous expression, the clones were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 of 0.6. Expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were grown for 3 h at 37 °C (for PsTic62-IA1, PsTic62-IA3) or at 12 °C overnight (for LeTic62 full-length, LeTic62-Nt, and LeTic62-Ct), respectively. All proteins were purified via their C-terminal polyhistidine tags using Ni-NTA-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany) under native conditions and eluted by the addition of 400 mm imidazole. The proteins were always used fresh and dialysed against 20 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 8.0, prior to CD analysis.Co-immunoprecipitation of Tic62, Tic110, and FNR—Isolated pea chloroplasts (100 μg of chlorophyll) or inner envelope (IE) vesicles (50 μg of protein), isolated by sucrose density centrifugation (16Waegemann K. Soll J. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), were incubated with oxidizing compounds (20 mm HAR for chloroplasts, 1 mm NADP+ for inner envelope vesicles) or reducing agents (20 mm Asc for chloroplasts, 1 mm NADPH for inner envelope vesicles) for 20 min and solubilized with 1.5% decylmaltoside in 200 μl of IP buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation for 10 min at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was diluted 1:10 in IP buffer, 5 μl of primary antiserum (αPsTic62) were added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature, followed by subsequent incubation with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at room temperature. The Sepharose beads were washed five times in IP buffer with 0.15% decylmaltoside and one time in IP buffer without detergent. Elution was performed using Laemmli sample buffer and incubation for 5 min at 95 °C. Load, Flow-through, washes, and elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antisera against PsTic110 and AtFNR-L1. Quantification of the signals was performed using AIDA software (version 3.52.046).Sucrose Gradient Sedimentation—250 μg of inner envelope vesicles were incubated with either H2O, 1 mm NADP+, or 1 mm NADPH for 15 min at 25 °C, followed by solubilization with 1.5% decylmaltoside for 15 min on ice. Sucrose gradients (10–50% w/v sucrose in 25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, ±0.1 mm NADP(H)) were centrifuged at 342,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C, and fractions of 200 μl were collected, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antiserum against PsTic62, PsTic110, and AtFNR-L1.Dehydrogenase Activity Assay—Dehydrogenase activity assays were performed essentially as described (10Chigri F. Hormann F. Stamp A. Stammers D.K. Bolter B. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16051-16056Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). If not stated otherwise, 1 μg of purified protein (LeTic62 full-length, LeTic62-Nt, or LeTic62-Ct) was used, and the reaction was carried out in dehydrogenase buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 100 μg (0.612 mm) nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), and 100 μm NADPH in the presence of phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes (Lα-phosphatidylcholine type IV-S; Sigma; 1 mg/ml). Liposomes were generated by mixing 20 mg/ml l-α-phosphatidylcholine with 80 mm MEGA-9 (N-(d-glucityl)-N-methylnonanamide, N-nonanoyl-N-methylglucamide) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and subsequent dialysis against 10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0 overnight at 4 °C.Binding Assays of Tic62 to FNR and the Tic Complex—The extraction of FNR from pea thylakoids and binding to the purified Tic62 constructs (PsTic62-IA1 and PsTic62-IA3) were performed as described (11Küchler M. Decker S. Hörmann F. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6136-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, FNR was enriched from thylakoids in the presence of 1 mm NADP+ or NADPH, followed by incubation with 10 μg of expressed and purified Tic62 constructs for 2 h at room temperature. Tic62 polypeptides and interacting proteins were isolated by binding to Ni-NTA-Sepharose. Flow-through, washes, and elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.For binding of Tic62 constructs (PsTic62-IA1, PsTic62-IA3, LeTic62-Nt, and LeTic62-Ct) to the Tic complex and FNR from stromal and membrane chloroplast fractions, pea chloroplasts were disrupted by incubation in 25 mm Hepes/KOH pH 8.0 for 10 min on ice and fractionated by centrifugation for 10 min at 100,000 × g. The pellet (membranes) was solubilized in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl with 1.5% decylmaltoside for 10 min on ice, centrifuged for 10 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, and both the solubilized membranes and the supernatant after fractionation (stroma) were incubated with 10 μg of the respective Tic62 constructs for 2 h at room temperature. The proteins were subsequently isolated by binding to Ni-NTA-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Flow-through, washes, and elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Circular Dichroism Measurement—Circular dichroism experiments using LeTic62-Nt and PsTic62-IA3 were carried out at room temperature using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter flushed with nitrogen. Spectra were collected from 260 to 185 nm using a 1-mm pathlength of a cylindrical quartz cell. Each spectrum was the average of three scans taken at a scan rate of 50 nm/min with a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm. The concentration of proteins varied from 0.082 to 0.284 mg/ml. Where indicated, 0.01–0.1 mg/ml sonicated PC liposomes or 50 μm NADP(H) were added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature with protein prior to the measurement. For the final representation, the baseline was subtracted from the spectrum. Experiments were done in duplicate or triplicate. The analysis was performed using the CDSSTR program (protein reference set 3) from the DichroWeb server (17Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar) or the CDNN program (CD Spectra Deconvolution Version, 2.1).RESULTSTic62 Shuttles between Chloroplast Membranes and Stroma—Chloroplasts subdivided into membrane and stromal fraction by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g show an approximately equal distribution of Tic62 in both compartments (Fig. 1A). Higher centrifugation speeds (up to 600,000 × g for 2 h) did not alter this distribution, which excludes the possibility that Tic62 stays in the supernatant because of residual membrane shreds (as demonstrated for Toc159 in Ref. 18Becker T. Jelic M. Vojta A. Radunz A. Soll J. Schleiff E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar; data not shown). Because Tic62 was suggested to be a possible redox sensor protein (11Küchler M. Decker S. Hörmann F. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6136-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we were interested in answering the question of whether the localization of Tic62 might itself be influenced by redox conditions. Incubation of chloroplasts with oxidizing or reducing agents clearly changed this distribution (Fig. 1A). After treatment with HAR, a water-soluble electron acceptor that oxidizes the NADPH pool in the stroma (19Zickermann V. Kurki S. Kervinen M. Hassinen I. Finel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), Tic62 was found to be more associated with the membrane fraction in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar effects were observed upon incubation with GSSG, the oxidized form of glutathione. In contrast to this, treatment of chloroplasts with reducing agents like Asc or the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) showed a slightly higher accumulation of the protein in the stroma, even though the effect was not as drastic as observed with oxidizing compounds. This suggests that a subpool of Tic62 remains membrane-bound in vitro. Tic110, used as an inner envelope control protein, showed no difference in distribution upon treatment with oxidizing or reducing agents (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, incubation of mildly solubilized (0.15% decylmaltoside) inner envelope vesicles with NADPH led to an increase of the Tic62 amount in the supernatant compared to incubation with NADP+ or H2O (data not shown). Although this effect was much weaker than the observed shuttling in intact chloroplasts, it could be slightly enhanced (∼1.5-fold) by the addition of FNR (Fig. 1B). As experiments with HAR/GSSG and Asc/GSH consistently resulted in similar observations, only the results obtained with HAR and Asc are described below.A similar redox-dependent membrane association of Tic62 was also observed when the distribution of newly imported protein was analyzed (Fig. 1C). After import of the protein for 15 min, reisolation, and subsequent treatment of the chloroplasts with HAR, we observed very small amounts of Tic62 in the soluble fraction in contrast to the control reaction with H2Oor Asc (compare lanes 2, 4, and 6). A more detailed analysis of the HAR-induced membrane association of Tic62 revealed that this effect occurred very rapidly (Fig. 2A). After 1 min of incubation with HAR, the majority of Tic62 was found in the membrane fraction, while the distribution of Tic110, used as inner envelope control protein, did not change. Moreover, we detected that FNR reacted similarly to changes of the chloroplast redox state: e.g. upon treatment of chloroplasts with HAR, the attachment of this protein to the membrane fraction increased markedly, whereas it was equally distributed between stroma and a total chloroplast membrane fraction in untreated control chloroplasts (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 2Characterization of the observed Tic62 shuttling. A, time course of HAR treatment. Incubation of chloroplasts with HAR was stopped after the indicated time points and chloroplasts were lysed and fractionated. The samples were analyzed by immunoblot with αTic62 and αTic110, soluble and membrane fractions are depicted. B, rescue of HAR treatment with reducing agents. HAR-incubated chloroplasts were either kept in the dark, incubated with reducing compounds (Asc, GSH), or kept in the light for 20 min, followed by separation into soluble fractions and membranes. The presence of Tic62 and Tic110 in the soluble and pellet fractions is shown by immunoblotting. C, time course of rescue. Pea chloroplasts were treated with HAR for 10 min, washed, and incubated with Asc for the time indicated. The samples were analyzed by immunoblot with αTic62. D, reverse rescue. Pea chloroplasts were first treated with Asc for 10 min, washed, and subsequently incubated with HAR for 5 min. The samples (supernatant and pellet after fractionation) were analyzed by immunoblot with αTic62. Standard error bars are included in the quantifications. All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. S, soluble fraction; M, membranes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To address the question of whether the observed attachment of Tic62 to the membrane fraction under oxidizing conditions is reversible and therefore of physiological relevance in the chloroplast, we investigated a possible re-localization of Tic62 back to the stroma after changing the incubation buffer from oxidizing to reducing conditions. Indeed, HAR-induced membrane binding was found to be reversible. When chloroplasts were treated with HAR for 10 min, followed by washing and incubation with Asc or GSH, a re-localization of Tic62 to the stroma was observed (Fig. 2B). Moreover, even incubation of HAR-treated chloroplasts for 20 min in ambient light, which resulted in reinitiation of photosynthetic electron transport and production of NADPH, led to a slight, but noticeable re-shuttling of Tic62 into the stroma. A time-dependent analysis of this rescue showed that the re-localization of Tic62 induced by Asc was slower than the initial membrane binding caused by oxidizing agents (Fig. 2C). This could be explained by (i) the strong NADPH oxidizing effect of HAR, which might not be washed out completely or (ii) by a decreasing viability of chloroplasts after the incubation steps. Furthermore, in a reverse rescue experiment, the insertion of Tic62 into the inner membrane could be induced if HAR treatment followed Asc incubation (Fig. 2D). In this approach, chloroplasts were first treated with 20 mm Asc and subsequently incubated with HAR, which induced a reassociation of Tic62 with the membrane. Thus, the relocalization of Tic62 even in vitro suggests a physiological role of the observed Tic62 shuttling and a highly dynamic distribution of the protein, which is strictly dependent on the redox state of the chloroplast. A mere unspecific aggregation of Tic62 seems therefore unlikely.The Interaction of Tic62 with the Tic Complex and FNR Is Redox-dependent—The co-localization and interaction of Tic62 with the Tic complex had been investigated previously (11Küchler M. Decker S. Hörmann F. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6136-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Chigri F. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Plant J. 2005; 42: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In these studies, Tic62 was described as part of the Tic complex, but it was suggested that the association of Tic62 with Tic110 might be quite dynamic. A prominent feature of Tic62 is its strong interaction with FNR via the repetitive motif in the C terminus (11Küchler M. Decker S. Hörmann F. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6136-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Several Tic62 constructs were used to investigate the role of these repeats in the binding to FNR: IA1, located in the middle part of PsTic62 (containing no FNR-interacting repeats) and IA3, containing all three repeats from the C terminus (Fig. 3A). The same constructs were also used in the present study to analyze the influence of different redox environments on the interaction of Tic62 and FNR in the presence or absence of NADP+ or NADPH, respectively.FIGURE 3Oxidizing or reducing conditions influence the interactions of Tic62 with the Tic complex and FNR. A, schematic overview of the Tic62 constructs used in this study. For investigation of the redox-dependent interaction of Tic62 with FNR, FNR was isolated from pea thylakoids and incubated with His-tagged PsTic62 proteins, containing eith"
https://openalex.org/W2087407796,"Transient receptor potential channels are involved in sensing chemical and physical changes inside and outside of cells. TRPV3 is highly expressed in skin keratinocytes, where it forms a nonselective cation channel activated by hot temperatures in the innocuous and noxious range. The channel has also been implicated in flavor sensation in oral and nasal cavities as well as being a molecular target of some allergens and skin sensitizers. TRPV3 is unique in that its activity is sensitized upon repetitive stimulations. Here we investigated the role of calcium ions in the sensitization of TRPV3 to repetitive stimulations. We show that the sensitization is accompanied by a decrease of Ca2+-dependent channel inhibition mediated by calmodulin acting at an N-terminal site (amino acids 108–130) and by an acidic residue (Asp641) at the pore loop of TRPV3. These sites also contribute to the voltage dependence of TRPV3. During sensitization, the channel displayed a gradual shift of the voltage dependence to more negative potentials as well as uncoupling from voltage sensing. The initial response to ligand stimulation was increased and sensitization to repetitive stimulations was decreased by increasing the intracellular Ca2+-buffering strength, inhibiting calmodulin, or disrupting the calmodulin-binding site. Mutation of Asp641 to Asn abolished the high affinity extracellular Ca2+-mediated inhibition and greatly facilitated the activation of TRPV3. We conclude that Ca2+ inhibits TRPV3 from both the extracellular and intracellular sides. The inhibition is sequentially reduced, appearing as sensitization to repetitive stimulations. Transient receptor potential channels are involved in sensing chemical and physical changes inside and outside of cells. TRPV3 is highly expressed in skin keratinocytes, where it forms a nonselective cation channel activated by hot temperatures in the innocuous and noxious range. The channel has also been implicated in flavor sensation in oral and nasal cavities as well as being a molecular target of some allergens and skin sensitizers. TRPV3 is unique in that its activity is sensitized upon repetitive stimulations. Here we investigated the role of calcium ions in the sensitization of TRPV3 to repetitive stimulations. We show that the sensitization is accompanied by a decrease of Ca2+-dependent channel inhibition mediated by calmodulin acting at an N-terminal site (amino acids 108–130) and by an acidic residue (Asp641) at the pore loop of TRPV3. These sites also contribute to the voltage dependence of TRPV3. During sensitization, the channel displayed a gradual shift of the voltage dependence to more negative potentials as well as uncoupling from voltage sensing. The initial response to ligand stimulation was increased and sensitization to repetitive stimulations was decreased by increasing the intracellular Ca2+-buffering strength, inhibiting calmodulin, or disrupting the calmodulin-binding site. Mutation of Asp641 to Asn abolished the high affinity extracellular Ca2+-mediated inhibition and greatly facilitated the activation of TRPV3. We conclude that Ca2+ inhibits TRPV3 from both the extracellular and intracellular sides. The inhibition is sequentially reduced, appearing as sensitization to repetitive stimulations.

Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). In mammals, temperature sensing is thought to be accomplished through concerted actions of a minimum of six TRP channels, i.e. TRPA1, -M8, -V4, -V3, -V1, and -V2, each covering a defined temperature range from below 17 °C to above 52 °C (2Jordt S.E.

Neurosci. 2003; 4: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). However, the debate remains whether some of these channels, e.g. TRPA1, are really temperature-sensitive (4Bautista D.M. Jordt S.E. Nikai T. Tsuruda P.R. Read A.J. Poblete J. Yamoah E.N. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Cell. 2006; 124: 1269-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). In addition, TRPM2, -M4, and -M5 have shown temperature sensing in the presence of second messenger cofactors, such as ADP-ribose and Ca2+ (5Talavera K. Yasumatsu K. Voets T. Droogmans G.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1804-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Although some of the thermosensitive TRP channels are clearly expressed and functional in sensory neurons, indicative of their actions in primary afferents, others have been localized in the non-nervous tissues, for example, TRPV3 and -V4 are expressed in skin keratinocytes (7Chung M.K. Lee H. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32037-32046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 8Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Biol.

Clapham D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The TRPV3 null mice showed some deficits in sensing hot temperatures in the innocuous and noxious range but no other obvious sensory impairment (10Moqrich A. Hwang S.W. Earley T.J. Petrus M.J.

On the other hand, constitutively active mutations of TRPV3 have been linked to hair loss and atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in rodents (11Asakawa M. Yoshioka T. Matsutani T. Hikita I. Suzuki M.

In addition to temperature, the thermosensitive TRP channels are activated by a large number of structurally unrelated chemical ligands from exogenous as well as endogenous sources (13Calixto J.B. Kassuya C.A. Andre E. Ferreira J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 106: 179-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This polymodal nature has become a common feature of the TRP channel family, implicating that multiple mechanisms and external stimuli may be involved in the activation and regulation of these channels. TRPV3 was first shown to be activated by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB), a synthetic compound known to inhibit inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and store-operated channels as well as many TRP channels (14Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5177-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 15Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). It was soon discovered that a number of natural anti-irritants and flavor enhancers such as camphor, carvacrol, thymol, and eugenol, also use TRPV3 as one of their targets (9Xu H. Delling M. Jun J.C. Clapham D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 10Moqrich A. Hwang S.W. Earley T.J. Petrus M.J. Murray A.N. Spencer K.S. Andahazy M. Story G.M. Patapoutian A. Science. 2005; 307: 1468-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). More importantly, cell signaling events leading to the activation of phospholipase C, phosphorylation by protein kinase C, and the release of unsaturated, especially polyunsaturated, fatty acids are known to enhance the function of the TRPV3 channel (9Xu H. Delling M. Jun J.C. Clapham D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 16Hu H.Z. Xiao R. Wang C. Gao N. Colton C.K. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). One of the unique properties of TRPV3 is that its activity is enhanced during repetitive stimulations (17Xu H. Ramsey I.S. Kotecha S.A. Moran M.M. Chong J.A. Lawson D. Ge P. Lilly J. Silos-Santiago I. Xie Y. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Clapham D.E.

Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Science. 2002; 296: 2046-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). This sensitization upon repetitive stimulations is in contrast to many other channels, including those that share similar structure, function, and mechanism of activation with TRPV3. For instance, TRPV1 and TRPV4 are both desensitized upon repetitive stimulations (8Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21569-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 19Bhave G. Zhu W. Wang H. Brasier D.J. Oxford G.S. Gereau IV, R.W.

A. 2003; 100: 8002-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Although TRPV1 and TRPV2 occasionally displayed enhanced responses to repeated heat stimulations when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (21Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar), the sensitization of TRPV3 appears to be independent of the stimuli, showing not only sensitizing responses to the same stimulus regardless whether it is heat, 2APB, or other chemical ligands but also cross-sensitization to stimuli of a different nature, for example, camphor caused a sensitization of the response to heat (10Moqrich A. Hwang S.W. Earley T.J. Petrus M.J. Murray A.N. Spencer K.S. Andahazy M. Story G.M. Patapoutian A. Science. 2005; 307: 1468-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The sensitization property of TRPV3 may be important for the body's response to skin sensitizers and allergens as well as inflammation. Here we show that sensitization of the TRPV3 channel involves an activity-dependent relief of Ca2+ block from both the cytoplasmic side via calmodulin (CaM) binding and the extracellular side through interaction at the pore. We identified a critical CaM-binding site at the N terminus and an essential aspartic acid at the pore loop that contribute to the sensitization of TRPV3. DNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—Murine TRPV3 cDNA in the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pIRES2EGFP (Clontech) vectors were obtained as described previously (15Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). To change Asp641 to Asn, two oligonucleotides, 5′-ATGTTCAGGTTACCCAGGCCTATGGTGAG and 5′-GGCCTGGGTAACCTGAACATCCAGCAG, were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA) and then paired with oligonucleotide 5′-TGTCCTCATCTGGGCCAC and the SP6 primer, respectively, in separate PCRs using the wild type TRPV3 as the template. All PCR conditions were standard as described before (22Wang C. Hu H.Z. Colton C.K. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37423-37430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) using Pfu polymerase and an annealing temperature of 56 °C. One of the PCR products was digested with BsrGI/BstEII and the other with BstEII/XbaI. The purified fragments were subcloned back to TRPV3/pcDNA3 opened with BsrGI/XbaI. To disrupt the N-terminal CaM-binding site, two oligonucleotides, 5′-TCTGAAGCTTCTGCCTGACTCTGTTCTTCC and 5′-GCAGAAGCTTCAGATGCAGAGGGCATCTTCGCGGC were paired with primers 5′-ATATCCATGGCCCACTCCAAGGATATG and 5′-CTACTTGGCAAATTTCTTC, respectively, for PCR as above, and the products were digested with BglII/HindIII and HindIII/BspEI. The two fragments were then subcloned back to TRPV3/pIRES2EGFP opened with BglII/BspEI. Mutant clones were selected based on the creation of a BstEII site for D641N and a HindIII site for TRPV3RK– (113RQKKKRLKKR122 changed to SQAEASDAEG). The mutated sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing performed at a sequencing facility at Ohio State University. The D641N-RK– double mutant was created by subcloning the BglII/BspEI fragment from TRPV3RK– to D641N opened by the same pair of enzymes. Cells and Transfections—HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed in wells of a 96-well plate using Lipofectamine 2000 as described previously (15Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The pIRES2EGFP vector was used throughout for the bicistronic expression of TRPV3 (or one of its mutants) and the green fluorescence protein to facilitate the identification of transfected cells for patch clamp experiments. One day after transfection, cells were reseeded in 35-mm dishes at low densities and used within 1 or 2 days. Intracellular Ca2+ Measurement—HEK293 cells transiently transfected in wells of 96-well plates with TRPV3 in pcDNA3 vector or pcDNA3 alone were loaded with Fluo4 and assayed for 2APB-induced fluorescence changes using a fluorescence plate reader as described (15Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). To study internal Ca2+ release, the cells were washed three times in a Ca2+-free bath (omitting CaCl2 with the addition of 0.1 mm EGTA) and then assayed in the same bath. Electrophysiological Studies—Recording pipettes were pulled from micropipette glass (World Precision Instruments Inc, Sarasota, FL) and fire-polished. The resistance was 2–4 megohms when filled with an internal solution and placed in a bath solution listed in Table 1. Isolated cells were voltage-clamped in the whole-cell mode using an EPC9 amplifier (HEKA Instruments Inc., Southboro, MA). Voltage commands were made from the Pulse+Pulse Fit program (version 8.53, HEKA) and currents recorded at 5 kHz. Cells were held at 0 mV. Two protocols were used. The voltage ramp protocol was composed of repeated applications (at 2 Hz) of 100-ms ramps to +100 mV after a brief step to –100 mV for 20 ms. The step protocol was composed of 16 episodes of 300-ms step pulses with a 20-mV increment starting from –100 mV. Each step pulse was followed by a 250-ms step to –100 mV, giving rise to tail currents. Cells were continuously perfused with bath solution through a gravity-driven multiple outlet device with the desired outlet placed about 50 μm away from the cell being recorded. 2APB and other drugs were diluted in appropriate external solutions to the desired final concentrations and applied to the cell through perfusion. To ensure the dialysis of Ca2+ buffers and CaM antagonists, cells were equilibrated for >4 min after break-in before first stimulation was applied. All recordings were performed at the room temperature, 22–24 °C.TABLE 1Solutions used for whole-cell experimentsMonovalentDivalentCa2+ bufferGlucosepHBufferValueAdjusted byInternal solutions 1 EGTA140 CsCl0.6 MgCl21 Cs-EGTA10 Hepes7.2CsOH 10 EGTA108 CsCl0.6 MgCl210 Cs-EGTA10 Hepes7.2CsOH 1 BAPTA140 CsCl0.3 MgATP1 K-BAPTA10 Hepes7.2CsOH 10 BAPTA108 CsCl0.6 MgCl210 Cs-BAPTA10 Hepes7.2CsOH 1.6 μm Ca2+90 CsCl8.87 CaCl2/0.6 MgCl210 Cs-BAPTA10 Hepes7.2CsOHExternal solutions Normal145 NaCl2 CaCl2/1 MgCl21010 Hepes7.4NaOH NMDG150 NMDG-Cl1010 Hepes7.4NMDG+ Ca2+-free145 NaCl1 MgCl20.1 Na-EGTA1010 Hepes7.4NaOH pCa > 8145 NaCl1 MgCl21 Na-EGTA1010 Hepes7.4NaOH 10-4 Ca2+145 NaCl0.59 CaCl2/1 MgCl21 Na-EGTA1010 Hepes7.4NaOH 3 × 10-4 Ca2+145 NaCl0.81 CaCl2/1 MgCl21 Na-EGTA1010 Hepes7.4NaOH 0.001 Ca2+145 NaCl0.94 CaCl2/1 MgCl21 Na-EGTA1010 Hepes7.4NaOH 0.003 Ca2+145 NaCl0.42 CaCl2/1 MgCl21 Na-HEDTA1010 Hepes7.4NaOH 0.01 Ca2+145 NaCl0.72 CaCl2/1 MgCl21 Na-HEDTA1010 Hepes7.4NaOH 0.03 Ca2+145 NaCl0.91 CaCl2/1 MgCl21 Na-HEDTA1010 Hepes7.4NaOH 0.1 Ca2+145 NaCl0.1 CaCl2/1 MgCl21010 Hepes7.4NaOH 0.3 Ca2+145 NaCl0.3 CaCl2/1 MgCl21010 Hepes7.4NaOH 1 Ca2+145 NaCl1 CaCl2/1 MgCl21010 Hepes7.4NaOH 3 Ca2+145 NaCl3 CaCl2/1 MgCl21010 Hepes7.4NaOH 10 Ca2+133 NaCl10 CaCl2/1 MgCl21010 Hepes7.4NaOH 30 Ca2+103 NaCl30 CaCl2/1 MgCl21010 Hepes7.4NaOH Open table in a new tab CaM Binding Assay—Constructs for TRPV3 fragments fused to the C terminus of maltose-binding protein (MBP), in vitro synthesis of 35S-labeled MBP fusion proteins, and assay conditions for their binding to CaM were essentially the same as described previously (23Zhang Z.

Briefly, segments of TRPV3 cDNA were generated by restriction digests or PCR. The encoded peptides were synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and then incubated with CaM-agarose in the absence or presence of 50 μm free Ca2+ buffered with 10 mm HEDTA. The amount of peptide retained by CaM-agarose was revealed by autoradiography after separation of the washed products by SDS-PAGE. Data Analyses—Tail currents were normalized to the maximal current and fitted using a modified Boltzmann Equation 1, Itail/Imax(&percnt;)=b+a/(1+exp(-(V-V1/2)/S))(Eq. 1) where the constants are explained under “Results.” For current that did not reach steady state at the end of the step pulse, the steady-state current was estimated from the exponential fit of the recorded activation curve and then used to calculate the conductance. Activation kinetics were fitted with one exponential as shown in Equation 2, A=a×(1-exp(-t/τact))(Eq. 2) where a is the peak current amplitude, and τact is the activation time constant. Dose dependence of extracellular Ca2+-mediated inhibition was fitted with the two-site Equation 3, I[Ca]/Imax=fH/(1+[Ca]/kH)+(1-fH)/(1+[Ca]/kL)(Eq. 3) where fH is the fraction of the high affinity state, and kH and kL are IC50 values of the high and low affinity state, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed by Student's t test using Microcal Origin. p < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. Summary data are expressed as means ± S.E. Chemicals—2APB was from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte system was from Promega (Madison, WI). BAPTA, EGTA, HEDTA, W-7, calmidazolium, and ophiobolin A were from Sigma. Fluo4-AM, thapsigargin, Lipofectamine 2000. and all cell culture medium and reagents were from Invitrogen. Sensitization to Repetitive Stimulation Results from the Relief of Cytoplasmic Ca2+-mediated Inhibition on the Voltage Dependence of TRPV3 Activation—Repeated temperature challenges and 2APB applications are both well known to cause sensitization of the native channel in skin keratinocytes and ectopically expressed TRPV3 in HEK293 cells (14Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5177-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 17Xu H. Ramsey I.S. Kotecha S.A. Moran M.M. Chong J.A. Lawson D. Ge P. Lilly J. Silos-Santiago I. Xie Y. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). We noticed a strong effect of intracellular Ca2+ buffering on the current development of TRPV3 expressed in HEK293 cells both at the level of maximal current density and the process of sensitization to repetitive applications of 2APB. Fig. 1, A and B, shows that under whole-cell conditions, a continued application of 100 μm 2APB activated TRPV3 expressed in HEK293 cells very slowly. The currents recorded by voltage ramps show double rectifications at both negative and positive potentials and a reversal potential at 0 mV. The inward currents at negative potential were completely abolished, and the reversal potential was shifted to more negative than –70 mV by replacing cations in the extracellular solution with N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+), indicative of cation conductance. Interestingly, following a transient upshot upon switching to the NMDG+ solution, which is because of the removal of external Ca2+ (see later Fig. 8A), the currents at positive potentials were also largely blocked by NMDG+ and the reversal potential returned to near 0 mV, suggesting that NMDG+ may be able to enter and plug the TRPV3 pore.FIGURE 8Activation of TRPV3 in Ca2+-free bath solution. A, removal of extracellular Ca2+ strongly increased the 2APB-evoked currents. The pipette solution contained 10 mm BAPTA. A TRPV3-expressing cell was stimulated with 2APB in the normal bath (2 mm Ca2+) while the solution was switched to a Ca2+-free bath containing 0.1 mm EGTA and the same concentration of 2APB. Note the sudden increase of the current size at both the positive (+100 mV) and negative (–100 mV) potentials and linear I-V (right plot) upon Ca2+ removal and the quick re-inhibition when extracellular Ca2+ was reintroduced. B and C, response of TRPV3 to repetitive 2APB applications in the Ca2+-free bath. The pipette solution contained either 10 mm BAPTA (B) or 1 mm EGTA (C). D and E, summary data for peak current densities at +100 (filled symbols) and –100 mV (open symbols) for repetitive 2APB stimulations with pipette solutions that contained 10 mm BAPTA (circles), 1 mm EGTA (triangles), or 10 mm BAPTA with free Ca2+ buffered at 1.6 μm (E) supplemented (squares) or not (diamonds) with 20 μm ophiobolin A. F, 2APB-evoked [Ca2+]i changes in HEK293 cells that expressed TRPV3 (black) or the vector control (gray). Cells were loaded with fluo4 20 h post-transfection, washed with either normal or the Ca2+-free bath, and then stimulated with 166 μm 2APB in the corresponding solutions. Note the significant fluorescence increase in the Ca2+-free bath and the lack of response in the control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Currents developed faster and reached higher amplitudes when intracellular Ca2+ was buffered by 10 mm BAPTA (Fig. 1A) than by 1 mm EGTA (Fig. 1B, also see summary in Fig. 1, C and D). The current plateau was achieved with the BAPTA internal solution after about 6 min of stimulation by 2APB but was not reached with the EGTA solution even after more than 10 min. Sensitization occurred when 2APB was applied repeatedly with short (∼30 s) intervals as illustrated in Fig. 2, A and B, but not when it was applied twice for 30 s with a 10-min interval (Fig. 2C). The latter example indicates that sensitization is not because of the loss of cellular content or other changes during the long period of whole-cell dialysis. With the EGTA-buffered internal solution, the first few responses were very small and sometimes undetectable. Sensitization occurred slowly and did not reach the maximum until the cells were repeatedly stimulated for more than 17 times (Fig. 2, B and D). By contrast, with 10 mm BAPTA in the internal Ca2+ buffer, the initial responses were larger than with 1 mm EGTA, and the response approached the maximum after about 6 stimulations (Fig. 2, A and D). Because of the very low initial response, the extent of sensitization was more prominent with EGTA-buffered than with BAPTA-buffered internal solution. The rate of sensitization, however, was slower with EGTA than with BAPTA. Despite having similar affinities, EGTA binds to Ca2+ about 100–1,000 times more slowly than BAPTA (25Stern M.D. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 26Naraghi M. Neher E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6961-6973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus allows Ca2+ to rise longer and diffuse further. Fig. 2E shows a simulation of Ca2+ diffusion in the BAPTA and EGTA internal solutions using the PORE program (developed by J. Kenton and available on line). The free Ca2+ concentration in 10 mm BAPTA dissipates to less than 0.1% of the initial concentration at the source (e.g. 1 mm) within a distance of 10 nm, whereas in 1 mm EGTA, this distance is more than 33 nm. The simulation also revealed that the diffusion patterns are rather similar between 1 and 10 mm EGTA. Consistently, the patterns of sensitization of TRPV3 to repeated 2APB stimulations are also very similar between the two EGTA solutions (Fig. 2D). According to the above simulation, intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) increases, which occur as a result of TRPV3 activation, should be more pronounced and longer lasting in the EGTA than in the BAPTA internal solution. Therefore, the results in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that Ca2+ rise at the cytoplasmic side is inhibitory to TRPV3 activity. This intracellular Ca2+-dependent inhibition appears to be strong during the initial stimulations and is gradually relieved after repeated channel activation. Consistent with this interpretation, when free Ca2+ concentration in the 10 mm BAPTA internal solution was increased to ∼1.6 μm, the initial responses of TRPV3 to 2APB also became small, and the rate of sensitization was slowed (see Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the inward current, which mediates Ca2+ entry and hence contributes to cytoplasmic Ca2+ fluctuations, deactivated more in the EGTA than in the BAPTA solution as revealed by the voltage step from 0 to –100 mV (Fig. 2F). For some thermo-TRPs, e.g. TRPV1 and TRPM8, changes in voltage dependence may underlie the main mechanism of channel activation in response to temperature changes as well as chemical ligands (27Voets T.

Caterina M.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5177-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To examine the voltage dependence of the TRPV3 channel during repetitive stimulations by 2APB, we measured the currents at –100 mV immediately following voltage steps (300 ms) to different potentials from –100 to +200 mV with a 20-mV increment. This series of “tail” currents reflect the relative open probability of the channel at the potential before stepping to –100 mV. Plotting these open probabilities as a function of membrane potentials applied through the pre-step pulses gives rise to conductance-voltage (G-V) relationships that can be fitted by a modified Boltzmann equation with constants describing the potential for half-maximal channel activation (V½), voltage-dependent fraction (VDF, a) and voltage-independent fraction (b) of the total activity, and the slope factor s = RT/zF, with z being the valence of the gating charge. As shown in Fig. 3, TRPV3-expressing cells were repeatedly stimulated with 2APB. The step protocol was used for the 1st, 10th, 17th, 24th, 31st, and 38th stimulations, whereas voltage ramps were used to record the currents during other stimulations. The pipette solution contained either 1 mm EGTA (Fig. 3A) or 10 mm BAPTA (Fig. 3B). With repetitive stimulations, the G-V curves shifted gradually to the left (Fig. 3C). This shift was larger but also occurred more slowly with the EGTA than with the BAPTA internal solution. The V½ in the EGTA solution decreased nearly 100 mV from 144 ± 12 mV during the 1st stimulation to 47 ± 11 mV in the 24th stimulation and stabilized afterward. By comparison, the V½ in the BAPTA solution decreased from 77 ± 14 to 13 ± 4 mV after 24 stimulations, and the voltage dependence stabilized after about 10 stimulations (Fig. 3D, top). With the EGTA internal solution, nearly all activities were voltage-dependent. A small fraction (<3%) of voltage-independent activity only appeared after 20 repetitive stimulations (Fig. 3D, bottom). By contrast, the voltage-independent activity was more pronounced with the BAPTA solution, reaching 12 ± 5% at the 24th stimulation. The valence"

APP homodimerization is likely to be mediated by two sites of the ectodomain and a third site within the transmembrane sequence of APP. We have now investigated the role of the N-terminal growth factor-like domain in APP dimerization by NMR, biochemical, and cell biological approaches. Under nonreducing conditions, the N-terminal domain of APP formed SDS-labile and SDS-stable complexes. The presence of SDS was sufficient to convert native APP dimers entirely into monomers. Addition of an excess of a synthetic peptide (APP residues 91-116) containing the disulfide bridge-stabilized loop inhibited cross-linking of pre-existing SDS-labile APP ectodomain dimers. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that this peptide specifically bound to the N-terminal domain of APP and that binding was entirely dependent on the oxidation of the thiol groups. By solution-state NMR we detected small chemical shift changes indicating that the loop peptide interacted with a large protein surface rather than binding to a defined pocket. Finally, we studied the effect of the loop peptide added to the medium of living cells. Whereas the levels of α-secretory APP increased, soluble β-cleaved APP levels decreased. Because Aβ40 and Aβ42 decreased to similar levels as soluble β-cleaved APP, we conclude either that β-secretase binding to APP was impaired or that the peptide allosterically affected APP processing. We suggest that APP acquires a loop-mediated homodimeric state that is further stabilized by interactions of hydrophobic residues of neighboring domains.

Recently, elucidation of the γ-secretase cleavage mechanism has revealed that a conserved GXXXG motif in the transmembrane sequence of APP mediates homophilic helix-helix interactions and has an important role in the processing of Aβ40/42 into shorter Aβ species, i.e. Aβ38, Aβ37, Aβ35, and Aβ34 (7Munter L.M.

Unraveling structural features of APP by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography has led to the identification of specific regions that function as subdomains (see Fig. 1A). The extracellular N-terminal domain of APP has been dissected into the E1 region consisting of the N-terminal growth factor-like domain (GFLD) followed by the copper-binding domain (CuBD) (10Daigle I. Li C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12045-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). An acidic region (residues 190-264) precedes the carbohydrate domain, which contains the N-glycosylation site of the ectodomain (11Kitaguchi N. Takahashi Y. Oishi K. Shiojiri S. Tokushima Y. Utsunomiya T. Ito H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate domain together with the juxtamembrane region (residues 507-589) is called E2 or the central APP domain (12Dulubova I. Ho A. Huryeva I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9583-9588Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The homophilic binding between extracellular and transmembrane domains of APP is of considerable interest because of possible implications in its functional role and regulatory aspects for APP processing into Aβ peptides. We and others have shown previously that APP and other substrates of the γ-secretase (e.g. ErbB-4 and E-cadherin) can form homodimers (13Beher D. Hesse L. Masters C.L. Multhaup G. J. Biol.

A rough quantification of APP homodimerization in living higher eukaryotic cells by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis yielded about 30% APP homodimers of total membrane-bound APP (7Munter L.M.

The third site is localized within the transmembrane sequence of APP and determines on γ-secretase cleavages but leaves dimerization of full-length and secreted APP unaffected (7Munter L.M. Voigt P.

The homophilic binding mechanism of APP is still a subject of debate. In this study, we explored the proposed N-terminal site of APP dimerization and its impact on APP processing. NMR, biochemical, and cell biological approaches were applied to elucidate the involvement of the disulfide bridge-stabilized (between Cys-98 and Cys-105) loop and its basic residues in the dynamics of the conformation and APP cleavage by secretases. Plasmids and Transfections—For stable expression of APP, the plasmid pCEP4 (Invitrogen) containing the cDNA of APP695 was used as described previously (7Munter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M. Langosch D. Multhaup G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and transfected into SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC CRL-2266, Manassas, VA) using Transfectin (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cloning, expression, and enrichment of the β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) ectodomain were performed as described previously (20Schmechel A. Strauss M. Schlicksupp A. Pipkorn R. Haass C. Bayer T.A. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39710-39717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Loop Peptide Synthesis—The wild type (WT) loop peptide (NWCKRGRKQCKTHPHFVIPYR) or peptide (PVTIQNWCKRGRKQCKTHPHFVIPYR) for NMR experiments containing intramolecular disulfide bridges formed by the indicated cysteine residues and a loop mutant (mut) control peptide containing Ser residues instead of Cys residues to inhibit the disulfide bond arrangement (NWSKRGRKQSKTHPHFVIPYR) were synthesized with the automated system ABI 433a (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on Trt-Tentagel resin (0.25 mmol/g, 0.5 g; Rapp-Polymere, Tübingen, Germany) using the Fmoc strategy (double couplings with 9 eq of Fmoc amino acids/(2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/6 eq of N,N-diisopropylethylamine). After final cleavage/deprotection using trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (9:1), crude peptides were purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC to yield final products of 95% purity according to HPLC analysis (detector, 220 nm). For cyclization (disulfide formation), peptides (1 mg/ml) were dissolved in sodium bicarbonate buffer at pH 8.5, and the mixture was stirred while exposed to air for 3 days. After lyophilization, the crude product was purified by preparative HPLC and characterized by MALDI mass spectrometry, which gave the expected masses for the linear and cyclic peptides (see supplemental Fig. 1). For the experiments, loop-WT and loop-mut were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4 at concentrations of 5 mg/ml, which equals concentrations of 2.06 mm loop-WT and 2.03 mm loop-mut, and further diluted as indicated in the individual experiment descriptions. Sandwich Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Western Blots—Stably transfected cells were plated at a density of 2.8 × 105 cells/12-well dish. The day after splitting, 200 μl of fresh medium (Opti-MEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with either vehicle control (PBS) or loop-WT or loop-mut peptides were added and incubated for 6 h. Aliquots of the conditioned medium were directly analyzed for secreted APP. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunolabeled either with antibody W0-2 (21Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol.

Paganetti, Novartis) to detect sAPPβ. sAPPβ signals were densitometrically quantified using the Alpha Imager and suitable AlphaEase software (Alpha Innotech). For Aβ40- and Aβ42-specific ELISAs, 50 μl of medium were analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions (The Genetics Company, Zurich). The same protocol was applied to determine sAPPα levels except that the anti-Myc antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) was used as the capture antibody. BACE Activity Assay—The BACE ectodomain enriched by Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) ion exchange chromatography from supernatants of stably transfected HEK293 cells was concentrated with 30-kDa cut-off Amicon spin columns (Millipore). For the enzymatic reaction, 20 μl of soluble BACE (PBS or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as control) were incubated in 100 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm NaAc, pH 5, 100 μm substrate) at room temperature with or without 25, 50, and 100 μm loop peptides. BACE activity was measured by quantifying cleavage of the fluorescent substrate Cy3-SEVNLDAEFK-(Cy5Q)-NH2 (22Westmeyer G.G. Willem M. Lichtenthaler S.F. Lurman G. Multhaup G. Assfalg-Machleidt I.

Biacore Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance analysis (Biacore 3000, GE Healthcare) of peptide binding to APP18-350 was done at 25 °C in 1× PBS buffer without detergent at flow rates of 30 μl/min according to standard protocols provided by the manufacturer. Recombinant APP was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip via standard NHS/EDC activation chemistry (Biacore amine coupling kit) in amounts that yielded 1,600 response units. Peptides were dissolved (10 mg/ml in water), diluted to a working solution of 1 μg/μl, and injected at concentrations of 6-18 μg/ml for 1 min followed by a 10-min elution with the PBS buffer. The sensor chip was cleaned of immunocomplexes by the injection of 10 μl of regeneration solution (50 mm NaOH). The base lines for the curves shown in Fig. 4 were adjusted to zero for a better comparison of the results. Kinetic constants were obtained by fitting curves to a single-site binding model (A + B = AB) with mass transfer using the BIAe-valuation 4.1 program (Biacore). The time frame from 90 to 125 s was used to calculate the association rate constant. For the dissociation rate constant, a time frame from 150 to 700 s was chosen. Purification of Recombinant APP—APP18-350 was produced in Pichia pastoris using the inducible promotor of the alcohol oxidase (AOX) and purified as described previously (16Rossjohn J. Cappai R.

Briefly, recombinant APP-containing supernatant of the growth culture medium was first purified by anion exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose, GE Healthcare) and eluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, by a linear NaCl gradient up to 1 m NaCl. APP-containing fractions were concentrated to 20% of the initial volume with Amicon centrifugal tubes (30-kDa cut-off, Millipore). Subsequently, the APP-containing solution was loaded onto a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) column (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) in buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4 and 100 mm NaCl at pH 6.9. The column was calibrated with standard protein markers (gel filtration LMW and HMW calibration kits, GE Healthcare). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining of the gel or Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody 22C11 (23Hilbich C. Monning U. Grund C. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26571-26577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical Cross-linking—Aliquots of 25-50 μg of purified APP18-350 (0.5-1 μg/μl) were incubated with either vehicle (PBS) or 8- and 16-molar excesses of loop-WT or loop-mut peptides for 60 min. The chemical cross-linking reagent dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl) propionate (DTSSP; Pierce) was freshly dissolved (10 mm in water) and added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cross-linking was allowed to proceed for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 7.5). All reactions were performed at 24 °C. For immunoblotting, 0.6 μg of treated and control samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with monoclonal antibody 22C11. NMR Measurements—Isotopically enriched APP18-350 was expressed in P. pastoris. Using a rich yeast/peptone/dextrose medium, we obtained ∼98 mg/liter purified APP18-350. In contrast, use of a 2H,15N,13C isotopically enriched yeast nitrogen base minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% (15NH4)2 SO4, 2%[13C]glucose) yielded only 7 mg/liter purified APP18-350. Growth of P. pastoris in minimal medium was accompanied by a drastic reduction of the pH value, which was readjusted by adding 100 mm phosphate buffer. Furthermore, expression of APP18-350 could only be achieved upon addition of 0.2 mg/liter CuSO4 to the growth medium. The expression of protein was induced by addition of 2% methanol to the medium. To avoid the suppression of promotors of the alcohol oxidases AOX1 and AOX2, cells were incubated in a medium containing 0.1% glycerol prior to induction. Purification of recombinant APP18-350 was achieved by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (phenyl-Sepharose, GE Healthcare) followed by gel permeation chromatography on Superdex 200 using a buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4 and 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.9. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The identity and integrity of APP were verified by Western blot analysis with monoclonal antibody 22C11 (23Hilbich C. Monning U. Grund C. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26571-26577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein was relatively unstable and showed degradation bands after 1 week (∼20%) as judged by SDS-PAGE under NMR conditions (20 mm phosphate buffer, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, at 30 °C). All described NMR experiments were therefore performed using fresh protein and were recorded within 7 days after protein expression to ensure that the employed protein was constitutively intact. All NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker 600-MHz Avance spectrometer equipped with a triple channel cryo-probe. The temperature was set to 30 °C in all experiments. 1H,15N correlation experiments were recorded using a standard heteronuclear single quantum correlation employing WATER-GATE for solvent suppression. For titration experiments, the typical APP18-350 protein concentration was on the order of 0.1 mm. The acquisition time in the direct dimension was restricted to 50 ms. A total of 256 increments were recorded in the indirect dimension. Assignment of the protein resonances was achieved by recording 15N-1H transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy HNCACB and HNCOCB experiments (24Salzmann M. Pervushin K. Wider G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13585-13590Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) using uniformly 2H-, 15N-, and 13C-labeled APP18-350. Spectra were acquired using 96 × 88 × 2048 real data points employing 32 scans per increment. Acquisition times in F1(15N), F2(13Cα/β), and F3(1HN) were 10.5, 2.6, and 68 ms, respectively. The carrier frequencies were set to 120.6, 42.7, and 4.7 ppm in the F1, F2, and F3 dimensions, respectively. Data were processed using the Bruker Topspin software and analyzed employing the program Sparky 3 (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). The Loop-WT Peptide Impairs APP-APP Interaction—In earlier studies we showed that the N-terminal domain of recombinant APP (residues 18-350) containing a disulfide-bonded loop is sufficient to form dimers and higher oligomers (17Scheuermann S. Hambsch B. Hesse L. Stumm J. Schmidt C. Beher D. Bayer T.A. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33923-33929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of the N-terminal loop in APP homointeraction, we expressed APP18-350 in P. pastoris and purified the protein as described previously (Fig. 1B) (16Rossjohn J. Cappai R. Feil S.C. Henry A. McKinstry W.J. Galatis D. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Parker M.W. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33923-33929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To differentiate between the effects of the disulfide bond itself and the basic residues flanked by the Cys residues in the primary sequence, we used a synthetic peptide that is referred to as the loop-WT peptide. As a control, we used a loop-mut peptide where Cys residues were replaced by Ser residues. The formation of the disulfide bridge in the loop-WT peptide was confirmed by MALDI mass spectrometric analysis (supplemental Fig. 1). Fractions containing native APP18-350 dimers were obtained in a final purification step by GPC on a calibrated Superdex 200 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Fig. 1B). At high sensitivity settings, when the APP dimer containing the peak (fractions 19-23) and the salt peak (fraction 27 and higher) were off-scale, peaks containing higher oligomers became visible. Proteins eluted in fractions 16-18 correspond to tetramers, fractions 12-15 to octamers, and fractions 5-11 to higher oligomers (Fig. 1B). Additionally, the oligomeric states observed by GPC could be verified by blue native gel electrophoresis (see supplemental Fig. 2). The determination of the protein content of collected fractions revealed that by far the majority of APP18-350 eluted as homodimers and that monomers were absent under the conditions used. The protein was essentially purified to homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 1, B and C). Fractions loaded onto the gel stained by silver were also analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometric analysis (data not shown). Only residual amounts of the yeast AOX could be detected and are visible as a faint band at 75 kDa (Fig. 1C). This was because of high levels of AOX expression after the induction of APP18-350 controlled by the AOX promotor. A closer inspection of results obtained by GPC and by SDS-PAGE indicates that under nonreducing conditions and in the presence of SDS, APP dimers are easily converted into monomers, tetramers into dimers, and higher oligomers mainly into tetramers (Fig. 1B). We found that SDS has a considerable influence on the monomer-dimer equilibrium of APP in the absence of reducing agents. Homomeric APP complexes could be separated by GPC into SDS-stable tetramers and dimers, whereas APP dimers obtained under native conditions were fully converted into monomers in the presence of SDS (Fig. 1B). Thus, APP dimers exist in SDS-labile and SDS-stable forms, the latter of which are derived exclusively from higher oligomers. The finding that under reducing conditions all forms of APP were entirely converted into monomers (data not shown) indicates that covalent intramolecular linkages as provided by Cys-98 and Cys-105 forming the disulfide bridge are required to stabilize a dimerization-prone conformation of APP. Although we cannot exclude that other disulfide bridges occurring in APP (residues 18-350) may contribute to oligomerization, we rather assume that hydrophobic interactions are involved. This view is also supported by the NMR data described below. To study specific effects of the loop peptide on dimerization of APP, fractions containing SDS-labile dimers (fractions 19-23) (Fig. 1B) were treated in the presence and absence of the loop peptide with DTSSP. DTSSP is a homobifunctional reagent that cross-links primary amines. After cross-linking, mainly dimers and low amounts of tetramers of APP became visible after SDS-PAGE and Western blotting but were not observed without the cross-linker (Fig. 1D). When reactions were performed with an 8- or 16-fold molar excess of the loop-WT peptide, the intensities of the dimer band (90 kDa) and the band representing tetramers (180 kDa) were weakened (Fig. 1D). Addition of the loop-WT peptide, but not the loop-mut peptide (Fig. 1D), inhibited the formation of covalently linked dimers and oligomers by affecting the monomer-dimer equilibrium of APP18-350. Thus, given that the dimers are not the result of intermolecular disulfide bridges, we conclude that the disulfide-bonded loop plays a crucial role in the noncovalent dimerization of APP. The Loop-WT Peptide Drastically Reduces Aβ Secretion—To investigate the possibility that the loop-WT peptide, which has been shown to modulate the conformation of recombinant APP (Fig. 1 and see Fig. 5), can have an influence on cellular APP, we incubated living cells with the synthetic peptide. We examined whether the loop-WT and loop-mut peptides could alter APP processing and generation of Aβ. SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing APP695WT were tested for α- or β-secretase activities (Fig. 2, A-D) by measuring soluble APP levels (sAPPα and sAPPβ) in the presence and absence of the loop-WT peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2014324993,"The yeast protein Dom34 has been described to play a critical role in a newly identified mRNA decay pathway called No-Go decay. This pathway clears cells from mRNAs inducing translational stalls through endonucleolytic cleavage. Dom34 is related to the translation termination factor eRF1 and physically interacts with Hbs1, which is itself related to eRF3. We have solved the 2.5-Å resolution crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dom34. This protein is organized in three domains with the central and C-terminal domains structurally homologous to those from eRF1. The N-terminal domain of Dom34 is different from eRF1. It adopts a Sm-fold that is often involved in the recognition of mRNA stem loops or in the recruitment of mRNA degradation machinery. The comparison of eRF1 and Dom34 domains proposed to interact directly with eRF3 and Hbs1, respectively, highlights striking structural similarities with eRF1 motifs identified to be crucial for the binding to eRF3. In addition, as observed for eRF1 that enhances eRF3 binding to GTP, the interaction of Dom34 with Hbs1 results in an increase in the affinity constant of Hbs1 for GTP but not GDP. Taken together, these results emphasize that eukaryotic cells have evolved two structurally related complexes able to interact with ribosomes either paused at a stop codon or stalled in translation by the presence of a stable stem loop and to trigger ribosome release by catalyzing chemical bond hydrolysis.

In living cells, elaborate quality control mechanisms are essential for ensuring the highest fidelity in the transfer and decoding of the genetic information, i.e. during DNA replication, transcription and translation of mRNAs into proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 1Echols H.

During the last decade, RNA biogenesis has proven to be a niche for the identification of new surveillance pathways aimed at clearing nonfunctional RNAs from the cells (6Garneau N.L. Wilusz J. Wilusz C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). For instance, the various steps responsible for the maturation of a mRNA (splicing, polyadenylation, capping,...) are sources of errors that will greatly affect the overall accuracy of gene expression. To prevent the translation of faulty mRNAs by the ribosome, eukaryotic cells have evolved several quality control systems whose roles are to detect and degrade these pools of aberrant mRNAs. In addition, these mechanisms also contribute to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and are implicated in certain diseases (7Holbrook J.A. Neu-Yilik G. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 8Kuzmiak H.A. Maquat L.E. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 306-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Among these quality control systems, the best studied is nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), 2The abbreviations used are:NMDnonsense-mediated mRNA decayNSDnon-stop decayMantmethylanthraniloylNGDNo-Go decaySeMetselenomethioniner.m.s.root mean squareGMPPNPguanyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate. a pathway targeting mRNAs harboring in-frame premature termination (nonsense) codons (9Amrani N.

Sci. 2006; 31: 639-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). NMD identifies and removes from the cytoplasm, aberrant mRNA that if translated could produce truncated proteins. This pathway functions through the concerted action between the translational apparatus (ribosome, release factors eRF1 and eRF3, Pab1), mRNA decay machineries (Dcp1-Dcp2, Xrn1, and exosome), and specific NMD factors whose number varies among species (Upf1, Upf2, Upf3, Smg1, and Smg5-7). Release factors eRF1 and eRF3 recognize stop codons in the ribosomal A-site and then interact with Upf1, a RNA helicase as well as with Pab1, which binds to the 3′-poly(A) tract. Growing evidence suggests that in yeast as well as in flies and worms, the discrimination between normal and aberrant stop codons is based on the aptitude of Pab1 and eRF3 to interact together. A premature stop codon would be too far from the 3′ poly(A) tract to allow the formation of the eRF3-Pab1 complex, leading to the assignment of this mRNA as aberrant and substrate of NMD (14Amrani N.

In mammals, NMD targets are recognized depending on a post-splicing exon junction complex of proteins that is deposited ∼20-24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junctions (17Hir Le H. Gatfield D.

A second pathway, non-stop decay (NSD), is dedicated to the clearance of mRNAs devoid of in-frame stop codons or prematurely polyadenylated (19Frischmeyer P.A. Hoof van A. O'Donnell K. Guerrerio A.L. Parker R. Dietz H.C. Science. 2002; 295: 2258-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 20Maquat L.E. Science. 2002; 295: 2221-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Hoof van A. Frischmeyer P.A. Dietz H.C. Parker R. Science. 2002; 295: 2262-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). NSD facilitates the release of the ribosomes stalled at the 3′ end of mRNAs and as a consequence, also protects cells from the production of aberrant proteins. In bacteria, proteins encoded by mRNAs lacking stop codons are marked for degradation by the addition of a transfer messenger RNA at their C-terminal extremities (22Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 23Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). In the eukaryotic NSD pathway, these mRNAs are detected and degraded by a completely different mechanism, which involves Ski7, the exosome, and the Ski complex (19Frischmeyer P.A. Hoof van A. O'Donnell K. Guerrerio A.L. Parker R. Dietz H.C. Science. 2002; 295: 2258-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 21Hoof van A. Frischmeyer P.A. Dietz H.C. Parker R. Science. 2002; 295: 2262-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Ski7 connects the exosome to the Ski complex via its N-terminal domain (24Araki Y. Takahashi S. Kobayashi T. Kajiho H. Hoshino S. Katada T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4684-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Its C-terminal domain is structurally related to the GTPase domain from translation elongation factor eEF-1A and the translation termination factor eRF3, two proteins that bind close to the ribosomal A-site. More recently, a novel mRNA surveillance pathway called No-Go decay (NGD) has been unraveled in yeast (25Clement S.L. Lykke-Andersen J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Doma M.K. Parker R. Nature. 2006; 440: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 27Tollervey D. Nature. 2006; 440: 425-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Engineering of a very stable stem loop into a mRNA forces the ribosome to pause during elongation, leading to the accelerated degradation of the mRNA via an endonuclease cleavage followed by rapid degradation by the exosome and the Xrn1 nuclease. NGD involves at least two proteins, Dom34 and Hbs1. In yeast, Dom34 functions in protein translation to promote G1 progression and cellular differentiation (28Davis L. Engebrecht J. Genetics. 1998; 149: 45-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster and mouse, the Dom34 homolog named Pelota is required for correct mitotic and meiotic cell division (29Adham I.M.

According to primary sequence analysis, Dom34 is related to the translation termination factor eRF1 (32Koonin E.V. Bork P. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2166-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The eRF1 protein interacts with the translation termination factor eRF3 and its three-dimensional structure mimics that of a tRNA (33Song H. Mugnier P. Das A.K. Webb H.M. Evans D.R. Tuite M.F. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Cell. 2000; 100: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Dom34 interacts with Hbs1, which has been identified as an Hsp70 subfamily B suppressor and is a member of the family of eEF-1A-like GTPases (34Carr-Schmid A. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2564-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 35Inagaki Y. Blouin C. Susko E. Roger A.J.

El'skaya A.V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 60: 47-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) is the representative of this protein family that further includes eRF3 (38Kisselev L.L.

Kisselev L. Philippe M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4065-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) and Ski7, which is involved in exosome-mediated mRNA degradation and in the NSD pathway (19Frischmeyer P.A. Hoof van A. O'Donnell K. Guerrerio A.L. Parker R. Dietz H.C. Science. 2002; 295: 2258-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 21Hoof van A. Frischmeyer P.A. Dietz H.C. Parker R. Science. 2002; 295: 2262-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The Hsp70 Ssb1/2 chaperones interact with the nascent polypeptide chain at the exit of the ribosome channel during protein synthesis. In yeast, deletion of both ssb1 and ssb2 genes results in slower cell growth, in the decrease of the number of translating ribosomes and in slower translation (40Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Hbs1 suppresses this phenotype in yeast ssb1/ssb2 mutant strains. Based on these observations, Inagaki and co-workers (35Inagaki Y. Blouin C. Susko E. Roger A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4227-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have suggested that during translation elongation, Hbs1 may help in stop codon-independent peptide release from ribosomes stalled by the absence of Hsp70-mediated nascent polypeptide channeling. This is further supported by the involvement of Hbs1 and Dom34 in the NGD pathway (26Doma M.K. Parker R. Nature. 2006; 440: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Very recently, the crystal structure of the Dom34/Pelota protein from the archeon Thermoplasma acidophilum (hereafter called Ta Pelota) has been described (41Lee H.H. Kim Y.S. Kim K.H. Heo I. Kim S.K. Kim O. Kim H.K. Yoon J.Y. Kim H.S. do Kim J. Lee S.J. Yoon H.J. Kim S.J. Lee B.G. Song H.K. Kim V.N. Park C.M. Suh S.W. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 938-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Lee and colleagues (41Lee H.H. Kim Y.S. Kim K.H. Heo I. Kim S.K. Kim O. Kim H.K. Yoon J.Y. Kim H.S. do Kim J. Lee S.J. Yoon H.J. Kim S.J. Lee B.G. Song H.K. Kim V.N. Park C.M. Suh S.W. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 938-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed in vitro that the N-terminal domains from both T. acidophilum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dom34/Pelota display endonuclease activity against mRNAs that contain a stem loop, supporting the hypothesis that Dom34 is the endonuclease involved in the NGD pathway. Here, we present the 2.5-Å resolution crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Dom34 protein (hereafter called Dom34) and compare it to the structure of Ta Pelota. Yeast Dom34 is composed of three domains whose orientations are significantly different from those observed in the structure of Ta Pelota. Two of these domains are structurally homologous to eRF1. From the structure, we observe that all the eRF1 motifs known to be involved in the interaction with eRF3 have structural matches within Dom34. This resemblance is further supported by fluorescence experiments showing that Dom34 enhances the affinity of Hbs1 for GTP but not GDP as already observed for eRF1 with eRF3. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Dom34 and Hbs1—The DOM34 (YNL011w) and HBS1 (YKR084c) genes were amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae strain S288C as a template. An additional sequence coding for a His6 tag was introduced at the 3′ end of each open reading frame during amplification. The PCR products derived from DOM34 and HBS1 were then cloned into a derivative of pET9 vector (Stratagene). Expression of these proteins was done at 15 °C using the transformed Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS (Dom34) or Gold (DE3) (Hbs1) strains (Novagen) and 2×YT medium (BIO101 Inc.) supplemented with kanamycin at 50 μg/ml. For both proteins, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and stored at -20 °C. Cell lysis was achieved by sonication. Both His-tagged proteins were separately purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen Inc.) followed by gel filtration on a Superdex™ 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The Hbs1-Dom34 complex was purified on a Superdex™ 200 (16/60) column (Amersham Biosciences) after mixing of individual components. Protein labeling with SeMet was conducted as described (42Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Due to a decreased solubility compared with the native protein, the SeMet protein was purified as described above in the following buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. During protein concentration, the NaCl was decreased to 0.5 m. The homogeneity and SeMet labeling of Dom34 was verified by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. Fluorescence Measurements for Binding of Ligands—Methylanthraniloyl (Mant)-GTP and Mant-GDP were purchased from Jena Biosciences. Excitation was performed at 349 nm and emission scanned from 400 to 500 nm with a Cary Eclipse fluorospectrophotometer (Varian). Measurements were performed at 25 °C with 2 μm Hbs1 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol. Successive aliquots of ligands (from 0 to 20 mm) were added to the protein. Binding of ligands to Hbs1 or Hbs1-Dom34 (2 μm Dom34) was quantified by measuring fluorescence difference of Mant-guanine nucleotides at 448 nm against ligand concentration. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Structure Determination—Crystallization trials were performed at 18 °C. Crystals for the native protein were grown from a mixture in a 1:1 ratio of 9 mg/ml protein solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and crystallization liquor containing 7.5% polyethylene glycol 4000, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.7, 3% xylitol. Crystals for the SeMet protein (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) were grown under the same conditions after microseeding from crystals of the native form. All crystals were cryo-protected by transfer into the crystallization solution with progressively higher glycerol concentrations up to 30% (v/v) and then flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Native crystals diffracted to 2.6-Å resolution on beamline ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). These crystals belong to space group P3221 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit (cell dimensions a = b = 75.5 Å, c = 164 Å). Diffraction data (2.5-Å resolution) at the selenium edge were collected from a flash cooled SeMet crystal at 100 K on beamline BM30A (ESRF, Grenoble, France) (43Roth M. Carpentier P. Kaikati O. Joly J. Charrault P. Pirocchi M. Kahn R. Fanchon E. Jacquamet L. Borel F. Bertoni A. Israel-Gouy P. Ferrer J.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to space group P3121 with cell dimensions a = b = 75.6 Å, c = 324.5 Å (the c axis is twice longer than in native crystal), corresponding to two molecules per asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 60%. The structure was determined by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method using the selenium anomalous signal. Data were processed using the XDS package (44Kabsch W. J. Appl. Cryststallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). Eighteen of 20 (10 per Dom34 protomer) expected selenium atom sites were found with the program SHELXD in the 14-3.5-Å resolution range (45Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). These sites were then used by the SOLVE/RESOLVE package to calculate experimental electron density maps and to improve them by both NCS averaging and solvent flattening (46Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 47Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The quality of the experimental phases allowed automatic building of a partial model with the program RESOLVE (supplemental Fig. S1A). This model was completed by iterative cycles of manual rebuilding using the molecular modeling program “TURBO” followed by refinement with the program PHENIX in the 14-2.5-Å resolution range (48Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3692) Google Scholar). In the final model, the following Dom34 regions Met1-Phe47, Thr60-Tyr170, and Asp180-Asp382 could be modeled in the electron density as well as 228 water molecules, one phosphate ion from the crystallization solution and two glycerol molecules, which was used as cryoprotectant (supplemental Fig. S1B). In parallel, the structure of the native protein (one Dom34 protomer in the asymmetric unit) was refined using the program PHENIX and considering a twinning fraction of 6.5%, yielding R and Rfree factors of 22.6 and 28.8%, respectively. The statistics for data collection and refinement are provided in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure—The structure of S. cerevisiae Dom34 was solved using the single wavelength anomalous diffraction method from the anomalous scattering from SeMet-substituted protein crystals and refined to 2.5-Å resolution (Table 1). The excellent quality of the electron density maps allowed the building of a large majority of the 386 amino acids of this protein (supplemental Fig. S1). 24 loop residues (Thr48-Ser59, Ser171-Thr179, and Asp383-Glu386) were absent in the final model due to the lack of electron density, reflecting intrinsic flexibility. Two copies of Dom34 related by a 2-fold axis are present in the asymmetric unit. Although the interface between both copies buries a large surface (2,100 Å2), size exclusion chromatography indicated that the protein is monomeric in solution (data not shown). We have also refined the structure of the native protein to 2.6-Å resolution in a different space group with only one copy of Dom34 in the asymmetric unit. Dom34 adopts a “T” shape with overall approximate dimensions 30 × 55 × 80 Å3. It is organized into three domains with the arms of the T formed by both N-terminal and C-terminal domains and the vertical one by the central domain (Fig. 1A). The central domain interacts loosely with N-terminal and C-terminal domains (buried accessible surface area of 520 and 640 Å2, respectively), which are tightly packed together (buried accessible surface area of 1,030 Å2). Superimposition of the three independent copies of Dom34 (two SeMet labeled and one native) onto their N-terminal domain (r.m.s. deviation ≈ 0.35-0.4 Å over 130 Cα positions) reveals flexibility of the central and C-terminal domains relative to the N-terminal domain (supplemental Fig. S2). The two conformations can be superposed by a rigid body movement of these domains whose amplitude is inversely correlated to their contact area with the N-terminal domain, i.e. the central domain exhibits larger shifts than the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain (residues 1-135) consists of a highly bent 7-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (strand order β1, β2, β7, β3, β4, β5, and β6; Figs. 1B and 2) flanked on one side by two α-helices. This domain can be assigned to the Sm-fold family that is characterized by a N-terminal α-helix followed by a twisted five-stranded β-sheet. Compared with the canonical Sm-fold, two insertions (two N-terminal β-strands β1 and β2 and the C-terminal helix α2) are located on the same extremity of the domain (Fig. 1B). The closest structural homologs of this domain are E. coli Hfq (r.m.s. deviation of 2.5 Å over 55 Cα atoms; 7% sequence identity (49Schumacher M.A. Pearson R.F. Moller T. Valentin-Hansen P. Brennan R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3546-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar)) and SmD1 from human small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (r.m.s. deviation of 2.9 Å over 70 Cα atoms; 10% sequence identity (50Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. la Fortelle de E. Raker V.A. Luhrmann R. Li J. Nagai K. Cell. 1999; 96: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar)). Many Sm-fold containing proteins, including Hfq and SmD1, bind RNA and associate as homohexamers (bacterial Hfq) or heptamers (archaeal and eukaryotic proteins). The N-terminal domain of Dom34 has two important differences with members of the Sm family. First, the strands β1 and β2 from Dom34 occupy the location of strands β4 and β3 from the neighboring protomer in oligomeric Sm family members and therefore hamper the formation of an oligomeric structure as observed in Lsm proteins, for instance (Fig. 1B). Second, Dom34 lacks the Sm1 and Sm2 motifs implicated in RNA binding. Therefore, if the N-terminal domain of Dom34 is involved in RNA binding, the mechanism of recognition will be different to that of documented Sm family members. Sequence analysis of Dom34 protein suggested that the central and C-terminal domains were structurally analogous to the eukaryotic class I release factor eRF1 (32Koonin E.V. Bork P. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2166-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1C, the central domains of eRF1 and Dom34 are very similar (r.m.s. deviation of 2.1 Å over 95 Cα atoms; 12% sequence identity (33Song H. Mugnier P. Das A.K. Webb H.M. Evans D.R. Tuite M.F. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Cell. 2000; 100: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar)). In Dom34, this central domain (residues 136-277) has an α/β sandwich architecture with a five-stranded β-sheet (strand order β10, β9, β8, β11, and β12 with β9 antiparallel to the others) sandwiched by three helices (α3, α4, and αA) on one side and two (α5 and α7) on the other. The fold of the central domain is found in some endonucleases (E. coli RNase H1, RuvC resolvase, and the RNase H domain from human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (51Ariyoshi M.

Science. 1990; 249: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar)). The largest difference between the central domains of Dom34 and eRF1 resides in helix α3 that is 15 Å shorter in Dom34. This difference is very significant because the universally conserved GGQ motif of eRF1 is present in a loop at the C-terminal extremity of this helix. The central and C-terminal domains are connected by helix α7, which is kinked so that one-third belongs to the central domain and the remainder to the C-terminal domain. The latter adopts a mixed α/β-fold with a central four-stranded β-sheet (strand order β13, β16, β14, and β15 with β16 antiparallel to the others) flanked by two α-helices on each side. This domain is also structurally homologous to the eRF1 C-terminal domain (r.m.s. deviation of 2 Å over 96 Cα; 18% sequence identity; Fig. 3A). Effect of Dom34 on GTP Binding by Hbs1—We further wanted to find out whether the structural analogies between Dom34 and eRF1 indicate deeper functional similarities. Dom34 is known to interact with Hbs1, a protein homologous to class II release factor eRF3 (34Carr-Schmid A. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol"
https://openalex.org/W2159030877,"TRAIL/Apo2L (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is a multifunctional protein regulating homeostasis of the immune system, infection, autoimmune diseases, and apoptosis. However, its function in normal, nontransformed tissues is not clear. Here we show that TRAIL increases vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation in vitro, effects that can be blocked with neutralizing antibodies to TRAIL receptors DR4 and DcR1. In aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass grafts in vivo, TRAIL co-localizes with VSMC, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF1R) expression but not active caspase-3. TRAIL is required for serum-inducible IGF1R expression, and antisense IGF1R inhibits TRAIL-induced VSMC proliferation. At 1 ng/ml, TRAIL stimulates IGF1R mRNA expression greater than insulin-like growth factor-1 and also activates the IGF1R promoter 7-fold. TRAIL-inducible IGF1R expression requires NF-κB activation. Consistent with this, ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a pharmacological inhibitor of NF-κB, blocks TRAIL-induced IGF1R expression, and p65 overexpression increases IGF1R protein levels. In addition, NF-κB binds a novel TRAIL-responsive element on the IGF1R promoter. Our findings suggest that the biological functions of TRAIL in VSMC extend beyond its role in promoting apoptosis. Thus, TRAIL may play an important role in atherosclerosis by regulating IGF1R expression in VSMC in an NF-κB-dependent manner.

Furthermore, although TRAIL, DR4, and DR5 are expressed in normal and in diseased atherosclerotic tissue (10Schoppet M. Al-Fakhri N. Franke F.E. Katz N. Barth P.J. Maisch B. Preissner K.T.

Physiol. 2000; 278: L1045-L1050PubMed Google Scholar), the role of TRAIL in atherosclerosis is poorly understood, particularly its effect on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) biology. TRAIL can induce apoptosis of VSMC (12Gochuico B.R. Zhang J. Ma B.Y. Marshak-Rothstein A. Fine A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L1045-L1050PubMed Google Scholar, 13Niessner A. Sato K. Chaikof E.L.

Med. 2006; 203: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) demonstrated that plaque-derived CD4+ T cells induce VSMC apoptosis in a TRAIL-dependent manner (14Sato K. Niessner A. Kopecky S.L. Frye R.L. Goronzy J.J. Weyand C.M. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). TRAIL-induced apoptosis of vascular cells may therefore regulate cell turnover in the vessel wall. In contrast to these findings, recombinant human TRAIL administration attenuated development of plaques in diabetic ApoE-null animals and affected cellular composition of plaque lesions by inducing apoptosis of macrophages and increasing VSMC content (15Secchiero P. Candido R. Corallini F. Zacchigna S. Toffoli B. Rimondi E. Fabris B. Giacca M. Zauli G. Circulation. 2006; 114: 1522-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although this study suggests that TRAIL may protect VSMC, it is not clear if the increase in VSMC content was a direct effect of TRAIL or due to changes in other cell types. One of the most potent antiapoptotic growth factors for VSMC is insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), which binds the type 1 receptor (IGF1R). The IGF1R possesses intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, activating a number of downstream mediators, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (16Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 17Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). IGF1R activation initiates signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and transformation (18Valentinis B. Baserga R. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Interestingly, dominant negative IGF1R inhibits neointimal formation through suppression of VSMC proliferation, migration, and induction of apoptosis by Akt inhibition (19Lim H.J. Park H.Y. Ko Y.G. Lee S.H. Cho S.Y. Lee E.J. Jameson J.L. Jang Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 1106-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reduction of IGF1R expression in vascular pathologies, such as intimal thickening in atherosclerosis, instent neointimal proliferation after percutaneous coronary interventions, or pulmonary hypertension, might be beneficial given that down-regulation of IGF1R expression correlates with increased sensitivity to apoptosis in VSMC (20Kavurma M.M.

Weissberg P.L. Bennett M.R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, human plaque-derived VSMC have reduced IGF1R expression and a subsequent defect in IGF1R-dependent survival (21Patel V.A. Zhang Q.J. Siddle K. Soos M.A. Goddard M. Weissberg P.L. Bennett M.R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This may be potentially detrimental in advanced atherosclerosis, given that apoptosis of VSMC can lead to plaque vulnerability and rupture (22Clarke M.C. Figg N. Maguire J.J. Davenport A.P. Goddard M. Littlewood T.D. Bennett M.R. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), processes that can precipitate myocardial infarction and sudden death. We therefore examined the direct effects of soluble TRAIL on VSMC and its role in IGF1R signaling. We show that TRAIL promotes VSMC proliferation at low concentrations. The prosurvival and proproliferative effects of TRAIL on VSMC are IGF1R-dependent, and TRAIL up-regulates IGF1R via NF-κB-signaling. We have also identified a novel NF-κB site on the IGF1R promoter responsible for TRAIL-induced IGF1R expression and subsequent proliferation of VSMC. Cell Culture—Primary human VSMC were isolated from the aortas of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation under informed consent with ethical approval from the Huntingdon Local Ethics Committees. Human cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, and WKY12-22 rat VSMC were cultured in Waymouth's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum. Additional supplements included penicillin (10 units/ml), streptomycin (10 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (1 mm). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Human VSMC were not used beyond passage 10. Unless specified, WKY12-22 VSMC were used in all transfection experiments and luciferase assays. WKY12-22 cells were seeded into 6-well titer plates and at 40% confluence were starved for 24 h. The following day, the cells were transfected in serum-free medium with the indicated constructs and 10 ng/well pRL-SV40 using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). TRAIL was added at the same time as transfection. For transfections involving the NF-κB reporter (pNF-κB-Luc), TNFα was added 24 h after the transfection. The cells were stimulated for a further 24 h prior to harvest. Luciferase activity was quantified using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to the internal control pRL-SV40. Immunohistochemistry—Antibodies to TRAIL (1:100 dilution; R&D Systems MAB375), IGF1Rβ (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-713), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (1:50 dilution; Dako M879), active caspase-3 (1:50 dilution; BD Pharmingen 557035), and smooth muscle-α-actin (1:25 dilution, Novocastra ASM-1) were employed on consecutive paraffin sections of formalin-fixed aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass grafts with angiographic luminal stenosis of >75% explanted at redo operation at St. Vincent's Hospital (Sydney, Australia). Informed consent was obtained from each patient. The study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Human Research Committee of St Vincent's Hospital Sydney. Prior to staining, deparaffinized sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide (peroxidase blocking) and boiled in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, to retrieve antigenicity. The standard avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase technique was used (23Hsu S.M. Raine L. Fanger H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (13474) Google Scholar). After washing in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, sections were incubated in the primary antibody for 60 min, followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody (horse anti-mouse, vector BA-2000 or goat anti-rabbit, vector BA-1000) for 20 min, and finally with avidin-biotin complex (Elite Vector PK-6100) for 30 min. Immunogenicity was visualized by treatment in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution for 2 min, which produced brown coloration. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. As a negative control, the primary antibody was omitted, or the sections were treated with the immunoglobulin fraction of suitable nonimmune serum as a substitute for the primary antibody. No positive staining was observed in any of the negative control sections (data not shown). Human plaque tissue was obtained after informed consent with ethical approval from the Huntingdon or Cambridge Local Ethics Committees, respectively. Double labeling was performed as described by R&D Systems using the R&D cell and tissue kit, where the substrate was 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and for smooth muscle α-actin (SMA) the substrate vector was 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. TRAIL antibodies (1:25 dilution; R&D Systems) and SMA (1:500 dilution; DAKO) were used in this assay. Plasmid Constructs—The rat IGF1R promoter construct -476/+640 and -188/+640 was kindly provided by Haim Werner (Tel-Aviv University, Israel). pRL-SV40 was purchased from Promega. pebgNLS and pebgSp1 were obtained from Gerald Thiel (Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne). mNF-κB-476/+640 IGF1R was constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and oligonucleotides (mutation in boldface type): F-mNF-κB, 5′-GACTCCAAAAATGAATGCCTTGGGCGCCG-3′; R-mNF-κB, 5′-CGGCGCCCAAGGCATTCATTTTTGGAGTC-3′. pNF-κB-Luc was purchased from Stratagene. Proliferation and BrdUrd Incorporation Assays—Human VSMC were seeded into a 96-well titer plate (4000 cells/well). The following day, cells were starved for 24 h followed by the addition of human recombinant TRAIL (R&D Systems) for a further 24 h in serum-free medium. Where indicated, recombinant human IGF1 (Pepro Tech) was used as a positive control. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, and trypan blue exclusion or Coulter counting was utilized to analyze viable cells. For BrdUrd incorporation studies, the Cell Proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (Roche Applied Science) was used. Briefly, BrdUrd (10 μm) was added to the cells 24 h prior to harvest. Cells were fixed, incubated with anti-BrdUrd for 90 min, and washed in PBS, and immune complexes were detected by substrate reaction at A450. Absorbance correlates directly with DNA synthesis. For antisense (AS) and sense (S) assays targeting the IGF1R (24Du J. Delafontaine P. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), human VSMC were starved in serum-free medium for 6 h prior to transfection with AS or S using FuGENE6. The cells were arrested for a further 18 h. The following day, a second transfection with AS and S was performed in either TRAIL-containing medium (1 ng/ml, for proliferation assays) or DMEM containing 20% fetal calf serum (for protein expression). The cells were harvested 24 h later for cell counting or Western blotting. Sequences used were as follows: AS, 5′-TCCGGAGCCAGACTTCATTC-3′;S, 5′-GAATGAAGTCTGGCTCCGGA-3′ (24Du J. Delafontaine P. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In experiments involving TRAIL receptors, neutralizing antibodies to DR4 (Abcam), DcR1 (R&D Systems), DcR2 (R&D Systems), and OPG (R&D Systems) at the indicated concentrations were added at the same time as recombinant TRAIL stimulation at 1 ng/ml. For DR5, human recombinant DR5-Fc (Alexis Chemicals) was used in proliferation assays. An IgG control antibody or recombinant human IgG Fc were used as controls. Cells were harvested for counting 24 h later. Flow Cytometry for Annexin V/Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining—At 60–70% confluence, human VSMC were starved for 24 h followed by the addition of TRAIL at the indicated concentrations for a further 24 h. Cells were harvested as previously described (25Kavurma M.M. Santiago F.S. Bonfoco E. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4964-4971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Annexin V staining was analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 h. Results are expressed as annexin V staining as a percentage of the total cell population. Western Blot Analysis—Human VSMC were treated with TRAIL for 24 h after serum starvation for 24 h. For experiments involving ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC; Calbiobiochem), APDC was added to cells at the same time as TRAIL treatment. The cells were harvested using radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100% Triton X-100) or SDS-sample buffer, together with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). Proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked overnight containing 5% skimmed milk and 0.05% Tween 20. IGF1Rβ-chain was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:2500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), Sp1 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and β-actin was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:30,000; Sigma). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was isolated using STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) as described by the manufacturer. cDNA was generated from 1–5 μg of total RNA and analyzed using the Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Research) by absolute quantification. Taqman expression assay systems (Applied Biosystems) for human IGF1R, DR4, DR5, DcR1, DcR2, OPG, and β-actin were used. Values were normalized to β-actin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Human recombinant NF-κB p50 and p65 were purchased from Promega Corp. and Active Motif, respectively. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (25Kavurma M.M. Santiago F.S. Bonfoco E. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4964-4971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In binding reactions, recombinant protein or nuclear extract was incubated at room temperature for 20 min in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol), together with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and the indicated 32P-double-stranded oligonucleotides in a total volume of 20 μl. In supershift assays, extracts were incubated with antibody for 15 min, prior to the addition of the probe. Samples were resolved by 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: (i) NF-κB consensus annealed oligonucleotide purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (forward oligonucleotide, 5′-ACTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; reverse oligonucleotide, 5′-CGGACCCTTTCAGGGGAGTTGA-3′); (ii) NF-κB IGF1R oligonucleotide F-NF-κB IGF1R (5′-GACTCCAAAAAACAATGCCCCGGGCGCCG-3′) and R-NF-κB IGF1R (5′-CGGCGCCCGGGGCATTGTTTTTTGGAGTG 3′); (iii) mutant NF-κB IGF1R (mutation in boldface type), F-mNF-κB IGF1R (5′-GACTCCAAAAATGAATGCCCCTTGCGCCG-3′) and R-mNF-κB IGF1R (5′-CGGCGCAAGGGGCATTCATTTTTGGAGTG-3′). Statistics—Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Data were assessed for significance by Student's t test. Comparisons between three or more unpaired groups were made using analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered significant. TRAIL at Low Concentrations Stimulates Proliferation via DR4 and DcR1 without Inducing Human VSMC Apoptosis—We first examined the direct effects of soluble TRAIL on human VSMC. TRAIL stimulated human VSMC cell counts within 24 h with a peak concentration at 1 ng/ml compared with cells in serum-free medium (Fig. 1A, left). Consistent with these findings, increased BrdUrd incorporation was also observed, again with a peak effect at 1 ng/ml (Fig. 1A, right), suggesting that TRAIL stimulates proliferation of human VSMC. Interestingly, TRAIL-stimulated proliferation appears biphasic with only modest effects at higher concentrations. In addition, TRAIL treatment between 0.1 and 100 ng/ml did not induce apoptosis of human VSMC compared with untreated VSMC as determined by annexin V and PI staining (Fig. 1B). A significant increase in apoptosis was only observed at TRAIL concentrations of 400 ng/ml (Fig. 1B). These findings were supported by reduced proliferation of VSMC exposed to 400 ng/ml (Fig. 1C). Consistent with a direct effect of TRAIL on VSMC, we found that TRAIL, DR4, DR5, DcR1, DcR2, and OPG mRNA are all expressed in human VSMC, although at varying levels (Fig. 2A). To investigate which TRAIL receptor is responsible for the proproliferative effect of soluble TRAIL, VSMC were incubated with neutralizing antibodies or recombinant Fc protein to DR4, DR5, DcR1, DcR2, and OPG or an irrelevant control. Neutralizing DR4 and DcR1 antibody inhibited TRAIL-mediated proliferation at 0.1 μg/ml concentration, an effect not observed by the control, or by DR5, DcR2, and OPG (Fig. 2B). These findings illustrate that TRAIL at low concentrations stimulates proliferation via DR4 and DcR1, without inducing apoptosis of VSMC. TRAIL Is Expressed in Saphenous Vein Bypass Sections in Regions of VSMC Proliferation and IGF1R Expression—To examine whether TRAIL is present in human vessels and to analyze any association with VSMC proliferation, we examined human aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass grafts showing graft failure for TRAIL by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 3A). Strong SMA staining was observed in the intima at sites of graft stenosis, implying high VSMC content (Fig. 3A). TRAIL was expressed in regions that were SMA-positive (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this, TRAIL and SMA double-labeling was also evident in human atherosclerotic tissue (Fig. 3B). TRAIL also co-localized with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Fig. 3A), a marker of proliferation, and consistent with our in vitro findings, TRAIL staining did not correlate with increased apoptosis, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry for active caspase-3 (Fig. 3A). The IGF1R is important for proliferation of many cell types, including VSMC (27Li S. Ferber A. Miura M. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32558-32564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TRAIL expression also co-localized in part with that of the IGF1R (Fig. 3A). Thus, TRAIL is expressed in regions of VSMC proliferation in human disease and co-localizes with increased IGF1R expression. TRAIL Is Important for Inducible IGF1R Expression and IGF1R-dependent Proliferation of VSMC—To determine if TRAIL is important for IGF1R expression, serum-inducible IGF1R expression in VSMC was evaluated following treatment with a neutralizing antibody directed to TRAIL. TRAIL neutralizing antibody inhibited serum-inducible IGF1R expression of human VSMC compared with the isotype control (Fig. 4A). In addition, TRAIL-inducible VSMC proliferation was blocked by AS oligonucleotides targeting the IGF1R (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the S control had no effect (Fig. 4B). Western blotting for IGF1R expression in human VSMC confirmed the inhibitory effect of AS on IGF1R expression (Fig. 4C). These findings suggest that TRAIL is produced by VSMC in an autocrine or paracrine manner and that TRAIL-induced proliferation of VSMC is dependent on the IGF1R. TRAIL Induces IGF1R Gene Expression—To examine whether TRAIL directly regulates IGF1R expression in VSMC, we treated human VSMC with TRAIL for 24 h and performed quantitative PCR for IGF1R mRNA. TRAIL induced IGF1R mRNA expression over a range of concentrations (Fig. 5A), with a peak at 1 ng/ml, the same peak concentration that induced VSMC proliferation. IGF1-stimulated cells were used as a positive control (Fig. 5A). TRAIL, at the lower concentrations (0.1–1 ng/ml), also stimulated IGF1R protein production as assessed by Western blot, which was comparable with levels achieved by serum (Fig. 5B). TRAIL also increased IGF1R promoter activity (Fig. 5C), again with a peak at 1 ng/ml, suggesting that TRAIL regulates IGF1R transcription. These findings taken together demonstrate a positive effect of TRAIL on IGF1R expression in VSMC. TRAIL-inducible IGF1R Does Not Involve Sp1—To examine the molecular and transcriptional mechanisms of TRAIL-induced IGF1R expression, we used deletion constructs of the IGF1R promoter previously described (28Idelman G. Glaser T. Roberts C.T.J. Werner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3474-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Whereas -476/+640 of the IGF1R promoter was activated upon treatment with TRAIL at 1 ng/ml, -188/+640 failed to respond to TRAIL treatment (Fig. 6A). Within this region (-476/-188) there are six putative Sp1 elements (29Beitner-Johnson D. Werner H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of dominant negative Sp1 (30Petersohn D. Thiel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) on TRAIL-induced IGF1R expression. Basal expression of IGF1R protein was reduced in cells transiently expressing dominant-negative Sp1, consistent with previous reports (29Beitner-Johnson D. Werner H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6C). Overexpression of dominant-negative Sp1 increased Sp1 protein levels compared with the backbone control (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, TRAIL-induced IGF1R protein expression in VSMC was not blocked by this mutant construct (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, dominant negative Sp1 overexpression did not affect TRAIL-induced IGF1R promoter activity (data not shown). These findings taken together suggest that TRAIL-inducible IGF1R expression does not require Sp1. TRAIL Regulates IGF1R Expression via NF-κB—TRAIL activates NF-κB in endothelial cells (31Ashkenazi A. Pai R.C. Fong S. Leung S. Lawrence D.A. Marsters S.A. Blackie C. Chang L. McMurtrey A.E. Hebert A. DeForge L. Koumenis I.L. Lewis D. Harris L. Bussiere J. Koeppen H. Shahrokh Z. Schwall R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, TRAIL activated NF-κB in VSMC (Fig. 7A). Using an NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide for EMSA analysis, TNFα induced multiple bands, which could be supershifted with antibodies to p65 (RelA) and p50, components of NF-κB (Fig. 7A). Three nucleoprotein complexes were induced after TRAIL treatment at 1 ng/ml, also common to TNFα-treated cells (Fig. 7A, double-headed arrows). Furthermore, TNFα activated an NF-κB reporter vector (p-NF-κB-Luc), which was blocked by APDC, a pharmacological inhibitor of NF-κB (Fig. 7B). EMSA for NF-κB binding was performed with nuclear extracts of VSMC exposed to TRAIL at multiple concentrations. TRAIL increased NF-κB DNA binding at low concentrations (0.1–10 ng/ml) but not at the subapoptotic 100 ng/ml concentration (Fig. 7C). TRAIL at 1 ng/ml also activated p-NF-κB-Luc. In contrast, 400 ng/ml TRAIL did not (Fig. 7D). Furthermore, APDC blocked TRAIL-inducible IGF1R protein expression (Fig. 7E), suggesting that NF-κB plays a role in TRAIL-induced up-regulation of IGF1R. The role of NF-κB was further confirmed by transient transfection of the p65 component of NF-κB, which increased IGF1R expression in VSMC, whereas the backbone control, pcDNA3, had no effect (Fig. 7F). Taken together, these findings suggest that TRAIL activates NF-κB and that NF-κB regulates IGF1R expression in VSMC. Identification of a Functional NF-κB Site on the IGF1R Promoter—By sequence analysis, we identified a 100% putative consensus (RRRCWN0–13WGYY) NF-κB site between -476 and"
https://openalex.org/W2043003009,"beta-Defensins are important in mammalian immunity displaying both antimicrobial and chemoattractant activities. Three canonical disulfide intramolecular bonds are believed to be dispensable for antimicrobial activity but essential for chemoattractant ability. However, here we show that HBD3 (human beta-defensin 3) alkylated with iodoactemide and devoid of any disulfide bonds is still a potent chemoattractant. Furthermore, when the canonical six cysteine residues are replaced with alanine, the peptide is no longer active as a chemoattractant. These findings are replicated by the murine ortholog Defb14. We restore the chemoattractant activity of Defb14 and HBD3 by introduction of a single cysteine in the fifth position (Cys V) of the beta-defensin six cysteine motif. In contrast, a peptide with a single cysteine at the first position (Cys I) is inactive. Moreover, a range of overlapping linear fragments of Defb14 do not act as chemoattractants, suggesting that the chemotactic activity of this peptide is not dependent solely on an epitope surrounding Cys V. Full-length peptides either with alkylated cysteine residues or with cysteine residues replaced with alanine are still strongly antimicrobial. Defb14 peptide fragments were also tested for antimicrobial activity, and peptides derived from the N-terminal region display potent antimicrobial activity. Thus, the chemoattractant and antimicrobial activities of beta-defensins can be separated, and both of these functions are independent of intramolecular disulfide bonds. These findings are important for further understanding of the mechanism of action of defensins and for therapeutic design."

Although very high concentrations of NAD have been shown to enter cells, it is not known whether lower, more physiological concentrations are able to be taken up.

Pyridine nucleotides, although often considered as simple redox cofactors in the cell, are in fact multifunctional molecules involved in a wide range of cellular processes (1Ziegler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1550-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It is becoming clear that NAD(P) is involved in more pharmacologically attractive cellular processes such as cell signaling, transcriptional regulation, and post-translational protein modification (2Khan J.A.

The general perception is that cellular NAD is synthesized either de novo from tryptophan or via one of two possible recycling pathways: from nicotinic acid or nicotinamide (together referred to as vitamin PP, or niacin) (6Magni G. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Orsomando G. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recently, a third biosynthesis pathway has been described, which uses nicotinamide riboside as a precursor (7Bieganowski P. Brenner C.

Med. 2006; 12: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) has led to the investigation and description of several mechanisms for the export of NAD across the plasma membrane, including transport through connexins and stimulus-induced exocytotic release (9Bruzzone S.

Surprisingly, though, the possibility that low NAD concentrations can be imported across the membrane to directly replenish the cellular NAD(P) pools bypassing biosynthetic pathways has not been conclusively addressed.

Here we show that various mammalian cell types are able to transport picomolar concentrations of NAD across the plasma membrane from the extracellular medium. When intracellular NAD(P) levels were reduced by treatment with the NAD biosynthesis inhibitor FK866 (APO866, (E)-N-[4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl]-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide (25Hasmann M. Schemainda I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7436-7442PubMed Google Scholar)), application of NAD extracellularly was able to partially replenish these levels. Furthermore, cells could be rescued from FK866-induced NAD depletion, autophagy, and cell death by addition of NAD to the culture medium. These data, taken together, suggest that NAD uptake can participate in the homeostasis of cellular NAD levels. Cell Culture—NIH-3T3 murine epithelial cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 5% FBS (fetal bovine serum), 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. SH-SY 5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HMEC, HeLa, HaCaT, K562, and RAW 264.7 cells were cultured according to the conditions suggested by the ATCC. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C and were subcultured as needed by detaching the cells with 0.25% trypsin and 5 mm EDTA. [32P]NAD Transport—Cells plated in 6-well plates were grown to confluence. The wells were washed twice with 1 ml of warm Locke buffer (134 mm NaCl, 4 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) before addition of 0.5 ml of Locke buffer or modifications thereof (NMG Locke contained 134 mm N-methylglucamine in place of the NaCl (4 mm final Na+); EGTA Locke lacked CaCl2 with the addition of 500 μm EGTA). The reaction was started by the addition of 250 pm [32P]NAD (800 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 250 pm [32P]NAADP prepared as described previously (26Billington R.A. Genazzani A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Competing compounds and drugs were added to the wells before [32P]NAD unless stated in the text. After 10 min (except where indicated), the reaction was stopped by aspiration of the buffer, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of Locke buffer. The cells were then dissolved in 1 ml of 0.5 m NaOH. 2 ml of scintillation fluid was added, and the radioactivity associated with the cells was counted using a standard scintillation counting procedure for 32P. For HPLC analysis of transported NAD, cells were scraped after transport experiments in ddH2O, extracted by adding an equal volume of chloroform and run on HPLC as described previously (27Morgan A. Churchill G. Masgrau R. Ruas M. Davis L. Billington R. Patel S. Yamasaki M. Thomas J. Genazzani A. Galione A. Putney J.J. ed) 2nd. Methods in Calcium Signalling.

Briefly, cells were plated in 24-well plates and treated as indicated for the appropriate time. FK866 (dissolved in Me2SO), and the vehicle control were added to the cells to give a final Me2SO concentration no greater than 0.5%. Cells were washed once in Locke buffer and 300 μl of MTT (250 μg/ml in Locke buffer) was added before returning the cells to the incubator for 1 h to allow the formation of the purple formazan crystals. After 1 h, 600 μl of isopropanol/0.1 m HCl was added to each well, and the absorbance was read at 570 nm in a plate reader (Victor3V, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Alternatively, cell counts were performed. Briefly, cells were detached from the wells by trypsinization, stained with trypan blue to exclude dead cells, and counted in a Bürker Chamber. NAD(P) Cycling Assay—Total cellular NAD(P) was measured using an adaptation of the method described by Gasser et al. (28Gasser A. Bruhn S. Guse A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16906-16913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cells, grown and treated in 24-well plates, were scraped with the piston of a 1-ml syringe in 100 μl of ddH2O on ice, and were extracted with 1 volume of HClO4 (2 m) for 45 min on ice. The samples were then centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of K2CO3 (1 m). After a further 45-min incubation on ice, the insoluble potassium perchlorate was removed by centrifugation for 1 min at 13,000 × g. The final pH of the supernatant was 8-8.5. In a black 96-well plate (OptiPlate™-96 F: PerkinElmer Life Sciences) 60 μl of cycling mix was added to 100 μl of the extracted NAD(P). The cycling mix (60 μl) consisted of: 20 μl of 500 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 2 μl of 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 μl of 10 mm resazurin (prepared fresh), 5 μl of 100 mm glucose 6-phosphate (G8404, Sigma), 15 μl of 1 mg/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 15 μl of purified dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.4) (see below). Fluorescence (excitation 544 nm, emission 590 nm) was measured for each well using a plate reader (Victor3V, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Standard curves were generated with authentic NAD subjected to mock extractions were used to generate calibration curves. The diaphorase was purified as follows: 100 μl of enzyme solution (diaphorase, 12 mg/ml, in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0 adjusted with NaOH) was mixed with 200 μl of bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml in water) and 1.2 ml of a suspension (2% w/v) of activated charcoal in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the charcoal was removed by centrifugation (11,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was used directly for the cycling assay. To ensure that FK866, as an antagonist of an NAD-using enzyme, did not directly affect the enzymes of the cycling assay, calibration curves were performed in the presence and absence of 100 nm and 10 μm FK866. The calibration curves were not affected by the presence of FK866 (data not shown). Furthermore, the assay was not affected by nicotinamide mononucleotide at 100 μm. FK866—FK866 was synthesized using a shorter route with respect to that reported (29Biedermann E. Hasmann M. Loser R. Rattel B. Reiter F. Schein B. Seibel K. Vogt K. U. S. Patent 6. June 7 2005; 903: 118Google Scholar) (5 synthetic steps versus 7 synthetic steps). In brief, the commercially available 4-piperidine butyric acid hydrochloride was reduced to the corresponding alcohol using lithium aluminum hydride and then chemoselectively N-benzoylated. The product was then transformed into an azide using the diphenyl phosphoryl azide/1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene, sodium azide protocol. Finally, the Staudinger azide-amine reduction gave the amine. This compound was subsequently coupled with (E)-3-(3-pyridinyl)-2-propenylchloride (prepared starting from the corresponding carboxylic acid using oxalyl chloride) to give FK866 (overall yield over five steps: 11%). The identity of the product was confirmed by NMR (1H and 13C) and mass spectrometry. EYFP-LC3-β Translocation—Exponentially growing cells were transfected with pEYFP-LC3-β (kind gift of Prof. Jäättelä, Institute of Cancer Biology, Copenhagen, Denmark) by liposome transfection (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen) and seeded 1 day after the transfection on glass chamber slides. After the indicated treatments, the percentage of green cells (a minimum of 100 cells/sample) with green vacuoles (EYFP-LC3-β translocated from cytosol to autophagic vacuoles) was counted using a Leica TCS-SP2 Laser-scanning microscope. For the morphological evaluation of autophagic vacuoles and lysosome co-localization, the acidic compartment of cells was counterstained by labeling the cells by adding 50 nm of LysoTracker red (Molecular Probes) for 1 min at 37 °C to cell culture media immediately before confocal analysis. Cytochrome c and AIF Immunolocalization—Cells were grown on 18-mm coverslips and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of the specified compounds. Cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were washed and then incubated with an anti-cyt-c antibody (1:500, BD Biosciences) or with anti-AIF (1:250, Sigma-Aldrich) antibody in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, cells were stained with an AlexaFluor488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse-IgG (1:250, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were inverted and adhered to the glass slides using a mounting solution (DakoCytomation). Images from fluorescence patterns of the cells were obtained using a Leica TCS-SP2 microscope. Apoptotic Nuclei Staining—For confocal-microscopy analysis of DNA integrity and AIF nuclear localization counterstaining, neuroblastoma cells were plated on 12-mm glass coverslips and maintained for appropriate length of time with different compounds. DRAQ5 (Biostatus Ltd., Leicestershire, UK) DNA dye was used for nuclear staining of living and apoptotic cells (fragmented nuclei). Briefly, the dye was added to cultured cells at 10 μm for 30 min followed by fixing in a 3.7% PBS/paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS, stained for AIF protein (as described above), and mounted onto coverslips for visualization with a confocal microscopy (HeNe laser UV, 633 nm). To test whether NAD is transported into cells, NIH-3T3 cells were incubated for different lengths of time in Locke buffer containing 250 pm [32P]NAD, and the reaction was stopped by aspiration of the buffer followed by a wash step with 1 ml of Locke buffer. When the amount of [32P]NAD was determined by scintillation counting, a significant amount was recovered from the cellular fraction (Fig. 1A). This amount corresponded to 4.88 ± 0.28 fmol after 5 min and 29.81 ± 0.29 fmol (∼24% of total [32P]NAD present in the extracellular medium) after 1 h. We have previously shown a similar accumulation of NAADP into mast cells (17Billington R.A. Bellomo E.A. Floriddia E.M. Erriquez J. Distasi C. Genazzani A.A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 521-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and we tested the ability of NIH-3T3 cells to transport [32P]NAADP. When the experiment was repeated with 250 pm [32P]NAADP, 9.44 ± 0.75 fmol of NAADP were recovered after 5 min and 38.07 ± 0.57 fmol after 1 h. NAD uptake shows at least two phases with an initial rapid phase of transport followed by a prolonged phase of steady uptake up to at least an hour. NAD has previously been reported to bind to an extracellular P2Y purinergic receptor (P2Y11 (30Moreschi I. Bruzzone S. Nicholas R.A. Fruscione F. Sturla L. Benvenuto F. Usai C. Meis S. Kassack M.U. Zocchi E. Flora De A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31419-31429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)). To identify whether a transport mechanism or a receptor mechanism was responsible for the observed NAD accumulation, experiments were performed whereby cells were treated with unlabeled NAD (100 μm) before or after treatment with 250 pm [32P]NAD (Table 1). Cells were washed between treatments. Cells were also treated simultaneously with unlabeled and labeled NAD. The amount of NAD transported was reduced only in the co-treatment experiment indicating direct competition (Table 1). The lack of displacement when excess unlabeled NAD was added after the [32P]NAD indicates that a reversible binding site is not responsible, and the lack of inhibition by pre-treatment with unlabeled NAD rules out the presence of an irreversible binding site (Table 1). Furthermore, we can exclude that NAD is metabolized before transport, because all of the radioactivity remaining in the extracellular medium co-eluted with authentic NAD when assessed by HPLC (data not shown). We also assessed the fate of the transported [32P]NAD by extracting nucleotides and analyzing them by HPLC. We found that 65.4 ± 3.0% of the transported radioactivity co-eluted with authentic NAD(H), whereas most of the remaining radioactivity eluted in a single peak co-eluting with NADP (Fig. 1B).TABLE 1Transport of [32P]NAD in NIH-3T3 cells [32P]NAD was added at a concentration of 250 pm.

Analysis of these data allowed us to construct a Michaelis-Menten plot (Fig. 1C). The apparent Km of NAD transport was ∼190 μm while the Vmax was 429 pmol/well/10 min. To determine whether the transport mechanism observed was the same as those previously described for NAADP and cADPR, the pharmacological properties of the mechanism were investigated (Table 2). In particular, NAADP transport has been shown to be Na+- and Ca2+-dependent and sensitive to the nucleoside transport inhibitor dipyridamole (DPR (17Billington R.A. Bellomo E.A. Floriddia E.M. Erriquez J. Distasi C. Genazzani A.A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 521-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)), whereas cADPR transport has been shown to be Na+-dependent and via one of three mechanisms: CD38 dimers (31Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Usai C. Flora De A. Faseb. J. 1998; 12: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), nucleoside transporters (18Guida L. Bruzzone S. Sturla L. Franco L. Zocchi E. Flora De A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47097-47105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), or connexin hemichannels (10Bruzzone S. Franco L. Guida L. Zocchi E. Contini P. Bisso A. Usai C. Flora De A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48300-48308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As NIH-3T3 cells are CD38-negative (32Zocchi E. Daga A. Usai C. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. Marchetti C. Flora De A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8017-8024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we concentrated on the other two pathways. When NAD transport was performed in Locke buffer lacking NaCl or CaCl2 (see “Experimental Procedures”), uptake was found to be significantly reduced in the absence of extracellular Na+ (NMG Locke) but unaltered in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (EGTA Locke, Table 2). Because NAADP transport has previously been shown to be both Na+- and Ca2+-dependent, we investigated whether the insensitivity of NAD transport to extracellular Ca2+ was a cell-specific or nucleotide-specific effect (17Billington R.A. Bellomo E.A. Floriddia E.M. Erriquez J. Distasi C. Genazzani A.A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 521-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When NAADP transport was carried out in the absence of extracellular Na+ or Ca2+, uptake was significantly reduced in both buffers (NMG Locke: 44.8 ± 2.6% of control NAADP transport; EGTA Locke: 57.2 ± 3.5% of control NAADP transport). When NAD transport was performed in the presence of 100 μm of the nucleoside transport inhibitors DPR and nitrobenzylthioinosine or with the physiological substrates of these transporters (adenosine or uridine, 100 μm), the only treatment that inhibited transport was DPR (Table 2). Nitrobenzylthioinosine and uridine were without effect while adenosine significantly increased transport. These results suggest that nucleoside transporters are unlikely to mediate the uptake of NAD and that the effect of DPR is not related to the inhibition of these proteins. To evaluate the role of connexins, we used the inhibitors carbenoxelone (100 μm), enoxelone (100 μm), and octanol (1 mm). All three compounds were able to partially block NAD transport (Table 2).TABLE 2Pharmacology of [32P]NAD transport in NIH-3T3 cells Transport experiments were carried out for 10 minutes.

To test this, we decided to take advantage of FK866, an inhibitor of the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NMPRTase), which is a key enzyme in the NAD recycling pathway that mediates the production of nicotinamide mononucleotide from dietary nicotinamide (niacin) (6Magni G. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Orsomando G. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 25Hasmann M. Schemainda I.

Because it induces cell death via the reduction of cellular NAD levels (25Hasmann M. Schemainda I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7436-7442PubMed Google Scholar), it has now entered clinical trials for cancer treatment (2Khan J.A. Forouhar F. Tao X. Tong L. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2007; 11: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34Holen K. Saltz L.B. Hollywood E. Burk K. Hanauske A.R. Invest. New Drugs. 2008; 26: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In our hands, FK866 displayed an IC50 of 4.90 ± 0.55 nm for cell vitality when cells were treated for 72 h with maximal effect at 100 nm (∼78% cell death). FK866-induced cell death was time-dependent, with increasing levels of cell death between 24 (no apparent effect, data not shown) and 72 h (Fig. 2A). The IC50 values for cell death at 48 or 72 h were similar (Fig. 2A). Extracellularly applied NAD (100 μm) reverted the effect of FK866 (Fig. 2B). Because the cell vitality assay we employed is based on a respiratory activity, which might be biased by changes in NAD levels, we also carried out cell counts to evaluate viability, and all results mirrored those obtained by MTT confirming the validity of the results obtained in the cell vitality assay (Fig. 2B). We then tested whether FK866-induced cell death and rescue by NAD could be explained simply by intracellular NAD levels. To avoid artifacts due to cell death, we incubated cells with 100 nm FK866 for 24 h (an incubation time that yields no cell death) and evaluated total cellular NAD(P) levels with an NAD(P) cycling assay. Indeed, FK866 dose-dependently reduced cellular NAD(P) levels with an IC50 of 926 ± 130 pm (Fig. 3A), whereas incubation with extracellular NAD replenished these levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, cells that were treated with NAD alone displayed an increase in NAD(P) levels.FIGURE 3FK866-induced reduction in NAD(P) levels in NIH-3T3 cells and rescue by extracellular NAD.

Indeed, in SH-SH5Y (neuroblastoma) cells, NAD transport was present (total transport in 10 min, 6.0 ± 0.2 fmol; n = 8) and was sodium-dependent (NMG Locke: 28.3 ± 1.1% of control transport; n = 4) and calcium-independent (EGTA Locke: 121 ± 4.5% of control transport; n = 4). We also found NAD transport in HeLa (epithelial; 8.2 ± 0.3 fmol/10 min), HaCaT (keratinocytes; 2.2 ± 0.2 fmol/10 min), HMEC (endothelial; 2.1 ± 0.1 fmol/10 min), and RAW 264.7 cells (macrophages; 8.5 ± 0.5 fmol/10 min). Transport was significantly reduced in the absence of extracellular Na+ and partially inhibited in the presence of DPR in all cells tested. Although in RAW 264.7 cells, transport was insensitive to extracellular Ca2+, in HMEC, HaCaT, and HeLa cells, NAD transport was inhibited by ∼20%, 50, and 80%, respectively, in EGTA Locke, perhaps suggesting diverse mechanisms or diverse regulation (n = 6). NAD transport was not detected in K562 (leukemia) cells. To confirm the data obtained with FK866 in NIH-3T3 cells, we repeated the experiments in SH-SY5Y cells. FK866 displayed a slightly higher IC50 than in NIH-3T3 cells in MTT experiments (0.93"

This multienzyme complex connects glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle by catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. As is the case for many other rate-limiting, flux-generating metabolic reactions, PDC activity is tightly regulated (4Kolobova E. Tuganova A. Boulatnikov I. Popov K.M. Biochem.

In contrast to the mammalian enzyme, in Sc the PDC kinase and phosphatase are not tightly bound to the complex and escaped their identification for a long time. Recently, our group used a reverse genetic approach to identify two enzymes engaged in phosphorylation (Pkp1p) or dephosphorylation (Ppp1p) of Pda1p (20Krause-Buchholz U. Gey U. Wünschmann J.

Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 1543-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), which shares 42% homology to Pkp1p. Because its functional role is currently unknown, we included Ygl059wp in our study on PDC phosphorylation. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate blue native multiple reaction monitoring-initiated detection and sequencing scan tandem affinity purification isoelectric focusing hemagglutinin yeast extract/peptone/dextrose matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate blue native multiple reaction monitoring-initiated detection and sequencing scan tandem affinity purification isoelectric focusing hemagglutinin yeast extract/peptone/dextrose matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. The previously identified PDC-phosphatase Ppp1 (20Krause-Buchholz U. Gey U. Wünschmann J. Becker S. Rödel G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) belongs to the evolutionary conserved protein phosphatase family type 2C and, thus, has been originally named Ptc5p as one of seven members (Ptc1p–Ptc7p) (22Gonzalez A. Ruiz A. Serrano R. Arino J. Casamayor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35057-35069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ptc1p–Ptc4p are localized to the nucleus and/or the cytoplasm (23Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K.

A. 2003; 100: 13207-13212Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in dephosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins. Therefore, we included Ycr079wp and Yhr076wp in our survey for enzymes engaged in dephosphorylation of PDC. We report here on the analysis of the respective null mutants and demonstrate that two of the investigated proteins, Ygl059wp and Ycr079wp, are involved in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of PDC in yeast, respectively. In analogy to the previously identified enzymes, we propose to name these new enzymes as PDC kinase II (Pkp2p) and PDC phosphatase II (Ppp2p). Pda1p, the α-subunit of PDC, was identified as the target of phosphorylation by means of two-dimensional isoelectric focusing (IEF)/SDS-PAGE, phosphospecific in gel fluorescence staining, and subsequent mass spectrometry. In addition, we present data on the molecular organization and association of the regulatory enzymes with PDC. We discuss that the PDC phosphatases show partial functional redundancy, whereas the PDC kinases exhibit complementary activity. Strains and Media—Sc wild type strain BY4741 (accession number Y00000) and deletion strains Δpda1 (accession number Y06174), Δyil042c (accession number Y01435), Δygl059w (accession number Y04426), Δyor090c (accession number Y01866), Δycr079w (accession number Y05798), and Δyhr076w (accession number Y01904) were obtained from Euroscarf. Strain expressing tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged Pkp1 (YIL042c-TAP, accession number YSC1178-7501003) was purchased from Open Biosystems. Yeast complete media contained 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose or 3% ethanol as the sole carbon source. Yeast minimal media were prepared as described (26Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1994: 207-210Google Scholar). Epitope Tagging—Fusion of proteins with either c-Myc- or HA tag was achieved by homologous recombination of the corresponding integration cassettes (27Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) in the chromosomal loci of strains BY4741, Δygl059w, Δycr079w, or YIL042c-TAP. Integration cassettes for c-Myc or HA tagging were PCR-amplified from vector pGA2254 (containing nine repeats of c-Myc epitope) or vector pWZV108 or pUC19-3HA-URA (containing three repeats of HA epitope), respectively (kind gifts of W. Zachariae, MPI-CBG Dresden, Germany). Growth Analysis by Nephelometry—Growth of yeast cells was monitored in 96-well plates. 200 μl of the respective medium per well were inoculated with 104 cells of an overnight culture in YPD. Plates were incubated at 30 °C with constant shaking, and light scattering was measured in 20-min intervals in a NEPHELOstar (BMG Labtech). Isolation and Purification of Mitochondria—Yeast cells were grown to early stationary phase in media containing ethanol as the carbon source. Isolation and purification of mitochondria by two successive sucrose gradient centrifugations and treatment with 1 m NaCl were performed as described (28Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Meisinger C. Sommer T. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I + II (Sigma) were included in a 1:100 dilution throughout the preparation. Proteinase K Treatment of Mitochondria and Mitoplasts—For mitoplast formation 50 μg of mitochondria were incubated in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m mannitol) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Mitoplasts were stabilized by the addition of 1 volume buffer containing 0.65 m mannitol. Proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/μl to either mitochondria or mitoplasts in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 (Roche Applied Science). Samples were incubated for 15 min on ice, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (Applichem). The pellet obtained by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Samples lysed with Triton X-100 were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration). Two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE—Two-dimensional PAGE was essentially performed as described (30Görg A. Obermaier C. Boguth G. Harder A. Scheibe B. Wildgruber R. Weiss W. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1037-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). 500 μg of highly purified mitochondria were sedimented (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and lysed in 100 μl of thiourea buffer containing 4% CHAPS for 10 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged (13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and diluted with 400 μl of thiourea buffer (containing 4% CHAPS and 0.002% bromphenol blue). Samples were applied by in-gel rehydration of Immobiline DryStrips (24 cm, pH 3–11 NL, GE Healthcare) overnight at room temperature. IEF was performed in the Ettan IPGphor II system (GE Healthcare) in 3 steps (1 h at constant at 200 V, 2 h gradient up to 1000 V, and a further 6 h constant at 8000 V) at 20 °C with 50 μA per strip. Strips were equilibrated for 15 min in SDS buffer containing 10 mg/ml dithiothreitol and finally in SDS buffer with 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide (30Görg A. Obermaier C. Boguth G. Harder A. Scheibe B. Wildgruber R. Weiss W. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1037-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). The second dimension was carried out in the Ettan DALTsix system (GE Healthcare) using 12% SDS-gels. All chemicals were from GE Healthcare except for iodoacetamide (Sigma), Tris, and glycine (Applichem). Phosphoprotein and Total Protein Staining—Fluorescent staining of phosphoproteins was performed with ProQ®-Diamond Stain (Invitrogen) using an optimized protocol (31Agrawal G.K. Thelen J.J. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4684-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Deep Purple total protein staining (GE Healthcare) was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Imaging of the stained gels was performed with the Typhoon 9410 image scanner (GE Healthcare). Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands were excised, washed, ingel reduced, S-alkylated, and in-gel-digested with trypsin (Promega) as described previously (32Czupalla C. Mansukoski H. Pursche T. Krause E. Hoflack B. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 3868-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MALDI-MS measurements were performed using an Ultraflex MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) in reflectron mode and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Spectra acquisition and processing were done as described previously (33Czupalla C. Mansukoski H. Riedl T. Thiel D. Krause E. Hoflack B. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 134-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein identification was performed using MASCOT (Matrix Science) and SwissProt (216,380 sequences). Search criteria were as follows: taxonomy, S. cerevisiae; peptide and MS/MS tolerance, 50 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively; maximum one missed cleavage site; variable modifications, carbamidomethylation, methionine oxidation, phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, and Tyr. For nanoliquid chromatograph-MS/MS experiments, extracted peptides were separated on a Tempo nano-multidimensional liquid chromatograph system (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a RP-C18 trap column and a Pep-Map C18 analytical column (75 μm inner diameter × 150 mm) directly coupled to the micro-ion spray II nano-source of a 4000 Q TRAP system (Applied Biosystems). Peptides were eluted with a 30 min linear gradient of 5–50% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at 250 nl/min. All MS was conducted in positive mode using 2700 eV source voltage, sheath gas and curtain gas of 10 (arbitrary units), and an interface heater temperature of 150 °C. A multiple reaction monitoring-initiated detection and sequencing scan (MIDAS) was developed for all potential phosphorylation sites (Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P)) of Pda1p using either neutral loss of H3PO4 (-98) or the Tyr(P) immonium ion (m/z 216). A scan of 156 multiple reaction monitoring transitions triggered an enhanced resolution scan of the three most intense ions followed by enhanced product ion scans if the ion intensity was greater than a threshold value. Precursor ions were subjected to collision-induced dissociation using rolling collision energy, and the m/z of the ion was determined from the enhanced resolution scan. Enhanced product ion scans were searched using MASCOT and SwissProt. Peptide and MS/MS tolerance were set to 0.5 Da (other search criteria were as above). Phosphopeptides identified by MASCOT were manually sequenced, and spectra were analyzed by ProteinPilot (Applied Biosystems). TAP Method—The TAP method was performed with 1 mg of mitochondrial proteins of a strain co-expressing Pkp1p-TAP and Pkp2p-HA as described previously (20Krause-Buchholz U. Gey U. Wünschmann J. Becker S. Rödel G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation—40 μg of HA or c-Myc (Roche Applied Science) antibodies, respectively, were covalently coupled on NHS HP Spin Trap columns (GE Healthcare) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. 1 mg of mitochondria of a strain co-expressing Pkp1p-c-Myc and Pkp2p-HA were lysed in buffer containing 4% digitonin (10 mm NaCl, 5 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase-inhibitor mixture I + II (Sigma) 1:100). After extensive washing steps, elution was done with 2% SDS. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Preparation of 12% SDS gels and protein electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), probed with primary antibodies, and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL-Plus kit (GE Healthcare). Primary antibodies were directed against c-Myc (Roche Applied Science), HA (Roche Applied Science), Cox2p (cytochrome c oxidase subunit II; Invitrogen), Aco1p (aconitase; a kind gift of R. Lill, Marburg, Germany), Pgk1p (phosphoglycerate kinase; Invitrogen), Cyb2p (cytochrome b2), and Ccp1p (cytochrome c peroxidase; kind gifts of W. Neupert, Munich, Germany). TAP antibodies (Open Biosystems) are directed against the calmodulin binding domain. Blue Native (BN)-PAGE—The method of BN-PAGE (35Schägger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar) was adapted for the separation of salt-labile PDC as previously described (20Krause-Buchholz U. Gey U. Wünschmann J. Becker S. Rödel G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PDC Activity Assay Based on NADH Production—The activity of PDC in isolated mitochondria was determined as described by James et al. (37James A.G. Cook R.M. West S.M. Lindsay J.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 40 μg of mitochondrial protein were lysed with 0.25% Triton X-100 and subjected to the assay buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm pyruvate, 2,6 mm cysteine, 2.5 mm NAD+, and 2 mm thiamine pyrophosphate. The PDC reaction was started by the addition of coenzyme A (final concentration 0.13 mm), and increases in NADH concentration were followed by measurement of A340 in a TECAN Infinite™ M200. The Protein Phosphatases Ppp2p and Yhr076wp and the Protein Kinase Pkp2p Are Localized in the Mitochondrial Compartment—We have previously identified two enzymes that phosphorylate (Pkp1p) and dephosphorylate (Ppp1p) Pda1p, thereby regulating the activity of PDC. However, the yeast genome encodes additional candidate proteins of PDC regulation; Pkp2p is 42% homologous to Pkp1p, whereasPpp1p shares 49 and 37% homology with Ppp2p and Yhr076wp, respectively. We first addressed the question of whether these proteins are targeted to mitochondria, which is an essential prerequisite for enzymes directly affecting the phosphorylation state of mitochondrial PDC. To this end, the respective reading frames were fused at the carboxyl terminus either with the c-Myc- or the HA-tag coding sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”). To assess the subcellular localization of the proteins, crude mitochondria were isolated and subjected to two consecutive sucrose gradient purification steps (Fig. 1A). To remove proteins that are associated with the cytoplasmic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane, aliquots of the gradient-purified mitochondria were treated with 1 m NaCl. All fusion proteins tested showed an identical fractionation profile to those of the mitochondrial control proteins aconitase (Aco1p, mitochondrial matrix), cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (Cox2p, inner mitochondrial membrane), and the intermembrane space protein cytochrome b2 (Cyb2p). In contrast, the highly abundant cytoplasmic phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1p), which is firmly attached to the outer surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane, was no longer detectable in the salt washed fraction. This suggests the complete removal of cytoplasmic contaminations. No (Pkp2p, Ppp2p) or only a very faint (Yhr076wp) signal was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, indicating that these proteins are almost exclusively localized within the mitochondrial compartment as was also shown for the previously identified PDC kinase Pkp1p and PDC phosphatase Ppp1p (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, in a recent report Ppp2p (therein denoted as Aup1p) was found to be localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and to be involved in the process of mitophagy (38Tal R. Winter G. Ecker N. Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5617-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This localization would preclude the direct interaction and dephosphorylation of the target protein Pda1p in the mitochondrial matrix. To clarify this issue we reinvestigated the submitochondrial localization of Ppp2p. Mitoplasts were generated from gradient-purified mitochondria of cells expressing Ppp2p-HA and subjected to proteinase K treatment (Fig. 1B). In line with the results shown above, Ppp2p is resistant to proteinase K digestion of intact mitochondria. Complete digestion of the protein upon solubilization of the mitochondrial membranes by Triton X-100 indicates that the protein per se is sensitive to proteinase K (Fig. 1B). After rupturing the outer mitochondrial membrane by hypo-osmotic treatment, Ppp2p is still detectable in presence of proteinase K and thus, behaves like the matrix protein aconitase. In contrast, the marker proteins of the intermembrane space Cyb2p and Ccp1p are degraded, documenting the accessibility of this compartment for the proteinase K. We conclude that Ppp2p is a protein of the mitochondrial matrix. This is supported by the in silico prediction of a 33-amino acid-residue-long cleavable mitochondrial presequence (39Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Activity of PDC Is Regulated by Ppp2p and Pkp2p but Not by Yhr076w—We next studied the influence of deletions of the respective mitochondrial kinase and phosphatase genes on PDC activity in cells grown on ethanol. Wenzel et al. (40Wenzel T.J. Luttik M.A. van den Berg J.A. de Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed an unexpected high activity of PDC under aerobic growth on ethanol. Mitochondria of the null mutant strains were isolated and tested for PDC activity by monitoring the production of NADH in the presence of pyruvate as a substrate (Fig. 2). No enzymatic activity was detectable in strains lacking the PDC subunit Pda1p, documenting the specificity of the assay. As previously described (20Krause-Buchholz U. Gey U. Wünschmann J. Becker S. Rödel G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), deletion of PPP1 decreased the activity by 56%, whereas the absence of PDC kinase Pkp1p does not significantly change the activity compared with wild type under the growth conditions used (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, PDC activity in PPP2 deletion strains dropped dramatically to 6%. In contrast, in the absence of Pkp2p, PDC possessed a 45% higher activity compared with wild type. These results strongly argue that both enzymes are involved in the regulation of PDC. No alterations in enzyme activity were observed for the yhr076w null mutant, suggesting that this phosphatase is not engaged in PDC regulation. Deletion of Either of the PDC Phosphatases Affects Growth—We compared the growth in the presence of different carbon sources of the wild type and the pda1 deletion strain with that of strains lacking either of the regulatory PDC enzymes (Fig. 3). As expected, cells devoid of an active PDC due to the absence of Pda1p possessed a reduced growth rate and a lower final cell density on glucose and ethanol (41Wenzel T.J. van den Berg M.A. Visser W. van den Berg J.A. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similar phenotypes were observed for strains lacking either of the phosphatases on media with ethanol due to the diminished PDC activity in these strains described above. The cell division rate is most notably reduced in the case of Δppp2. This finding is in line with the more severe reduction of PDC activity upon deletion of PPP2. However, this residual activity in both Δppp2 and Δppp1 is sufficient to allow for the production of wild type-like final cell densities on glucose. Interestingly, only in Δppp2 the adaptation phase is elongated on glucose. This may hint at an additional regulatory function of Ppp2p (see “Discussion”). Pda1p Is the Target of Phosphorylation—To identify the target protein(s) of Pkp2p and Ppp2p, mitochondrial proteins of wild type and deletion strains were separated by two-dimensional-IEF/SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A) and subsequently stained with the phosphospecific fluorescent dye ProQ-Diamond (Fig. 4B, lower panel), with a fluorescent total protein stain (Fig. 4B, upper panel), and finally with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (data not shown) to allow for spot picking. Comparison of the gels revealed one spot (Fig. 4B, spot 1) that significantly differed in the staining intensity; although stained in wild type, Δppp1, and Δppp2 strains, no signal can be detected in strains lacking Pkp1p, Pkp2p, and Pda1p. The respective protein of spot 1 was identified by MALDI TOF/TOF as Pda1p. In line with this, the respective spot was missing in the mitochondrial proteome of Δpda1. To identify the phosphorylation site(s) of Pda1p, a MIDAS method for 156 multiple reaction monitoring transitions cove"

Jaundice is frequently observed and stems from a variety of hepatic and non-hepatic conditions such as infection, biliary obstruction, hemolysis, liver disease, and genetic diseases that influence hepatic metabolism and transport.

The most benign genetic disease leading to hyperbilirubinemia is Gilbert syndrome, which is a common inheritable condition resulting in transient levels of UCB (1Bosma P.J. J. Hepatol. 2003; 38: 107-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In humans, bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid, which is catalyzed solely by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (2Bosma P.J. Seppen J. Goldhoorn B. Bakker C. Oude E.R. Chowdhury J.R.

More detailed analysis of genetic variants associated with UGT1A1*28 indicate that Gilbert syndrome is part of a haplotype of four UGT1A variants spanning at least three UGT1A genes (5Lankisch T.O.

The organization of the UGT1 locus on chromosome 2 is encoded by >220 kDa of DNA, with four conserved exons located at the 3′-end and flanked consecutively by an array of nine cassette exons that encode the N-terminal portion of each UGT1A protein. Thus, the UGT1 locus encodes nine functional UGT1A proteins, each composed of a unique N-terminal region encoded by one of the 5′-flanking exons while sharing an identical C-terminal 245 amino acids encoded by exons 2-5. Each UGT1A gene is regulated independently from each other based upon tissue-specific control (15Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol.

Med. 1993; 37: 149-173PubMed Google Scholar), the animals are healthy based upon their ability to reproduce. To assess the functional role of the Ugt1 locus in mice, we have created a mouse model in which the coding region of exon 4 has been interrupted. Results are presented demonstrating complete interruption of the Ugt1 locus in Ugt1-/- mice leading to levels of UCB that equate to comparable increases observed in patients with CN1 disease. The absence of functional UGT1A protein predisposes neonatal mice to fatal consequences associated with non-hemolytic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Generation of the Ugt1-/- Mice—A 14-kb Ugt1a1 λ-genomic DNA clone from a 129/SvJ genomic DNA library (Stratagene, 946313) was isolated by screening the library with a cDNA fragment to exons 2-5 of the mouse Ugt1a6 cDNA (28Lamb J.G. Straub P. Tukey R.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10513-10520Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This Ugt1a1-λ DNA fragment contained exon 1 through exon 5 with additional 3′ intronic sequence. From this λ DNA, we cloned two EcoRI fragments (see Fig. 1) that spanned 9.4 kb into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) and generated the targeting vector by interrupting amino acids Thr-413/Leu-414 of exon 4 (at the BstEII site) with the G418 (neo)-resistant gene. The 5′-arm was 3.2 kb, and the 3′-arm extended 6.2 kb. Following electroporation of the targeting construct into 129J ES cells and selection of clones with G418, clones were analyzed by Southern blotting after BglII digestion using the 5′ probe as indicated in Fig. 1. ∼3% of the clones were positive for homologous recombination. Four ES clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Male chimaeras were backcrossed to C57BL/6 females to generate heterozygous founders that were bred to produce Ugt1-/- mice. For genotype analysis, tail DNA was digested with BglII and determined by Southern blotting. Mice were maintained under standard 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with access to standard rodent food and given water ad libitum. All protocols for mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California San Diego. Blood Chemistry Analysis—Blood was taken from 5-day-old neonatal mice by decapitation and allowed to clot for 20-30 min in the dark. Following centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, serum was collected under minimal light to reduce bilirubin decomposition. Blood chemistries were carried out for bilirubin (total and direct), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase, albumin, total protein, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase, cholesterol, iron, alkaline phosphatase, and amylase at the UC San Diego Medical Diagnostic Laboratory using a Beckman LX-20 analyzer with T4, T3, and TSH levels performed with a Bayer Centaur analyzer. Protein Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis—All Western blots were prepared using 4-12% NU-PAGE Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Liver microsomal preparations were generated as previously described (18Chen S. Beaton D. Nguyen N. Senekeo-Effenberger K. Brace-Sinnokrak E. Argikar U. Remmel R.P. Trottier J. Barbier O. Ritter J.K.

Following electrophoresis at 200 V, the resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-Millipore), and the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline solution (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for several hours. The membranes were then incubated with primary human UGT1A (29Albert C. Vallee M. Beaudry G. Belanger A. Hum D.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3292-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or UGT2B7 (30Guillemette C. Levesque E. Beaulieu M. Turgeon D. Hum D.W. Belanger A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2998-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Each membrane was washed again, and the conjugated horseradish peroxidase was detected using the ECL plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences), and the proteins were detected using a MolecularImager® ChemiDoc™ XRS system (Bio-Rad). UDP-glucuronosyltransferase Activity Determination—Liver microsomes were prepared from 5-day-old neonatal mice. Liver from three animals of each genetic stain (WT, Ugt1+/-, or Ugt1-/-) were combined and homogenized at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) using a motorized glass Teflon homogenizer. The tissue homogenate was completed at 4 ml with microsome buffer (2.62 mm KH2PO4, 1.38 mm K2H1PO4, 2% glycerol, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and was first centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and this resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in microsome buffer, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Glucuronidation assays were performed for 1 h in triplicate with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 8.5 mm saccharolactone (except for serotonin, MPA, imipramine, bilirubin, and T4), 10 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine (except for T4), 1 mm UDP-glucuronic acid (Sigma), 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin (except for T4), 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin (except for MPA and T4), 10 μg of microsomal protein, and 10 μm of the substrate (bilirubin, testosterone, 2-OH-estrone, 4-nitrophenol, 4-methylumbilleferone, and 1-naphthol) and 200 μm of the substrate (serotonin, MPA, imipramine and T4) in a total volume of 100 μl. Assays were stopped with 100 μl of methanol (1-naphthol, 4-nitrophenol, 4-MU, testosterone, 2-OH-estrone, and bilirubin (with 0.02% butylated hydroxytoluene)) or methanol with 0.02 m HCl (MPA) or acetonitrile with 0.02% butylated hydroxytoluene (serotonin) or acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid (imipramine) or acetonitrile with 6% formic acid and 0.02% butylated hydroxytoluene (T4) prior to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected for high-performance liquid chromatography analyses. Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Enzymatic Assays—Each sample (50 μl) was diluted 1:1 with water, vortexed, and then transferred into a conical vial for injection into the mass spectrometer. The high-performance liquid chromatography system consisted of a mass spectrometer (model API 3200, PerkinElmer Life Sciences/MDS Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) and was used to detect glucuronide conjugates formed. It was operated in the multiple reactions monitoring mode and equipped with an electrospray ionization interface in negative or positive ion mode and a high-performance liquid chromatography pump plus autosampler model 1200 series (Agilent, Montreal, Canada). For testosterone-glucuronide analysis, chromatographic separation was achieved with a 10 mm × 4.6 mm, 4-μm particle size Synergy Hydro-RP column at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The mobile phase A was water plus 1 mm ammonium formate, B was methanol plus 1 mm ammonium formate, and C was tetrahydrofuran. Separation was achieved using an isocratic condition of 48% A, 48% B, and 4% C in 7 min at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. Afterward, the column was flushed 1 min with 4% A, 92% B, and 4% C and re-equilibrated to initial conditions over 3 min. For 2-hydroxyestrone-glucuronides, samples were analyzed with a 4- to 6-mm inner diameter × 50-mm Luna Phenyl-Hexyl column (3-μm particle size, Phenomenex) using the mobile phase (solvent A, water; solvent B, methanol plus 0.1% ammonium hydroxide; and C, methanol). Separation was achieved using a linear gradient of 85% A, 5% B, and 10% B to 70% A, 5% B, and 20% C in 2 min at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. After 2 min, the column was washed with 5% A, 5% B, and 90% C. Afterward, the column was re-equilibrated to initial conditions over 3 min. For imipramine-glucuronide, samples were analyzed with a 3.9-mm inner diameter × 100-mm Xterra MS C18 (3.5-μm particle size) using the mobile phase solvent A, water plus 0.1% formic acid; solvent B, acetonitrile. Separation was achieved using a linear gradient of 30% to 50% B in 1 min at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. After 1 min, the column was washed with 90% B. Afterward, the column was re-equilibrated to initial conditions over 3 min. For 1-naphthol-glucuronide, 4-nitrophenolglucuronide, and 4-MU-glucuronide, samples were analyzed with a 3-mm inner diameter × 50-mm Synergie Polar column (2.5-μm particle size, Phenomenex) using the mobile phase solvent A, water plus 0.02% formic acid; solvent B, methanol plus 0.02% formic acid. Separation was achieved using an isocratic separation of 50% A and 50% B (3.5 min). For serotonin-glucuronide, 60% A and 40% B (2 min) was used with the same chromatographic system. For MPA-glucuronide and MPA acylglucuronide, samples were analyzed with a 4.6-mm inner diameter × 100-mm Gemini C18 column (5-μm particle size, Phenomenex). The mobile phases were solvent A, water plus 3 mm ammonium formate plus 0.5% acetic acid and B methanol plus 3 mm ammonium formate plus 0.5% acetic acid. Separation was achieved using a linear gradient of 65% to 85% B in 3 min at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. After 3 min, the column was washed with 85% B. Afterward, the column was re-equilibrated to initial conditions over 3 min. For bilirubin monoglucuronide and diglucuronide, samples were analyzed with a 4.6-mm inner diameter × 100-mm Luna C18 column (3-μm particle size, Phenomenex). The mobile phase A was water plus 1 mm ammonium formate; B was methanol plus 1 mm ammonium formate. Separation was achieved using a linear gradient of 70% B to 95% B in 2.5 min at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. After 0.5 min, the column was re-equilibrated to initial conditions over 3 min. For thyroxine (T4)-glucuronide, samples were analyzed with a 4.6-mm inner diameter × 100-mm Synergie RP-Hydro column (4-μm particle size, Phenomenex). The mobile phase A was water plus 0.1% formic acid, and B was acetonitrile plus 0.1% formic acid. Separation was achieved using an isocratic separation of 70% A and 30% B (3.5 min). Detection of Ugt1a RNAs by Reverse Transcription-PCR and Northern Blot—Total RNA for Northern blot and reverse transcription-PCR was prepared using the RNeasy RNA purification kit from Qiagen. For reverse transcription-PCR analysis, 2 μg of total RNA was used for generation of cDNA following the Omniscript RT kit protocol (Qiagen) with oligo(dT) primers in a 20-μl reaction. Following cDNA synthesis, 2 μl of the reaction was used for PCR amplification using 2 units of Choice TaqDNA polymerase (Denville Scientific). For detection of mouse UGT1A1 RNA, the forward primer was designed to a highly specific region of exon 1a1 (5′-GGTGGAACTTGGACGGACTG-3′). For detection of the common UGT1A transcripts the forward primer was designed toward exon 2 (5′-GCCTATGTCAACGCCTCTGG-3′). The reverse primer annealing in exon 5 (5′-GGCGCATGATGTTCTCCTTG-3′) was used for both UGT1A1 and UGT1A amplification. For detection of UGT1A6, the forward primer was designed to anneal to an identical region in exons 1a6a and 1a6b (5′-CAGGATGGCTTGCCTTCTTCC-3′). The reverse primer for UGT1A6 was directed toward exon 5 (5′-TGTTCTTGGCAAGATTCGATG-3′). Expression of actin was used as a loading control. For detection of UGT1A1, UGT1A, and actin RNA expression, the polymerase was activated for 2 min at 95 °C followed by 23 cycles of 95 °C 30 s, 58 °C 30 s, 72 °C 45 s, and a final 72 °C extension for 7 min. The PCR for detection of UGT1A6 RNA expression was performed under the same conditions except the annealing temperature was 55 °C. Eight microliters of the PCR product was resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and imaged using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS. For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of RNA from each liver was separated in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels with the resolved RNA transferred to GeneScreen membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by capillary diffusion. The membrane was pre-hybridized at 42 °C for several hours in a solution containing 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml single-stranded DNA, and 50% formamide. A 1.2-kb DNA probe that spans a portion of exon 5 was amplified from the targeting vector by PCR (5′-AAAGGAACACCTCCAGAGACC-3′ and 5′-GCTACAAGGAGAACATCATGCG-3′), purified, and labeled using [α-32P]ATP and a Rediprime II Random Prime Labeling System (Amersham Biosciences), followed by hybridization to the membrane overnight at 42 °C. The membrane was then washed with 0.5% SDS and 2× SSC several times and exposed to phosphorimaging screens (Molecular Dynamics) followed by detection of signal using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 optical scanner. Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated as described above from three 5-day-old WT and three Ugt1-/- livers. Biotinylated cRNA was prepared using the Illumina RNA amplification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion, Inc, Austin, TX). Messenger RNA was converted to cDNA and then amplified and labeled by T7 DNA polymerase. The Mouse 6 Sentrix Expression BeadChip was used (Illumina). Following hybridization and washing, the arrays were scanned on an Illumina BeadArray Reader. The signals were computed with weighted averages of pixel intensities, and local background was subtracted. Sequence-type signal was calculated by averaging corresponding bead signals from the three liver samples with outliers removed (median absolute deviation). Simultaneous normalization of multiple microarrays was done using the “mloess” method (31Sasik R. Woelk C.H. Corbeil J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Array data have been deposited in the EBI Array Express Data base (accession number is pending). Hyperbilirubinemia Associated with Mutagenesis of the Ugt1 Locus—The mouse Ugt1 locus encodes nine functional Ugt1a genes (32Mackenzie P.I. Walter B.K. Burchell B. Guillemette C. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. Miners J.O. Owens I.S. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenet. Genomics. 2005; 15: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) resulting in the translation of UGTs that contain identical C termini encoded by conserved exons 2-5. Elimination of the mouse UGT1A activity from the germ line was accomplished by interrupting exon 4 at a BstEII restriction enzyme site and inserting the neomycin gene followed by recombination of the targeting vector (Fig. 1) into ES cells. Heterozygous Ugt1+/- mice generated from one of the clones was bred, and littermates that were Ugt1-/- were identified by Southern blot analysis from tail DNA (Fig. 1). Using BglII to digest DNA, the WT band is identified as a 4.8-kb fragment that is extended to 6.0 kb following insertion of the neo gene. Both 4.8- and 6.0-kb fragments are identified in Ugt1+/- mice, whereas the WT band is not present in Ugt1-/- mice, demonstrating that the knock-out allele is heritable when Ugt1+/- mice serve as the breeders. Within 8 h following birth, the visible appearance of jaundice in Ugt1-/- mice is evident by the orange skin color of the neonates (Fig. 2). Longevity studies show that all of the Ugt1-/- neonatal mice die within the first 2 weeks following birth (Fig. 2), demonstrating that interruption of the Ugt1 locus generates a lethal mutation. In humans, UGT1A1 is solely responsible for generating the mono- and diglucuronide metabolites of bilirubin (2Bosma P.J. Seppen J. Goldhoorn B. Bakker C. Oude E.R. Chowdhury J.R. Chowdhury N.R. Jansen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17960-17964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bilirubin diglucuronide is required for elimination from the liver into the bile. Genetic defects in CN1 patients (33Clarke D.J. Moghrabi N. Monaghan G. Cassidy A. Boxer M. Hume R. Burchell B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1997; 266: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) result in UCB levels that usually exceed 20 mg/dl (350 μmol/liter), which corresponds to approximately a 20-fold increase in the normal indirect bilirubin levels (1.2 mg/dl). In littermates from heterozygous Ugt1+/- offspring that were sacrificed at 5 days and from which serum was collected for blood chemistry analysis, UCB levels from Ugt1-/- mice were 50- to 60-fold more concentrated than in WT or Ugt1+/- mice (Table 1). The normal levels of UCB in 5-day-old mice ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/dl in comparison to 7-10 mg/dl in Ugt1-/- mice. The rise in total bilirubin results from the accumulation of UCB. There were no differences in total or indirect bilirubin levels between WT and Ugt1+/- mice. Markers of liver injury such as serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were normal in Ugt1-/- mice along with several other serum analyte measurements (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicating there is no obstruction of biliary flow or kidney damage (data not shown).TABLE 1Serum bilirubin concentrationsBilirubinBilirubin-GTotalGenotypeWT, +/− (mg/dl)0.13 ± 0.160.46 ± 0.230.59 ± 0.30−/− (mg/dl)7.82 ± 1.250.80 ± 0.258.62 ± 1.14(−/−/WT, +/−) (-fold increase)59.681.7314.53p value<0.00010.005<0."
https://openalex.org/W2037151916,"The cell walls of the Corynebacterineae, which includes the important human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, contain two major lipopolysaccharides, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and lipomannan (LM). LAM is assembled on a subpool of phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), whereas the identity of the LM lipid anchor is less well characterized. In this study we have identified a new gene (Rv2188c in M. tuberculosis and NCgl2106 in Corynebacterium glutamicum) that encodes a mannosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of the early dimannosylated PIM species, acyl-PIM2, and LAM. Disruption of the C. glutamicum NCgl2106 gene resulted in loss of synthesis of AcPIM2 and accumulation of the monomannosylated precursor, AcPIM1. The synthesis of a structurally unrelated mannolipid, Gl-X, was unaffected. The synthesis of AcPIM2 in C. glutamicum DeltaNCgl2106 was restored by complementation with M. tuberculosis Rv2188c. In vivo labeling of the mutant with [3H]Man and in vitro labeling of membranes with GDP-[3H]Man confirmed that NCgl2106/Rv2188c catalyzed the second mannose addition in PIM biosynthesis, a function previously ascribed to PimB/Rv0557. The C. glutamicum Delta NCgl2106 mutant lacked mature LAM but unexpectedly still synthesized the major pool of LM. Biochemical analyses of the LM core indicated that this lipopolysaccharide was assembled on Gl-X. These data suggest that NCgl2106/Rv2188c and the previously studied PimB/Rv0557 transfer mannose residues to distinct mannoglycolipids that act as precursors for LAM and LM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2114966457,"Spatiotemporal aspects of ERK activation are stimulus-specific and dictate cellular consequences. They are dependent upon dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that bind ERK via docking domains and can both inactivate and anchor ERK in cellular compartments. Using high throughput fluorescence microscopy in combination with a system where endogenous ERKs are removed and replaced with wild-type or mutated ERK2-green fluorescent protein (GFP), we show that ERK2 activation responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and protein kinase C (PKC) are transient and sustained, respectively. PKC-mediated ERK2 activation is associated with prolonged nuclear localization in the dephosphorylated form, whereas EGF-stimulated ERK2 activation mediates only transient nuclear accumulation. By using short inhibitory RNAs to nuclear inducible DUSP1, -2, or -4 (alone or in combination), we demonstrate that all three of these enzymes contribute to the dephosphorylation of PKC (but not EGF)-activated ERK2 in the nucleus but that they have opposing effects on localization. DUSP2 and -4 inactivate and anchor ERK2, whereas DUSP1 dephosphorylates ERK in the nucleus but allows its traffic back to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of DUSP1, -2, or -4 prevented ERK2 activation, but only DUSP2 and -4 caused ERK2-GFP nuclear accumulation or could be immunoprecipitated with ERK2. Furthermore, protein synthesis inhibition or replacement of wild-type ERK2-GFP with docking domain mutants selectively increased PKC effects on ERK activity and altered ERK2-GFP localization. These mutations also impaired the ability of ERK2-GFP to bind DUSP2 and -4. Together, our data reveal a novel, stimulus-specific, and phosphatase-specific mechanism of ERK2 regulation in the nucleus by DUSP1, -2, and -4. Spatiotemporal aspects of ERK activation are stimulus-specific and dictate cellular consequences. They are dependent upon dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that bind ERK via docking domains and can both inactivate and anchor ERK in cellular compartments. Using high throughput fluorescence microscopy in combination with a system where endogenous ERKs are removed and replaced with wild-type or mutated ERK2-green fluorescent protein (GFP), we show that ERK2 activation responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and protein kinase C (PKC) are transient and sustained, respectively. PKC-mediated ERK2 activation is associated with prolonged nuclear localization in the dephosphorylated form, whereas EGF-stimulated ERK2 activation mediates only transient nuclear accumulation. By using short inhibitory RNAs to nuclear inducible DUSP1, -2, or -4 (alone or in combination), we demonstrate that all three of these enzymes contribute to the dephosphorylation of PKC (but not EGF)-activated ERK2 in the nucleus but that they have opposing effects on localization. DUSP2 and -4 inactivate and anchor ERK2, whereas DUSP1 dephosphorylates ERK in the nucleus but allows its traffic back to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of DUSP1, -2, or -4 prevented ERK2 activation, but only DUSP2 and -4 caused ERK2-GFP nuclear accumulation or could be immunoprecipitated with ERK2. Furthermore, protein synthesis inhibition or replacement of wild-type ERK2-GFP with docking domain mutants selectively increased PKC effects on ERK activity and altered ERK2-GFP localization. These mutations also impaired the ability of ERK2-GFP to bind DUSP2 and -4. Together, our data reveal a novel, stimulus-specific, and phosphatase-specific mechanism of ERK2 regulation in the nucleus by DUSP1, -2, and -4.

The biological outcome of ERK signaling is dependent upon the magnitude, duration, and localization of its activation (1Caunt C.J. Finch A.R. Sedgley K.R. McArdle C.A. Trends Endocrinol.

ERK is typically associated with its upstream activator MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) in the cytosol of quiescent cells. Upon phosphorylation by MEK, ERKs dissociate and typically translocate to the nucleus where they can phosphorylate transcription factors and immediate early gene products, leading to altered gene expression (1Caunt C.J.

Cells in which ERK nuclear translocation is prevented remain quiescent, even if ERK phosphorylation is sustained (6Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J.

The activity and localization of ERK are regulated by dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), which act by directly binding to and catalyzing the removal of phosphorylated Thr and Tyr within the activation loop (7Owens D.M. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3203-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 8Jeffrey K.L. Camps M. Rommel C. Mackay C.R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). A highly related subfamily of DUSPs, termed the nucleus-inducible MAPK phosphatases (MKPs), are rapidly induced by stimuli and localize exclusively to the nucleus. This group consists of DUSP1/MKP-1, DUSP2/PAC1, DUSP4/MKP-2, and DUSP5 (referred to using DUSP nomenclature herein). Each of these enzymes is able to dephosphorylate ERK and, with the exception of DUSP5, is also active with respect to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and/or p38 (7Owens D.M. Keyse S.M.

The specificity of ERK binding to phosphatases and other substrates is regulated through a system of docking domains. Two such motifs that govern these interactions are termed D-(docking) and DEF (docking site for ERK, FXFP)-domains. The D-domains are characterized by a string of basic amino acid residues (consensus, (K/R)2–3X1–6(L/I)X(L/I)) that facilitate docking to ERK via the common docking motif, located opposite the catalytic cleft (12Tanoue T.

Biol. 2005; 15: 1319-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast, DEF-domains have a consensus site of (F/Y)X(F/Y)P, which binds to ERK through a motif adjacent to the catalytic site (14Lee T. Hoofnagle A.N. Kabuyama Y. Stroud J. Min X. Goldsmith E.J. Chen L. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). All of the nuclear inducible MKPs have a D-domain motif, which determines substrate specificity (7Owens D.M. Keyse S.M.

However, little is known about how these motifs influence the spatiotemporal aspects of ERK regulation. Sustained, mitogenic ERK activation in fibroblasts has been shown to induce expression of nuclear proteins that mediate the dephosphorylation and scaffolding of ERK, resulting in its accumulation in the nucleus (22Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 23Volmat V. Camps M. Arkinstall S. Pouyssegur J. Lenormand P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3433-3443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This nuclear ERK accumulation is also dependent upon both protein synthesis and D-domain interactions (23Volmat V. Camps M. Arkinstall S. Pouyssegur J. Lenormand P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3433-3443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was therefore postulated to involve the nuclear inducible MKPs. A recent study provided the first direct evidence for this, showing that DUSP5 is rapidly induced by ERK stimuli and when overexpressed can co-immunoprecipitate with ERK and cause its nuclear accumulation in a D-domain-dependent manner (10Mandl M. Slack D.N. Keyse S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1830-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, although DUSP1 contains both D- and DEF-domain binding motifs and can efficiently dephosphorylate ERK (11Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol.

Here we have used siRNA to knock down endogenous ERKs in HeLa cells, and recombinant adenovirus (Ad) to add back either wild-type ERK2-GFP or ERK2-GFP that has been mutated to impair D- or DEF-domain-dependent binding. Using immunofluorescent staining and a semi-automated system for image acquisition and analysis, we now use this model to explore how DUSP1, DUSP2, and DUSP4 shape spatiotemporal aspects of ERK signaling in response to EGF and a PKC-activating phorbol ester, and the dependence of their effects on D- or DEF-domain interactions. Engineering of Plasmids and Viruses—The pCR3.1 vector was purchased from Invitrogen. pSRα Myc-tagged DUSP1, DUSP2, and DUSP4 vectors were a gift from Prof. Stephen Keyse (Cancer Research UK, University of Dundee). Viral shuttle vectors were constructed initially by subcloning a KpnI-NotI digest of ERK2-GFP in pEGFP-N1 (a gift from Prof. Louis Luttrell, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston) into a corresponding digest of pacAd5CMV K-N pA (donated by Prof. Beverly Davidson, University of Iowa, Iowa City). Y261A and D319N mutations were introduced using a QuikChange PCR-based mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and the following primers: 5′-AAT TTA AAA GCT AGA AAC GCT TTG CTT TCT CTC CCG CAC-3′ and 5′-GCA GTA TTA TGA CCC AAG TAA TGA GCC CAT TGC TGA AGC-3′ along with antisense primers according to manufacturer's recommendations and using the pacAd5CMV ERK2-GFP vector as the template. Viruses were generated from shuttle vectors as described (25Anderson R.D. Haskell R.E. Xia H. Roessler B.J. Davidson B.L. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4.5 μg of shuttle vectors were digested alongside 1.5 μg of pacAd5 9.2–100 sub360 backbone vector (donated by Prof. Beverly Davidson, University of Iowa, Iowa City) with PacI. Cut shuttle and backbone vectors were then mixed and transfected into low passage HEK293 cells using Superfect (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Cells were left to allow recombination between shuttle and backbone vectors. Verification of recombination was performed by restriction digest and sequence analysis, and Ad vectors were grown to high titer and purified according to standard protocols (26Hislop J.N. Madziva M.T. Everest H.M. Harding T. Uney J.B. Willars G.B. Millar R.P. Troskie B.E. Davidson J.S. McArdle C.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4564-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were cultured in 10% FCS-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). For 96-well plate experiments, cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded at 5 × 103 cells/well, using RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) and the manufacturer's reverse transfection protocol. Cells were transfected with two siRNA duplexes (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) as follows: for ERK1, 5′-CGU CUA AUA UAU AAA UAU AdTdT-3′, 5′-UAU AUU UAU AUA UUA GAC GdGdG-3′, 5′-CCC UGA CCC GUC UAA UAU AdTdT-3′, and 5′-UAU AUU AGA CGG GUC AGG GdAdG-3′; and for ERK2, 5′-CAC UUG UCA AGA AGC GUU AdTdT-3′, 5′-UAA CGC UUC UUG ACA AGU GdTdT-3′, 5′-CAU GGU AGU CAC UAA CAU AdTdT-3′, and 5′-UAU GUU AGU GAC UAC CAU GdAdT-3′, which were identified and validated in a recent publication (13Dimitri C.A. Dowdle W. MacKeigan J.P. Blenis J. Murphy L.O. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1319-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A mixture of all four ERK1/2 duplexes or control siRNA against GFP (Ambion, Warrington, UK) was used in experiments at 1 nm total concentration. For DUSP siRNA transfection, 10 nm SMARTpool or nontargeting control siRNA mixtures (Dharmacon, Cramlington, UK) were included in the transfections. For combination knockdown experiments, each SMARTpool siRNA was added at 10 nm to the ERK1/2 siRNAs and compared with control groups transfected with identical concentrations of control siRNA. Sixteen hours after siRNA transfection, cells were transduced with 2 × 106 pfu/ml Ad wild-type, Y261A, or D319N ERK2-GFP vector in DMEM with 10% FCS. The Ad-containing medium was removed after 4–6 h and replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FCS. The cells were then maintained for 16–24 h in culture prior to stimulation with EGF (Calbiochem) or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu; Sigma). In some experiments, cells were treated with 30 μm cycloheximide (Sigma) for 30 min prior to stimulation. Expression levels of GFP-tagged fusions were compared using Western blotting techniques (see Fig. 1A and Fig. 3A) as well as comparison of mean cell fluorescence in microscopy assays (not shown).FIGURE 3Stimulus-specific and ERK-dependent regulation of nuclear inducible DUSP mRNA. Cells were transfected in 6-well plates with control siRNAs (Ctrl) or ERK1/2 siRNAs prior to stimulation for 120 min with 10 nm EGF or 1 μm PDBu, as indicated. Total RNA isolates were analyzed for relative levels of DUSP1, -2, or -4 mRNA using qPCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as average normalized values obtained from three separate experiments, each with duplicate readings (mean ± S.E., n = 3). * = p < 0.05, comparing control siRNA-transfected cells to ERK1/2 siRNA-transfected cells, using Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western Blotting—HeLa cells were simultaneously plated and transfected in 6-well plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well) with 1 nm ERK1/2 siRNAs and 10 nm control or SMARTpool siRNAs prior to Ad transduction as above. Following treatment noted in figure legends, cells were lysed as described (27Hislop J.N. Everest H.M. Flynn A. Harding T. Uney J.B. Troskie B.E. Millar R.P. McArdle C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39685-39694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), prior to Western blotting. Total and ppERK1/2 were detected using polyclonal rabbit anti-total ERK1/2 and rabbit anti-ppERK1/2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Hitchin, UK), respectively. Loading controls were assayed by staining parallel blots with mouse anti-β-actin (AC-15, 1:5000; Sigma). Antibodies were visualized by using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare). Co-immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were simultaneously plated and transfected in 9-cm plates (2 × 106 cells/plate) with 1 nm control or ERK1/2 siRNAs as described above. Sixteen hours after siRNA transfection, cells were transfected with 10 μg of pCR3.1, pMyc-DUSP1, pMyc-DUSP2, or pMyc-DUSP4 using Superfect (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions, and in add-back experiments simultaneously transduced with 2 × 106 pfu/ml Ad wild-type, Y261A, or D319N ERK2-GFP vector in DMEM with 10% FCS. The Ad-containing medium was removed after 3 h and replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FCS. The cells were then maintained for 16–24 h in culture prior to lysis and immunoprecipitation using a mammalian Myc tag Co-IP kit (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. Whole cell lysate controls and Myc immunoprecipitates were assayed for ERK1/2, ERK2-GFP, and Myc-DUSP content by Western blotting with polyclonal rabbit anti-total ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology) and mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Quantitative PCR—HeLa cells were simultaneously plated and transfected in 6-well plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well) with 1 nm ERK1/2 siRNAs and 10 nm control or SMARTpool siRNAs prior to Ad transduction and serum starvation as described above. Cells were stimulated with 10 nm EGF or 1 μm PDBu before extraction of total RNA using the RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Contaminating genomic DNA was removed from columns using an additional DNase (Qiagen) digestion step. Complementary DNA was then prepared for 1 μg of each total RNA sample using a cloned avian myeloblastosis virus first-strand synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). cDNAs were then quantified relative to expression of human GTPase-activating protein using the following primers: 5′-CAA CGA GGC CAT TGA CTT CAT AG-3′ and 5′-CAA ACA CCC TTC CTC CAG CA-3′ for DUSP1; 5′-AAA ACC AGC CGC TCC GAC-3′ and 5′-CCA GGA ACA GGT AGG GCA AG-3′ for DUSP2; 5′-CTG GTT CAT GGA AGC CAT AGA GT-3′ and 5′-CGC CCA CGG CAG TCC-3′ for DUSP4; and 5′-GGG AAG GTG AAG GTC GGA GT-3′ and 5′-GAG TTA AAA GCA GCC CTG GTG A-3′ for the human GTPase-activating protein internal control. PCR primers were mixed with 50 ng of reverse transcription-PCR template and SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK), and the comparative CT method was used to detect relative expression curves on an ABI PRISM 7500 detection system (Applied Biosystems). Semi-automated Image Acquisition and Analysis—Cells were transfected with siRNA, transduced with Ad vectors, and plated as described above on Costar plain black-wall 96-well plates (Corning, Arlington, UK). For anti-Myc immunostaining experiments, cells were transfected with pCR3.1, pMyc-DUSP1, pMyc-DUSP2, or pMyc-DUSP4 using Superfect (Qiagen), according to manufacturer's instructions, simultaneously with viral transduction. Following treatment as noted in the figure legends, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS and permeabilization in -20 °C methanol. After blocking in 5% normal goat serum/PBS, cells were probed with rabbit anti-ppERK1/2 polyclonal antibody (1:300, Cell Signaling Technology) or mouse anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS. Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300, Invitrogen) was used to visualize ppERK1/2 and Myc antibody binding, respectively. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 600 nm) in PBS was used to stain nuclei. Image acquisition in each well was performed on an IN Cell Analyzer 1000 (GE Healthcare) microscope, using a ×10 objective and 360-nm (DAPI), 475-nm (GFP), and 535-nm (Alexa 546) excitation filters, and monitored through 460-, 535-, and 620-nm emission filters, respectively, with a 61002 trichroic mirror (GE Healthcare). Analysis of ppERK1/2 activity and localization was performed using the Object Intensity algorithm in the IN Cell Analyzer Workstation (GE Healthcare) with images collected from 460- and 620-nm emission filters to define nuclear and cytoplasmic regions, respectively. ERK2-GFP localization and ppERK2 activity were simultaneously analyzed using the Multitarget Analysis algorithm (IN Cell Analyzer Investigator; GE Healthcare) with images collected from 460- and 535-nm emission filters to define nuclear and cytoplasmic regions, respectively. Single cells with levels of ERK2-GFP intensity yielding superphysiological ppERK2 responses in comparison with the endogenous ERK1/2 were deemed to be overexpressed and excluded from analysis (∼20% of cells) to prevent misleading localization data. Similarly, subpopulations of Myc-DUSP expressing cells were selected using filters for Myc-DUSP staining intensity within nuclei to ensure comparison of equal DUSP expression levels in single cells. 300–500 cells per field were typically analyzed, and up to four fields per well were captured in experiments performed in duplicate or quadruplicate, meaning that in each experiment data were normally derived from at least 1000 individual cells per time point. Imaging data are reported as ppERK intensity (mean fluorescence intensity per cell) or as a ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic intensity (N:C ratio). Endogenous ERK1/2 Knockdown and Reconstitution with ERK2-GFP Fusion Protein—We have previously shown that EGF causes a transient activation of ERK (ppERK1/2 maximal at 5 min, returned to basal by 60 min), whereas stimulation of PKC with PDBu causes a more sustained ERK activation (maximal at 5–15 min, above basal for >4 h) in HeLa cells. These stimuli also caused ERK translocation to the nucleus as revealed by the increase in nuclear translocation of endogenous ERK1/2 or ERK2-GFP in cells transduced with Ad ERK2-GFP (28Caunt C.J.

However, the techniques used (Western blotting and confocal microscopy) are labor-intensive, and the assay necessitated co-transduction with MEK to recapitulate the normal cytoplasmic localization of ERK2 (in serum-starved cells) despite its overexpression. Accordingly, the initial aim of these experiments was to develop a more efficient model for exploring spatial and temporal aspects of ERK2 regulation without the overexpression of ERK2 binding partners. To do so, we have used siRNAs to knock down endogenous ERK1/2, recombinant Ad to add back fusion proteins of wild-type or mutated ERK2 and GFP, fluorescent labeling of ppERK1/2, and a wide field fluorescence microscope based platform for semi-automated image acquisition and analysis. Transfection with siRNA sequences targeted to noncoding regions of ERK1 and -2 (ERK1/2) transcripts reduced ERK1/2 expression and PDBu-induced phosphorylation (ppERK1/2) responses by >95%, as judged by Western blotting (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Subsequent transduction with Ad ERK2-GFP (2 × 106 pfu/ml) restored ERK expression levels and the phosphorylation response (Fig. 1A, note the higher molecular weight of the ERK2-GFP fusion protein), which had comparable magnitude and kinetics to the response in control cells (Fig. 1A, top panel and data not shown). We next assessed ERK activation and localization by quantitative fluorescence microscopy, defining nuclear regions with a DAPI stain so that ERK2-GFP or dual phosphorylated ERK2-GFP (ppERK2) could be measured in the nucleus and cytoplasm (as well as in whole cells). Outlines of nuclei and cells defined by automated analysis algorithms using DAPI and ppERK1/2 stains are shown in Fig. 1B. As expected, PDBu caused a rapid and sustained increase in whole cell ppERK1/2 levels in control siRNA-transfected cells. No such effect was seen in ERK1/2 siRNA-transfected cells, and the response seen in cells transfected with siRNA and transduced with Ad ERK2-GFP had comparable magnitude and kinetics to that seen in control cells (Fig. 1C). This activation of ERK was paralleled by a rapid and sustained increase in the nuclear to cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio of ERK2-GFP (Fig. 1D). Scatter plots of ppERK1/2 location within single cells revealed that PDBu increased ppERK1/2 labeling in the cytoplasm and nucleus of control cells (Fig. 1E). It had no such effect in cells transfected with ERK1/2 siRNAs alone, but it increased ppERK1/2 within both compartments of cells transfected with ERK1/2 siRNAs and transduced with Ad ERK2-GFP (Fig. 1E). Thus, semi-automated image acquisition and analysis provide an efficient means of monitoring spatial and temporal aspects of ERK activation, and the knockdown and add-back model recapitulates the key features of endo"
https://openalex.org/W1999981814,"We previously showed that K-Ras is a calmodulin-binding protein. Involvement of this interaction in anterograde and retrograde transport of K-Ras was then suggested. To test this we have analyzed here the domains of K-Ras essential for the interaction with calmodulin. At least three different regions in the K-Ras molecule were important; they are the hypervariable region, the α-helix between amino acids 151 and 166, and the Switch II. Within the hypervariable region, both the hydrophobic farnesyl group and the positive-charged amino acids were essential for the interaction between K-Ras and calmodulin in cellular extracts. Consistently, K-Ras S181D, which mimics phosphorylation of Ser-181 of K-Ras, also completely abolished binding to calmodulin. K-Ras mutants correctly farnesylated that did not bind calmodulin were all located at plasma membrane, showing that calmodulin interaction was not required for the transport of K-Ras to plasma membrane. In NIH3T3 cells, K-Ras and calmodulin colocalized mainly in the plasma membrane even after the addition of Ca2+ ionophore, indicating that interaction did not directly lead to K-Ras internalization. Furthermore, using a K-Ras with impaired binding to calmodulin but with membrane localization, we could demonstrate in striatal neurones that interaction between K-Ras and calmodulin was not required for Golgi K-Ras translocation induced by Ca2+ influx. We previously showed that K-Ras is a calmodulin-binding protein. Involvement of this interaction in anterograde and retrograde transport of K-Ras was then suggested.

Ras GTPases are key regulators of signal transduction pathways controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis (1Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 2Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rebollo A. Martinez A. Blood. 1999; 94: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis for such a wide variety of cell responses controlled by Ras proteins is that Ras transduces signals from various extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, hormones, and cell-extracellular matrix contacts to many downstream effectors (4Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 5Olson M.F. Marais R. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As a molecular switch, Ras cycles between a GTP-bound active and an inactive state when GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. Active Ras interacts with and modulates the activity of effector proteins. Their role in transformation and oncogenesis is highlighted by the fact that more than 10% of human cancers harbor point mutations on Ras proteins (6Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 7Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar, 8Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). There are three ubiquitously expressed Ras isoforms, H-, N-, and K-Ras 4B (K-Ras). The high degree of homology between the different Ras isoforms suggests that they are functionally identical, but accumulating evidence points to a preferential activation of specific effectors by different Ras isoforms (9Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Furthermore, experiments with mice knocked out selectively for each Ras isoform showed that K-Ras, but not H-Ras or N-Ras, is essential for development (10Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E. Schmitt E. Bronson R.T. Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2468-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 11Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Pellicer A. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Those Ras isoforms have a conserved globular domain between positions 1 and 165, whereas the carboxyl-terminal 23–24 amino acids show considerable variation (hypervariable region: HVR). 5The abbreviations used are: HVR, hypervariable region; CaM, calmodulin; CaMBP, CaM-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RBD, Ras binding domain; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; ROI, regions of interest; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; Seph, Sepharose; WT, wild type; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate. Within the conserved domain there are several motifs important for Ras functions including GTP binding, and Switch I and Switch II regions responsible for effector, guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and GTPase-activating protein interactions (see Fig. 1) (12Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Ras reveals that this protein exists in different conformations in the GDP-versus GTP-bound states, this being the most important change in the Switch I and II regions. Consequently, GDP- and GTP-bound states have different affinity for effectors, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and GTPase-activating proteins (13Dykes D.C. Brandtrauf P. Luster S.M. Chung D. Friedman F.K. Pincus M.R. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1992; 9: 1025-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 14Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A.

Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The HVR contains sequences important for post-translational modification, including the CAAX box responsible for targeting lipid modification. The three isoforms are anchored to the inner surface of the plasma membranes, and their location is believed to be essential to physiological activity. Although H-, N-, and K-Ras are mostly found in the plasma membrane, their location and signaling in endomembranes has also been described (16Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). A carboxyl-terminal S-farnesyl cysteine carboxyl methyl ester together with a second signal directs their location to the membrane (17Magee T. Marshall C. Cell. 1999; 98: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The second signal in K-Ras comprises a polybasic domain of six lysine residues. Those basic residues are believed to associate with the anionic head groups of inner leaflet phospholipids. In contrast, the second signal in H- and N-Ras comprises palmitoylation of cysteine residues. This two-signal membrane-targeting mechanism serves to determine the trafficking pathway of the different Ras proteins to the plasma membrane and the microlocation at different plasma membrane domains. All Ras proteins are synthesized at the cytosol on free polysomes. They are immediately prenylated and consequently targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. N-Ras and H-Ras are palmitoylated, directed to Golgi, and sent to the membrane via vesicular transport (18Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Retrograde N-Ras and H-Ras traffic back to Golgi occurs after depalmitoylation (19Goodwin J.S. Drake K.R. Rogers C. Wright L. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Philips M.R. Kenworthy A.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In contrast, K-Ras moves directly from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane through an unknown mechanism, which may imply a chaperone protein to hide the farnesyl group, whereas K-Ras is in the cytosol. Furthermore, it has been recently suggested that K-Ras can also be redirected from the plasma membrane to Golgi apparatus in hippocampal neurons stimulated with glutamate through a CaM-dependent pathway (20Fivaz M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and to the mitochondria in other cellular types after protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation (21Bivona T.G. Quatela S.E. Bodemann B.O. Ahearn I.M. Soskis M.J. Mor A. Miura J. Wiener H.H. Wright L. Saba S.G. Yim D. Fein A. de Castro I.P. Li C. Thompson C.B. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 481-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In fact, we showed previously that CaM down-regulates Ras activation in fibroblasts and that CaM binds specifically to GTP-loaded K-Ras in a Ca2+-dependent way (22Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Bosch M. Chiloeches A. Rocamora N. Gil J. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). But the interaction between K-Ras and CaM has not been analyzed in detail, and consequently its role in the K-Ras intracellular localization has not been directly studied. CaM is a small (148 amino acids) and well conserved Ca2+-binding protein (23Klee C. Vanaman T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of CaM in the Ca2+-bound form shows a dumbbell-shaped molecule with two globular domains arranged in a trans configuration. These domains are connected by a long extended central α-helix, the middle portion of which is highly mobile and acts as a flexible tether. Each domain consists of two helix-loop-helix motifs (EF hands), with each binding one molecule of Ca2+. Ca2+ binding changes the orientation of the two EF hands of each domain, inducing the appearance of hydrophobic patches that interact with proteins known as CaM-binding proteins (CaMBPs). Binding of CaM to CaMBPs modulates the function of these proteins and, in consequence, affects many aspects of cell regulation. The carboxyl-terminal lobe binds Ca2+ with high affinity (Kd 10-7 m), whereas the amino-terminal lobe binds it with lower affinity (Kd 10-6 m). The fact that the Kd values fall within the range of intracellular Ca2+ concentration exhibited for most cells (10-7–10-6 m) makes it a good sensor for changes in Ca2+ intracellular levels (24Weinstein H. Mehler E.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 213-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Swindells M.B. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). The CaM binding domain of some of the CaMBPs with high affinity for CaM (nm range) consists of a 20-amino acid sequence that has an amphiphatic α-helix conformation (27James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). CaM binding domains with lower affinity for CaM (μm range) have also been described (28Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that some proteins like MARCKS and CAP-23/NAP-22 use the myristoyl group to interact with CaM (29Matsubara M. Titani K. Taniguchi H. Hayashi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48898-48902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Matsubara M. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Taniguchi H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As well as K-Ras, diverse Ras superfamily GTPases like Kir/Gem (31Fischer R. Wei Y. Anagli J. Berchtold M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25067-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), Ric (32Wes P.D. Yu M.J. Montell C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have been shown to bind to CaM. We analyzed here which elements of K-Ras are essential for its interaction with CaM to assess whether this interaction is important for anterograde or retrograde K-Ras traffic. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—The truncated forms of K-Ras (from amino acid 1 to 150 and from amino acid 1 to 166) were obtained by PCR and cloned into a pGEXKG plasmid with the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI to obtain the GST-K-Ras-(1–150), GST-K-Ras-(1–166), GST-K-Ras-(1–166)R161D, and GST-K-Ras-(1–166)R164D fusion proteins. The truncated K-Ras-(1–166) and H-Ras-(1–166) protein with amino-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag was obtained by single PCR and cloned into a pEFHA plasmid. All mutants (except Switch II) were obtained by single PCR but with reverse or forward oligonucleotides carrying the appropriate mutations. The forward oligonucleotide incorporated a BamHI site, and the reverse one incorporated a ClaI site to allow subcloning into the pEFHA and BamHI and XhoI, respectively, to subclone into pGEXKG. Switch II mutants were obtained by point mutation using QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA), and we used as a double-stranded DNA template the construction K-Ras or K-RasV12 cloned into a pEFHA plasmid. This pEFHA-K-Ras plasmid was a gift from R. Marais (UK Cancer Research Centre, London, England), and the effector domain K-Ras mutants cloned in a pCEFLAU5 plasmid were a gift from J. M. Rojas (Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain). K-Ras and K-RasV12 were cloned into pEYFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech) by BglII/SalI sites. CaM was cloned into pECFP-C1 and pEGFP-C1 plasmids (Clontech) by SmaI site. Protein Expression and Purification—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 carrying the pLysS plasmid. Purification and loading with the GTPγS nucleotide were performed as indicated elsewhere (22Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Bosch M. Chiloeches A. Rocamora N. Gil J. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum. Immortalized striatal neurons (STHdh) (a gift of S. Ginés, University of Barcelona, Spain) were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient expression of the different K-Ras mutants was achieved by transfecting cells with the appropriate expression vector and using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CaM-Sepharose Pulldown Assays—For pulldown assays with cellular lysates, cells (1 × 106) were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 0.4 ml of pulldown buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol) plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors (0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C and clarified by centrifugation. Lysates (equalized for protein content) were incubated with 30 μl of CaM-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. The unbound fraction was collected by centrifugation, and the remaining bound fraction was washed four times with pulldown buffer with either CaCl2 or EGTA. An aliquot (25–50 μl) of the unbound fraction and the input fraction and the entire bound fraction were analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blotting. A lysate from NIH3T3-transfected cells was always loaded in the same gel as a control for the transfection. For in vitro binding experiments with purified proteins, these were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 20 μl of CaM-Sepharose (previously blocked for 30 min with 10% bovine serum albumin). In this case, pulldown buffer also contained 300 mm NaCl with either 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. Unless otherwise indicted in the figure legend, total bound and unbound fractions and equivalent amounts of input were obtained as indicated above and analyzed by Western blotting. In the competition assay between K-RasV12 and Ras15-(1–166) α-helix peptide, this peptide was diluted in pulldown buffer and preincubated with CaM-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. After this preincubation, the beads were washed two times with pulldown buffer and incubated with a lysate from NIH3T3 cells previously transfected with K-RasV12 for 2 h at 4 °Cinthe presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2. Ras Binding Domain (RBD) Pulldown Assay—To analyze the capacity of Ras mutants to be loaded with GTP in cell lysates, a RBD (of Raf-1) pulldown assay was performed. Cells (5–10 × 106) were lysed in the culture dish with the CaM pulldown buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol). In this buffer nucleotide exchange is allowed, and Ras bound cellular GTP (22Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Bosch M. Chiloeches A. Rocamora N. Gil J. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cleared (10,000 × g) lysate was assayed for protein concentration by the Bradford method, and protein-equalized supernatants were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads precoupled with GST-RBD (1 h, 4 °C). Beads were washed four times in the lysis buffer. Bound proteins were dissolved by the addition of 30 μl of Laemmli loading buffer and run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. The amount of Ras in the bound fraction was analyzed by Western blotting. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Binding experiments and kinetic analysis was performed by using BIAcore T100 equipment. Biotinylated CaM (20 μg/ml) was immobilized on a precoated streptavidin biosensor chip (SA) at 25 °C with a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min and for 60 s of contact time. Nonspecific binding was subtracted by using two linked channels. A biotin-saturated surface was used in the reference channel. GST, GTP-loaded GST-K-Ras-(1–150) and GST-K-Ras-(1–166), and the peptides K-Ras-(150–166) and CaM kinase II-(290–309) as a positive control, and protein kinase A-(6–22) and C-(19–36) as negative controls were diluted in HBSN buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1 mm CaCl2) and injected at different concentrations with their corresponding triplicates. Regeneration was performed injecting HBSN buffer with 5 mm EDTA allowing completely dissociation of all proteins and peptides. Triton X-114 Partitioning—The method indicated by Bordier et al. (36Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used with slight modifications to analyze if K-Ras was farnesylated. Transfected cells with different K-Ras mutants were washed twice in PBS, then lysed in 1 ml of an ice-cold solution of 1% Triton X-114 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing protease inhibitors. Cells were scraped from the culture dish, and lysate was transferred to a cold Eppendorf tube, vortexed, and incubated on ice for 15 min. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min to remove insoluble debris. The supernatant was harvested to a fresh tube (an aliquot of 30 μl was collected before) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 min, then centrifuged for 2 min at room temperature to separate the detergent phase from the aqueous phase. The top, aqueous phase was collected and transferred to a new tube, and the detergent phase was kept in the same tube. The aqueous portion was made up to 1 ml with 100 μl of 10% Triton X-114, and the detergent portion was made up to 1 ml with 900 μl of TBS. 30 μl of total lysate and of detergent and aqueous phase were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody. Immunofluorescence and Fluorescence Microscopy—For the detection of HA-Ras proteins, cells were fixed as described above, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, blocked for 20 min with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody, clone 12CA5 from Roche Applied Science, at 1:200 dilution. For Golgi detection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS for 10 min, blocked for 10 min with 0.2% BSA in PBS, and then incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with monoclonal anti-GM130 and 0.2% BSA (1:200, BD Transduction Laboratories). Coverslips were then washed 3 times in PBS and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with an Alexa-594-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and 0.2% BSA (dilution 1:500, Invitrogen). Confocal images of fixed cells were acquired using a Leica TCS SL laser-scanning confocal spectral microscope (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Manheim, Germany) with argon and HeNe lasers attached to a Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope. GFP and Alexa-594 emission were acquired sequentially with a triple dichroic beam-splitter (TD 488/543/633 nm) and emission detection ranges 500-535 and 592–700 nm, respectively. YFP and Alexa-594 emission were acquired sequentially with a double dichroic beam-splitter (DD 458/514 nm) and with a triple dichroic beam-splitter (TD 488/543/633 nm), and emission detection ranges were 525-570 and 592–700 nm, respectively. All images were obtained using 63× oil immersion objective lens (NA 1.32) equipped with phase contrast optics and the confocal pinhole set at 1 Airy unit. Electronic zoom (×2) was used for stronger magnification and better image resolution. For in vivo experiments, a Leica TCS SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope was used with an incubation system with temperature and CO2 control. CFP and YFP were acquired using 63× oil immersion objective lens (NA 1.32), 458- and 514-nm laser line, Acousto-Optical Beam Splitter, emission range detection 465–510 and 525–650 nm, respectively, and the confocal pinhole was set at 2.5 Airy units. Image treatment and movie assembly were performed using the Image J Software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health). Fluo4 emission was acquired using 63× oil immersion objective lens (NA 1.32), a 488-nm laser line, an Acousto-Optical Beam Splitter, and emission range detection 500–600 nm. Regions of interest (ROIs) were set for each cell, and the average intensity in ROI was measured over time. Changes in the intracellular calcium concentration were given as the relative change in the fluorescence ratio F/F0 of Fluo4-AM, where F was the fluorescence intensity at any time, and F0 was the base-line fluorescence intensity. Image treatment and movie assembly were performed using the Image Processing Leica Confocal Software. Colocalization was quantified using the Image J Software and the Highlighting Colocalization plugin (Pierre Bourdoncle, Institut Jacques Monod, Service Imagerie, Paris). This plugin highlights the colocalized points of two images. Two points were considered colocalized if their intensities were higher than the threshold of their channels and the ratio of their intensity was higher than 50%. The Highlighting Colocalization plugin generated an image of colocalized pixels. With the Image Calculator plugin the values of the colocalized points were converted to the real value of red (HA-K-Ras protein). Then membrane and cytoplasmatic ROIs were defined in each cell, and the integrity density of both the colocalized points with the real red value (HA-K-Ras colocalized with GFP-CaM) and the red image (total HA-K-Ras) was calculated in each ROI. The percentage of colocalization was obtained in each ROI by dividing the two intensities. At least 10 cells were analyzed for each condition. The mean and S.D. were determined. The perinuclear region (PN)/plasma membrane (PM) ratio was calculated drawing different ROIs of PM and PN, PM regions where movement or shape changes were observed during the experiment were discarded. The average fluorescence intensity of a selected ROI was then logged onto an Excel spreadsheet, normalized, and plotted over time. Only images of cells that showed a medium overexpression of the proteins were analyzed. Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies—Fractions of the pull down experiments were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes for 2 h at 60 V. The sheets were preincubated in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA containing the appropriate antibodies: Pan-Ras (Oncogene Science OP40, 1:100 dilution), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science 1583816, clone 12CA5 1:1000 dilution), anti-AU5 (Berkeley Antibody Co., Inc., 1:1000). After washing in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (3 times, 10 min each), the sheets were incubated with a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1:4000 dilution) (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the sheets were washed twice in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and once in TBS. The reaction was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) and detected and quantified using Fluor-S MultiImager and Quantity One program (Bio-Rad). Analysis of the CaM-interacting Domains of K-Ras—To better understand regulation of K-Ras activity by CaM, we analyzed the domains of K-Ras that are essential for the interaction with CaM. We previously showed that truncated GST-K-Ras-(1–166) (amino acid 1–166), expressed in bacteria and purified, was able to bind to CaM-Sepharose in a Ca2+-dependent way, specifically when loaded with GTP (22Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Bosch M. Chiloeches A. Rocamora N. Gil J. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To analyze which domains in GST-K-Ras-(1–166) were responsible for the binding to CaM, interaction of a further truncated version of K-Ras (GST-K-Ras-(1–150)) completely lacking the last α-helix α5 (Fig. 1) was analyzed. Both truncated proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified, and GTP-loaded before analysis of their interaction with CaM. To confirm GTP loading, the ability of both truncated proteins to bind to RBD-Sepharose (Ras binding domain of Raf-Sepharose) was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2A, both truncated forms were GTP-loaded since they bound equally to RBD-Sepharose. However, although GST-K-Ras-(1–166) interacted with CaM in the presence of Ca2+, GST-K-Ras-(1–150) did not. These results suggested the presence of a CaM-interacting region in the last α-helix of K-Ras, between amino acids 151 and 166. To further confirm that, surface plasmon resonance technology was used to determine the affinity of K-Ras helix α5 to CaM. Our data showed that K-Ras-(151–166) peptide had a clear affinity for CaM (KD = 470 nm), whereas with the same analysis two unrelated peptides that had a similar proportion of hydrophobic and basic amino acids showed no significant binding to CaM. As a positive control CaM kinase II-(290–309) peptide (the CaMBD of CaMKII) was used and showed as already described a very high affinity for CaM (KD = 20 nm). Binding kinetics of purified GST-K-Ras constructs was also analyzed and are as shown in Fig. 2B. Although GST-K-Ras-(1–166) had an affinity of 630 nm, the deletion of the helix α5 notable increased the KD, indicating a reduction of the affinity for CaM. But the presence of another CaM-interacting region in the HVR has also been reported (20Fivaz M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To test whether in a cell context the HVR was essential for the interaction with CaM, we expressed both full-length HA-K-Ras and HA-K-Ras-(1–166) in NIH3T3 cells and performed pulldown assays with CaM-Sepharose directly with the cellular extracts. Extracts were performed with a buffer that allowed GTP loading in the lysate (22Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Bosch M. Chiloeches A. Rocamora N. Gil J. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and, as shown in Fig. 2C (upper panel), both forms of K-Ras were GTP-loaded. Although full-length HA-K-Ras interacted with CaM, deletion of the HVR completely abolished binding to CaM (Fig"

AKIP1 is a nuclear protein and known to interact with the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc). We identified AKIP1 by a yeast two-hybrid screen using the N terminus region of p65 as bait. The interaction between AKIP1 and p65 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay in vitro and immunoprecipitation-Western blotting assay in vivo. We found that the PKAc was present in the AKIP1·p65 complex and enhanced the transcriptional activity of NF-κB by phosphorylating p65. In a transient luciferase assay, AKIP1 cotransfection efficiently increased the transcriptional activity of NF-κB induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). When AKIP1 was knocked down by RNA interference, the PMA-mediated NF-κB-dependent gene expression was abolished, indicating a physiological role of AKIP1. We found that PKAc, which is maintained in an inactive form by binding to IκBα and NF-κB in resting cells, was activated by PMA-induced signaling and could phosphorylate p65. Overexpression of AKIP1 increased the PKAc binding to p65 and enhanced the PKAc-mediated phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-276. Interestingly, this p65 phosphorylation promoted nuclear translocation of p65 and enhanced NF-κB transcription. In fact, we observed that AKIP1 colocalized with p65 within the cells and appeared to retain p65 in nucleus. These findings indicate a positive role of AKIP1 in NF-κB signaling and suggest a novel mechanism by which AKIP1 augments the transcriptional competence of NF-κB.

NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor for the expression of wide variety of genes involved in immunoinflammatory responses, cell proliferation, and survival, thus playing crucial roles in the pathogenesis of many diseases including cancer, leukemia, and autoimmune diseases (1Baeuerle P.A.

In resting cells, NF-κB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm through association with inhibitory proteins IκBs (5Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PKA, existing predominantly in the cytoplasm as an inactive tetramer holoenzyme in resting cells, is composed of two catalytic subunits and a homodimer of two regulatory subunits that can dissociate upon activation by cAMP (16Carnegie G.K.

In resting cells, PKAc is involved in the IκB·NF-κB complex present in the cytoplasm, and IκB keeps PKAc inactivated by masking the catalytic center. In the presence of extracellular stimuli such as PMA or TNFα, IκB is phosphorylated and degraded, thus activating the IκB-sequestered PKAc to phosphorylate p65 on Ser-276. Phosphorylation by PKAc facilitates p65 to assemble with the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300, and the binding of NF-κB to its target sites on DNA (8Hayashi T. Sekine T. Okamoto T. J. Biol.

One of the target genes of NF-κBisIκBα, newly synthesized IκBα proteins can enter into nucleus, bind with p65, and export to the cytoplasm as a complex. This negative feedback system limits the NF-κB transcription response (21Le Bail O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israël A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 22Zabel U.

It is reported that phosphorylation of p65 by PKAc enhances acetylization of NF-κB by CBP/p300, which prevents p65 binding to the nuclear IκB, and the subsequent nuclear export (24Chen L.F. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). As discussed later, we consider from our data presented in this paper that the mechanism by which AKIP1 stimulates the NF-κB-dependent transcription involves the competition between AKIP1 and IκB in binding to NF-κB in the nucleus. AKIP1 was initially reported as a breast cancer-associated protein 3, called BCA3, highly expressed in the breast cancer and prostate cancer cell lines. However, its expression was minimal in normal breast and prostate tissues (25Kitching R. Li H. Wong M.J. Kanaganayakam S. Kahn H. Seth A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1625: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It was also reported that AKIP1 was a nuclear protein and appeared to facilitate the nuclear translocation of PKAc (26Sastri M. Barradough D.M. Carmichae P.T. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, our initial findings with a yeast two-hybrid screen of the molecular interaction between AKIP1 and p65, as well as the fact that NF-κB-mediated transcription is activated by AKIP1, prompted us to investigate the molecular action of AKIP1 in the NF-κB-mediated transcription. Here we provide evidences suggesting that AKIP1 enhances the transcriptional activity by retaining the nuclear localization of p65 and promoting the Ser-276 phosphorylation of p65 by PKAc. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Construction of Plasmids—A bait construct, pB27-p65-(1-186), expressing a fusion protein containing the LexA binding domain and the N-terminal region of p65 (aa 1-186), was constructed and used for the yeast two-hybrid screen against a human cDNA library, CEMC7_RP, obtained from a CD4(+) T cell line. A clone encoding AKIP1 obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening using the N terminus of p65 was cloned into pGEM-T-vector (Promega). Full-length AKIP1 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using mRNA purified from 293 cells and oligonucleotide primers, 5′-ACCATGGACAACTGTTTGGCGGCCGC-3′ and 5′-CACAGGGAAGACCAGGTCCACGCTTTGC-3′, containing HindIII and BamHI sites, and inserted into pcDNA3.1 vector containing the FLAG immunoepitope tag in-frame, thus creating pcDNA3.1-FLAG-AKIP1. pcDNA3.1-FLAG-AKIP1 (aa 1-72) was generated by amplifying the corresponding AKIP1 fragment by PCR using oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTGACAACTGTTTGGCGGCCGCA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCACTCTCCCGGGAGAACGCGCTGC-3′ containing HindIII and BamHI, respectively, and inserted into FLAG-pcDNA3.1 vector. pcDNA3.1-FLAG-AKIP1 (aa 73-210) was generated by inserting the HindIII-BamHI fragment containing the AKIP1 cDNA to FLAG-pcDNA3.1 vector by using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTAGAGAAGAGAGACCCCCAACC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCCACAGGGAAGACCAGGTCCAC-3′. pGEXGSTp65N expressing the p65 N-terminal region (aa 1-185), to express the recombinant p65 N-terminal region fused to the GST moiety, was constructed by inserting the cDNA fragment of pMp65, containing the aa 1-185 region of p65 and additional BamHI site in both ends to pGEX4T3 (Promega). The plasmids expressing kinase substrate p65, pGEXGSTp65 (aa 12-317) and pGEXGSTp65 (aa 12-317) S276C, where Ser-276 was substituted by Cys (10Vermeulen L. Wilde G.D. Damme P.V. Berghe W.V.

Cell Culture and Transfection—293, HeLa, and MCF7 cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using either FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche) or the CaCl2 method (27Blochlinger K. Diggelmann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2929-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. AKIP1 Knockdown by RNAi—The RNAi sequence of AKIP1 (UCCUCUUGGCCCUCUCCAGCACUUC) was designed from exon 2 of AKIP1 (aa 155-179), which can knockdown all endogenous AKIP1 and its splicing variants (AKIP1b and AKIP1c), as previously demonstrated (26Sastri M. Barradough D.M. Carmichae P.T. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Stealth RNAi for AKIP1 was purchased from Invitrogen. Transfection of Stealth RNAi of AKIP1 into MCF7 cells was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In Vitro Binding Assay—The GST and GST-p65 N protein were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads. [35S]Methionine-labeled AKIP1 proteins, full-length AKIP1, AKIP1 (aa 1-72), and AKIP1 (aa 73-210), were synthesized by the in vitro transcription and translation protocol using the TnT-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega) (28Yang J.P. Hori M. Sanda T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15662-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For in vitro protein-protein interaction studies, an equal amount of the in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled AKIP1 mutants were incubated with 20 μg of purified GST-p65 N-terminal protein (GST-p65 N) or GST alone (as negative control) that were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads in 1 ml of buffer A (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and proteasome inhibitors (Roche)) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed by buffer A three times with 500 μl of ice-cold binding buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with an equal volume of SDS loading buffer, boiled for 3 min, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation (IP)-Western Blotting—After transfection of FLAG-AKIP1, HeLa cells were cultured for 24 h and stimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml) for another 24 h. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in 500 μl of pre-chilled lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (Roche)) for 30 min. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and cell supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C, and beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with an equal volume of SDS loading buffer at 100 °C for 3 min and fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was conducted using anti-NF-κB p65 (C20) or anti-PKAc antibodies (Santa Cruz). Reciprocal experiments were performed as described above using NF-κB p65 (C20) antibody and eluted proteins were immunoblotted by anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or anti-PKAc antibody (Santa Cruz). MCF7 cells were treated with PMA (50 ng/ml) with or without transfection with RNAi-AKIP1. IP-Western blotting assay was then performed similarly using NF-κB p65 (C20) antibody (Santa Cruz) or AKIP1 polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. S. Taylor). Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were cultured in 4-well chamber slides and transfected with pcDNA3.1-FLAG-AKIP1 expressing FLAG-AKIP1 using FuGENE 6. After 24 h, cells were untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml PMA for 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 6 h, respectively. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and reacted with 10% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. Immunostaining was carried out with two primary antibodies including mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-κB p65 (C20) antibody (Santa Cruz), and two secondary antibodies, rhodamine- and fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies against mouse and rabbit IgGs (Calbiochem), respectively. Cells were then incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature to depict the nuclear morphology. The intracellular localizations of p65 and AKIP1 were examined by fluorescence microscopy. In Vitro Kinase Assay—293 cells were transfected with FLAG-AKIP1 with or without PKAc and immunoprecipitation was performed with beads containing anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) for 24 h after the transfection. The cellular proteins immunoprecipitated by binding to the FLAG M2 beads and 100 ng purified substrate protein GSTp65(12-317) were mixed and incubated in various kinase buffers (buffer A: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP; buffer B: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP; buffer C: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) as previously described (8Hayashi T.

The dose-dependent inhibitory action of PKI6-22 was assessed on the p65 phosphorylation by PKAc in the aforementioned conditions. Phosphorylated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and phosphate incorporation was visualized by PhosphorImager analysis using BAS-1800 II (Fuji Film, Tokyo). Transient Luciferase Assay—293 cells were cultured in 24-well plates and transfections were conducted with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche). For each transfection, FLAG-AKIP1 or its mutant plasmids together with 15 ng of pGL-3κB-luc, a κB-dependent reporter plasmid, and 5 ng of pRL-TK, expressing Renilla luciferase as an internal control, were used. The empty vector pcDNA3.1 was used to adjust the total amount of transfected DNA to 50 ng. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA for 24 h, with or without PKAc inhibitor PKI6-22 (10 nm), and harvested for luciferase assay. The luciferase activity was normalized by the Renilla luciferase activity of each transfection to normalize the transfection efficiency. Luciferase activities of CREB-luc or NFAT-luc reporter genes were also examined as controls. MCF7 cells were treated with PMA (10 ng/ml) with or without transfection with RNAi-AKIP1 (3, 10, and 20 nm). Cell lysates were then subjected to the luciferase assay. HIV-1-LTR-luc reporter plasmid with or without authentic κB sites (34Victoriano A.F.B. Asamitsu K. Hibi Y. Imai K. Barzaga N.G. Okamoto T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was also used for testing NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity. Interaction between p65 and AKIP1—By virtue of yeast two-hybrid screening using the N terminus of p65 (aa 1-186) as a bait against human cDNA library obtained from CEM cells with random priming, CEMC7_RP, we identified AKIP1 interacting with the p65 subunit of NF-κB. By screening ∼8.2 × 107 yeast transformants, 260 clones grew on selective medium and they were confirmed by β-galactosidase assay. Fig. 1A depicts a diagram of three independent clones of the same gene including Clone 107 (aa 36-210), Clones 41 and 139 (aa 46-210), which were identical, and Clone 223 (aa 108-210) containing various portions of C termini of AKIP1, which interacted with p65. To confirm the direct interaction between p65 and AKIP1, we performed in vitro GST pull-down assay between GSTp65 N proteins, containing the N-terminal (aa 1-185) region of p65, and various truncated proteins of AKIP1, AKIP1 (aa 1-72), AKIP1 (aa 73-210), and full-length AKIP1. As shown in Fig. 1B, full-length AKIP1 (lane 4) and C-terminal AKIP1 (aa 73-210) (lane 5), but not N-terminal AKIP1 (aa 1-72) (lane 6), interacted strongly with GST-p65 N. These results confirmed the molecular interaction between p65 and AKIP1 in vitro, and suggested that the N-terminal of p65 specifically binds the C-terminal of AKIP1 (aa 73-210). To examine the protein-protein interaction between AKIP1 and p65 in intact cells, we carried out immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting assay using antibodies to FLAG epitope and to p65, respectively. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing the full-length AKIP1 tagged with the FLAG epitope, incubated for 24 h, and then treated with 50 ng/ml PMA for an additional 24 h. Cell extracts were prepared and after immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody, the immune complex was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-NF-κB p65 (C20) antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A (left panel), after immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 beads, the 65-kDa band recognized by anti-p65 antibody, was detected. When cells were overexpressing FLAG-AKIP1 and treated with PMA (Fig. 2A, left panel, lane 4), the interaction between p65 and AKIP1 was demonstrated in vivo. However, without PMA treatment, the binding between p65 and FLAG-AKIP1 was not detected (Fig. 2A, left panel, lane 2), suggesting that the association of AKIP1 and p65 requires the signal-activated NF-κB. The reciprocal experiment using anti-p65 antibody to immunoprecipitate the NF-κB complex followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody was carried out and similar results were obtained (Fig. 2A, right panel). These findings demonstrate that the binding between p65 and AKIP1 occurs in the cells where NF-κB is activated. Similar experiments using anti-FLAG M2 beads for immunoprecipitation and anti-p50 antibody for Western blotting were performed, but no p50 binding to AKIP1 was detected (data not shown). To further confirm the interaction between lines AKIP1 and p65 under the physiological conditions, we performed the IP-Western blotting assay in MCF7 cells expressing high levels of endogenous AKIP1 (25Kitching R. Li H. Wong M.J. Kanaganayakam S. Kahn H. Seth A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1625: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Sastri M. Barradough D.M. Carmichae P.T. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After cells were treated with 50 ng/ml PMA, cell lysates were subjected to the immunoprecipitation assay by anti-p65 antibody, then the p65-bound AKIP1 was detected by Western blotting using polyclonal antibody against AKIP1 (Fig. 2B, left panel, lanes 1 and 2). Treatment of PMA enhanced this interaction between p65 and endogenous AKIP1 (Fig. 2B, left panel, lane 2; compare with lane 1). AKIP1 knockdown with 10 nm RNAi-AKIP1 remarkably inhibited the binding of AKIP1 to p65 (Fig. 2B, left panel, lanes 3 and 4). Reciprocal experiments using anti-AKIP1 for the immunoprecipitation and anti-p65 for the immunoblotting were performed and consistent results were obtained (Fig. 2B, right panel, lanes 5-8). The control RNAi, nonspecific for AKIP1, did not affect the p65-AKIP1 binding (data not shown). These results suggested that AKIP1 interacts with p65 in physiological conditions and this interaction can be enhanced by PMA treatment. Involvement of PKAc in the AKIP1·p65 Complex—Because it is previously known that AKIP1 interacts with PKAc (26Sastri M. Barradough D.M. Carmichae P.T. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we next examined whether PKAc is contained in the AKIP1·p65 complex. In the immunoprecipitation-Western blotting assay, PKAc was coprecipitated with FLAG-AKIP1 (Fig. 2C, left panel). Without any stimulation, there was a small amount of PKAc bound to FLAG-AKIP1 (lane 2), whereas upon treatment with PMA, a larger amount of PKAc was detected bound to FLAG-AKIP1 (lane 4) confirming the previous finding that the degradation of IκB activates the PKAc (9Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C (right panel) shows that PKAc was also found interacting with p65 in addition to AKIP1 in vivo especially when cells were stimulated with PMA (compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 7 and 8). Without PMA stimulation, overexpression of FLAG-AKIP1 did not significantly change the binding between PKAc and p65 (Fig. 2C, right panel, compare lanes 5 and 6), presumably because both PKAc and p65 were sequestered by the IκB protein in the resting cells. However, in the presence of PMA treatment (compare lanes 7 and 8), overexpression of FLAG-AKIP1 slightly increased the interaction between PKAc and p65. These results suggest that NF-κB activation, and IκB degradation, promotes the binding of AKIP1 to the PKAc·p65 complex. It appears that AKIP1 consolidates the PKAc·p65 complex formation by an un-identified mechanism. AKIP1 Colocalizes with p65 in the Nucleus and Promotes Its Nuclear Retention—To analyze the subcellular distribution of AKIP1 protein, we transfected FLAG-tagged AKIP1 into HeLa cells. These cells were then treated with PMA for different time periods and the intracellular localization of p65 and AKIP1 was examined. After 30 min and 1 h treatment of PMA, ∼79 and 91% of the FLAG-AKIP1-transfected cells showed the nuclear distribution of p65 in contrast to 63 and 77% of the nontransfected cells. As shown in Fig. 3, AKIP1 appears to promote the nuclear retention of p65 (compare Fig. 3, A and B, and see the comparison graph in Fig. 3C). After 2 h treatment with PMA, majorities of p65 started to move from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In ∼68% of cells p65 was predominantly found in the nucleus, whereas significantly higher numbers of cells (81%) to which FLAG-AKIP1 was transfected showed p65 retained in the nucleus. This effect of AKIP1 was observed at least for 6 h. However, overexpression of FLAG-AKIP1 did not change the intracellular distribution of p65 without PMA stimulation (Fig. 3), indicating that nuclear protein AKIP1 promotes the nuclear translocation of p65 only upon stimulation with PMA, which may liberate and activate the IκB-sequestered PKAc. Inhibition of PKAc by H89 blocked the PMA-induced nuclear translocation of p65 irrespective of the presence of AKIP1 (data not shown). These findings collectively indicate that overexpression of AKIP1 facilitates the nuclear translocation and retention of p65 and that the intracellular signaling, such as the PMA signaling, is required. AKIP1 Enhances Phosphorylation of p65 by Recruiting PKAc—As AKIP1 interacts with both PKAc and p65 at the same time (Fig. 2) and phosphorylation of p65 by PKAc is considered to be critical for the NF-κB-mediated gene expression (8Hayashi T. Sekine T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26790-26795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), we examined whether p65 phosphorylation by PKAc is up-regulated by AKIP1 by the in vitro kinase assay.

https://openalex.org/W2082957812,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. To prevent errors in protein synthesis, many synthetases have evolved editing pathways by which misactivated amino acids (pre-transfer editing) and misacylated tRNAs (post-transfer editing) are hydrolyzed. Previous studies have shown that class II prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) possesses both pre- and post-transfer editing functions against noncognate alanine. To assess the relative contributions of pre- and post-transfer editing, presented herein are kinetic studies of an Escherichia coli ProRS mutant in which post-transfer editing is selectively inactivated, effectively isolating the pre-transfer editing pathway. When post-transfer editing is abolished, substantial levels of alanine mischarging are observed under saturating amino acid conditions, indicating that pre-transfer editing alone cannot prevent the formation of Ala-tRNAPro. Steady-state kinetic parameters for aminoacylation measured under these conditions reveal that the preference for proline over alanine is 2000-fold, which is well within the regime where editing is required. Simultaneous measurement of AMP and Ala-tRNAPro formation in the presence of tRNAPro suggested that misactivated alanine is efficiently transferred to tRNA to form the mischarged product. In the absence of tRNA, enzyme-catalyzed Ala-AMP hydrolysis is the dominant form of editing, with “selective release” of noncognate adenylate from the active site constituting a minor pathway. Studies with human and Methanococcus jannaschii ProRS, which lack a post-transfer editing domain, suggest that enzymatic pre-transfer editing occurs within the aminoacylation active site. Taken together, the results reported herein illustrate how both pre- and post-transfer editing pathways work in concert to ensure accurate aminoacylation by ProRS.

Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Biosciences, Georgetown, TX2005Google Scholar). In the first step, an amino acid is activated with ATP to form an aminoacyl-adenylate (AA-AMP) intermediate. In the second step, the amino acid is transferred to the 3′ end of the cognate tRNA to form the aminoacylated tRNA product. Therefore, the fidelity of protein synthesis is maintained, in large part, by the selectivity of the AARS for their specific substrates. The selection of cognate tRNA is based upon a number of unique identity elements within the nucleic acid sequence, resulting in high specificity of AARS for their cognate tRNAs (4Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). However, selection of cognate amino acids poses a greater challenge because the amino acid is a smaller molecule with fewer distinguishing features (5Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Misactivation of amino acids that are smaller than or isosteric with the cognate amino acid is often observed. These errors may result in mischarged tRNA products and subsequent incorporation of incorrect amino acids into proteins, thereby challenging the viability or function of living cells (6Lee J.W. Beebe K. Nangle L.A. Jang J. Longo-Guess C.M. Cook S.A. Davisson M.T. Sundberg J.P. Schimmel P. Ackerman S.L.

To correct for errors in amino acid selection, many AARS have evolved a series of editing mechanisms (Scheme 1) (7Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Lapointe J. Brakier-Gingras L. Translation Mechanism. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York2003: 34-64Google Scholar). In pre-transfer editing, the noncognate AA-AMP is hydrolyzed to yield free amino acid and AMP (paths 1-3). This reaction can occur via tRNA-dependent or -independent enzymatic hydrolysis in either the synthetic active site or at a separate editing site (paths 1 and 3) or via “selective release” of the enzyme-bound AA-AMP into solution and subsequent hydrolysis (path 2). Post-transfer editing consists of the hydrolysis of mischarged aminoacyl-tRNA at a separate domain on the enzyme (path 4). Of the 20 AARS, ten enzymes representative of both classes have been observed to exhibit editing activities (8Mascarenhas A. Martinis S. An S. Rosen A.E. Musier-Forsyth K. RajBhandary T. Koehrer C.

Prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) is a class II synthetase that has been shown to misactivate a variety of both natural and unnatural, noncognate amino acids and to possess multiple mechanisms to maintain fidelity (10Beuning P.J.

Post-transfer editing of Ala-tRNAPro by bacterial ProRS is carried out by a large insertion domain located between class II consensus motifs 2 and 3 (12Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the insertion domain, when expressed as an independent protein, maintains its deacylation activity, and this activity can be modulated via mutation of the highly conserved Lys279 residue (13Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Silvers C. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52857-52864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recent work has identified a variety of homologs of the insertion domain that also possess deacylation function. In particular, Haemophilus influenzae YbaK was recently shown to be specific for the deacylation of Cys-tRNAPro, providing a mechanism by which mischarged cysteine is cleared in some organisms (16Ruan B.

Proteins. 2000; 40: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although overwhelming evidence exists for post-transfer editing by bacterial ProRSs, it may not be the dominant mechanism. In the absence of tRNA, alanine stimulates ATP hydrolysis (10Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), indicative of either enzymatic pre-transfer editing (5Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or release of the noncognate adenylate into solution (14Hati S. Ziervogel B. SternJohn J. Wong F. Nagan M. Rosen A.E. Siliciano P.G. Chihade J.W. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27862-27872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Whereas the assessment of pre-transfer editing in the absence of tRNA is straightforward, the presence of tRNA complicates the analysis of pre-transfer editing because of the concurrent hydrolysis of mischarged Ala-tRNAPro, allowing only for the extent of total editing to be measured. To directly assess pre-transfer editing in the course of the aminoacylation reaction, we have kinetically characterized the K279A Escherichia coli (Ec) ProRS mutant that is defective in post-transfer editing (12Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), thereby effectively isolating the pre-transfer pathway. Characterization of this simplified reaction scheme allows for the direct assessment of the relative contributions of pre- and post-transfer editing to the fidelity of aminoacylation by Ec ProRS, revealing that both pathways work in concert to ensure efficient aminoacylation. Studies carried out with human (Hm) and Methanococcus jannaschii (Mj) ProRS, which lack post-transfer editing activity, were consistent with results obtained using the bacterial system and show that enzymatic pre-transfer editing is maintained even in the absence of the post-transfer editing domain.

Enzyme concentrations were determined by active site titration (23Fersht A.R. Ashford J.S. Bruton C.J. Jakes R. Koch G.L. Hartley B.S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). RNA Preparation—Ec tRNAPro was prepared by in vitro transcription using BstNI-linearized plasmid as described previously (24Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). tRNAPro was labeled with 32P at the 3′-terminal internucleotide linkage via published procedures with slight modification (25Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A 100-μl reaction containing 50 mm glycine-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm tRNAPro, 0.82 μm [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 50 μm sodium PPi, and 30 μg/ml tRNA-terminal nucleotidyl transferase was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Yeast pyrophosphatase (PPiase) was added to a final concentration of 10 units/ml, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 30 s. The reaction was quenched by phenol/chloroform extraction, filtered through a G25 microspin column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove unreacted nucleotides, and isolated via ethanol precipitation. Purity was checked by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealing successful removal of free nucleotides. Nonchargeable tRNA was obtained by periodate oxidation. Briefly, a 50-μl reaction containing 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5, 2.5 mm sodium periodate, and 80 μm tRNAPro was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Glucose was added to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the reaction was incubated at 0 °C for an additional 1.5 h. The oxidized product was collected via ethanol precipitation. Charging assays utilizing [3H]Pro conducted using published conditions (26Liu H. Peterson R. Kessler J. Musier-Forsyth K.

Enzyme Assays—Aminoacylation assays to determine kinetic parameters and charging levels were performed at 37 °C. The reactions (20 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm tRNAPro, trace amounts of 32P-labeled tRNAPro, and variable levels of amino acid. The reactions were initiated upon addition of Ec K279A ProRS to a final concentration of 0.1 μm (proline) or 0.5 μm (alanine), unless otherwise specified. At the desired time point, a 1.5-μl aliquot was removed and quenched into 4 μl of 0.2 m NaOAc, pH 5, containing 0.4 unit/μl of nuclease P1 (Sigma) at 0 °C. Upon completion of the assay, the aliquots were digested at room temperature for 15 min. Aliquots (1 μl) were spotted onto polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (Sigma) pre-washed with water. Separation of [32P]AMP and aminoacyl-[32P]AMP was performed by developing TLC plates in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, 5% acetic acid. The plates were visualized by phosphorimaging, and the data were analyzed using Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX software. The fraction of acylated tRNA was determined from the ratio of aminoacyl-AMP to the total amount of AMP in the reaction aliquot. Kinetic parameters were determined using at least five concentrations for each amino acid, ranging from 0.01 to 1 mm for proline and from 10 to 450 mm for alanine. The data were analyzed using Lineweaver-Burk plots. TLC assays to measure the rate of AMP formation were performed as described previously (14Hati S. Ziervogel B. SternJohn J. Wong F. Nagan M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 27862-27872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with the exception that pyrophosphatase was omitted from the reaction. All of the assays contained either 3 mm proline or 450 mm alanine, 250 μm ATP, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm KF, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 μm [α-32P]ATP. The reactions were performed at 37 °C and initiated with either 0.5 μm Ec K279A ProRS or 5 μm WT Ec ProRS, Hm ProRS, or Mj ProRS. The data were analyzed as described previously at 0.5 μm enzyme concentrations (14Hati S. Ziervogel B. SternJohn J. Wong F. Nagan M. Rosen A.E. Siliciano P.G. Chihade J.W. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27862-27872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At 5 μm enzyme, the rates were obtained using only the initial time points, where the plot of [AMP] versus time was linear. The data were fit to the following equation: y=B+ksst(Eq. 1) where B is the burst amplitude and kss is the steady-state rate. The reaction rate constants (kobs) were calculated by dividing the steady-state rate of the reaction (in μm/s) by the total enzyme concentration (μm). To directly compare the rates of mischarging with AMP formation, charging assays were performed utilizing the same reaction conditions as described for the assay of AMP formation. Digestion of tRNA and subsequent data analysis were as described above. Characterization of Alanine Mischarging by a Mutant ProRS That Lacks Post-transfer Editing Activity—In this work, we kinetically characterized the EC K279A ProRS mutant, in which post-transfer editing was previously shown to be essentially abolished (12Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By focusing on this enzyme, the impact that pre-transfer editing has upon alanine charging kinetics could be assessed. Initial steady-state charging assays performed with proline revealed that both WT and K279A ProRS charge the cognate amino acid substrate with equal efficiency (data not shown), indicating that the fidelity of the synthetic active site in this mutant is maintained. To characterize the alanine charging kinetics for both WT and K279A ProRS, we used an assay in which the 3′-terminal internucleotide linkage of tRNAPro is labeled with [32P] (25Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Importantly, use of this assay allows for kinetic characterization at saturating amino acid levels, in contrast to the more commonly used trichloroacetic acid precipitation method, which uses 3H-labeled amino acids (12Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Liu H. Peterson R. Kessler J. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At saturating alanine levels (450 mm), the post-transfer editing-deficient K279A ProRS shows that substantial alanine mischarging capabilities and plateau level charging can be achieved (Fig. 1). In contrast, WT ProRS shows detectable but low mischarging levels, because of post-transfer editing of mischarged alanine, as previously reported (12Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A plateau level is observed because of a dynamic equilibrium between mischarging and hydrolysis. Thus, abolishing post-transfer editing results in an increase in mischarged tRNA, implying that pre-transfer editing alone cannot ensure the fidelity of aminoacyl-tRNAPro synthesis. To further quantify this effect, we determined steady-state parameters for the two-step aminoacylation reaction for both cognate proline and noncognate alanine by Ec K279A ProRS. As shown in Table 1, the values measured when post-transfer editing is abolished result in a discrimination factor for proline over alanine of 1 in 1900, which is well within the range where editing is needed (28Fersht A.R. Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B. 1981; 212: 351-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), even when the relative amino acid concentrations are not taken into account. In E. coli, alanine is present at a higher concentration than proline (148 μm versus 9 μm, respectively) (29Raunio R. Rosenqvist H. Acta Chem. Scand. 1970; 24: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which effectively reduces the discrimination factor to 1 in 120. These results further support the conclusion that pre-transfer editing is not sufficient to prevent the mischarging of alanine in the presence of tRNA.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for the aminoacylation of tRNAPro with proline and alanine by K279A Ec ProRSAmino acidkcatKmkcat/Kmkcat/Km (relative)s−1mMs−1 mM−1Pro0.23 ± 0.080.15 ± 0.021.51Ala0.024 ± 0.00231 ± 27.7 × 10−45.1 × 10−4 Open table in a new tab Measurement of AMP Formation in the Presence of tRNA—As shown in Scheme 1, both pre-transfer editing and amino acid transfer to form charged tRNA result in the release of AMP. In the absence of editing, the formation of AMP is expected to be stoichiometric with respect to the formation of charged tRNA. In the presence of editing, AMP is formed to a greater extent than charged tRNA, because both adenylate hydrolysis (pre-transfer editing) and mischarging and subsequent deacylation (post-transfer editing) result in the production of AMP. Because post-transfer editing is abolished in the case of K279A ProRS, nonstoichiometric production of AMP reports directly on the extent of pre-transfer editing. To assess the formation of AMP as both a function of pre-transfer editing and of tRNA charging, we monitored steady-state AMP formation and tRNA charging with K279A Ec ProRS under the same conditions, in the presence of either proline or alanine. Importantly, all of the assays were performed in the absence of PPiase, which prevents pyrophosphorolysis of the alanyl-adenylate. Thus, under these conditions, the reverse reaction may also take place. For cognate proline, no appreciable formation of AMP by K279A ProRS is detected in the absence of tRNA, consistent with the lack of cognate amino acid editing (Table 2). When the overall accuracy of the experimental technique and standard deviations are taken into account, the presence of tRNA results in a rate of AMP formation that agrees well with the rate of tRNA aminoacylation under identical conditions (Table 2). Similar results have been demonstrated upon formation of His-tRNAHis by Ec histidyl-tRNA synthetase (30Guth E.C. Francklyn C.S. Mol.

Furthermore, when the supply of chargeable tRNA is exhausted (i.e. plateau is reached), AMP formation continues with the same steady-state rate, presumably because of adenylate hydrolysis. The observation of similar rates for both reactions in the presence and absence of tRNA implies that they share a common rate-limiting step. Furthermore, these data suggest that the transfer step is kinetically fast enough to out-compete pre-transfer editing (see also Fig. 1).TABLE 3Steady-state kinetic parameters of AMP and AA-AMP formation by Ec, Hm, and Mj ProRSBAaBA is the burst amplitude extrapolated to time 0.kobsAMPAA-AMPAMPAA-AMPμMs−1Ec ProRS (Ala)12 ± 70.7 ± 0.6(3.0 ± 0.9) × 10−2(5 ± 1) × 10−3Ec ProRS (Pro)6 ± 20.2 ± 0.02(2.2 ± 0.7) × 10−3(8.2 ± 0.4) × 10−5Mj ProRS (Ala)10 ± 31 ± 0.3(1.5 ± 0.4) × 10−2(2.4 ± 0.7) × 10−3Hm ProRS2 ± 5—bThe dash denotes a reaction in which no product was detected.(6.1 ± 0.4) × 10−2-(Ala)a BA is the burst amplitude extrapolated to time 0.b The dash denotes a reaction in which no product was detected. Open table in a new tab In some AARS, it has been demonstrated that the presence of tRNA can induce a conformational change that impacts the synthetic active site. For example, GlnRS is catalytically inactive prior to binding tRNAGln, demonstrating the importance of tRNA-induced conformational changes (31Ibba M. Becker H.D. Stathopoulos C. Tumbula D.L. Söll D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutant tRNAHis has been shown to alter the kinetics of His-AMP formation by HisRS (30Guth E.C. Francklyn C.S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To probe the possibility that the binding of tRNA induces a conformational change that stabilizes the enzyme-bound Ala-AMP intermediate and thereby increases the observed rate of mischarging, we measured the rate of AMP formation by K279A Ec ProRS in both the presence and absence of a nonchargeable tRNA substrate. If bound tRNA is capable of stabilizing the adenylate intermediate and decreasing the rate of editing, a reduced rate of AMP formation should be observed, because in this case AMP formation can only occur via pre-transfer editing. However, in the presence of periodate-treated tRNA, the rate of AMP formation was measured to be 0.048 s-1, which is similar to the observed rate in the absence of tRNA (Table 2). We therefore conclude that the binding of tRNA does not increase the stability of Ala-AMP, implying that alanine transfer to tRNAPro can kinetically compete with adenylate hydrolysis. Furthermore, the addition of tRNA does not further stimulate AMP production beyond the level formed during aminoacylation, consistent with the earlier observation that tRNA does not stimulate pre-transfer editing by ProRS (10Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Enzyme-catalyzed Hydrolysis of Ala-AMP—Although the results described above clearly point to post-transfer editing as the dominant mechanism in the presence of chargeable tRNA, in the absence of tRNA, Ala-AMP is hydrolyzed at a significant rate (0.034 s-1). Consistent with our previous studies of WT Ec ProRS (14Hati S. Ziervogel B. SternJohn J. Wong F. Nagan M. Rosen A.E. Siliciano P.G. Chihade J.W. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27862-27872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the steady-state rate of AMP formation by K279A ProRS in the presence of alanine is significantly faster (5- and 7-fold in the absence and presence of tRNA, respectively) than the steady-state rate of Ala-AMP formation (Fig. 3 and Table 2). We also previously reported that the rate of AMP formation by WT ProRS in the presence of alanine was ∼2-fold slower than the rate of nonenzymatic hydrolysis of Ala-AMP (∼0.1 min-1) and therefore concluded that the majority of pre-transfer editing was occurring via the selective release pathway rather than via enzymatic hydrolysis (14Hati S. Ziervogel B. SternJohn J. Wong F. Nagan M. Rosen A.E. Siliciano P.G. Chihade J.W. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27862-27872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, our present studies of K279A ProRS show that the rate of AMP formation in the presence of alanine is 0.034 s-1, which is at least 20 times faster than the rate of nonenzymatic hydrolysis (32Lewinsohn R. Paecht-Horowitz M. Katchalsky A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 140: 24-36Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and suggests that pre-transfer editing is enzyme catalyzed. These results motivated us to revisit our previous conclusions with WT ProRS, and in doing so, a calculation error was uncovered. 4In calculating the rate of AMP formation reported in the first row of Table 3 in Ref. 14Hati S. Ziervogel B. SternJohn J. Wong F. Nagan M. Rosen A.E. Siliciano P.G. Chihade J.W. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol.

The revised numbers are: kobs = 9.6 min-1 for proline and 27.2 min-1 for alanine. We now report a revised rate of 0.45 s-1 for overall AMP formation in the presence of alanine by WT ProRS. This rate is 240 times faster than the rate of nonenzymatic hydrolysis. Although this recalculated rate is significantly larger than what we report herein for WT ProRS (Table 3), we attribute this difference to the presence of PPiase in our previous studies.

It is also associated with a variety of neurological diseases. Changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α1 subunit gene (<i>GABRA1</i>) expression have been reported in animal models of epilepsy, alcohol abuse, withdrawal, and stress. Understanding the genetic mechanism behind such changes in α subunit expression will lead to a better understanding of the role that signal transduction plays in control over GABA<sub>A</sub>R function and brings with it the promise of providing new therapeutic tools for the prevention or cure of a variety of neurological disorders. Here we show that activation of protein kinase C increases α1 subunit levels via phosphorylation of CREB (pCREB) that is bound to the <i>GABRA1</i> promoter (<i>GABRA1p</i>). In contrast, activation of protein kinase A decreases levels of α1 even in the presence of pCREB. Decrease of α1 is dependent upon the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) as directly demonstrated by ICER-induced down-regulation of endogenous α1-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at the cell surface of cortical neurons. Taken together with the fact that there are less α1γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in neurons after protein kinase A stimulation and that activation of endogenous dopamine receptors down-regulates α1 subunit mRNA levels subsequent to induction of ICER, our studies identify a transcriptional mechanism for regulating the cell surface expression of α1-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs that is dependent upon the formation of CREB heterodimers."

Nature. 2005; 437: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 (Flt1) and VEGFR2 (mouse Flk1 or human KDR), are restricted in their tissue distribution primarily to endothelial cells. The binding of VEGF to its cognate receptors induces dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation of the receptors, leading to the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways (5Takahashi T.

In particular, the angiogenic signals triggered by VEGF are mediated through the activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), protein kinase C, and subsequently the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (5Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar).

The importance of VEGF-induced signaling is demonstrated in that the genetic inactivation of either receptor leads to a complete lack of development of blood vessels in the embryo, and inactivation of VEGFR2 function dramatically impairs the growth of cancer cells in vivo (12Fong G.H.

In particular, mice deficient in c-Src showed no vascular permeability response to VEGF and displayed minimal edema and infarction volume following stroke (15Eliceiri B.P. Paul R. Schwartzberg P.L.

The Src family of tyrosine kinases are basally inactive due to autoinhibition by intramolecular interactions between its Src homology 2 domain and a phosphotyrosine (Tyr-527 in chickens, Tyr-530 in humans) in the C-terminal region and/or between its Src homology 3 domain and a Pro-rich sequence in the linker region (17Zhang S.Q.

Cell. 2004; 13: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of c-Src at Tyr-527 is catalyzed by the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), a cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinase that is regulated by binding to its docking proteins for co-localization with c-Src to exert its inhibitory effect (17Zhang S.Q.

Recent studies suggest that Csk recruitment to its docking proteins, such as paxillin and Cbp/PAG, is controlled by the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (18Chan R.J. Feng G.S.

SHP2 promotes c-Src activation by regulating the phosphorylation of the Csk regulators PAG/Cbp and paxillin, thereby controlling Csk access to Src kinases (17Zhang S.Q. Yang W. Kontaridis M.I.

However, how Src kinase is activated in response to VEGF and whether there is a specific docking protein for Csk to control Src activation remain to be determined. Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) is the major adhesive protein of the adherens junction and is specific for vascular endothelial cells (21Dejana E. Spagnuolo R. Bazzoni G. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Deletion or cytosolic truncation of VE-cadherin impairs remodeling and maturation of the vascular network, and on the cellular level, it abolishes transmission of intracellular signal via VEGFR2 (22Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V. Bono F. Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Oostuyse B. Dewerchin M. Zanetti A. Angellilo A. Mattot V. Nuyens D. Lutgens E. Clotman F. Ruiter de M.C.

VE-cadherin exerts a negative effect on endothelial cell growth by binding VEGFR2 and inhibiting its mitogenic signaling pathways mediated by ERK1/2 activation (22Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G.

Breviario F. Dejana E. Resnick N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9462-9467Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition, VEGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, which has been proposed as a potential mechanism that regulates the stability of cell-cell junctions and vascular permeability (21Dejana E. Spagnuolo R. Bazzoni G. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin contains nine tyrosine residues that represent potential target sites for tyrosine kinases, which may participate in recruiting the signaling proteins that associate with VE-cadherin (24Baumeister U. Funke R. Ebnet K. Vorschmitt H. Koch S. Vestweber D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1686-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In particular, it has recently been reported that Csk binds to the phosphorylated Tyr-685 of VE-cadherin. Therefore, it is likely that VE-cadherin plays a pivotal role in VEGF signaling in endothelial cells. In this study, we found that c-Src activation by VEGF was impaired when VE-cadherin expression in endothelial cells was knocked down by small interference RNA (siRNA) and when the Csk binding site in VE-cadherin was mutated. When tyrosine-phosphorylated, VE-cadherin recruited SHP2, which served to disrupt VE-cadherin-Csk complex formation, resulting in the activation of c-Src. Importantly, we also showed that the VE-cadherin/SHP2/Src signaling module was required for VEGF-mediated Akt and eNOS but not ERK1/2 activation.

Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and were cultured in medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) as described previously (25Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from human umbilical veins and grown in medium 200 with LSGS (Cascade Biologics, Inc.), as described previously (26Jin Z.G. Wong C. Wu J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12305-12309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Wong C. Jin Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33262-33269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Confluent cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were serum-starved for 24 h and exposed to VEGF as indicated. For the inhibitor studies, cells were pretreated with various inhibitors for 30 min in serum-depleted medium. siRNA and Transfection—To determine the contribution of VE-cadherin and SHP2 in VEGF-stimulated signaling, we treated HUVECs with human VE-cadherin, SHP2, and c-Src siRNA duplex obtained from Dharmacon, Inc. The following siRNAs were used: VE-cadherin siRNA, sense (5′-GGAACCAGAUGCACAUUGAUU) and antisense (5′-PUCAAUGUGCAUCUGGUUCCUU); SHP2 siRNA, sense (5′-GAACAUCACGGGCAAUUAAUU) and antisense (5′-PUUAAUUGCCCGUGAUGUUCUU); c-Src siRNA, sense (5′-GAGAACCUGGUGUGCAAAGUU) and antisense (5′-PCUUUGCACACCAGGUUCUCUU). The scrambled siRNA control is a nontargeting siRNA pool from Dharmacon, Inc. For transfection of siRNA, HUVECs were seeded into 60-mm dishes for 24 h at about 80% confluence, and then transfection of siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, as described previously (27Wong C. Jin Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33262-33269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). VEGF stimulation was performed 48 h after siRNA transfection. Adenovirus Constructs and Infection—Adenoviruses encoding mouse VE-cadherin wild type (WT) and tyrosine 685 replacement mutant (Y685F) were generated from pcDNA3-VE-cadherin-WT and pcDNA3-VE-cadherin-Y685F, which were kindly provided by Dr. Dietmar Vestweber (University of Münster, Münster, Germany) (24Baumeister U. Funke R. Ebnet K. Vorschmitt H. Koch S. Vestweber D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1686-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), using the ViraPower Adenoviral Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Adenoviruses encoding the catalytically inactive SHP2 mutant with phosphatase domain deletion (Ad-SHP2ΔPTP) and the kinase-inactive c-Src mutant (c-Src-DN) have been described previously (28Kontaridis M.I. Liu X. Zhang L. Bennett A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3875-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Okuda M. Takahashi M. Suero J. Murry C.E. Traub O. Kawakatsu H. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26803-26809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses containing β-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) was used as a control. The infection of endothelial cells with recombinant adenovirus was performed as described previously (30Lungu A.O. Jin Z.G. Yamawaki H. Tanimoto T. Wong C. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48794-48800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, endothelial cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were infected with adenoviruses at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) for 24 h in a growth medium and then treated with VEGF. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested in lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitations were performed according to standard protocols, as described previously (25Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 27Wong C. Jin Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33262-33269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The immune complex samples or total cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE according to standard protocols (25Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 27Wong C. Jin Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33262-33269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). After being transferred to membranes, the samples were immunoblotted with primary antibodies, followed by IRDye infrared secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences). Bands for immunoreactive proteins were visualized by an Odyssey infrared imaging system, and density was quantified by the use of Odyssey software (LI-COR Biotechnology). Results were normalized by arbitrarily setting the densitometry of the control sample to 1.0. Immunofluorescence—For analysis of the VE-cadherin, Csk, and phospho-Src Tyr-416 localization in monolayer endothelial cells, BAECs or HUVECs were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline after the treatment of VEGF (31Yamaoka-Tojo M. Tojo T. Kim H.W. Hilenski L. Patrushev N.A. Zhang L. Fukai T. Ushio-Fukai M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1991-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry were performed according to a standard protocol, and the images were captured at a magnification of ×60, using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51). Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as means ± S.E. The significance of the results was assessed by a paired t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. VE-cadherin Modulates c-Src Activation in Response to VEGF—To ask whether VEGF-evoked c-Src activation requires VE-cadherin function, we studied endothelial cells in which VE-cadherin expression was silenced acutely by siRNA. Because our siRNAs specifically target on human proteins, all experiments related to siRNA were performed in HUVECs. Freshly isolated HUVECs were transfected with siRNA against human VE-cadherin or with a scrambled nontargeting siRNA control. 48 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml VEGF for 0, 5, 10, and 30 min. Immunoblots revealed a >90% decrease of VE-cadherin expression in VE-cadherin siRNA-transfected cells. VE-cadherin siRNA is specific for targeting VE-cadherin, since expression of β-actin, Akt, and eNOS was unchanged (Fig. 1A). c-Src activation was determined by the status of its autophosphorylation at the active site Tyr-416 residue using specific phospho-Src antibodies. VEGF stimulated increased Src Tyr-416 phosphorylation in control siRNA-treated cells in a time-dependent manner, which is similar to untreated cells (not shown). In contrast, VEGF-evoked c-Src Tyr-416 phosphorylation was decreased markedly in VE-cadherin siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, silencing VE-cadherin did not significantly affect overall VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to VEGF (Fig. 1C). These results imply that VE-cadherin plays a critical role in c-Src activation by VEGF in ECs. VE-cadherin Differentially Modulates Akt and ERK1/2 Activation by VEGF—To further determine the role of VE-cadherin in VEGF signaling, we examined the effects of silencing VE-cadherin by siRNA on VEGF-induced activation of ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS (a substrate of Akt (32Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar)), which have been shown to play pivotal roles in endothelial cell proliferation, survival, migration, and permeability (33Sessa W.C. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 2005; 100: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). HUVECs were transfected with control or VE-cadherin siRNA; 48 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml VEGF at various times as indicated. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies that recognize their phosphorylation at active sites of Akt Ser-473 (p-Akt), eNOS Ser-1177 (p-eNOS), and ERK1/2 Thr-202/Tyr-204 (p-ERK1/2), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2A, a marked increase in both Akt and eNOS phosphorylation was observed after treatment with VEGF. Cells treated with VE-cadehrin siRNA showed a marked decrease in Akt and eNOS phosphorylation relative to control cells. There was no change in the expression of total Akt and eNOS under any of these conditions (Fig. 2A). Most intriguingly, in contrast to the reduced Akt and eNOS phosphorylation by VE-cadherin siRNA, there was an increase of VEGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in VE-cadherin siRNA-treated HUVECs compared with control cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Our results suggest that VE-cadherin differentially modulates VEGF signal transduction in endothelial cells. Notably, the role of VE-cadherin in the regulation of VEGF-stimulated c-Src activation and downstream signaling to Akt, eNOS, and ERK1/2 is specific, because siRNA silencing of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule, another paracellular transmembrane adhesion molecule present in regions of cell-cell contact, had no significant effects on VEGF-mediated Akt, eNOS, and ERK1/2 activation (data not shown). c-Src Kinase Mediates Activation of Akt and eNOS in Response to VEGF—Src kinases play an import role in signal transduction of various tyrosine kinase receptors. Although it has been suggested that c-Src kinase is involved in VEGF signaling and angiogenesis in endothelial cells, evidence linking Src to Akt/eNOS and ERK1/2 pathways remains to be firmly established (10Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 100: 293-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Here we exploited the Src kinase-selective inhibitor PP2 to examine the role of c-Src in VEGF signaling. BAECs were pretreated with or without Src kinase inhibitor PP2 at 10 μm for 30 min and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml VEGF for 10 min. The treatment of PP2 inhibited VEGF-induced Akt and eNOS activation. In contrast, inhibiting Src kinases by PP2 enhanced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed in HUVECs treated with PP2 (data not shown). Our data suggest differential roles of c-Src in VEGF-mediated Akt/eNOS and ERK1/2 pathways. To further determine the role of c-Src in VEGF signaling, we examined the effects of an adenovirus encoding for a kinase-inactive c-Src on VEGF signaling. The dominant negative function of this kinase-inactive c-Src mutant (c-Src-DN) has been characterized previously (29Okuda M. Takahashi M. Suero J. Murry C.E. Traub O. Kawakatsu H. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26803-26809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Infection of c-Src-DN at 30, 100, and 300 MOI in HUVECs increased c-Src expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the PP2 results, overexpression of c-Src-DN dose-dependently inhibited Akt and eNOS activation in response to VEGF. However, VEGF-induced ERK1/2 activation was increased by overexpression of a c-Src-DN in HUVECs. Thus, our findings imply that c-Src has a positive role in VEGF-induced activation of Akt and eNOS but a negative role in ERK1/2 activation. SHP2 Is Essential for Mediating VE-cadherin to c-Src Activation in Response to VEGF—To define the molecular mechanisms by which VE-cadherin modulates VEGF activation of c-Src, we studied the potential signal molecules associated with VE-cadherin, focusing on SHP2 because of its involvement in Src activation in other systems (17Zhang S.Q. Yang W. Kontaridis M.I. Bivona T.G. Wen G. Araki T. Luo J. Thompson J.A. Schraven B.L. Philips M.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). BAECs were treated with VEGF for 0, 5, 10, and 30 min, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with VE-cadherin antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, the association of SHP2 and VE-cadherin was increased by VEGF stimulation in a time-dependent manner. We also analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2. We found that VE-cadherin-associated SHP2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to VEGF, which was detected by immmunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) after VE-cadherin immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that SHP2 associates with VE-cadherin in endothelial cells in response to VEGF. To determine the role of SHP2 in VEGF-evoked Src activation in endothelial cells, HUVECs were transfected with control siRNA or human SHP2 siRNA and then stimulated with VEGF for 10 min. SHP2 siRNA specifically knocked down expression of SHP2 in endothelial cells, but not β-actin, compared with control siRNA-transfected HUVECs (Fig. 4B). VEGF-evoked c-Src Tyr-416 phosphorylation was decreased markedly in SHP2 knockdown cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, our data indicate that in VEGF signaling, SHP2 promotes c-Src activation. Consistent with the critical role of c-Src in VEGF signal transduction, silencing SHP2 by siRNA also inhibited Akt and eNOS activation. In contrast, VEGF-induced ERK1/2 activation was enhanced (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that VE-cadherin, SHP2, and c-Src may lie on similar pathways in VEGF signaling. Next, we sought to determine whether the catalytic activity of SHP2 is required for VEGF-induced c-Src activation by infecting endothelial cells with either adenoviruses encoding β-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ, as a control) or adenoviruses expressing a PTP catalytic domain deletion mutant of SHP2 (Ad-SHP2ΔPTP) (28Kontaridis M.I. Liu X. Zhang L. Bennett A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3875-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The dominant negative effect of this mutant has been demonstrated previously (28Kontaridis M.I. Liu X. Zhang L. Bennett A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3875-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SHP2ΔPTP was overexpressed in cells, as confirmed by immunoblotting for the expression of the truncated SHP2 mutant (Fig. 5A). We observed that VEGF appropriately stimulated Src Tyr-416 phosphorylation in Ad-LacZ-infected BAECs (Fig. 5A). In contrast, Src Tyr-416 phosphorylation by VEGF is dramatically inhibited in cells infected with Ad-SHP2ΔPTP (Fig. 5, A and B). Concomitantly, VEGF-induced activation of Akt and eNOS wer"
https://openalex.org/W2091742867,"GPR39 is a constitutively active orphan G-protein-coupled receptor capable of increasing serum response element-mediated transcription. We found GPR39 to be up-regulated in a hippocampal cell line resistant against diverse stimulators of cell death and show that its overexpression protects against oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, as well as against direct activation of the caspase cascade by Bax overexpression. In contrast, silencing GPR39 rendered cells more susceptible to cell death. An array analysis of transcripts induced by GPR39 revealed up-regulation of RGS16 (inhibitor of G-protein signaling 16), which suggested coupling to Gα13 and induction of serum response element-mediated transcription by the small GTPase RhoA. In line with this, co-expression of GPR39 with RGS16, dominant-negative RhoA, or serum response factor abolished cell protection, whereas overexpression of the serum response factor protected from cell death. Further downstream the signaling cascade, GPR39 overexpression leads to increased secretion of the cytoprotective pigment epithelium-derived growth factor (PEDF). Medium conditioned by cells overexpressing GPR39 contained 4-fold more PEDF, and when stripped off it lost most but not all of its protective properties. We conclude that GPR39 is a novel inhibitor of cell death, which might represent a therapeutic target with implications for processes involving apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress like cancer, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and neurodegenerative disease.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E133-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); they are activated by a wide variety of natural ligands, and pharmacological alteration of their signaling constitutes one of the most successful approaches to the treatment of human disease, which makes GPCRs the most targeted protein superfamily in pharmaceutical research (2Drews I.I. Drug. Discov. Today. 2000; 5: 2-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We recently presented a screening system able to discriminate protective and detrimental receptors involved in oxidative stress (3Sahin M. Joost P. Saxena A. Lewerenz J. Methner A. Free Radic. Res. 2006; 40: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) to identify targets for the multitude of human diseases caused or aggravated by oxidative stress. In this proof-of-concept study, we noticed that the relative mRNA content of cytoprotective GPCRs (the most prominent being VPAC2, a receptor for the neuroprotective vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP) was increased in glutamate-resistant (HT22R) cells generated by repeated exposure of the parental cell line HT22 to high concentrations of glutamate and further propagation of the few surviving cells. HT22 cells are derived from embryonal mouse hippocampal cells and are considered to be a model system of cell death by oxidative stress. In this model system, increased extracellular glutamate blocks the gradient-driven glutamate/cysteine antiporter Xc-, depleting the cells of cysteine. Cysteine is required for the synthesis of the important antioxidant glutathione, and the sequence of events after depletion of intracellular glutathione involves the activation of 12-lipoxygenase, the accumulation of intracellular peroxides, activation of a cyclic GMP-dependent calcium channel, and eventually a caspase-independent cell death with features of necrosis and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 4Tan S. Schubert D. Maher P. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Cell death mediated by the proapoptotic protein Bax, in contrast, leads to cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and formation of a complex between Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, leading to caspase-9 activation. Caspase 9 in turn then activates the executioner caspases 3 and 7, which results in classical apoptosis. A third pathway leading to cell death is death by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, where the accumulation of excess unfolded proteins in the ER activates, although not exclusively, the ER stress-specific caspase 12, which then activates caspase-9 independently of cytochrome c (reviewed in Ref. 5Xu, C., Bailly-Maitre, B., and Reed, J. C. (2995) J. Clin. Investig. 115, 2656-2664Google Scholar).In this contribution, we investigated the expression of 82 orphan GPCR in HT22R and wild type cells, which identified GPR39 as a candidate regulator of cell death. GPR39 indeed protected against glutamate toxicity, ER stress, and Bax-mediated cell death by coupling to Gα13 leading to activation of the RhoA pathway and secretion of the cytoprotective pigment epithelium-derived growth factor (PEDF) and other factors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Proteins, siRNA, and Plasmids—HT22 and HT22R cells were cultured and generated as described (6Lewerenz J. Klein M. Methner A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 916-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (a kind gift from Christoph Borner, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany) and human HEK-293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Full-length GPR39 and GPR15 cDNA were cloned by high fidelity PCR from HT22 cDNA into pcDNA5.1 and pQCXIP (Invitrogen). RGS16 and dominant-negative RhoA T19N in pcDNA3.1 were obtained from the Missouri University of Science and Technology cDNA Resource Center. Human SRF fused to VP16, the nonfunctional ΔM mutant, and the dominant-negative SRF in pCS2+ were kind gifts from Ulrike Philippar (Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany). Bax-EGFP in pcDNA3 was a gift from Pawel Kermer (University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany). Pools containing four siRNA duplexes against GPR39 were obtained from Dharmacon (MQ-065633-00-0005). MicroRNA was designed against a specific sequence in the first exon of GPR39 (5′-AAACTGCTGATTGGCTTTGTA-3′) and cloned into pcDNA™6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR (Invitrogen).GPCR Quantification—cDNA from HT22R and wild type HT22 cells was generated as described (3Sahin M. Joost P. Saxena A. Lewerenz J. Methner A. Free Radic. Res. 2006; 40: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the amount of 82 orphan GPCR was quantitated on a 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using the SYBR green I core kit (Eurogentech). Primer sequences used in the screen can be obtained from the authors. For GPR39 the up-regulation was reproduced using exon spanning primers (upper, 5′-AGGACAGACCATCATATTCCTGAGACT-3′; lower, 5′-GATCCGTCGGATCTGATTGG-3′) and a 5′-5-carboxyfluorescein- and 3′-Tamra-labeled probe (5′-ATTGTGGTGACGTTGGCCGTGTGTT-3′) with a qPCR Mastermix (Roche Applied Science). Membrane-bound GPR39 was quantified by flow cytometry. In brief, 104 HT22 and HT22R cells were seeded in six-well plates and grown for 24 h, permeabilized, and incubated with rabbit polyclonal α-GPR39 (SP4221P, Acris) and stained with an ALEXA-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Serotec). HEK293T clones were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mouse monoclonal antibody HA.11 clone 16B12 (Covance). Subsequently, the cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline + 2% fetal calf serum containing 1 μg/ml 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; Calbiochem-Novabiochem), and mean fluorescence at 488 nm was analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and quantified using Cell Star™ software (Becton Dickinson). Dead cells were identified by 7-AAD staining and excluded from the analysis.Transfections—High purity plasmids were prepared using Nucleobond AX 500 columns (Machery and Nagel). For transient transfections, the cells were grown to 80-90% confluence and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen); HT22 cells were nucleofected using the Amaxa system. For this purpose, 106 HT22 cells in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution L (Amaxa) were mixed with 2 μg of the indicated expression construct in a cuvette and nucleofected using program A-020. Following nucleofection, the cells were incubated at a concentration of 106 cells/ml in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1U/ml penicillin, 1 μg/ml streptomycin. For siRNA transfections, HT22 cells were grown to 80% confluence in a 24-well plate and transfected with a final concentration of 100 nm siRNA with DharmaFECT 2 (Dharmacon). For stable transfections, pQCXIP-GPR39 was transfected in HEK-293T cells and selected with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin for 3 weeks. Single colonies were isolated using cloning cylinders (Sigma) and transferred into 96-well plates, where they were further propagated.Cell Death and Viability Assays—For toxicity experiments, 5000 HT22 or 8000 HEK-293T cells were seeded in 100 μl of medium into 96-well plates in the presence of the indicated amounts of PEDF (BioProducts MD) or ROCK1 inhibitor Y-27632 (Sigma). Transfections were carried out 24 h before seeding. Tunicamycin, glutamate, or vehicle was added 24 h after seeding in 50 μl of a 1:1 dilution in complete medium to 50 μl of medium. Cell viability was measured 24 h later by the amount of blue formazan produced by viable cells from the tetrazolium salt 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma), which is proportional to the number of viable cells as previously described (3Sahin M. Joost P. Saxena A. Lewerenz J. Methner A. Free Radic. Res. 2006; 40: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Lewerenz J. Klein M. Methner A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 916-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).For cell death analysis by flow cytometry, the cells were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with 0.4 μg of Bax-EGFP and the indicated constructs. 24 h later, the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of annexin V binding buffer (BD-Pharmingen) and stained with 5 μl of annexin V-PE (BD-Pharmingen) and 5 μl of 7-AAD. Single EGFP-positive cells were gated at 488 nm and analyzed for annexin V and 7-AAD staining. The data were acquired on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and quantified using Cell Star™ software (Becton Dickinson).To remove PEDF from GPR39-conditioned medium, 3000 wild type HT22 cells/well were seeded into a 96-well plate, and the medium was replaced 24 h later by serum-free medium conditioned by HT22 wt cells or cells overexpressing GPR39 containing 2 μg/ml α-PEDF (rabbit polyclonal antiserum; Bio-Products MD) or control antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-chicken antiserum; Davids Biotechnology). Tunicamycin in the indicated amounts was added 24 h later, and cell death was measured as described above.Microarray Analysis—Total RNA from HEK-293T cell clones 1 and 17 was quantified by a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies), and quality was assessed by a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Synthesis of double-stranded cDNA and in vitro transcription were carried out according to Affymetrix protocols. In brief, 3 μg of total RNA from cultured cells were reverse transcribed with SuperScriptII and T7-oligo(dT) promotor primer for 1 h at 42 °C, followed by 2 h of incubation at 16 °C for second strand cDNA synthesis. After sample clean-up, the cDNA served as a template for subsequent in vitro transcription carried out in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase and a biotinylated nucleotide analog/ribonucleotide mix for complementary (cRNA) amplification and biotin labeling for 16 h at 37 °C. The quality of cRNA was assessed in a 2100 Bioanalyzer. Biotinylated cRNA was cleaned up, and 15 μg were fragmented by metal/heat-induced fragmentation. The fragmented cRNA was hybridized against GeneChip Human genome U133 Plus 2.0 in an Affymetrix GeneChip hybridization oven for 16 h at 45 °C and 60 rpm. Each microarray was washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin using Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 and scanned with Affymetrix Scanner 3000. Raw data were analyzed with Affymetrix MAS5 algorithm, and probe sets with a detection p value of p < 0.01 were used for further analysis.PEDF Quantification—PEDF mRNA was quantitated in HEK293 cells by real time PCR 48 h after transfection using the SYBRgreen core kit (Eurogentech) and QuantiTect primer assays (QT00100730, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol using a 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as endogenous control, and the results are given as cycles over endogenous control. PEDF concentrations were determined by using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for PEDF (microwells coated with specific polyclonal antibody for full-length recombinant human PEDF antigen and detection with high titer polyclonal anti-PEDF antibody conjugated to biotin (BioProducts MD). Briefly, the assays were performed incubating the samples (100 μl each, diluted 1:50) for 1 h at 37 °C into duplicate wells. The samples were aspirated, and the wells were washed. Afterward 100 μl of reconstituted PEDF detector antibody was added to each well and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. After washing five times, 100 μl of streptavidin peroxidase working solution was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After another five washing cycles, 100 μl of tetramethylbenzidine substrate was added to each well and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After this time 100 μl of stop solution was added, and optical density read at 450 nm. The concentration of PEDF in each specimen was calculated by interpolation from the standard curve and given as ng/ml.Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemistry, HEK 293T cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected in 6-well plates as described above and seeded into four-well chamber slides (Labtek) 24 h later. Again 24 h later, the cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, preincubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 for 30 min. Rhodamine-phalloidin was incubated for 1 h and 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole for 15 min at room temperature. The images were captured with an Olympus IX-81 inverse fluorescence microscope and deconvoluted by CellR^ software (Olympus).SRE Reporter Assay—HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected in a 48-well plate with the serum response element luciferase reporter plasmid (pSRE-Luc, Stratagene) and the indicated expression constructs. 48 h after transfection cells were washed and lysed in 200 μl cell lysis buffer (Promega), lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min, and 20 μl of supernatant were transferred to a white 96-well microtiter plate. 100 μl of luciferase assay buffer (Promega) were injected to each well directly before measurement. Luminescence was measured by a Genios Pro microplate reader (Tecan) and integrated for 10,000 ms.Statistical Analysis—The data were summarized as the means ± S.D., and the statistical significance was assessed using two-tailed t tests or analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison test as indicated.RESULTSHT22R Cells Are Resistant against Cell Death Caused by Diverse Cytotoxic Pathways—HT22R cells have been described before; they are resistant against oxidative stress elicited by glutamate and hydrogen peroxide by up-regulation of the glutamate/cysteine exchanger xCT (6Lewerenz J. Klein M. Methner A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 916-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and the cytoprotective G-protein-coupled receptor VPAC2 (3Sahin M. Joost P. Saxena A. Lewerenz J. Methner A. Free Radic. Res. 2006; 40: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We now extended the description of their protective phenotype to cell death elicited by ER stress and overexpression of Bax. Treating HT22 wild type cells with tunicamycin, a compound that inhibits protein glycosylation in the ER thus generating an unfolded protein response, led to a prominent induction of cell death even more pronounced than the cell death caused by glutamate toxicity. HT22R cells, in contrast, were protected (∼18.7% difference at 5 μg/ml; Fig. 1A). Transfection of a Bax-EGFP fusion construct and quantification of early and late apoptotic cells by measuring phosphatidylserine translocation with annexin V and 7-AAD staining of dead cells in EGFP-positive transfected cells also demonstrated the protective phenotype of HT22R cells (∼15.8% difference after 24 h; Fig. 1B). In summary, we conclude that HT22R cells are not only protected against oxidative glutamate toxicity but also against cell death caused by ER stress and Bax overexpression.HT22R Cells Differ in the Expression of Orphan GPCRs—To identify novel drug targets implicated in protection against oxidative stress and cell death in general, we investigated the expression of 82 orphan GPCRs in wild type and HT22R cells by quantitative PCR. VPAC2 served as positive control. Half of all investigated transcripts did not yield reliable amplification curves, probably because of lack of expression. Another 36 transcripts were up-regulated less than 4-fold, and only five, including the positive control, were up-regulated more than 4-fold in HT22R cells (Fig. 1C). The expression of GPR37 and GPR101 differed significantly in the three different mRNA preparations used in the analysis and were not analyzed further. GPR15 and GPR39, however, were reproducibly regulated more then 4-fold, with GPR39 being more abundant. Both receptors were initially identified for their homology to known receptors (7McKee K.K. Tan C.P. Palyha O.C. Liu J. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. der Ploeg Van L.H. Genomics. 1997; 46: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 8Heiber M. Marchese A. Nguyen T. Heng H.H. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Genomics. 1996; 32: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with GPR39 being closely related to the neurotensin receptors and GPR15 to the angiotensin and bradykinin receptors (9Joost P. Methner A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0063)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of membrane localization of GPR39 using flow cytometry and a specific antibody directed against the third extracellular loop revealed an ∼2-fold increase corroborating the observed regulation at the mRNA level (Fig. 1D). Western blotting resulted in no visible bands, probably because of the still low expression level and the inherent difficulties of detecting GPCRs in Western blots.GPR39, but Not GPR15, Protects against Diverse Stimuli of Cell Death—Both candidate receptors GPR15 and GPR39 were cloned from HT22R cDNA and overexpressed in wild type HT22 cells. GPR39, but not GPR15, protected against glutamate toxicity (∼12% increase in viability at 40 mm glutamate), against direct oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide (∼19.5% at 1.25 mm H2O2), and tunicamycin (∼19.6% at 5 mg/ml) (Fig. 2A). GPR39 also protected against direct activation of the caspase cascade by overexpression of Bax (∼31.4%) speaking in favor of a more general protective mechanism (Fig. 2B). In these experiments, only EGFP-positive transfected cells were counted, whereas in the experiments investigating cell death caused by treatment with glutamate, H2O2, or tunicamycin viability was quantitated by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays in a mixed population with an app. transfection efficiency of 50%, thus explaining the apparently more prominent protection against Bax-induced cell death. The reverse experiment, transfecting HT22R cells with a pool of four different siRNAs in contrast increased susceptibility to glutamate toxicity (∼19.8% decrease in viability at 40 mm glutamate; Fig. 2C). Knockdown efficiency was measured by quantitative PCR and constituted 1.79 ΔCT values over GAPDH (ΔΔCT), corresponding to a ∼3.5-fold reduction in GPR39 mRNA abundance. To exclude the possibility that the effect of the pooled siRNA corresponded to off target effects, we repeated this experiment with vector-expressed microRNA, which yielded very similar results. Overexpression of GPR39 microRNA driven by RNA polymerase II promoter increased cell death of HT22R cells caused by 40 mm glutamate by ∼16.5% (Fig. 2C). In this approach, GPR39 mRNA was reduced ∼3-fold. The differences in glutamate susceptibility between the siRNA and the vector-driven microRNA experiments are most likely caused by the different transfection agents used. These data strongly suggest that GPR39 has a protective phenotype, because overexpression and silencing (using two different approaches) resulted in opposite effects on cell viability. The protective phenotype was not due to mutations in the GPR39 coding region because the cDNA cloned from HT22R cells corresponded to the sequence deposited with NCBI.FIGURE 2GPR39 overexpression protects from diverse stimuli of cell death and knockdown is detrimental. A, viability of S cells transfected with empty vector (open square), GPR39 (closed square), or GPR15 (closed circle) exposed to the indicated amounts of glutamate, Tn, or H2O2.

We determined the surface expression of 36 monoclonal colonies by flow cytometry using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal hemagglutinin antibody and chose six clones exhibiting low, middle, and top surface expression for glutamate toxicity studies, which yielded a positive correlation between GPR39 surface expression and resistance against glutamate toxicity (Pearson r2 = 0.66, p < 0.05). In subsequent studies using again hydrogen peroxide and tunicamycin, the highest expressing clone 17 always exhibited a more pronounced protection against cell death when compared with the lowest expressing clone 1 (∼6.7% at 1 mm H2O2, respectively, ∼4.95% at 5 mg/ml tunicamycin (Tn); see Fig. 3A). We compared the transcriptome of clones 1 and 17 using Affymetrix chip human genome U133 Plus 2.0 containing 47000 different human probe sets to identify the downstream targets of GPR39 that mediate the protective effect. We chose this approach over comparison with wild type or vector-transfected cells because clones 1 and 17 only differ 2.9-fold in the amount of GPR39 mRNA and of course by the site of genomic integration. We figured that comparing these very similar clones would result in more meaningful data then simply comparing GPR39-overexpressing vector-expressing cells. Transcripts relatively increased in clone 17 but also expressed in clone 1 are shown in Fig. 3B in descending order. The corresponding proteins are enzymes like enolase (ENO2), tissue plasminogen activator (PLAT) or the putative serine protease PRSS23, proteins of the extracellular matrix like the integrin-binding protein (EDIL3) or collagen II alpha 1 (COL2A1), the major histocompatibility complex-binding nuclear protein MAGEB2, and zinc finger protein TRIM38. Furthermore, proteins involved in transcription and signal transduction like PEDF, the putative high mobility group transcription factor TNRC9, and the transcriptional activator Cited1 were identified (Fig. 3B). To verify the array results, we confirmed the up-regulation of PEDF by quantitative PCR, which yielded similar results (Fig. 3C). Of utmost interest was, however, the increased expression of the regulator of G-protein signaling RGS16, because some RGS proteins attenuate signals that induce their expression in a feedback desensitization loop, as shown for RGS16 in lysophatidic acid signaling (10Johnson E.N. Seasholtz T.M. Waheed A.A. Kreutz B. Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Jones T.L. Brown J.H. Druey K.M. Nat.

Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The fold change of RGS16 almost matched the fold change of GPR39, which is what is expected.FIGURE 3Changes in gene expression caused by GPR39 overexpression.

RGS16 directly binds to Gα13 and translocates the complex to detergent-resistant membranes (10Johnson E.N. Seasholtz T.M. Waheed A.A. Kreutz B. Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Jones T.L. Brown J.H. Druey K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2105707275,"Cyclin D1 is an important cell cycle regulator, but in cancer its overexpression also increases cellular migration mediated by p27KIP1 stabilization and RhoA inhibition. Recently, a common polymorphism at the exon 4-intron 4 boundary of the human cyclin D1 gene within a splice donor region was associated with an altered risk of developing cancer. Altered RNA splicing caused by this polymorphism gives rise to a variant cyclin D1 isoform termed cyclin D1b, which has the same N terminus as the canonical cyclin D1a isoform but a distinct C terminus. In this study we show that these different isoforms have unique properties with regard to the cellular migration function of cyclin D1. Although they displayed little difference in transcriptional co-repression assays on idealized reporter genes, microarray cDNA expression analysis revealed differential regulation of genes, including those that influence cellular migration. Additionally, whereas cyclin D1a stabilized p27KIP1 and inhibited RhoA-induced ROCK kinase activity, promoting cellular migration, cyclin D1b failed to stabilize p27KIP1 or inhibit ROCK kinase activity and had no effect on migration. Our findings argue that alternate splicing is an important determinant of the function of cyclin D1 in cellular migration.

In particular, cyclin D1-deficient cells showed enhanced cellular adhesion and reduced migration into a wound, and genetic complementation experiments established a requirement for the Cdk-binding but not the pRB-binding domain of cyclin D1 to rescue the cell migratory defect (16Li Z.

Recently, a common polymorphism identified in the human cyclin D1 gene was found to be associated with an increased risk of cancer development (18Betticher D.C. Thatcher N. Altermatt H.J. Hoban P.

This polymorphism (A870G), located at the splice donor region at the exon 4-intron 4 boundary, modulates the efficiency of alternate splicing between exon 4 and 5. As a result of the altered splicing that occurs, the coding region downstream is altered such that the amino acid sequence of the C terminus of cyclin D1 is altered (18Betticher D.C. Thatcher N. Altermatt H.J. Hoban P. Ryder W.D.J. Heighway J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1005-1011PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the two isoforms of cyclin D1 produced, the canonical isoform termed cyclin D1a and the alternately spliced isoform termed cyclin D1b, are identical in their N termini but distinct in their C termini. Notably, clinical studies have associated this polymorphism with an increased risk of colon and rectal cancer, early onset squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (23Sawa H. Ohshima T.A. Ukita H. Murakami H. Chiba Y. Kamada H. Hara M. Saito I. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Elegant in vitro analyses have demonstrated that the cyclin D1a and D1b isoforms have similar half-lives in cultured cells; however, the cyclin D1b isoform is primarily nuclear in subcellular localization and relatively more resistant to phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export (24Lu F. Gladden A.B. Diehl J.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7056-7061PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin D1a blocks cells at the G1 phase, and cyclin D1b blocks cells at the G0 phase in some (23Sawa H. Ohshima T.A.

Yet despite serving as a less effective component of this pRb kinase, cyclin D1b conveys a greater transforming capacity that enhances colony formation of NIH3T3 cells. Thus, the basis for the enhanced transforming ability of cyclin D1b has been unclear. The Cdk inhibitor p27KIP1 inhibits most cyclin-Cdk complexes, including cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin D-Cdk4 (27Sherr C.J.

Mechanistic analyses presented here reveal that cyclin D1b evades binding to p27KIP1, which may explain the increased cell transforming activity of this isoform. Furthermore, cyclin D1b lacks the pro-migratory function of cyclin D1a, implicating the C-terminal region and alternate splicing as important determinants of this function. Cell Culture—Cyclin D1+/+ and cyclin D1-/- primary mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) cultures were prepared as described previously (4Wang C. Pattabiraman N. Zhou J.N. Fu M. Sakamaki T. Albanese C.

The samples were visualized on a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope with a ×63 objective. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—Cyclin D1-/- MEFs or 3T3 cells infected with GFP vector control or cyclin D1 wild type (D1a) or splice variant (D1b) were lysed in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). For each IP, 1 ml of lysate (1 mg of protein) and 10 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times in IP buffer, and 20 μl of 2× sample buffer was added to the bead pellet. The immunoprecipitates, as well as 50 μg of proteins from the corresponding lysates, were subjected to Western blotting as described previously (36Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y.

Time-lapse Video—For time-lapse observation of cell movement, cells were plated in 12-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and HEPES. Cells were placed in a temperature- and CO2-controlled incubator to maintain the temperature at 37 °C and CO2 at 5%. The cell movement videos were snapped at 5-min intervals for 2 h by using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope system. The cell movement velocity was determined by tracing several single cells at different time points using MetaMorph software. Mammalian Two-hybrid and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—Mammalian two-hybrid was performed by following the manufacturer's instruction (Promega) and was described previously (17Li Z. Jiao X. Wang C.

Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using a β-galactosidase reporter (CMV-β-gal) as an internal control. Northern Blot and Pulse-Chase Analysis—Total RNA samples were prepared from cyclin D1-/- 3T3 cells infected with cyclin D1a, D1b, or vector control with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For Northern blot, 10 μg of RNA per sample was separated on 0.9% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred, and hybridized by using Rapid-hyb Buffer (GE Healthcare). Mouse p27KIP1 probe, mouse β-actin probe, and human cyclin D1 probe were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using the Ready-to-Go kit (GE Healthcare). Mouse p27KIP1 and mouse β-actin probes were RT-PCR products. 1 μg of total RNA from cyclin D1-/- MEFs infected with cyclin D1a was used for cDNA synthesis with the Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). RT-PCR products were obtained with the following primers: p27Kip1 primers, forward 5′-CGTGAGAGTGTCTAACGGG-3′ and reverse 5′-CGAGTCAGGCATTTGGTCC-3′; β-actin primers, forward 5′-TGTTACCAACTGGGACGACA-3′ and reverse 5′-AAGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGAGC-3′. The human cyclin D1 probe was the fragment between HindIII and NcoI from MSCV-cyclin D1a-IRES-GFP retroviral vector. The filters were exposed to x-ray films at -80 °C.

Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA samples from cyclin D1-/- cells transfected with MSCV-IRES-GFP, MSCV-cyclin D1a-IRES-GFP, or MSCV-cyclin D1b-IRES-GFP were subjected to DNase I (RQ1 DNase: Promega Corp, Madison, WI) treatment to remove contaminating DNA from RNA preparations followed by their re-purification using Qiagen RNeasy RNA columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Equal amounts of purified RNA samples were reverse-transcribed using Iscript Reverse transcriptase kit (Bio-Rad) to form cDNA, which was then subjected to SYBR Green-based real time PCR relative quantification method for amplification of p27KIP1 transcripts using standard hot-start reaction mixes and conditions (39Hulit J.

The primers used for amplification of p27KIP1 were as follows: forward 5′-TCTCTTCGGCCCGGTCAAT-3′ and reverse 5′-GGGGCTTATGATTCTGAAAGTCG-3′. Amplification of 18 S rRNA housekeeping gene transcript (primer Ref. 40Katiyar S. Jiao X. Wagner E. Lisanti M.P. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell.

To calculate the fold change in p27KIP1 gene expression between various treatments, Ct values obtained from amplification of p27KIP1 transcripts in MSCV-IRES-GFP were used for calibration. Microarray Analysis—Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) using a high pressure liquid chromatography-purified T7-dT24 primer (Sigma Genosys), which contains the T7 polymerase promoter sequence. The single-stranded cDNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA using DNA polymerase I (Promega) and purified by cDNA spin column purification using GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix). The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template to generate biotinylated cRNA using Bioarray HighYield RNA transcription labeling kit (Enzo) and the labeled cRNA purified by GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix). 15 μg of cRNA was fractionated to produce fragments between 35 and 200 bp using 5× Fragmentation buffer provided in the Cleanup Module. The sample was hybridized to mouse 430 2.0 microarray (Affymetrix) representing ∼39,000 well characterized mouse transcripts. The hybridization and washing steps were carried out in accordance with Affymetrix protocols for eukaryotic arrays. The arrays were scanned at 570 nm with a confocal scanner from Affymetrix. Array Data Analysis—Analysis of the arrays was performed using R-statistics package and the limma library of the Bioconductor software package (37Wang C. Li Z. Lu Y. Du R. Katiyar S. Yang J. Fu M.

Arrays were normalized using robust multiarray analysis, and a p value of 0.05 was applied as criteria for statistically significant differentially expressed genes between cyclin D1a or cyclin D1b rescued 3T3 compared with GFP control.

For example, cyclin D1a inhibits PPARγ signaling and transactivation in vitro and in vivo (4Wang C. Pattabiraman N. Zhou J.N. Fu M. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Li Z. Wu K. Hulit J. Neumeister P.

To compare the transcriptional repression function of cyclin D1b, we evaluated its effects on PPARγ activity using a heterologous reporter system in which PPARγ was linked to the Gal4-DNA-binding domain. Consistent with prior studies, cyclin D1a inhibited PPARγ activity, whereas cyclin D1b also repressed PPARγ activity to a similar extent (Fig. 1A). Cyclin D1 also inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis, in part by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of NRF1 (37Wang C. Li Z. Lu Y. Du R. Katiyar S. Yang J. Fu M. Leader J.E. Quong A. Novikoff P.M. Pestell R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11567-11572Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Here, both cyclin D1a and cyclin D1b inhibited NRF1 activity (Fig. 1A). Consistent with recent studies (44Burd C.J. Petre C.E. Morey L.M. Wang Y. Revelo M.P. Haiman C.A. Lu S. Fenoglio-Preiser C.M. Li J. Knudsen E.S. Wong J. Knudsen K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To further compare the effects of the cyclin D1 isoforms on transcription, we performed a genome-wide analysis of how they affected gene expression in cyclin D1-/- mouse embryo fibroblast-derived 3T3 cells. The cyclin D1-/- cells were transduced with specific retroviral vectors. Previous work has shown that cyclin D1 regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular migration in early passage MEFs (16Li Z. Wang C. Jiao X. Lu Y. Fu M. Quong A.A. Dye C. Yang J. Dai M. Ju X. Zhang X. Li A. Burbelo P. Stanley E.R. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell.

Similar levels of cyclin D1 isoforms were expressed by each vector as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 2C and Fig. 3A). We found that 19 genes were regulated concordantly by both cyclin D1a and cyclin D1b (Fig. 1B). Distinct genes were regulated by cyclin D1a versus cyclin D1b. Cyclin D1a expression altered the abundance of 661 genes, of which 397 genes were induced and 264 genes repressed >1.3-fold, compared with vector control. Cyclin D1b regulated expression of 60 genes, ⅓ of which (19 genes) were regulated concordantly by cyclin D1a. Cyclin D1a regulated a distinct cluster of genes that function to promote cellular migration and invasion. These genes were not regulated by cyclin D1b (supplemental Table 1; for full details see GEO accession number GSE9161).

https://openalex.org/W1981028015,"Carboxypeptidase A6 (CPA6) is a member of the M14 metallocarboxypeptidase family that is highly expressed in the adult mouse olfactory bulb and broadly expressed in embryonic brain and other tissues. A disruption in the human CPA6 gene is linked to Duane syndrome, a defect in the abducens nerve/lateral rectus muscle connection. In this study the cellular distribution, processing, and substrate specificity of human CPA6 were investigated. The 50-kDa pro-CPA6 is routed through the constitutive secretory pathway, processed by furin or a furin-like enzyme into the 37-kDa active form, and secreted into the extracellular matrix. CPA6 cleaves the C-terminal residue from a range of substrates, including small synthetic substrates, larger peptides, and proteins. CPA6 has a preference for large hydrophobic C-terminal amino acids as well as histidine. Peptides with a penultimate glycine or proline are very poorly cleaved. Several neuropeptides were found to be processed by CPA6, including Met- and Leu-enkephalin, angiotensin I, and neurotensin. Whereas CPA6 converts enkephalin and neurotensin into forms known to be inactive toward their receptors, CPA6 converts inactive angiotensin I into the biologically active angiotensin II. Taken together, these data suggest a role for CPA6 in the regulation of neuropeptides in the extracellular environment within the olfactory bulb and other parts of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2069202451,"The molecular mechanisms by which the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun exerts its biological functions are not clearly understood. In addition to its well established role in transcriptional regulation of gene expression, several reports have suggested that c-Jun may also regulate cell behavior by non-transcriptional mechanisms. Here, we report that small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of c-Jun from mammalian cells results in inhibition of 28 S and 18 S rRNA accumulation. Moreover, we show that c-Jun depletion results in partial translocation of RNA helicase DDX21, implicated in rRNA processing, from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. We demonstrate that DDX21 translocation is rescued by exogenous c-Jun expression and that c-Jun depletion inhibits rRNA binding of DDX21. Furthermore, the direct interaction between c-Jun and DDX21 regulates nucleolar localization of DDX21. These results demonstrate that in addition to its transcriptional effects, c-Jun regulates rRNA processing and nucleolar compartmentalization of the rRNA processing protein DDX21. Thus, our results demonstrate a nucleolar mechanism through which c-Jun can regulate cell behavior. Moreover, these results suggest that the phenotypes observed previously in c-Jun-depleted mouse models and cell lines could be partly due to the effects of c-Jun on rRNA processing.

However, recent studies have indicated that some of the cellular functions of c-Jun could be mediated through non-conventional mechanisms distinct from its function in transcriptional regulation of AP-1-mediated gene expression.

Taken together, these results suggest that in addition to its well established effects on gene transcription, c-Jun might have as of yet unidentified nucleolar functions.In this study we demonstrate that in addition to its function as a prototypical transcription factor, c-Jun regulates nucleolar compartmentalization and rRNA binding of DDX21. We show that c-Jun depletion results in partial nucleoplasmic translocation of DDX21, decreased binding of DDX21 to rRNA, and inhibition of 28 S and 18 S rRNA accumulation. Moreover we show that depletion of DDX21 inhibits G1/S cell cycle progression, suggesting that the G1/S cell cycle effects of c-Jun depletion may be partly due to interference with DDX21 function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfections—HeLa and HT-1080 cells were obtained from ATCC.

All cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 international units/ml and 100 mg/ml, respectively). For transient transfections, subconfluent HT-1080 and HeLa cells were transfected with EGFP-DDX21, PS-CFP2-DDX21, EGFP-B23, and HA-c-Jun expression constructs using FuGENE-assisted transfection (Roche Applied Science). 24 h after transfection, cells were processed for either immunofluorescence or Western blotting. Transfection of HT-1080 and HeLa cells with siRNA duplex oligonucleotides was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). The following sense siRNA sequences were used for targeting human c-Jun: DDX21, 5′-GAUCCUGAAACAGAGCAUGTT-3 and 5′-AACGCAGCAGUUGCAAACATT-3; and si-934, 5′-AAGAGCAGCUGGGCGAGGAGATT-3 and 5′-GUGUGGCAUACAAGAAAGATT-3′ (13Henning D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52307-52314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). c-Jun and DDX21 were depleted by pooling the respective siRNA oligos to a final concentration of 200 μm. In all experiments, a scrambled duplex (5′-GUAACAAUGAGAGCACGGCTT-3) was used as a control. Cells were processed 48 or 72 h after transfection. Information about cloning of mammalian expression constructs used in this study is available upon request.Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Photoswitch Experiments—Immunostaining of cells grown on coverslips was performed by simultaneous fixation and permeabilization in 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 4% formaldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. All fixed cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline, 3% fetal calf serum). Primary antibodies used were rabbit monoclonal c-Jun (Signal Transduction), human polyclonal DDX21 (14Valdez B.C. Henning D. Busch R.K. Woods K. Flores-Rozas H. Hurwitz J. Perlaky L. Busch H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and mouse monoclonal B23 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary antibodies were detected with Cy2- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). All antibody incubations were carried out for 90 min at room temperature. Wide-field fluorescence microscope images were collected using a Leica DMRE microscope equipped with a high resolution Hamamatsu Photonics ORCA C4742-95 CCD camera. Fluorescence intensities were determined using MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging). Relative nucleoplasm/nucleolus distribution of endogenous DDX21 protein was quantified from a representative area of the nucleolus or nucleoplasm of 30-50 cells/group.For colocalization studies, confocal microscope images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope configured on an inverted Axiovert 200M stand (Zeiss) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil DIC objective. Cy2 fluorescence was excited at 488 nm with an argon ion laser, and emission was recorded through a 500-530-nm infrared band-pass filter. Cy3 fluorescence was excited at 543 nm with a helium-neon laser, and the emitted light was recorded through a 560-nm long-pass filter. Single z-sections were collected (0.8 μm thick) using Zeiss LSM 510 version 3.2 software.For photoswitch and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies, cells were transfected with PS-CFP2-DDX21, EGFP-DDX21 (15Valdez B.C. Perlaky L. Cai Z.J. Henning D. Busch H. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), or EGFP-DDX21 mut and grown on glass-bottom dishes (MatTek). The size and location of the photobleach and photoswitching area were adjusted with the Zeiss LSM 510 version 3.2 software. Fluorescence intensities were measured using photomultiplier tubes connected to the microscope and analyzed using the Zeiss LSM 510 version 3.2 software through EGFP (excitation, 405 nm; emission, 480 nm) and FITC channels (excitation, 490 nm; emission, 528 nm). Digital images were superimposed and assembled using Adobe Photoshop software.Sequence Alignment and Structural Modeling of the C-terminal End of Human DDX21—Based on a BLAST-PHI search, the C-terminal end of human DDX21 protein (amino acids 563-783) was aligned against seven related proteins in vertebrates that shared the conserved RNA binding C termini. The sequence alignment was performed using MALIGN and MALFORM within the Bodil visualization and modeling package. Secondary structure prediction was performed by aligning the C-terminal part of human DDX21 against three proteins that share sequence similarity with it (Protein Data Bank codes 2NRT, 1B2R, and 1UB1). Ten different structural models were generated based on these results using the program Modeler. The model with the lowest value for objective function, given by Modeler, was chosen. Sequence alignments were generated using the program ALSCRIPT, and the figure was created with the PYMOL Molecular Graphics System (DeLano Scientific).Peptide Synthesis and Microinjection Experiments—Peptides were synthesized with t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry on an Applied Biosytems 433A stepwise synthesizer. Peptide 1 corresponds to DDX21 amino acids 744-758 (FRGQREGSRGPRGQR) and peptide 2 to amino acids 729-743 (EGSRGFRGQRDGNRR). For the microinjection experiment, 30-50 HeLa cells were microinjected with peptide 1 or peptide 2 together with FITC-labeled dextran (Molecular Probes). 3 h after injection, cells were fixed and stained for DDX21 and viewed using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. To quantify the amount of DDX21 in the nucleoplasm versus the nucleolus, several z-sections were collected (0.8 μm thick) and analyzed using the Zeiss LSM 510 version 3.2 software.DDX21-rRNA Immunoprecipitation Analysis and Northern Blotting—To study the ability of DDX21 to bind rRNA, GFP-DDX21 was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells treated with scrambled or c-Jun siRNA, and the rRNA subunits that coimmunoprecipitated with DDX21 were subsequently identified by Northern blot analysis using rRNA subunit-specific probes (16Lapik Y.R. Fernandes C.J. Lau L.F. Pestov D.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The total RNA was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen). RNA was separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted on Hybond-N membranes (GE Healthcare). The following 32P end-labeled DNA oligonucleotides were used to visualize rRNA precursors: 45/47 S, 5′-CCTCCGCGCCGGAACGCGCTAGGTACCTGGACGGCGGGGGGGCGGACG-3′; 32 S, 5′-GCGGCGGCAAGAGGAGGGCGGACGCCGCCGGGTCTGCGCTTAGGGGGA-3′; 18 S rRNA, 5′-CACCCGTGGTCACCATGGTAGGCACGGCGACTACCATCGAAAGTTGATAG-3′; and 28 S, 5′-CCAGCTATCCTGAGGGAAACTTCGGAGGGAACCAGCTACTAGATGGTTCG-3′. RNA was separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted on Hybond-N membranes. The autoradiogram was exposed and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Fuji).RESULTSc-Jun Depletion Inhibits rRNA Processing—We recently reported increased expression of 28 S and 18 S rRNA in cells transformed with the viral oncogenic v-Jun protein (17Black E.J. Clair T. Delrow J. Neiman P. Gillespie D.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2357-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As the nucleolus is the site where rRNA processing occurs, identification of several nucleolar proteins associated with c-Jun (5Mialon A. Sankinen M. Soderstrom H. Junttila T.T. Holmstrom T.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) prompted us to test the hypothesis that c-Jun might be involved in the regulation of rRNA processing. To this end, the steady-state abundance of 45 S, 32 S, 28 S, and 18 S rRNAs in c-Jun siRNA-transfected HeLa cells was quantified by Northern blot analysis. In concert with our previous results (17Black E.J. Clair T. Delrow J. Neiman P. Gillespie D.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2357-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we found that c-Jun depletion (Fig. 1A) results in the inhibition of 28 S and 18 S accumulation, whereas no inhibition in either 45 S or 32 S rRNA levels is observed (Fig. 1B). The -fold difference in rRNA subunit expression levels, in comparison with 45 S, is shown below the radiographs (Fig. 1B). To obtain a more quantitative and dynamic view of the role of c-Jun in rRNA processing, the effect of c-Jun depletion on the accumulation of in vivo 32P-labeled rRNA subunits was measured. In this assay, the effect of c-Jun depletion on rRNA accumulation was assessed by comparing the intensity of 32P-labeled rRNA species 2 and 4 h after 32P addition to samples harvested immediately after the 32P pulse (0 h). Consistent with the results above, a clear decrease in 28 S and 18 S rRNA accumulation was observed in c-Jun-depleted cells at both the 2- and 4-h time points (Fig. 1C). The decrease in c-Jun-depleted cells was ∼3-4-fold for 28 S and 2-3-fold for 18 S for both time points (Fig. 1C). No marked effect on 45 S, 32 S, or 20 S rRNA accumulation was observed in response to c-Jun depletion (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that c-Jun depletion reduces 28 S and 18 S rRNA subunit accumulation in human cancer cells.c-Jun Regulates DDX21 Nucleolar Compartmentalization—Among the nucleolar proteins identified to associate with c-Jun (5Mialon A.

Inhibition of DDX21, whether by siRNA-mediated depletion or by antibody microinjection, results in a decrease in both 28 S and 18 S rRNA levels in human and Xenopus models (13Henning D. So R.B.

We demonstrated previously that endogenous c-Jun and DDX21 coimmunoprecipitate from human cancer cells in culture (6Westermarck J. Weiss C. Saffrich R. Kast J. Musti A.M. Wessely M. Ansorge W. Seraphin B. Wilm M. Valdez B.C. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that both exogenous and endogenous c-Jun and DDX21 colocalize at the perinucleolar rim of HeLa cells used in this study (supplemental Fig. S1). Considering the established role of DDX21 in rRNA processing (13Henning D. So R.B. Jin R. Lau L.F. Valdez B.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38847-38859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the physical association between c-Jun and DDX21, we investigated whether the rRNA processing defect observed in c-Jun-depleted cells is reflected in the expression or subcellular localization of DDX21. Western blot analysis of DDX21 protein expression in either c-Jun siRNA-transfected cells or c-Jun-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (c-Jun-/-) did not reveal any obvious differences in DDX21 expression as compared with c-Jun-expressing cells (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, when endogenous DDX21 staining in immortalized MEFs derived from c-Jun-deficient mice (c-Jun-/-) (11Johnson R. Spiegelman B. Hanahan D. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) was compared with wild-type cells (WT MEF), a clear increase in nucleoplasmic DDX21 staining was observed (Fig. 2C). Nucleoplasmic localization of DDX21 in these c-Jun-/- cells was not due to any clonal effect, as a similar phenotype was observed in c-Jun siRNA-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2D) and in an independently generated c-Jun-/- cell line (Fig. 2F) (12MacLaren A. Black E.J. Clark W. Gillespie D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9006-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Large-field images of the cells displayed in Fig. 2, C and D, are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Quantification of the ratio between nucleoplasmic and nucleolar DDX21 staining revealed that approximately twice as much DDX21 was localized to the nucleoplasm in c-Jun-depleted cells as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2, C-F). No increase in the nucleoplasmic/nucleolar ratio of B23/nucleophosmin, another nucleolar rRNA processing protein (19Itahana K. Bhat K.P. Jin A. Itahana Y. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1151-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), was observed in c-Jun siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S2B). Importantly, DDX21 nucleolar localization in c-Jun-/- cells was completely rescued by transient transfection of an HA-c-Jun expression construct (Fig. 2E, see white arrowhead for c-Jun-expressing cells). A similar rescue of DDX21 nucleolar localization was obtained in an independently generated c-Jun-/- cell clone by retroviral c-Jun expression (Fig. 2F).FIGURE 2c-Jun promotes nucleolar localization of DDX21. Western blot analysis of c-Jun, DDX21, and actin expression levels in WT MEF and c-Jun-/- cells (A) and in c-Jun siRNA-transfected cells (B) is shown. Scr., scrambled. C, wide-field images of nuclear localization of endogenous DDX21 in WT MEFs and in c-Jun-deficient MEFs (c-Jun-/-) are shown. The graph below shows the quantification of the intensity of nucleoplasm/nucleolus staining of DDX21 depicted as the mean ± S.D. of 200 cells/group. D, nuclear localization of endogenous DDX21, B23/nucleophosmin, and c-Jun proteins in HeLa cells 48 h after c-Jun siRNA transfection is shown. In contrast to DDX21, no effects on B23 localization are seen in response to c-Jun depletion. E, comparison of nucleoplasmic DDX21 staining (α-DDX21) in HA-positive and -negative cells reveals that transient overexpression of HA-Jun rescues nucleolar localization of DDX21 in Jun-/- MEFs (clone 1). An HA-Jun-transfected cell is indicated by a white arrowhead. F, retroviral (pBabe-Jun) c-Jun expression rescues nucleolar localization of DDX21 in Jun-/- MEFs (clone 2).

C-F, images represent the dominant phenotype observed in the cell population.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together, the above results demonstrate that c-Jun depletion from cells in culture, in addition to an rRNA processing defect (Fig. 1), results in nucleoplasmic translocation of the rRNA processing protein DDX21. Moreover, the results of the rescue experiments confirm that the effects seen in DDX21 localization arise due to a loss of c-Jun. Furthermore, as c-Jun depletion does not influence B23 localization, we conclude that DDX21 translocation is likely not due to general effects of c-Jun depletion on nucleolar integrity.c-Jun Depletion Inhibits DDX21 Binding to 45 S and 32 S rRNA—It has been proposed that the mobility of nuclear proteins indirectly reflects the affinity of proteins for their substrates (20Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). To study whether increased nucleoplasmic localization of DDX21 observed in c-Jun-depleted cells is reflected in the nucleoplasmic/nucleolar mobility of DDX21, both the inward and outward nucleolar movements of DDX21 in wild-type and c-Jun-/- cells were measured using a novel photoswitchable variant of cyan fluorescent protein (PS-CFP2). This CFP protein changes its emission spectra from 460 nm (CFP) to 515 nm (FITC) after photoactivation by a 405-nm laser line (21Chudakov D.M. Verkhusha V.V. Staroverov D.B. Souslova E.A. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows a representative time series of photoactivated nucleoli in WT MEF (Fig. 3A) and c-Jun-/- cells (Fig. 3B). Quantification of the DDX21 half-life (t½) for nucleolar recovery revealed a significantly shorter recovery time for PS-CFP2-DDX21 proteins in c-Jun-/- cells. The mean t½ recovery time was 100 s in c-Jun-/- cells compared with 235 s in WT cells (Fig. 3C). Similarly, the mean t½ exit rate for PS-CFP2-DDX21 from the nucleolus of c-Jun-/- cells (45 s) was significantly shorter than the 100 s seen for WT cells (Fig. 3D). These results confirm that the observed effects of c-Jun depletion on DDX21 compartmentalization (Fig. 2) can be recapitulated by a photoswitching methodology that is not susceptible to subjective criteria. Furthermore, these results strongly suggest that c-Jun depletion decreases the affinity of DDX21 for nucleolar rRNA substrates.FIGURE 3A and B, c-Jun promotes rRNA binding of DDX21. Exogenously expressed PS-CFP2-DDX21 proteins in wild-type (A) and c-Jun-/- (B) MEFs were subjected to photoactivation by a 405-nm laser line in the indicated nucleoli (white arrowheads). CFP (480 nm) shows the recovery and FITC (515 nm) shows the exit of photoswitched PS-CFP-DDX21 proteins. Insets show a magnification of the photoswitched nucleolus. C and D, quantitation of the nucleolar recovery rate (C) and the exit rate (D) of PS-CFP2-DDX21 in WT MEF and c-Jun-/- cells is shown. E, Northern blot analysis of rRNA subunits associated with EGFP-DDX21 in scrambled (Scr.) or c-Jun siRNA-transfected HeLa cells is shown. Equal amounts of total RNA extracted from EGFP-DDX21 immunoprecipitate (IP) were hybridized with probes specific for 45 S, 32 S, 28 S, and 18 S rRNAs. WCE, whole cell extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To directly study the effects of c-Jun depletion on the rRNA binding affinity of DDX21, rRNA subunits associated with DDX21 were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Northern blotting. We found that in scrambled siRNA-transfected cells, DDX21 associated with 45 S and 32 S pre-rRNA subunits, whereas no significant association of DDX21 with 28 S or 18 S rRNA was detected (Fig. 3E). In support of the role for c-Jun in the regulation of rRNA binding of DDX21, we found a clear decrease in the binding of DDX21 to both 45 S and 32 S rRNAs in c-Jun-depleted cells (Fig. 3E). As c-Jun depletion did not reduce cellular 45 S or 32 S amounts, but instead inhibited the accumulation of 28 S and 18 S (Fig. 1, B and C), these results together indicate that c-Jun depletion reduces DDX21 binding to 45 S and 32 S rRNAs and inhibits their processing to 28 S and 18 S. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that a transcription factor regulates rRNA binding of an rRNA processing protein and thereby affects rRNA processing.Interaction with c-Jun Supports Nucleolar Localization of DDX21—Even though we demonstrated previously that c-Jun binds directly to DDX21 (6Westermarck J. Weiss C. Saffrich R. Kast J. Musti A.M. Wessely M. Ansorge W. Seraphin B. Wilm M. Valdez B.C. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether this direct interaction is required for c-Jun-elicited support of nucleolar localization of DDX21. Using truncated recombinant GST-DDX21 proteins, we found that amino acids 731-740 at the C terminus of DDX21 are required for direct interaction between c-Jun and DDX21 (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, random mutations in the 734-738 region (FRGQR/YEGIQ) abolished the binding of the GST-DDX21 628-783 fragment to His-c-Jun (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the c-Jun interaction domain of DDX21, between amino acids 734 and 738 on the C-terminal tail, maps to one of four Arg-Gly repeats (repeat 2) found in the vicinity of the RNA binding domain of DDX21 (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). Moreover, sequence similarity analysis reveals that the c-Jun binding domain and the RNA binding domain are the most conserved areas of the C-terminal tail of DDX21 throughout the animal kingdom (supplemental Fig. S3A). This suggests that both of these domains are important for DDX21 function.FIGURE 4A direct interaction between DDX21 and c-Jun supports nucleolar localization of DDX21. A, characterization of the c-Jun binding domain on DDX21 by a His pulldown experiment with bacterially expressed full-length His-c-Jun and GST-DDX21 C-terminal fragments is shown. Numbering corresponds to amino acids of DDX21 present in the GST-DDX21 proteins. α-GST immunoreactivity was used to reveal direct c-Jun-DDX21 interactions. B, mutation of amino acids 734-738 on GST-DDX21 628-783 (mut) abrogates direct c-Jun binding. C, nuclear localization of WT EGFP-DDX21 and EGFP-DDX21 mut proteins in HeLa cells 24 h after transient transfection is shown. The graph shows the quantification of nucleoplasm/nucleolus EGFP-DDX21 intensity staining depicted as the mean ± S.D. of 200 cells/group.

https://openalex.org/W2157486480,"Novel heteroaromatic-substituted 4-hydroxycyclohexa-2,5-dienones (quinols) demonstrate potent in vitro antiproliferative activity and in vivo antitumor activity in tumor xenografts. The mechanism of action of these promising novel anticancer agents, however, remains to be fully elucidated. The thioredoxin (Trx) system comprising Trx, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and NADPH participates in a broad range of cellular functions involved in cell survival and proliferation. Accumulating evidence has indicated that the selenocysteine-containing mammalian TrxR is a valid molecular target for development of novel cancer therapeutics. In this study, we demonstrate that structural analogs containing a quinol pharmacophore inhibited TrxR with potencies correlated with their antiproliferative and cytotoxic efficacies. Benzenesulfonyl-6F-indole-substituted quinol (compound 6) irreversibly inhibited TrxR most strongly with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 2.7 microM after 1 h of incubation with recombinant rat TrxR. The inhibition was shown to be concentration-, time-, and NADPH-dependent and mediated through a direct quinol attack on the penultimate C-terminal selenocysteine residue. Moreover, TrxR activity in lysates of HCT 116 cells treated with apoptosis-inducing doses of quinols was significantly reduced. From the results obtained, we propose that TrxR inhibition is a critical cellular event that contributes to the proapoptotic effects of quinols."

Deficiency (whether dietary or genetic) results in primarily nervous system pathology, including cerebellar neurodegeneration and progressive ataxia (abnormal gait). However, despite the widely acknowledged antioxidant properties of vitamin E, only a few studies have directly correlated levels of reactive oxygen species with vitamin E availability in animal models. We explored the relationship between vitamin E and reactive oxygen species in two mouse models of vitamin E deficiency: dietary deficiency and a genetic model (tocopherol transfer protein, Ttp-/- mice). Both groups of mice developed nearly complete depletion of α-tocopherol (the major tocopherol in vitamin E) in most organs, but not in the brain, which was relatively resistant to loss of α-tocopherol. F4-neuroprostanes, an index of lipid peroxidation, were unexpectedly lower in brains of deficient mice compared with controls. In vivo oxidation of dihydroethidium by superoxide radical was also significantly lower in brains of deficient animals. Superoxide production by brain mitochondria isolated from vitamin E-deficient and Ttp-/- mice, measured by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, demonstrated a biphasic dependence on exogenously added α-tocopherol. At low concentrations, α-tocopherol enhanced superoxide flux from mitochondria, a response that was reversed at higher concentrations. Here we propose a mechanism, supported by molecular modeling, to explain decreased superoxide production during α-tocopherol deficiency and speculate that this could be a beneficial response under conditions of α-tocopherol deficiency.

In vivo oxidation of dihydroethidium by superoxide radical was also significantly lower in brains of deficient animals. Superoxide production by brain mitochondria isolated from vitamin E-deficient and Ttp-/- mice, measured by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, demonstrated a biphasic dependence on exogenously added α-tocopherol. At low concentrations, α-tocopherol enhanced superoxide flux from mitochondria, a response that was reversed at higher concentrations. Here we propose a mechanism, supported by molecular modeling, to explain decreased superoxide production during α-tocopherol deficiency and speculate that this could be a beneficial response under conditions of α-tocopherol deficiency. α-Tocopherol was first discovered as a micronutrient indispensable for reproduction in female rats (1Evans H.M. Bishop K.S. Science. 1922; 55: 650-651Crossref Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The view that α-tocopherol functions solely as a chain-breaking antioxidant has prevailed, reflecting a large body of accumulated experimental evidence showing that α-tocopherol can reduce lipid peroxidation in many models and the observation that α-tocopherol inhibits lipid peroxidation by scavenging peroxyl radicals faster (106 m-1 s-1) than they can react with other lipids (∼102 m-1 s-1) or proteins (2Wang X. Quinn P.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 17: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Recently, however, a broad array of “nonantioxidant” cellular functions for α-tocopherol have emerged (reviewed in Refs. 3Azzi A. Stocker A. Prog.

The mechanism by which these “nonantioxidant” actions factor into the observed biological effects of α-tocopherol is not yet known.

In the current study, we used two mouse models of vitamin E deficiency: 1) dietary deficiency (VED) in C57BL6 mice and 2) a genetic model, α-tocopherol transfer protein (TTP) knock-out mice. Although a number of studies have previously investigated the effect of dietary vitamin E deficiency, they have generally concentrated on liver, skeletal muscle, or heart (10Rafique R.

In our study, we maintained mice on deficient diets for >9 months to obtain a high degree of α-tocopherol depletion, allowing us to carry out “add-back” experiments on depleted tissues. We focused primarily on the brain rather than peripheral tissues, because α-tocopherol deficiency has such profound effects on nervous system integrity and function. The two human congenital syndromes that result in severe vitamin E deficiency, abetalipoproteinemia, caused by deletion mutations in the apolipoprotein B gene, and AVED (ataxia of vitamin E deficiency), resulting from deletion mutations in the α-tocopherol transfer protein (TTP) gene, result in severe progressive cerebellar degeneration, ataxia, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and a number of other neurological manifestations, with minimal pathology outside the nervous system (19Brigelius-Flohe R. Kelly F.J. Salonen J.T. Neuzil J. Zingg J.M. Azzi A. Am J. Clin Nutr. 2002; 76: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). This indicates that the brain may be uniquely sensitive to α-tocopherol deficiency. Both of these deficiency syndromes can be improved by high dose vitamin E therapy, confirming that α-tocopherol deficiency is key to the nervous system pathology. Here we examined the effects of α-tocopherol deficiency on levels of brain neuroprostane and isoprostanes, reported to be sensitive and specific indices of in vivo lipid peroxidation (20Kadiiska M.B.

Chemicals and Reagents—(R,R,R)-α-Tocopherol (≥99.0% purity) was obtained from Sigma. Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. l-α-Phosphatidylcholine type III/S, lipoxidase type IV, sodium deoxycholate, GSH, glutathione reductase, NADPH, Triton X-100 (peroxide-free), sodium azide, and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Dihydroethidium (DHE) was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). 5-Diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DEPMPO) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (AXXORA, LLC, San Diego, CA). The primary antibody against mouse glutathione peroxidase 4 was a generous gift of Dr. Qiato Ran (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). Mouse Vitamin E Deficiency Models: Dietary Deficiency and TTP Knock-out Mice—Male C57B6J mice at 6–8 weeks of age were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed under standard conditions. Upon arrival, mice were randomly assigned to either control or vitamin E-deficient diets ad libitum. Diets were obtained from Bio-Serv (Frenchtown, NJ). Both diets were based on their AIN-93G formulation, with the vitamin E-deficient chow prepared from vitamin E-stripped corn oil. Ttp+/- (tocopherol transfer protein) breeders were obtained from Jackson Laboratories, and a colony was established to generate Ttp-/- mice. Ttp-/- mice were genotyped as described (21Terasawa Y. Ladha Z. Leonard S.W. Morrow J.D. Newland D. Sanan D. Packer L. Traber M.G. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13830-13834Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Male knock-out mice were maintained on standard rodent chow starting at 3 weeks of age until sacrifice. Care and use of animals was approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Animal Studies Committee. HPLC Determination of α-Tocopherol Tissue Concentrations—α-Tocopherols were quantified using a hexane extraction method and HPLC. Briefly, at sacrifice, animals were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline, and tissue samples were stored at -80 °C until analysis. Tissue samples (∼75 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of Tris-radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Igepal CA-630, 1% deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm molybdic acid, Complete™ protease inhibitor, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). For tocopherol quantification, 25 μl of 10 mg/ml butylated hydroxyl toluene in ethanol, 2 ml of ethanol, and 2 ml of hexane were added to the homogenate. The mixture was vortexed for 10 min at 4 °C and then spun at 3000 rpm for 2 min to separate the phases. 1 ml of the top hexane layer was removed to a new tube and dried under N2, and the lipid film was resuspended with a 500-μl mobile phase (88% methanol, 12% water, 5 mm sodium dihydrogen phosphate). The sample was then filtered through 3 m Empore C8-high density 1-ml cartridges, with one 500-μl mobile phase wash, and injected onto an Agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatograph. Samples were maintained at 4 °C. Separations were performed on a Zorbax SB-C8 4.6 × 150-mm column maintained at 38 °C, using the above mobile phase at 1 ml/min. Tocopherols were detected by an electrochemical detector (ESA Coulochem II model 5010 analytical cell with a model 5020 guard cell, ESA Inc., Bedford, MA). The electrochemical detector settings were as follows: guard cell, -750 mV; detector 1, -250 mV; detector 2, +550 mV. Quantification was done using peak areas and commercial standards. Quantification of Neuroprostanes—F4-neuroprostanes and F2-isoprostanes were hydrolyzed and purified from the neocortex and quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as previously described (22Musiek E.S.

Confocal Imaging of Cell-specific in Vivo DHE Oxidation—To identify cell-specific superoxide formation, we employed systemic administration of the superoxide-sensitive fluorescent dye DHE (Molecular Probes) as described (24Quick K.L. Dugan L.L. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Quick K.L. Ali S.S. Arch R. Xiong C. Wozniak D. Dugan L.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2008; 29: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Control and vitamin E-deficient mice were injected intraperitoneally with DHE, and mice were then anesthetized and sacrificed 16 h after DHE injection. Mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (50 ml/animal). Brains were then removed and postfixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for ∼2 weeks. Cerebellar sections or coronal sections through the cortex at the level of the substantia nigra pars compacta (100 μm) were cut, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted. Fluorescence images were obtained using excitation λ of 488 nm and emission λ of >560 nm (590-nm long-pass filter) on a Zeiss LSM510 META confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with 488- and 543-nm laser lines using a ×63 C-Apochromat (numerical aperture 1.2) water immersion objective. At least 15 cells/slice (3 slices/animal) were analyzed by an individual blind to the experimental group, and the treatment group “code” was only revealed after all analyses were complete. Analysis of Mitochondrial Respiratory Function—Nonsynaptosomal brain mitochondria were isolated from phosphate-buffered saline-perfused whole brain using a Percoll gradient (26Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oxygraph™, Hansatech, Norfolk, UK). Purified mitochondria (∼200 μg of protein) were added to the oxymetry chamber in a 1-ml solution containing 100 mm KCl, 75 mm mannitol, 25 mm sucrose, 5 mm H3PO4, 0.05 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After 2 min of equilibration, 5 mm pyruvate and 2.5 mm malate were added, and oxygen consumption followed for 2 min. ADP (250 μm) was added to measure state 3 (phosphorylating) respiration. Oligomycin (2.5 μg/ml) was added 2 min later to inhibit the F0F1-ATPase and determine state 4 (resting) respiration. The maximal uncoupled respiratory rate was obtained by adding 0.2 μm carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazone to the chamber. Oxygen utilization traces and rate determinations were obtained using Oxygraph™ software. The respiratory control ratio (state 3 respiration/state 4 respiration) was calculated. Protein concentrations were quantified using the Pierce BCA microassay. EPR Spectrometry on Isolated Brain Mitochondria—A Bruker e-scan benchtop EPR spectrometer was used to detect superoxide and hydroxyl radical generation by mitochondria, as described (25Quick K.L. Ali S.S. Arch R. Xiong C. Wozniak D. Dugan L.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2008; 29: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27Ali S.S. Xiong C. Lucero J. Behrens M.M. Dugan L.L. Quick K.L. Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were acquired after the incubation of 1–2 mg of protein/ml of brain mitochondria isolated from different groups for 1 h at 37 °C. In each incubation, 10 mm pyruvate, 5 mm malate, and 1 mm ADP were included along with the desired concentration of (R,R,R)-α-tocopherol dissolved in absolute ethanol. In order to exclude the possibility that ethanol changed the free radical production from the isolated mitochondria, we included compensatory amounts of ethanol so that the final volumes of ethanol were always the same. In some experiments, 50 or 100 units/ml superoxide dismutase was included to confirm that the observed signal derived from superoxide. Each mixture was injected into the EPR cavity of the Bruker e-scan benchtop spectrometer via a Teflon tube with an inner diameter of ∼0.4 mm. The EPR settings were as follows: receiver gain, 1 × 103; scan width, 200 G centered at 3484.9 G; modulation amplitude, 2 or 4 G; time constant, 5.16 ms; modulation frequency, 86 kHz; microwave power, 5.04 milliwatts; sweep time, 5.24 s; spectrometer operating frequency, 9.784 GHz. Each spectrum was the average of 100 scans. To quantify free radicals, EPR intensities were normalized for protein contents. Calculations and Modeling—Molecular model constructions, geometry optimization, and energy minimization for all molecules were carried out using the MM2 force field provided by CS Chem3D Ultra® version 7.0 (CambridgeSoft, Cambridge, MA) and then verified and refined using the BioMedCAChe WorkSystem Pro version 6.02 (Fujitsu America Inc.). Energy minimization of α-tocopherol and CoQ derivatives were performed under the Project Manager environment using the following procedures. First, a thorough conformational search was carried out within Mechanics using CAChe Augmented MM2 or MM3 parameters through the conjugate gradient method until the gradient was below 0.001 kcal/mol within 3000 steps. Then the unique minimum was fully optimized with MOPAC (PM3 or occasionally PM5 force fields). The PRECISE keyword was also used in order to increase the geometric and electronic convergence criteria. In some cases, the GEO-OK keyword was used to prevent calculation routines from unexpected termination. Molecular docking studies of α-tocopherol and α-tocopheryl quinone into the yeast cytochrome cb1 (QCR) subunit using the BioMedCAChe suite of algorithms were done using the binding pocket of CoQ as a model for the binding mode. The crystal structure of the yeast QCR was selected as a model because of the availability of the x-ray structure of QCR binding with CoQH2, which enabled the definition of the binding pocket hence used to adopt α-tocopherol. The x-ray structure of the monomeric unit of QCR at 2.3 Å resolution was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank site on the World Wide Web (code 1EZV) (28Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). After correcting the crystal structure of QCR for valency and hydrogen bonding, CoQH2 was redocked into its identified pocket in the cytochrome b (COB) subunit by holding the residues of the protein fixed and allowing the ligand to be flexible. The orientation and hydrogen bonding of the redocked complex were close to that in the crystal structure, and the flexibility of the protein residue of the active site was consequently allowed. The docking score was then calculated using a genetic algorithm (1000 generations) with a fast, simplified potential of mean force (grid spacing, 0.3 Å) (29Muegge I. Martin Y.C. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The optimized structure of α-tocopherol (or α-tocopheryl quinone) was then superimposed on CoQH2 in the binding pocket, the model of CoQH2 was removed, and the model of α-tocopherol was docked into the pocket by holding the protein rigid and the ligand flexible before allowing a flexible active site and recalculation. In the final optimized complex, α-tocopherol and α-tocopheryl quinone were solely stabilized by hydrophobic interactions in the transmembrane domain of COB while retaining close positions around the heme bL group. Brain α-Tocopherol Levels in VED and Ttp-/- Mice—We observed an age-dependent increase in α-tocopherol levels in control brain, increasing from 0.01 nmol/mg protein in 1-week-old mice to 0.170 nmol/mg in 46- and 54-week-old mice (Fig. 1a). Accumulation of α-tocopherol in brain during development has been previously reported (11Rafique R. Schapira A.H. Coper J.M. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Elmadfa I. Both-Bedenbender N. Sierakowski B. Steinhagen-Thiessen E. Z. Gerontol. 1986; 19: 206-214PubMed Google Scholar); taken together, these results suggest that there is an active and age-dependent process for accumulating α-tocopherol in the brain. We then evaluated effects of dietary vitamin E depletion, produced in normal C57BL6 mice using prolonged dietary deficiency by placing mice on either a control or VED chow at 6–8 weeks of age. α-Tocopherol was significantly depleted in brains of VED mice after 38 weeks of dietary deficiency (Fig. 1b). In non-nervous system tissues after a 38-week deficiency, α-tocopherol was rapidly depleted: heart (18% of control), kidney (18% of control), lung (13% of control), and liver (6% of control). However, despite prolonged dietary deficiency, we were unable to reduce α-tocopherol levels in the brain to less than 50% of control levels (Fig. 1b). While our study was under way, two separate groups published studies on Ttp-/- mice. Both groups reported that liver α-tocopherol levels in Ttp-/- mice were 30% of Ttp+/+ controls but that Ttp-/- mice never accumulated α-tocopherol in brain, with levels <5% of controls (21Terasawa Y. Ladha Z. Leonard S.W. Morrow J.D. Newland D. Sanan D. Packer L. Traber M.G. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests that tocopherol transfer protein may be critical for brain uptake of α-tocopherol, an observation consistent with data from humans with the AVED syndrome, who also show greater depletion of α-tocopherol in the brain compared with other tissues. In our study, we confirmed that brain α-tocopherol was nearly absent in Ttp-/- mice (Ttp+/+ 0.094 ± 0.004 nmol/mg versus Ttp-/- 0.005 ± 0.002 nmol/mg, p < 0.00001) despite moderate levels remaining in liver and other tissues (data not shown). Neuroprostanes, a Specific Marker of Lipid Oxidation, Are Reduced in Vitamin E-deficient Mice—If vitamin E is acting solely as a chain-breaking antioxidant in vivo, we would predict higher levels of lipid peroxidation products during deficiency. We therefore analyzed the effect of vitamin E deficiency on F4-neuroprostane concentration in our two models of vitamin E deficiency. F4-neuroprostanes are derived from the radical-induced oxidation of docosahexanoic acid (22:6), which is abundant in the brain. Surprisingly, F4-neuroprostanes in two brain regions, cortex and cerebellum, were significantly positively correlated with α-tocopherol levels (i.e. lower α-tocopherol levels were associated with lower F4-neuroprostanes) (Fig. 2a, r = 0.83, p = 0.04). Interestingly, the cerebellum, which is the brain region most affected in human α-tocopherol deficiency syndromes, had significantly higher levels of neuroprostanes in both deficient and control mice compared with other brain regions (boxed area, p = 0.001, t test), suggesting that the cerebellum may be uniquely vulnerable to ongoing lipid peroxidation, even under α-tocopherol-replete conditions. Mirroring the age-dependent accumulation of α-tocopherol we observed in control mice, we also found a significant age-dependent increase in F4-neuroprostanes (Fig. 2b, p = 0.02). This increase leveled off between 46 and 64 weeks of age, similar to tissue α-tocopherol concentrations. Isoprostanes Are Not Elevated in Vitamin E-deficient Mice—As an additional measure of lipid peroxidation, we analyzed F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs), prostaglandin-like compounds formed from peroxidation of arachidonic acid independent of cyclooxygenase. Brain levels of F2-IsoPs in control and VED at 40 weeks of vitamin E deficiency were as follows (in pg/mg; mean ± S.D., n = 3): 1.3 ± 0.1 (control) and 1.2 ± 0.1 (VED) for cortex, 1.5 ± 0.3 (control) and 1.2 ± 0.1 (VED) for cerebellum, and 1.4 ± 0.2 (control) and 1.4 ± 0.1 (VED) for basal ganglia. There was a nonsignificant trend toward lower F2-IsoP levels in cortex and cerebellum from VED mice, but in reviewing the literature reporting F2-IsoPs in brain, we found that our values were at the lowest limits of sensitivity for this assay, thereby limiting our ability to detect a further decrease in F2-IsoP levels. In Vivo Superoxide Production Is Lower in VED Mice—Our observation that neuroprostane levels are lower with vitamin E deficiency could reflect either a compensatory enhancement of antioxidant defenses or decreased levels of cellular ROS production. Either mechanism would result in less lipid peroxidation. To assess antioxidant systems, we carried out Western immunoblot analysis on brain extracts but found no differences in protein expression for Sod1, Sod2, catalase, or GPx1 (glutathione peroxidase 1) between control and VED mice (data not shown). Unexpectedly, we also failed to observe a difference in these antioxidant proteins between Ttp+/+ and Ttp-/- mice. Because not only GPx1 but GPx4 is important for the repair of oxidized lipids, we also measured the activity of GPx4 but again failed to observe any difference in activity between groups (data not shown). Since antioxidant defenses were not overtly different between control and deficient mice, we carried out studies to look at ROS generation. Superoxide radical is a major product of many ROS-producing biological systems (e.g. mitochondria, various oxidases, P450 enzymes) (33Jezek P. Hlavata L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 2478-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) and can cause lipid peroxidation through a number of established reaction pathways. Cellular production of superoxide in vivo, evaluated by confocal fluorescence imaging of DHE oxidation in control and VED mice after 38 weeks of deficiency or in Ttp-/- mice versus wild-type controls indicated that both VED and Ttp-/- mice had significantly less superoxide production in hippocampus than their respective controls (Fig. 3) (38 weeks of VED versus control, p = 0.0004; Ttp-/- versus Ttp+/+, p = 0.004). Superoxide production in Ttp-/- mice was also significantly reduced in cortex (p = 0.046). Mitochondrial Respiratory Response to Vitamin E Deficiency—Mitochondria are generally assumed to be the major source of ROS production in cells. Because changes in mitochondrial respiratory function and coupling may modify ROS production, we evaluated respiration in isolated brain mitochondria from all groups of mice. Uncoupling results in O2 consumption that is not associated with ATP production and is often expressed as a lower respiratory control ratio (RCR) (state 3/state 4 respiration). Mitochondria were isolated by Percoll gradient from the brains of control and vitamin E-deficient mice after 38 weeks of deficiency and from Ttp+/+ control and Ttp-/- mice at 10 weeks of age. Mitochondrial respiration was measured in an oxymetry chamber equipped with a Clark-type O2 electrode and standard respiratory substrates and electron transport chain inhibitors. To verify that vitamin E deficiency did not alter mitochondrial yield or viability during the isolation procedure, we compared the wet weight of brain, total brain protein, and mitochondrial protein between control and VED groups. Brain wet weight (mean ± S.D.) was 460 ± 22 mg (control) and 455 ± 61 mg (VED). Total protein (mean ± S.D.) was 11.0 ± 1.3 mg/ml (control cortex) and 12.7 ± 1.2 mg/ml (VED cortex), 3.52 ± 0.53 mg/ml (control cerebellum), and 3.64 ± 0.53 mg/ml (VED cerebellum). Mitochondria protein was 1.3 ± 0.44 mg/ml (control) and 1.24 ± 0.22 mg/ml (VED). It is clear from these data that there was no significant difference between control and VED mitochondria yield. We then compared the activity of individual ETC complexes of cortical mitochondria from VED versus control"
https://openalex.org/W1978025958,"Inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) catalyzes in newly synthesized sulfatases the post-translational oxidation of a specific cysteine. Thereby formylglycine is generated, which is essential for sulfatase activity. Here we show that ERp44 interacts with FGE forming heterodimeric and, to a lesser extent, also heterotetrameric and octameric complexes, which are stabilized through disulfide bonding between cysteine 29 of ERp44 and cysteines 50 and 52 in the N-terminal region of FGE. ERp44 mediates FGE retrieval to the ER via its C-terminal RDEL signal. Increasing ERp44 levels by overexpression enhances and decreasing ERp44 levels by silencing reduces ER retention of FGE. Suppressing disulfide bonding by mutating the critical cysteines neither abrogates ERp44·FGE complex formation nor interferes with ERp44-mediated retention of FGE, indicating that noncovalent interactions between ERp44 and FGE are sufficient to mediate ER retention. The N-terminal region of FGE harboring Cys50 and Cys52 is dispensible for catalytic activity in vitro but required for FGE-mediated activation of sulfatases in vivo. This in vivo activity is affected neither by overexpression nor by silencing of ERp44, indicating that a further ER component interacting with the N-terminal extension of FGE is critical for sulfatase activation. Inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) catalyzes in newly synthesized sulfatases the post-translational oxidation of a specific cysteine. Thereby formylglycine is generated, which is essential for sulfatase activity.

Although it has little secondary structure, the catalytic core of FGE is a compact monomeric molecule that is stabilized by two intramolecular disulfide bridges and two Ca2+ ions. On its surface FGE harbors a binding groove for the sulfatase CXPSR substrate peptide with Cys336 and Cys341 of FGE being involved in FGly formation (17Dierks T. Dickmanns A. Preusser-Kunze A.

From this compact globular structure (residues 73–374), an N-terminal extension of 40 residues, the structure of which is unknown, obviously sticks out and is trimmed off in case of FGE secretion (22Preusser-Kunze A.

Mariappan, unpublished observations. Recently we could show that residues 34–88 (residues 1–33 are cleaved off by signal peptidase) fulfill two functions. On the one hand they confer ER retention to FGE, and on the other hand they are required for in vivo sulfatase activation through FGly generation. 7M. Mariappan, S. L. Gande, K. Radhakrishnan, B. Schmidt, T. Dierks, and K. von Figura, submitted for publication.7M. Mariappan, S. L. Gande, K. Radhakrishnan, B. Schmidt, T. Dierks, and K. von Figura, submitted for publication. Moreover, we could show that retaining FGE in the ER and ensuring the in vivo activity of FGE are two separate functional properties mediated by the N-terminal extension of FGE, as fusion with a C-terminal KDEL signal led to effective ER retention of FGE but not to biological activity.7 The latter is surprising, because in vitro the N-terminal extension is not needed for FGly modification of synthetic sulfatase peptide substrates (15Dierks T.

It was even more surprising to find that the N-terminal extension of FGE in living cells at least partially can complement in trans an N-terminally truncated, and therefore inactive, FGE.7 This complementation, however, was only observed when FGE1–88 was expressed as an N-terminal fusion with the paralog of FGE (pFGE), which itself is catalytically inactive because of the absence of the two catalytic cysteines in the substrate-binding groove (24Mariappan M. Preusser-Kunze A. Balleininger M. Eiselt N. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Wenzel D. Dierks T. Figura von K. J. Biol.

Preusser-Kunze A. Balleininger M. Eiselt N. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Wenzel D. Dierks T. Figura von K. J. Biol.

Obviously the structural similarity of pFGE to FGE enables the FGE1–88-pFGE fusion described above to present the N-terminal extension to its catalytic FGE partner and thereby to complement in vivo functionality, i.e. FGly generation in nascent sulfatase polypeptides inside the ER.7 We could further show that a Cys-Gly-Cys motif in this N-terminal extension of FGE, which is fully conserved in all known eukaryotic FGE sequences, is critical for activation of sulfatases, whereas it is dispensible for ER retention of FGE.7 This led us to postulate that the N-terminal extension of FGE mediates the interaction with ER components, which are required for the generation of FGly residues and the retention of FGE in the ER. In this study we describe the identification of an ER component interacting with the N-terminal extension of FGE, the biochemical basis of this interaction, and its direct functional relevance for FGE retention in the ER.

The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was incubated with Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 4 °C to remove proteins that interact with Affi-Gel matrix. After spinning, the supernatant was incubated with either Affi-Gel-10 matrix derivatized with the ASA scrambled peptide (PVSLPTRSCAALLTGR) or Affi-Gel-10 matrix derivatized with the ASA-Ser69 peptide (PVSLSTPSRAALLTGR) (22Preusser-Kunze A.

The beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer I and eluted with 400 μm ASA-Ser69 peptide. The eluted material was subjected to precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with or without 100 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide), visualized by silver staining, and identified as indicated. Expression Plasmids—The ERp44 cDNA was synthesized from total RNA, isolated from HeLa cells, by reverse transcription using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen) and an oligo(dT) primer. The first strand cDNA was amplified by PCR with primers ERp44-Nhe-fwd and ERp44-EcoRV-rev (see below). The PCR fragment was digested with NheI and EcoRV and cloned into MCS I of the pBI vector (BD Biosciences). Full-length sequencing verified the correctness of the cDNA insert. A c-Myc tag was inserted after the signal peptide cleavage site by sequential PCR-based reactions, in a similar way as reported for human ERp44 cloning (27Anelli T. Alessio M. Mezghrani A. Simmen T. Talamo F. Bachi A. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Briefly, ERp44-Nhe-fwd/Myc-ERp44-1R were used for first amplification reaction and Myc-ERp44-2f/ERp44-EcoRV-rev were used for the second. The resulting PCR products were used as templates in an overlapping extension PCR with primers ERp44-Nhe-fwd/ERp44-EcoRV-rev to generate a product coding for Myc-tagged ERp44. This product was digested with NheI and EcoRV for cloning into MCS I of pBI vector. The following primers were used: ERp44-Nhe-fwd, 5′-CTAGCTAGCATGCATCCTGCCGTCTTCCTATCC-3′; Myc-ERp44-1R, 5′-CAGGTCCTCCTCTGAGATCAGCTTCTGCTCCTCAGTTGTTACAGGAGTAAAAAC-3′; Myc-ERp44-2f, 5′-GAGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCAGAGGAGGACCTGGAAATAACAAGTCTTGATACAGAG-3′; and ERp44-EcoRV-rev, 5′-CCGATATCTTAAAGCTCATCTCGATCCCTCAATAG-3′. For coexpression of Myc-ERp44 with FGE or its mutants, Myc-ERp44 cDNA was cloned into the MCS I of pBI vector that already had a cDNA encoding wild-type FGE (or its mutants) in the MCS II. These pBI-FGE constructs have been described earlier (24Mariappan M. Preusser-Kunze A. Balleininger M. Eiselt N. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Wenzel D. Dierks T. Figura von K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15173-15179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).7 ERp44 mutants were created by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) using pBI-MycERp44 as template and complementary mutagenesis primers. The coding sequences of these primers were: TTTTATGCTGACTGGGCTCGTTTCAGTCAGATG (ERp44-C29A) and GTTTGCCAGAGTTGATGCTGATCAGCACTCTG (ERp44-C63A). ERp44ΔRDEL-His was generated by PCR amplification with pBI-MycERp44 as template and primers ERp44-Nhe-fwd (CTAGCTAGCATGCATCCTGCCGTCTTCCTATCC) and ERp44-6His-EcoRVrev (CGGATATCTTAATGATGGTGGTGATGGTGATGCGATCCATCCCTCAATAGAGTATACC). All of the PCRs were performed with Pfu-Ultra polymerase (Stratagene). The resulting constructs were analyzed by full-length sequencing of coding regions to preclude any PCR-derived errors. Cell Culture and Transfection—The immortalized fibroblasts from an MSD patient (kindly gifted by Prof. Andrea Ballabio, Naples, Italy) and HT1080 cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (PAN Biotech GmbH). Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). For single or coexpression experiments, the HT1080 Tet-On or MSDi Tet-On cells7 were transfected with 2 μg of pBI vector carrying one or two cDNAs driven by a bidirectional tetracycline responsive promoter. For triple expression, the MSDi Tet-On cells were transfected with a mixture of two plasmids: 2 μg of pBI vector containing steroid sulfatase alone and 2 μg of pBI vector containing two different cDNAs. 6 h after transfection, the medium was replenished with medium containing 2 μg/ml doxycycline (BD Biosciences), and after 30 h, the cells and medium were collected for further analysis. An HT1080 Tet-On cell line stably expressing c-Myc-ERp44 under control of a doxycycline-responsive promoter was established by cotransfecting HT1080 Tet-On cells (neomycin-resistant) with pBI-MycERp44 and the puromycin resistance vector pSV.pac (10:1 ratio). Transfectants were selected in normal medium with increasing concentrations of puromycin (Invitrogen) from 0.1 to 0.8 μg/ml and 800 μg/ml neomycin. The stable clones were screened for expression of Myc-ERp44 by Western blotting, upon induction of the cells with 0.1 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HT1080 Tet-On cells were grown on coverslips overnight and transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline 6 h after transfection. After 24 h of induction, the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and treated with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. The cells were permeabilized with 0.5% saponin in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies, namely rabbit anti-FGE anti-serum, either rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal antibodies against ERp44 (kind gift from Prof. Roberto Sitia, Milan, Italy) and mouse monoclonal antibodies against PDI (Stressgen Biotechnologies) or GM130 (BD Biosciences). After washing with PBS containing 0.1% saponin, the primary antibodies were decorated with appropriate secondary antibodies coupled with either Cy2 or Alexa 633 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with fluorescent mounting medium (Dakocytomation), and confocal images were acquired with Leica TCS SP2 AOBS laser scanning microscope. Coimmunoprecipitation—HT1080 Tet-On cells transfected with appropriate plasmids were induced for protein expression with 2 μg/ml doxycycline 6 h after transfection. After induction for 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with buffer I for 5 min at 37 °C, washed once again with PBS, and harvested by trypsinization. NEM was included in the lysis buffer to prevent any reshuffling of disulfide bonds during lysis. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer I, further containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and the cells were lysed by sonication (3 × 20 s on ice). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated either with rabbit preimmune serum or rabbit anti-FGE serum for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Pansorbin for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The Pansorbin pellet was washed five times with buffer I containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed finally once with buffer I without Triton. The pellet was boiled in 1× sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. 10% of the starting material prior to immunoprecipitation (load) and 10% of the pellet were resolved by SDS-PAGE either under nonreducing or reducing conditions and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blotting and probed with appropriate antibodies, as indicated in each figure. ERp44 RNAi Experiments—The siRNA duplex names and their target sequences were exactly as described earlier (26Higo T. Hattori M. Nakamura T. Natsume T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 2005; 120: 85-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), namely siControl-C (5′-AAGUAGUGUAUGCUAGAGUGG-3′), siERp44-C (5′-AAGUAGUGUUUGCCAGAGUUG-3′), siControl-3U (5′-AACAGCACCAUCGACCAACGU-3′), and siERp44-3U (5′-AACAGCAGCAUCAACCUACGU-3). The siRNA duplexes were purchased from IBA (Göttingen, Germany). Transfections of siRNA duplexes were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 as recommended by the supplier. For HT1080-Tet-on cells, the siRNA duplexes were transfected at 50–60% confluency, and after 24 h, the cells were split and seeded in such a way that they were again 50–60% confluent during the second siRNA duplex transfection, which was done ∼48 h after the first transfection. After another 8 h, the indicated cDNAs were transfected as pBI constructs (see above). Six hours later the cells were induced for protein expression with 2 μg/ml doxycycline. After 16 h of induction, the cells and medium were collected and analyzed. For immortalized MSD (MSDi) cells, the siRNA duplexes were transfected at 30–50% confluency using RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the supplier. After 30 h the indicated cDNAs were transfected as pBI constructs. 6 h after transfection, the cells were induced for protein expression with 2 μg/ml doxycycline. After 36 h of induction (72 h after siRNA treatment), the cells were harvested and analyzed. Activity Assay for Steroid Sulfatase and Western Blotting—Activity assays of steroid sulfatase were performed as described earlier (31Conary J. Nauerth A. Burns G. Hasilik A. Figura von K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, polyclonal antisera against FGE, ERp44 or steroid sulfatase, and monoclonal anti-c-Myc (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA (Covance), or anti-Hsc70 (rat monoclonal, 1B5, Abcam) antibodies were used as primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-rat antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Western blot signals were quantified using the AIDA 2.1 software package (Raytest). FGE amounts were calculated on the basis of known amounts of purified FGE present on each Western blot. Signals of steroid sulfatase are given as relative amounts, i.e. related to signal intensities detected in cells expressing steroid sulfatase only. Relative specific sulfatase activities were calculated, i.e. catalytic activity divided by the Western blot signal (arbitrary units) and referred to that of cells expressing the sulfatase only (relative specific sulfatase activity = 1). Absolute values for this reference are given in the legends. Identification of ERp44 as an in Vivo Interaction Partner of FGE—To identify interacting partners of FGE, we aimed at pulling out complexes of FGE with its partners from cells overexpressing FGE. We took advantage of an affinity column with an immobilized ASA peptide that binds with high affinity to the active site of FGE (15Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J. Preusser A. Mariappan M. Figura von K. Cell. 2003; 113: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To control for specificity, we used in parallel an affinity column carrying an immobilized peptide of identical amino acid composition but having the three key residues of the FGly modification motif of sulfatases in scrambled order (see Ref. 15Dierks T.

HT1080 cells stably overexpressing FGE were treated with NEM prior to lysis to stabilize disulfide bonds that had formed in vivo. Using the original FGE purification protocol (15Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J. Preusser A. Mariappan M. Figura von K. Cell. 2003; 113: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), we observed binding of FGE only to the sulfatase peptide column (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). In the eluate, obtained with free ASA peptide, two additional bands in the range of 70–75 kDa were detected (Fig. 1, lane 3), which contained no FGE, as evidenced by Western blotting (not shown). Tryptic digestion and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identified them as the two Hsp70 chaperone isoforms Hsp70-5 and Hsp70-9. These chaperones were also detectable in the eluate from the control affinity matrix, albeit at much lower levels (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that their binding is not FGE-dependent. Running the eluates under nonreducing conditions revealed in the eluate from the sulfatase peptide-derivatized affinity matrix a further band at ∼85 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 4). Analysis of its tryptic peptides by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry clearly identified two components, namely FGE and ERp44 that made up a stable complex. When NEM pretreatment of the cells prior to lysis was omitted (not shown) or dithiothreitol was present during SDS-PAGE, the 85-kDa band was not detectable (compare lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 1), indicating that the complex is stabilized by disulfide bridges. ERp44 has been described as a prominent retention factor for Ero1, unpolymerized immunoglobulin chains, and adiponectin and also as a redox-dependent regulator of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 1 (23Otsu M.

So far, distribution and function of K+-Cl- cotransporters (KCCs) in gastric parietal cells have not been reported. We found that KCC3a but not KCC3b mRNA was highly expressed, and KCC3a protein was predominantly expressed in the basolateral membrane of rat gastric parietal cells located in the luminal region of the glands. KCC3a and the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit (α1NaK) were coimmunoprecipitated, and both of them were highly localized in a lipid raft fraction. The ouabain-sensitive K+-dependent ATP-hydrolyzing activity (Na+,K+-ATPase activity) was significantly inhibited by a KCC inhibitor (R-(+)-[(2-n-butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2,3-dihydro-1-oxo-1H-inden-5-yl)oxy]acetic acid (DIOA)). The stable exogenous expression of KCC3a in LLC-PK1 cells resulted in association of KCC3a with endogenous α1NaK, and it recruited α1NaK in lipid rafts, accompanying increases of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and ouabain-sensitive Na+ transport activity that were suppressed by DIOA, whereas the total expression level of α1NaK in the cells was not significantly altered. On the other hand, the expression of KCC4 induced no association with α1NaK. In conclusion, KCC3a forms a functional complex with α1NaK in the basolateral membrane of luminal parietal cells, and it up-regulates α1NaK in lipid rafts, whereas KCC3a is absent in basal parietal cells.

KCCs mediate an electroneutrally coupled transport of K+ and Cl- and contribute to transepithelial transport and cell volume regulation (1Gamba G. Physiol.

KCCs are encoded by at least four homologues genes (KCC1–KCC4), and KCC3 has three isoforms (KCC3a–KCC3c) generated by the difference of first coding exons (3Mount D.B. Mercado A. Song L. Xu J.

So far, the distribution and function of KCCs have not been reported in the gastric parietal cells.Lipid rafts are glycosphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched microdomains and are thought to be the functional domains involved in membrane trafficking and signal transduction (9Simons K.

However, little is known about lipid rafts of gastric parietal cells.In the present study, we studied distribution of KCC3a and association of KCC3a with Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit (α1NaK) in the gastric mucosa. In addition, we studied recruitment of α1NaK by KCC3a in lipid rafts using the cells stably expressing exogenous KCC3a.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Anti-rat KCC3 rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptides against 19 amino acids corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of KCC3 (KKARNAYLNNSNYEEGDEY). Both KCC3a and b contain this N-terminal sequence. This antigen peptide has no homology with the sequences of KCC1, 2, and 4. Anti-Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit (α1NaK) mouse monoclonal antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.(Lake Placid, NY). Anti-H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit mouse monoclonal antibody (1H9) was from Medical & Biological Laboratories Co. (Nagoya, Japan). Anti-flotillin-2 mouse monoclonal antibody (B-6) and anti-human aquaporin-4 (AQP4) goat polyclonal antibody (H-19) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Lipofectamine 2000, anti-Xpress mouse monoclonal antibody, Alexa Fluor 488/546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, Alexa Fluor 488/546-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody were from Invitrogen. Ouabain, SCH 28080, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), and R-(+)-[(2-n-butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2,3-dihydro-1-oxo-1H-inden-5-yl)oxy]acetic acid (DIOA) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Protein A-agarose beads was from Pierce. Hygromycin B and blasticidin S were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan) and Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. 22NaCl was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Isolation of Tissues and Cells—The cell suspension rich in parietal cells and the gastric gland suspension were prepared from rabbit stomach as previously described (17Sakai H. Ohira Y. Tanaka A. Suzuki T. Ikari A. Morii M. Takeguchi N. J. Physiol. 2003; 551: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Human gastric mucosa was obtained from surgical resection of Japanese patients at Toyama University Hospital in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and with the ethics committee approval. All of the patients gave informed consent.Northern Blotting—Poly(A)+ RNA of the cells was prepared by using the PolyATtract mRNA isolation system II (Promega, Madison, WI). The amplified products were sequenced and used for the preparation of the 32P-labeled cDNA probes. The rabbit KCC3 probe was 712 bp long and corresponded to nucleotides 806–1507 of the KCC3a cDNA. The poly(A)+ RNA (2.5 μg) was separated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Zeta-probe GT; Bio-Rad). The membrane was hybridized with the 32P-labeled cDNA fragment overnight at 65 °C in 250 mm NaH2PO4-Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS; washed in 40 mm NaH2PO4-Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 1% SDS at 65 °C; and exposed to the Imaging Plate (Fuji Film) for 20 h.Plasmid Construction—Full-length cDNAs encoding rat KCC3a and rat KCC4 were inserted into pcDNA4/His vector (Invitrogen) by using KpnI/NotI and EcoRI/XbaI restriction sites, respectively (KCC3a-pcDNA4/His vector and KCC4-pcDNA4/His vector), and also inserted into pcDNA5/TO vector (Invitrogen) by using AflII/NotI and AflII/XbaI restriction sites, respectively (KCC3a-pcDNA5/TO vector and KCC4-pcDNA5/TO vector).Expression of KCC3a and KCC4 in Cultured Cells—To establish the tetracycline-regulated expression system of KCC3a or KCC4 in LLC-PK1 cells, the cells were cotransfected with pcDNA6/TR vector (Invitrogen), KCC3a-pcDNA5/TO vector, or KCC4-pcDNA5/TO vector by using Lipofectamine 2000 and cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The transfected cells were selected in the presence of 800 units/ml hygromycin B and 5 μg/ml blasticidin S. For transient expression of KCC3a in HEK293 cells stably expressing gastric H+,K+-ATPase (18Kimura T. Tabuchi Y. Takeguchi N. Asano S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20671-20677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the cells were transfected with the KCC3a-pcDNA4/His vector by using Lipofectamine 2000 and cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Western Blotting—Preparation of membrane fractions and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (19Fujii T. Ohira Y. Itomi Y. Takahashi Y. Asano S. Morii M. Takeguchi N. Sakai H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 560: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The signals were visualized with the ECL Plus system (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). To quantify the chemiluminescence signals on the membranes, a FujiFilm LAS-1000 system and the MultiGauge software were used. Anti-KCC3, anti-Xpress, and anti-H+,K+-ATPase (1H9) antibodies were used at 1:1,000 dilution, and anti-α1NaK antibody was used at 1:10,000 dilution. Anti-flotillin-2 antibody was used at 1:2,000 dilution. For negative control, one volume of each primary antibody was preincubated with five volumes of the corresponding blocking peptide. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat IgG was used as a secondary antibody (1:2,500 dilution).Immunohistochemistry—The gastric mucosa isolated from rat stomach was embedded in the O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Tokyo, Japan) and was cut at 8 μm. The sections were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 7 min at room temperature and were pretreated with the 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding of antibody. Then they were incubated with anti-KCC3, anti-H+,K+-ATPase (1H9), anti-α1NaK, or anti-AQP4 antibody (1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies (1:100 dilution) were used as secondary antibodies. Immunofluorescence images were visualized by using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope.Immunocytochemistry—LLC-PK1 cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 7 min and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked by 3% bovine serum albumin. The permeabilized cells were incubated with the anti-Xpress or anti-α1NaK antibody (1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 °C and then with the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated or Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-IgG antibody (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunofluorescence images were visualized by using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope.Isolation of Lipid Rafts—The membrane proteins were lysed with the ice-cold MBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.5) containing 1% CHAPS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A for 15 min. The solution was mixed with equal volume of 66% sucrose in MBS buffer, the mixture was placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube, and a discontinuous gradient was formed by overlaying with the 30% sucrose and the 5% sucrose solutions. The sample was centrifuged at 261,000 × g in SW41Ti rotor (Beckman) for 18 h at 4 °C. Ten fractions of 1 ml each were collected from the top of the gradient, and proteins were precipitated by acetone before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. For depletion of cholesterol, the cells were treated with 10 mm MβCD for 30 min at 37 °C before harvesting the cells.Immunoprecipitation—Membrane fractions of rat gastric mucosa (500 μg of protein) and KCC3a-expressing LLC-PK1 cells (2.5 mg of protein) were solubilized in the 500 μl of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm EDTA) for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was precleared with protein A-agarose beads, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-KCC3 antibody or control rabbit IgG for 24 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The antibody-antigen complexes were incubated with protein A-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Then the beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer and suspended in SDS sample buffer. The samples were used for Western blotting.Measurement of Na+,K+-ATPase Activity—Na+,K+-ATPase activity of LLC-PK1 (30 μg of protein) and membrane fractions of the rabbit gastric glands (30 μg of protein) and rabbit kidney (3 μg of protein) was measured in a 1 ml of solution containing 120 mm NaCl, 15 mm KCl, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 or 3 mm ATP, 50 μm SCH 28080, and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in the presence or absence of 100 μm ouabain. After incubation for 10 or 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of the ice-cold stop solution containing 12% perchloric acid and 3.6% ammonium molybdate, and inorganic phosphate released was measured (20Yoda A. Hokin L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The Na+,K+-ATPase activity was calculated as the difference between the activities in the presence and absence of ouabain.Measurement of Phosphorylation Level of Na+,K+-ATPase—Ten μg of membrane proteins were phosphorylated in a solution comprising 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP (4 × 106 cpm), 20 mm NaCl, 0.43 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.0) for 20 s at 0 °C. The reaction was quenched by the solution containing 10% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mm inorganic phosphate, and 1 mm ATP. Then the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized in a sample buffer comprising 2% SDS, 2.5% dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and subjected to the 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under acidic conditions at pH 6.0 (21Teramachi S.

The radioactivity associated with the Na+,K+-ATPaseα-subunit separated on the gel was visualized and quantified by a digital autoradiography of the dried gel using Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film).Measurement of H+,K+-ATPase Activity—H+,K+-ATPase activity of HEK293 cells (30 μg of protein) was measured in a 1-ml solution containing 15 mm KCl, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm NaN3, 2 mm ouabain, and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, in the presence or absence of 50 μm SCH 28080, a specific inhibitor of H+,K+-ATPase. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of the ice-cold stop solution containing 12% perchloric acid and 3.6% ammonium molybdate, and the inorganic phosphate released was measured (20Yoda A. Hokin L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Measurement of 22Na+ Transport Activity—Na+ transport activity of LLC-PK1 cells was estimated by measuring intracellular 22Na+ content (23Kometiani P. Liu L. Askari A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 24Liang M. Tian J. Liu L. Pierre S. Liu J. Shapiro J. Xie Z.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10585-10593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In each well of 12-well culture plates, 1 × 105 cells equipped with the tetracycline-regulated expression system of KCC3a were seeded and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 days, followed by treatment with or without 2 μg/ml tetracycline for 24 h. The treated cells were incubated at 37 °C in the culture medium containing trace amounts of 22Na+ (0.5 μCi/ml) for 120 min to fully equilibrate exchangeable intracellular Na+ with 22Na+. The 22Na+-loaded cells were incubated at 37 °C for additional 30 min in the presence and absence of 10 μm ouabain. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold solution of 100 mm MgCl2 and dissolved in 1 ml of the solution containing 1% SDS. 22Na+ contents in the samples were measured in a γ-counter (Aloka Accu-FLEXγ7001, Aloka Co., Tokyo, Japan). The Na+ transport activity of Na+,K+-ATPase was estimated as the difference between the intracellular 22Na+ contents in the presence and absence of ouabain.Statistics—The results are shown as the means ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and correction for multiple comparisons was made by using Dunnett's multiple comparison test. Comparison between the two groups was made by using Student's t test. Statistically significant differences were assumed at p < 0.05.RESULTSExpression of KCC3a in Gastric Parietal Cells—Northern blotting with the KCC3 cDNA probe gave a strong band of ∼8 kb and faint band of ∼7 kb in the preparation of rabbit gastric parietal cells (Fig. 1A). The transcript sizes of KCC3a and KCC3b were reported to be around 8 and 7 kb, respectively (25Mercado A. Vázquez N. Song L. Cortés R. Enck A.H. Welch R. Delpire E. Gamba G. Mount D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F1246-F1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Western blotting with the anti-KCC3 antibody showed a single band of ∼180 kDa in the samples from rats, rabbits, and humans (Fig. 1B, upper panel). The specificity of the antibody for the 180-kDa band was confirmed by using the corresponding blocking peptide (Fig. 1B, lower panel). KCC3b protein was reported to be expressed abundantly in kidney (5Pearson M.M. Lu J. Mount D.B. Delpire E. Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); thus we compared the band size of KCC3 expressed in the gastric mucosa with that expressed in the kidney of rats (Fig. 1C). The band size of the gastric mucosa (180 kDa) was apparently greater than that in the kidney (150 kDa). These results suggest that KCC3a mRNA and protein are predominantly expressed in gastric mucosa.In the immunohistochemistry of isolated rat gastric mucosa, the distribution pattern of KCC3a (Fig. 2, A, C, D, and F) was apparently different from that of H+,K+-ATPase (Fig. 2, B, C, E, and F). KCC3a was colocalized with Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit (α1NaK) (Fig. 2, J–L), suggesting that it is present in the basolateral membrane of gastric parietal cells. The specificity of anti-KCC3 antibody for positive staining was confirmed by using the blocking peptide (Fig. 2, G–I). AQP4 was abundantly expressed in the basal parietal cells (Fig. 2, M and N) as previously reported (26Carmosino M. Procino G. Nicchia G.P. Mannucci R. Verbavatz J.-M. Gobin R. Svelto M. Valenti G. J.

Interestingly, the present double immunostaining of KCC3a and AQP4 in rat gastric mucosa has shown clearly that KCC3a is predominantly expressed in the luminal parietal cells (Fig. 2M).Association of KCC3a with α1NaK in the Gastric Mucosa—To study whether KCC3a is associated with α1NaK in rat gastric mucosa, immunoprecipitation was performed by using an anti-KCC3 antibody. The subsequent Western blotting of the immune pellets with an anti-α1NaK antibody gave a clear band for α1NaK (100 kDa), whereas that with an anti-H+,K+-ATPase antibody gave no band for H+,K+-ATPase (95 kDa) (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that KCC3a is associated with α1NaK in gastric parietal cells.FIGURE 3Association of KCC3a and α1NaK in rat gastric mucosa. A, immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with the detergent extracts of rat gastric mucosa by using anti-KCC3 antibody and protein A-agarose. The detergent extracts (input; 1/25 (for KCC3) or 1/200 (for α1NaK and αHK) of total protein) and immunoprecipitation samples obtained with and without the antibody (1/20 of immunoprecipitation samples) were detected by Western blotting (WB) using antibodies for KCC3 (top panel), Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit (α1NaK; middle panel) and H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (αHK; bottom panel). B, lipid raft fractions (DRM) and nonraft fractions (non-DRM) were isolated from membrane fractions of rat gastric mucosa by sucrose gradient (5–40%) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blotting was performed by using antibodies for KCC3, α1NaK, and flotillin-2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Distribution of KCC3a and α1NaK in Lipid Rafts in Rat Gastric Mucosa—Lipid rafts are known to be insoluble for treatment with nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100 and CHAPS at low temperature and form detergent resistance membrane (DRM) fractions with low density (9Simons K. Vaz W.L.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). In the present study, lipid rafts were isolated from rat gastric mucosa by using CHAPS and sucrose gradient. Flotillin-2 was used as a marker for lipid rafts (30Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E.

As shown in Fig. 3B, most of KCC3a and α1NaK were distributed in the DRM fractions, in which flotillin-2 was also expressed (Fig. 3B).Tetracycline-regulated Stable Expression of KCC3a in LLC-PK1 Cells—Next, we constructed the tetracycline-regulated stable expression system of KCC3a in LLC-PK1 cells, a hog kidney proximal tubular cell line (Fig. 4). No significant expression of endogenous KCC3a was observed in control LLC-PK1 cells (data not shown). In this heterologous expression system, exogenous expression of KCC3a protein was assessed by using an anti-Xpress antibody. Expression of KCC3a (180 kDa) was observed in the cells treated with tetracycline (Tet-on cells), whereas no significant expression of KCC3a was observed in the cells treated without tetracycline (Tet-off cells) (Fig. 4A). Both KCC3a and α1NaK were found to be present in the basolateral membrane of the Tet-on cells (Fig. 4, F and G). The expression pattern of α1NaK in the Tet-on cells was similar to that in the Tet-off cells (Fig. 4, D and E).FIGURE 4Tetracycline-regulated expression system of KCC3a in LLC-PK1 cells. The tetracycline-regulated expression system of KCC3a was introduced to LLC-PK1 cells. The cells were treated with (Tet-on) or without (Tet-off) 2 μg/ml tetracycline. The expression of KCC3a was confirmed by Western blotting (A) and immunocytochemistry (B and C) using anti-Xpress antibody. In the cells, α1NaK was localized in the basolateral membrane (D, E, and G). In the Tet-on cells, KCC3a was localized in the basolateral membrane (F).

In the Tet-off cells, 33.0 ± 4.1% of total α1NaK was in DRM fractions in which flotillin-2 was localized, and 67.0 ± 4.1% of total α1NaK was in non-DRM fractions (Fig. 5, A and C). In the Tet-on cells, KCC3a was predominantly distributed in the DRM fractions, and an increased amount of α1NaK (76.9 ± 2.1%) was localized in the DRM fractions (Fig. 5, B and C). These findings suggest that the presence of KCC3a induces a significant recruitment of α1NaK from non-DRM fractions into the DRM fractions. Furthermore, depletion of cholesterol with MβCD (10 mm) shifted the distributions of both KCC3a and α1NaK from the DRM fractions to the non-DRM fractions (Fig. 5, B and D).FIGURE 5Lipid raft analysis of the tetracycline-regulated expression system of KCC3a.

https://openalex.org/W2057004695,"Ricin A chain (RTA) inhibits protein synthesis by removing a specific adenine from the highly conserved α-sarcin/ricin loop in the large rRNA. Expression of RTA with its own signal sequence in yeast resulted in its translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequent glycosylation. Because RTA must unfold within the ER, it may be vulnerable to host defenses, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR was induced in cells expressing an active site mutant but not the wild type RTA, indicating that the active site of RTA played a role in perturbing the ER stress response. The inactive RTA without the signal sequence did not induce UPR, indicating that translocation into the ER was critical for induction of UPR. The wild type RTA inhibited activation of UPR not only due to ER stress induced by the protein itself but also by global effectors such as tunicamycin and dithiothreitol. Mature RTA without the signal sequence also inhibited UPR, providing evidence that inhibition of UPR occurred on the cytosolic face of the ER. RTA could not inhibit UPR when the spliced form of HAC1 mRNA was provided in trans, indicating that it had a direct effect on UPR upstream of HAC1-dependent transcriptional activation. Only the precursor form of HAC1 mRNA was detected in cells expressing RTA after exposure to ER stress, demonstrating that ricin inhibits activation of UPR by preventing HAC1 mRNA splicing. The RTA mutants that depurinated ribosomes but did not kill cells were not able to inhibit activation of UPR by tunicamycin, providing evidence that the inability to activate UPR in response to ER stress contributes to the cytotoxicity of ricin.

Ricin is a member of a class of molecules termed ribosome-inactivating proteins that remove a highly conserved adenine from the α-sarcin ricin loop of the large rRNA (1Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8128-8130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The depurinated ribosome is no longer capable of fulfilling its role in protein synthesis (2Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Robertus J.D. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This rapidly lethal mechanism for debilitating and destroying cells has earned ricin the recent spotlight as a potential bioweapon. Ricin is produced in the seeds of castor bean, Ricinus communis. It is a heterodimeric toxin consisting of a catalytic A chain (RTA) 3The abbreviations used are:ERendoplasmic reticulumUPRunfolded protein responseUPREUPR elementRTAricin A chainERADER-associated degradationTmtunicamycinDTTdithiothreitolPGK3-phosphoglycerate kinaseHAhemagglutinin. covalently joined by a disulfide bond to a cell binding B chain (3Stirpe F.

Acta. 2004; 1701: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Due to its potent cytotoxicity and wide availability, ricin has been classified as a category B priority by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Currently there are no specific medical treatment options for ricin intoxication. To gain insight into the mechanism of ricin-induced cell death, we recently isolated a panel of nontoxic RTA mutants based on their inability to kill yeast cells (5Li X.P. Baricevic M. Saidasan H. Tumer N.E. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Analysis of these mutants provided evidence that ribosome depurination and translation inhibition are not sufficient for ricin-mediated cell death (5Li X.P. Baricevic M. Saidasan H. Tumer N.E.

Ricin possesses several unique features to overcome the cellular defenses before reaching the ribosome as a single chain ribosome-inactivating protein. In mammalian cells the holotoxin binds initially to terminal galactose-containing cellular receptors via ricin B chain. After endocytosis, a small fraction of ricin navigates through the trans-Golgi network and enters the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via retrograde transport (4Hartley M.R. Lord J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1701: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 6Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 7Wesche J. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 291: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Upon entry into the ER, the disulfide bonds of holotoxin are reduced, allowing RTA to separate from the B chain. RTA then enters the cytosol from the ER to reach its target (6Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which AB toxins enter the cytosol and how they evade degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway are poorly understood. RTA is thought to enter the cytosol from the ER using the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (8Wesche J. Rapak A. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34443-34449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9Simpson J.C. Roberts L.M. Romisch K. Davey J. Wolf D.H. Lord J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A fraction of RTA escapes the ubiquitin mediated-degradation in the cytosol ultimately reaching ribosomes (10Deeks E.D. Cook J.P. Day P.J. Smith D.C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3405-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Ricin undergoes conformational changes in the ER, including but not limited to reduction of disulfide bonds, partial unfolding, and transporter binding (4Hartley M.R. Lord J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1701: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). During any of these manipulations, RTA may be vulnerable to host defenses designed to destroy foreign proteins. One of these defenses that RTA is likely to encounter is the ER-to-nucleus signaling pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR is triggered in cells upon accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER. Various stresses, such as glucose starvation, inhibition of glycosylation, reducing conditions, alteration of calcium concentration, and viral infection can also trigger this defense. Several human diseases, are a result of perturbation in UPR, several human diseases, such as diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer, are a result of perturbation in UPR (11Zhao L. Ackerman S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER in yeast is sensed by a transmembrane protein kinase/ribonuclease, Ire1p, that transmits a signal from the ER to the nucleus (12Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 13Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Ire1p is an ER resident transmembrane protein whose amino-terminal domain is located in the ER lumen and functions as a sensor for the accumulation of unfolded proteins (13Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Its carboxyl-terminal cytosolic portion contains Ser/Thr protein kinase and endoribonuclease domains (12Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 13Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER causes oligomerization and autophosphorylation of Ire1p (14Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18181-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The cytosolic endoribonuclease domain of Ire1p is then activated and excises the intron in the unspliced HAC1 mRNA, Hac1u (u for uninduced), generating spliced HAC1 mRNA, Hac1i (i for induced) (15Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 16Cox J.S. Walter P.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The splicing event is so specific that Hac1u mRNA has been shown to be the only substrate for Ire1p in yeast (18Niwa M. Patil C.K. DeRisi J. Walter P. Genome Biology. 2005; 6: R3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A tRNA ligase Rlg1p is then required to rejoin the cleaved ends (19Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Hac1u is not a favorable mRNA for protein translation, but after splicing Hac1i is translated very efficiently, and its product, the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor Hac1p activates transcription of the UPR target genes by binding to the unfolded protein response element (UPRE) (20Bernales S. Papa F.R. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 487-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Activation of UPR reestablishes the protein folding capacity of the cell by increasing of genes encoding ER-resident chaperones and ERAD components that reduce ER stress by directing misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (21McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 300: 17-40PubMed Google Scholar, 22Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 23Romisch K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 435-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The consequences of UPR induction in mammalian and yeast systems differ in some fundamental aspects. For example, the upstream modulator of UPR in yeast cells is limited to Ire1p and its activity on HAC1 mRNA. In animal cells, one modulator is Ire1α and its substrate is the XBP1 mRNA. However, the basic leucine-zipper transcription factor ATF6 and the PERK kinase also play equally important roles in the induction of UPR (11Zhao L. Ackerman S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 24Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). Because yeast lacks both ATF6 and PERK, it provides an ideal system to study the PERK- and ATF6-independent pathways of the ER stress response. Considering RTA must unfold at least partially within the ER, it would seem likely that activation of UPR would occur. Because activation of UPR leads to expression of ERAD components, induction of this stress response may be deleterious to ricin. Ricin may have evolved to counteract host defenses within the ER, including UPR, in order to retrotranslocate from the ER to the cytosol. In this study we expressed RTA with and without its own amino-terminal signal sequence in yeast to investigate the events after entry of the toxin into the ER. We present the first evidence that ricin inhibits activation of UPR by preventing HAC1 mRNA splicing and Ire1p signaling. We further show that the ability to inhibit UPR contributes to the cytotoxicity of ricin. Growth Conditions and Plasmids—The RTA plasmid contained the 35-residue signal sequence and the 267-residue mature RTA downstream of the GAL1 promoter (5Li X.P. Baricevic M. Saidasan H. Tumer N.E. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The RTA mutants contained the same cDNA with the point mutations. The mature RTA contained the 267-residue mature RTA without the signal sequence, and the mature E177K contained the 267-residue mature RTA with the E177K mutation at its active site. W303 yeast cells harboring RTA, E177K, mature RTA, mature E177K plasmids or the empty vector (LEU), and either the UPRE-lacZ reporter, pJC104 (URA), or the PGK1-lacZ reporter, pTI25 (TRP) (25Tumer N.E. Parikh B.A. Li P. Dinman J.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown overnight in the appropriate synthetic dropout media supplemented with 100 μg/ml myo-inositol, 2% glucose. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in the appropriate synthetic dropout media supplemented with 100 μg/ml myo-inositol, 2% galactose (for induction of RTA). A portion of cells was induced for UPR with either 1 μg/ml tunicamycin (Tm) or 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) simultaneously during the galactose induction of RTA. At each time point, 0.2 A600 units of cells were pelleted and frozen for subsequent lacZ reporter assays. The growth conditions were identical for BY4743 cells and Δhac1 cells. Spliced HAC1 was provided where indicated from pJC835 (HIS). Both pJC104 (12Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) and pJC835 (26Ng D.T. Spear E.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) were gifts from Peter Walter. Ire1p-HA was overexpressed from the vector BG1805 (Open Biosystems). lacZ Reporter Assay—The assay was conducted as described previously (25Tumer N.E. Parikh B.A. Li P. Dinman J.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells pelleted as described above were resuspended in 800 μl of Z-buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4) + 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol. 100 μl of 0.1% SDS and 100 μl of chloroform were added and briefly vortexed. Cells were placed in a 30 °C water bath for at least 5 min to pre-equilibrate the lysates. After this incubation, 100 μl of orthonitrophenyl-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in Z-buffer) was added, samples were placed at 30 °C, and the timer was started. When samples appeared to be in the linear range for quantification, 250 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 was added to stop the reaction. Samples were vortexed briefly and centrifuged for phase separation. 100 μl of the supernatant was diluted into 200 μl of Z-buffer for quantification (in triplicate) along with a standard curve (in duplicate). lacZ activity was determined by calculating the A420 and dividing by the product of the A600 units and the length of incubation. This calculation was repeated on at least three individual transformants. Analysis of Protein Expression—The total cell lysate from frozen yeast cells harvested during the time course of induction was fractionated into membrane and cytosolic fractions as previously described (27Parikh B.A. Baykal U. Di R. Tumer N.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Total protein (10 μg) from each time point was separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with RTA polyclonal antibody (1:5000). RTA was visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The blots were then stripped for 30–45 min with 8 m guanidine hydrochloride and reprobed with antibody to dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (Dpm1p; Molecular Probes) (1:2000) and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1p; Molecular Probes) (1:5000). Hac1p levels were determined in cells co-transformed with pJC835 using monoclonal anti-HA (Covance) (1:5000). RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from yeast using hot phenol (25Tumer N.E. Parikh B.A. Li P. Dinman J.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern analysis was conducted using standard protocols. Blots were probed with PCR products corresponding to HAC1, ACT1, and KAR2 cDNA. For real-time RT-PCR analysis, cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction containing 1× first-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 40 units/μl RNA Guard RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.5 μg of poly d(T) oligonucleotide (Promega), 40 mm dNTPs, and Superscript II (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase. Quantification of transcript levels by real-time PCR analysis was performed using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection system using the manufacturer's protocols. For quantitative PCR, the primers used were as follows: KAR2,5′-AGACTAAGCGCTGGCAAGCT-3′ and 5′-ACCACGAAAAGGGCGTACAG-3′; GCN4,5′-CCAATTGTGCCCGAATCC-3′ and 5′-CCTGGCGGCTTCAGTGTT-3′; DER1,5′-GCAGCATCACTCGGTGTGTT-3′ and 5′-TTTCCGTTCTTTTTCAGTTCGTAGT-3′; ACT1,5′-TGGATTCCGGTGATGGTGTT-3′ and 5′-TCAAAATGGCGTGAGGTAGAGA-3′. For Northern blotting, a HAC1 probe was synthesized by first amplifying the first 717 nucleotides of HAC1 cDNA, subcloning into pYES2.1 (Invitrogen), and re-isolating the fragment after restriction digest followed by [32P]dCTP labeling (GE Healthcare). The primers used for HAC1 amplification were 5′-ATGGAAATGACTGATTTTGAACTA-3′ and 5′-TCATGAAGTGATGAAGAAATCATT-3′. Similarly, a probe for ACT1 was generated using the primers 5′-TGGATTCCGGTGATGGTGTT-3′ and 5′-TTAGAAACACTTGTGGTGAACG-3′. Expression of RTA with Its Own Signal Sequence Results in Translocation into the Endoplasmic Reticulum and Glycosylation—As shown in Fig. 1A, expression of RTA with its own 35-residue amino-terminal signal sequence from the GAL1 promoter in yeast resulted in the toxin accumulating in the membrane fraction (P18). To confirm that the membrane fraction was free of cytosolic contamination and comprised of the ER, the blots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against the cytosolic marker, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1p), and the ER marker, dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (Dpm1p) (Fig. 1A). These results were repeated with an inactive form of RTA that was mutated at the active site. By changing residue 177 from a glutamic acid to a lysine (E177K), the toxicity of RTA was abolished (5Li X.P. Baricevic M. Saidasan H. Tumer N.E. Infect.

The glycosylated RTA from castor beans contained two different forms (standard (std)). Unlike the wild type RTA, E177K expressed in yeast contained multiple forms (Fig. 1B). Expression of the mature RTA or mature E177K without the signal sequence resulted in a single form of the protein, which was more equally distributed in both the cytosolic and the membrane fractions (Fig. 1, C and D). To determine whether the multiple bands observed with the RTA or E177K correspond to glycosylated forms, we carried out immunoblot analysis after treating cells with Tm, which inhibits glycosylation. As shown in Fig. 1E, the slower migrating forms of RTA disappeared after treatment with Tm, and new faster migrating forms appeared. Similarly, treatment of cells expressing the E177K with Tm led to the disappearance of the slower migrating forms of RTA and the appearance of faster migrating forms (Fig. 1F). In contrast, the mobility of the mature RTA or mature E177K did not change in the presence or absence of Tm (Fig. 1, G and H). These results indicated that expression RTA or E177K with the signal sequence resulted in translocation into the ER and glycosylation. In contrast, the mature RTA without the signal sequence was not translocated into the ER but was associated with the membrane fraction. Expression of Inactive RTA That Can Translocate to the ER Induces UPR—To determine whether RTA affects UPR, we expressed RTA in cells that also harbor the lacZ reporter containing several UPREs within the promoter region. This reporter system has been used to determine the presence and extent of UPR induction in yeast cells (16Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase is only produced during induction of UPR through binding of Hac1p to the UPRE in the promoter. Cells were induced for up to 10 h, and β-galactosidase activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 2A, compared with vector control cells, UPR was induced in yeast expressing E177K. Conversely, cells expressing RTA did not induce UPR. To determine whether inhibition of translation by RTA prevented induction of UPR, we co-transformed cells expressing RTA, E177K, or the vector with a plasmid containing lacZ downstream of the constitutively expressed phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) promoter. In cells harboring the vector, RTA, or E177K, lacZ expression from the PGK1 promoter was not significantly changed (Table 1). When β-galactosidase activity was expressed as the ratio of the UPRE/PGK-driven lacZ, the activity was similar in cells expressing RTA or harboring the vector but higher in cells expressing E177K (Table 1). These results indicated that in cells expressing RTA, the inability to induce lacZ expression from the UPRE promoter was not due to inhibition of translation of the lacZ reporter.TABLE 1Data are milliunits of β-galactosidase activity upon inductionVector controlRTAE177K6 h of induction10 h of induction6 h of induction10 h of induction6 h of induction10 h of inductionMillliunitsMillliunitsMillliunitsβ-Galactosidase from UPRE-driven lacZ Galactose111 ± 15aS.D.

Open table in a new tab Because E177K seemed to strongly activate UPR, we next determined whether translocation to the ER was responsible for the induction. The mature RTA and the mature E177K were transformed into yeast cells bearing the UPRE-driven lacZ reporter plasmid. As expected, expression of either mature RTA or mature E177K without the signal sequence was no longer capable of causing UPR activation through ER stress (Fig. 2A). We conclude from these data that RTA can induce UPR only under conditions when the signal sequence is present but, as in E177K, when the activity of the protein is attenuated. RTA Inhibits Induction of UPR by Either Tunicamycin or DTT—One explanation for the lack of UPR induction in cells expressing wild type RTA is that the toxin inhibits induction of the UPR pathway. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of RTA on UPR that is activated by Tm or DTT. Both Tm and DTT can induce UPR via related but distinct mechanisms. Tm inhibits protein glycosylation, whereas DTT prevents disulfide bond formation. As expected, both agents caused an up-regulation of UPRE-driven lacZ in vector control cells (Table 1 and Fig. 2B). An enhancement of UPR was observed in cells expressing E177K after treatment with Tm or DTT (Table 1). In contrast, RTA inhibited induction of UPR by both Tm and DTT (Table 1 and Fig. 2B). Therefore, the wild type RTA appears to have a direct effect on UPR upstream of UPRE-dependant transcriptional activation. Because RTA inhibited induction of UPR upon ER stress, we next determined whether translocation into the ER was necessary for inhibition of UPR. This would allow us to discriminate between RTA targets within the lumen of the ER and targets on the cytosolic side of the ER. We treated cells expressing both mature RTA and mature E177K without the signal sequence with Tm and DTT and showed that only with mature RTA, but not with mature E177K, is there continued inhibition of Tm- and DTT-promoted UPR (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrated that RTA could inhibit activation of UPR regardless of whether it can translocate to the ER. Expression of KAR2 or DER1 Is Not Induced in Cells Expressing RTA—The expression of the KAR2 gene, encoding Kar2p the yeast ortholog of mammalian Bip, is up-regulated by UPR (20Bernales S. Papa F.R. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 487-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels corresponding to DER1, a component of the ERAD pathway, also increase during UPR (20Bernales S. Papa F.R. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 487-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In contrast, GCN4 expression is not induced by UPR (20Bernales S. Papa F.R. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 487-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). To determine whether RTA affected expression of genes induced during UPR, we examined the mRNA levels corresponding to KAR2, DER1, and GCN4. As shown in Fig. 3, real time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that in the absence of Tm, KAR2 and DER1 mRNA levels were slightly higher in cells expressing RTA or E177K compared with cells harboring the vector. However, at 10 h after Tm treatment, KAR2 and DER1 mRNA levels increased by more than 20 and 12-fold, respectively, in cells harboring the vector or expressing E177K but not in cells expressing RTA. In contrast, we did not detect any increase in GCN4 mRNA levels in cells expressing RTA or E177K or harboring the vector after treatment with Tm. The expression of actin mRNA as an internal control did not change in these cells. Similar results were obtained by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). These results demonstrated that RTA impairs the induction of expression of KAR2 and DER1 mRNA in response to stress. HAC1 mRNA Is Not Spliced in Cells Expressing RTA—Previous results indicated that translocation of RTA into the ER was not necessary for inhibition of UPR. A potential explanation for the inhibitory activity of RTA could then be explained by interference with one of the events occurring on the cytosolic face of the ER. These include trans-phosphorylation of Ire1p and splicing of HAC1 mRNA, translation of HAC1 mRNA, Hac1p binding, and transcriptional activation of the UPRE-containing genes. To determine more precisely the step inhibited in the UPR signaling pathway, we examined the splicing of HAC1 mRNA. To address the status of HAC1 mRNA, Northern blot analysis was conducted on cells expressing RTA or E177K or harboring the vector. As shown in Fig. 4, HAC1 mRNA was normally unspliced in the absence of ER stress in cells harboring the empty vector (VC). However, HAC1 mRNA was spliced when E177K was expressed in yeast. HAC1 mRNA was rapidly spliced in vector control cells after treatment with Tm or DTT (Fig. 4). In contrast, HAC1 mRNA was not spliced in cells expressing RTA, even after treatment with Tm or DTT. These results indicated that the inhibition of UPR by ricin occurs through a mechanism that specifically prevents HAC1 mRNA splicing. UPR Is Not Inhibited by Ricin after Splicing of HAC1 mRNA—Previous results indicated that the mature form of HAC1 mRNA is markedly decreased in cells expressing RTA. The RTA might inhibit HAC1 message either by increasing its turnover, sequestering it, or by inhibiting processing of the unspliced form, Hac1u. To determine whether this inhibition occurs upstream of the generation of HAC1i, Δhac1 cells, which contain a deletion of the endogenous HAC1, and the isogenic wild type BY4743 cells were co-transformed with RTA, E177K, or the vector and the UPRE-driven lacZ reporter plasmid, pJC104. By assaying UPR in yeast in which the endogenous HAC1 was deleted, the effects of UPR induction could accurately be attributed to only the spliced HAC1 mRNA provided in trans. Predictably, there was no detectable induction of UPR even in the presence of Tm in Δhac1 cells (data not shown). We"

Various subunits (e.g. CNOT1 and CNOT7/CAF1) have been reported to be involved in influencing nuclear hormone receptor activities. Here, we show that CCR4/CNOT6 and RCD1/CNOT9, members of the CCR4-NOT complex, potentiate nuclear receptor activity. RCD1 interacts in vivo and in vitro with NIF-1 (NRC-interacting factor), a previously characterized nuclear receptor cotransducer that activates nuclear receptors via its interaction with NRC. As with NIF-1, RCD1 and CCR4 do not directly associate with nuclear receptors; however, they enhance ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by nuclear hormone receptors. CCR4 mediates its effect through the ligand binding domain of nuclear receptors and small interference RNA-mediated silencing of endogenous CCR4 results in a marked decrease in nuclear receptor activation. Furthermore, knockdown of CCR4 results in an attenuated stimulation of RARα target genes (e.g. Sox9 and HoxA1) as shown by quantitative PCR assays. The silencing of endogenous NIF-1 also resulted in a comparable decrease in the RAR-mediated induction of both Sox9 and HoxA1. Furthermore, CCR4 associates in vivo with NIF-1. In addition, the CCR4-enhanced transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors is dependent on NIF-1. The small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of NIF-1 blocks the ligand-dependent potentiating effect of CCR4. Our results suggest that CCR4 plays a role in the regulation of certain endogenous RARα target genes and that RCD1 and CCR4 might mediate their function through their interaction with NIF-1.

Nuclear receptors are characterized by a common modular structure, an N-terminal “A/B” domain, a central zinc finger-containing DNA binding “C” domain (DBD), a “D” hinge region, and a C-terminal “EF” ligand binding domain (LBD) (3Xu W.

CCR4 was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as being necessary for non-fermentative gene expression (53Denis C.L. Genetics. 1984; 108: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CCR4 and CAF1 have also been shown to be components of the major cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylase, with CCR4 as the catalytic component (54Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L.

The NOT proteins were isolated as repressors of transcription from promoters lacking a canonical TATA sequence (56Collart M.A. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The NOT proteins play an important role in transcriptional regulation through their interaction with TFIID and other components of the Mediator complex (57Badarinarayana V. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L.

Corbo L. Heidmann T. BMC Genomics. 2001; 2: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The composition of the mammalian CCR4-NOT complex and the functionality of several components have also been conserved. For instance, CNOT2 (hNOT2) functions as a repressor of reporter gene activity, with a suggestion of the involvement of a histone deacetylase activity (61Zwartjes C.G. Jayne S. den Berg van D.L. Timmers H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10848-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A recent study identified CNOT1 as a ligand-dependent repressor of nuclear hormone receptor activity (62Winkler G.S. Mulder K.W. Bardwell V.J. Kalkhoven E. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3089-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). CNOT6 (hCCR4) and the newly identified CNOT6L (another homolog of yCCR4) have both been shown to possess a3′-5′ deadenylase activity in vitro (63Collart M.A. Timmers H.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77: 289-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 64Morita M. Suzuki T. Nakamura T. Yokoyama K. Miyasaka T. Yamamoto T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4980-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The expression of a catalytically inactive CCR4 resulted in impeded deadenylation and decay of mRNA (65Chang T.C.

We have previously reported the cloning and characterization of NIF-1 (NRC-interacting factor 1) (35Mahajan M.A. Murray A. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6883-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). NIF-1 enhances ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by nuclear hormone receptors through its interaction with the coactivator NRC. NIF-1 also exerts its activating function on other transcription factors such as c-Fos and c-Jun (35Mahajan M.A. Murray A. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6883-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To further understand the function of NIF-1 and to identify other interacting partners, we set up a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length NIF-1 as bait. This screen identified several putative NIF-1 interactors. One such interesting clone was identified as RCD1 (required for cell differentiation), a component of the CCR4-NOT complex. In this study, we report that NIF-1 associates with RCD1, and RCD1 as well as CCR4 function as nuclear hormone receptor coactivators. CCR4 is an AF-2-dependent coactivator and appears to play a vital and specific role in the regulation of certain RARα target genes. Although these factors do not directly associate with nuclear receptors, our findings are consistent with a model that suggests that they mediate their effects through a NIF-1 coactivator complex. Yeast Two-hybrid cDNA Library from GH4C1 Cells—Poly(A+) RNA isolated from GH4C1 cells was used for the synthesis of cDNA with a Stratagene cDNA synthesis system. The cDNA was size-fractionated using Sephacryl S200. Fractions above 0.4 kb were pooled, precipitated with ethanol, and ligated with EcoRI-XhoI-digested pEG202, which constitutively expresses the cDNA as a fusion with the LexA DNA binding domain in S. cerevisiae. The pEG202-cDNA was transformed into Sure bacteria (Stratagene) by electroporation. This cDNA library contains ∼1.2 × 107 independent transformants, and the average insert size was estimated to be 1.5 kb. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Full-length NIF-1 was cloned into the EcoRI site of pJGM vector (35Mahajan M.A. Murray A. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6883-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. pJGM was derived from the parent vector pJG4–5, as described earlier (24Mahajan M.A. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5048-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All methods and transformation procedures have been described previously (24Mahajan M.A. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5048-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The yeast strain EGY48 harboring the LacZ reporter pSH18–34 and pJGM-NIF-1 was transformed with the GH4C1 pEG202 cDNA library. Transformants were directly screened on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside (X-gal) synthetic defined minimal medium (SD)-galactose-raffinose plates lacking Trp, Ura, His, and Leu. The putative positive clones were then verified by replica plating each clone on Trp–, Ura–, His–, and Leu– X-gal SD-galactose-raffinose and Trp–, Ura–, His–, and Leu– X-gal-SD-dextrose plates. Yeast clones exhibiting a positive LacZ response on galactose-raffinose plates, but not on dextrose plates, were considered to be potential NIF-1-interacting clones. The putative cDNAs were then isolated, sequenced, and subjected to size determination and further analysis. Plasmids—Expression plasmids for nuclear receptors and various reporters have been described previously (24Mahajan M.A. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5048-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The cloning of pCDNA3-NIF-1 and pJGM-NIF-1 has also been described (35Mahajan M.A. Murray A. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6883-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The plasmid IRES-RCD1 (66Hiroi N. Ito T. Yamamoto H. Ochiya T. Jinno S. Okayama H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5235-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. Hiroto Okayama (University of Tokyo). pGEX-RCD1 was cloned by inserting full-length RCD1 into the EcoRI site of pGEX-4T-1. The pLPC vector (which introduces a FLAG and an HA tag into the cloning sequence) was kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Ye. pLPC-RCD1 was generated by first introducing a 5′-BamHI and 3′-EcoRI restriction enzyme site into the coding sequence of RCD1. The BamHI-EcoRI fragment was then cloned in-frame into the pLPC vector. Primers: 5′-BamHI, CTACCAGATGGATCCCACAGCCTGGCGACGGCTGCGC; 3′-EcoRI, CTACCAGATGAATTCTCACTGAGGGGGCAGGGGGATACC. The plasmid pSG5-FLAG-CCR4 (67Morel A.P. Sentis S. Bianchin C. Romancer Le M. Jonard L. Rostan M.C. Rimokh R. Corbo L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2929-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Laura Corbo (Unité INSERM, France). The yeast expression vectors for nuclear receptors have been described earlier (24Mahajan M.A. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5048-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Mahajan M.A. Murray A. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6883-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The yeast expression plasmid pEG202ΔPL-RCD1 was constructed by cloning the EcoRI insert from IRES-RCD1 into the pEG202ΔPL vector. The plasmid pEG202ΔPL-CCR4 was cloned by inserting the BamHI-SalI fragment of pSG5-CCR4 in the pEG202ΔPL multiple cloning site. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—HeLa cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum supplemented with glutamine and antibiotics. MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with glutamine and antibiotics. For the reporter studies, HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 150,000 cells per well, and the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% hormone-depleted bovine calf serum (68Samuels H.H. Stanley F. Casanova J. Endocrinology. 1979; 105: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) before transfection. Transfections were performed using calcium phosphate coprecipitation. Various ligands such as T3 for TRα, TTNPB for RARα, and LG100153 for RXRα were used at concentrations of 1 μm. Dexamethasone for GR and estradiol (E2) for ERα were used at 0.5μm and 0.1μm, respectively. Typically, 300–600 ng of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid and 150–300 ng of the expression plasmids were used per sample unless otherwise indicated. All transfections were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Yeast β-Galactosidase Assays—Various ligands, such as T3 for TRα, 9-cis-RA for RARα and RXRα, E2 for ERα, and deoxycorticosterone for GR were used at concentrations of 1 μm. Yeast colonies were first grown exponentially in Ura–, His–, and Trp– SD-dextrose medium, washed, diluted to the appropriate density, and incubated in Ura–, His–, and Trp– SD-galactose-raffinose medium for 12 h followed by quantitation of β-galactosidase as described earlier (35Mahajan M.A. Murray A. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6883-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase units are expressed as (A420 × 1000)/(minutes of incubation × A600 of the yeast suspension), where A420 and A600 are optical density at 420 and 600 nm, respectively. In Vitro Binding Assay—GST-RCD1 and GST-NRC-15 were expressed in SG1117 Escherichia coli by induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and then purified and immobilized to glutathione-agarose, as described previously (35Mahajan M.A. Murray A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). NIF-1 was labeled by in vitro transcription-translation with [l-35S]methionine using rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Typically, 300–500 ng of GST protein bound to glutathione agarose was used per assay. 35S-Labeled NIF-1 was mixed with GST, GST-RCD1, or GST-NRC-15 beads. The samples were incubated for 15 min at 25 °C followed by 2 h at 4°C in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml ovalbumin). The samples were then washed with same binding buffer, and the bound 35S-labeled protein was analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Antibodies and Coimmunoprecipitation—Rabbit polyclonal antibody against RCD1 was a kind gift from Dr. Hiroto Okayama (University of Tokyo). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against CCR4 was a kind gift from Dr. Laura Corbo (Unité INSERM, France). The anti-NIF-1 (BL2739) and the anti-Sox9 (AB5535) antibodies were from Bethyl Laboratories and Chemicon International, respectively. The anti-Cyclin D1 antibody was a gift from Dr. Michele Pagano (New York University School of Medicine). The antibody against β-actin was from Abcam. The anti-HA antibody was from Roche Applied Sciences. For coimmunoprecipitation, pLPC-RCD1 (HA-tagged) and full-length NIF-1 were transfected into HeLa cells. The cells were lysed with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors), and the lysate was incubated with an anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science). The immunoprecipitated proteins were then eluted from the beads with an HA peptide (Covance Inc.) and then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-NIF-1 antibody. To study the interaction between CCR4 and NIF-1, pSG5-CCR4 (FLAG-tagged) and full-length NIF-1 were transfected into 293T cells. Whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) as described previously (67Morel A.P.

Equal amounts of the lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG affinity matrix (Sigma). The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma) and then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-NIF-1 antibody. siRNA Transfection—siRNAs directed against RCD1, CCR4, NIF-1, and a non-targeting control (siControl) were obtained from Dharmacon. HeLa and MCF-7 cells were transfected with the siRNAs (final concentration, 25 nm and 40 nm, respectively) using Hiperfect siRNA transfection reagent from Qiagen. For the receptor reporter assays, the appropriate DNA constructs were transfected into HeLa cells (Lipofectamine®) 24 h after the siRNA transfection. The CAT assay was performed 64 h after the initial siRNA transfection. To study the effect of the siRNA-mediated knockdown on endogenous target genes, 40 nm of the siRNAs was transfected into MCF-7 cells using Hiperfect. The cells were lysed after appropriate incubation with ligand. Equal amounts of protein were then analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blotting for either Sox9 or cyclin D1. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol® (Invitrogen). For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, 100 ng of the RNA samples was reverse-transcribed and analyzed using the C. Therm polymerase One-step RT-PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The following primers were used: RCD1, 5′-GCTGGAGCTAAGTAAGAAGCGAGAATC-3′ and 5′-GGGAGAAACGCTCATACGTCTGAC-3′; CCR4, 5′-CAGAACTCGGAAACATGGTATCACTC-3′ and 5′-GATCCACAGTAGCCGTATAACTGC-3′; and GAPDH, 5′-TGAAG"
https://openalex.org/W2067540329,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is caused by the synthesis of a mutant form of prelamin A, which is generally called progerin. Progerin is targeted to the nuclear rim, where it interferes with the integrity of the nuclear lamina, causes misshapen cell nuclei, and leads to multiple aging-like disease phenotypes. We created a gene-targeted allele yielding exclusively progerin (LmnaHG) and found that heterozygous mice (LmnaHG/+) exhibit many phenotypes of progeria. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the phenotypes elicited by the LmnaHG allele might be modulated by compositional changes in the nuclear lamina. To explore this hypothesis, we bred mice harboring one LmnaHG allele and one LmnaLCO allele (a mutant allele that produces lamin C but no lamin A). We then compared the phenotypes of LmnaHG/LCO mice (which produce progerin and lamin C) with littermate LmnaHG/+ mice (which produce lamin A, lamin C, and progerin). LmnaHG/LCO mice exhibited improved body weight curves (p < 0.0001), reduced numbers of spontaneous rib fractures (p < 0.0001), and improved survival (p < 0.0001). In addition, LmnaHG/LCO fibroblasts had fewer misshapen nuclei than LmnaHG/+ fibroblasts (p < 0.0001). A likely explanation for these differences was uncovered; the amount of progerin in LmnaHG/LCO fibroblasts and tissues was lower than in LmnaHG/+ fibroblasts and tissues. These studies suggest that compositional changes in the nuclear lamina can influence both the steady-state levels of progerin and the severity of progeria-like disease phenotypes.

LMNA yields two principal proteins, prelamin A and lamin C (4Lin F. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16321-16326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prelamin A terminates with a CAAX motif (i.e. CSIM), which triggers farnesylation and methylation of a carboxyl-terminal cysteine (5Beck L.A. Hosick T.J. Sinensky M. J.

Following these modifications, the carboxyl-terminal portion of prelamin A (including the farnesylcysteine methyl ester) is clipped off by ZMPSTE24 and degraded, releasing mature lamin A (6Young S.G.

Lamins A and C are important proteins of the nuclear lamina, a filamentous meshwork that lines the inner nuclear membrane (1Muchir A. Worman H.J.

In the mouse, a complete absence of lamin A and lamin C leads to muscular dystrophy and death by 6 weeks of age (8Sullivan T. Escalante-Alcalde D. Bhatt H. Anver M. Bhat N. Nagashima K. Stewart C.L. Burke B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). However, prelamin A and lamin A appear to be dispensable, as mice that are homozygous for a “lamin C-only” allele (LmnaLCO/LCO) are healthy and robust (9Fong L.G. Ng J.K. Lammerding J. Vickers T.A.

Pediatr. 1972; 80: 697-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). HGPS is almost always caused by a point mutation in LMNA that alters pre-mRNA splicing, resulting in a mutant form of prelamin A, commonly called progerin, with a 50-amino acid internal deletion (10Eriksson M. Brown W.T. Gordon L.B. Glynn M.W. Singer J. Scott L. Erdos M.R. Robbins C.M. Moses T.Y. Berglund P. Dutra A. Pak E. Durkin S. Csoka A.B. Boehnke M. Glover T.W. Collins F.S.

However, the 50-amino acid deletion eliminates the site for the ZMPSTE24-mediated cleavage reaction, abrogating further processing to mature lamin A. Progerin accumulates at the nuclear rim and impairs the integrity of the nuclear lamina, resulting in misshapen nuclei and multiple disease phenotypes (10Eriksson M. Brown W.T. Gordon L.B. Glynn M.W.

LmnaHG/+ mice appear normal at birth, but by 6-8 weeks of age they manifest hallmarks of progeria (slow growth, weight loss, loss of adipose tissue, and osteolytic lesions in ribs and other bones) (16Yang S.H. Meta M. Qiao X. Frost D. Bauch J. Coffinier C. Majumdar S. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Fong L.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2115-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Osteolytic lesions in the ribs result in numerous spontaneous fractures. Most LmnaHG/+ mice die by ∼28 weeks of age. Mice with a double dose of progerin (LmnaHG/HG) are severely affected and die by 3 weeks of age (16Yang S.H. Meta M. Qiao X. Frost D. Bauch J. Coffinier C. Majumdar S. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Fong L.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2115-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in both humans and mice have shown that higher levels of progerin are associated with more severe disease phenotypes (14Moulson C.L. Fong L.G. Gardner J.M. Farber E.A. Go G. Passariello A. Grange D.K. Young S.G. Miner J.H. Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Yang S.H. Meta M. Qiao X. Frost D. Bauch J. Coffinier C. Majumdar S. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Fong L.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2115-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus far, however, no one has investigated whether alterations in the composition of the nuclear lamina could affect the severity of disease. Progerin is targeted to the nuclear rim and directly interacts with other nuclear lamins (17Delbarre E. Tramier M. Coppey-Moisan M. Gaillard C. Courvalin J.C. Buendia B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); hence, it seemed possible that changes in lamin composition might influence disease phenotypes elicited by the mutant allele. In this study, we hypothesized that compositional changes in the nuclear lamina might modulate disease phenotypes in mice harboring the LmnaHG allele. To explore this hypothesis, we took advantage of the existence of a lamin C-only allele, LmnaLCO, which produces lamin C but no lamin A. In our studies, we compared the severity of disease phenotypes in LmnaHG/LCO mice (which produce progerin and lamin C) and littermate LmnaHG/+ mice (which produce mature lamin A, lamin C, and progerin). Our data indicate that the severity of disease phenotypes elicited by the LmnaHG allele is diminished in the setting of the LmnaLCO allele (i.e. in the setting of a nuclear lamina devoid of mature lamin A). Genetically Modified Mice—Male chimeric mice, generated by injecting C57BL/6 blastocysts with LmnaHG/+ embryonic stem cells (9Fong L.G. Ng J.K. Lammerding J. Vickers T.A. Meta M. Cote N. Gavino B.

Toth J.I. Qiao X. Hu Y. Sandoval S. Meta M. Bendale P. Gelb M.H. Young S.G. Fong L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10291-10296Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Protein Extraction, and Western Blotting—Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from embryonic day 13.5 mouse embryos (18Bergo M.O. Gavino B. Ross J. Schmidt W.K. Hong C. Kendall L.V. Mohr A. Meta M. Genant H. Jiang Y. Wisner E.R. Bruggen van N. Carano R.A.D. Michaelis S. Griffey S.M. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13049-13054Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To generate cell extracts for Western blots, early passage fibroblasts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and urea-soluble extracts were prepared as described (19Dalton M. Sinensky M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 134-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For tissue extraction, 150 mg of fresh mouse tissues were frozen with liquid nitrogen and ground into a powder with a mortar and pestle. The powder was then resuspended in 0.5 ml of urea solubilization buffer (19Dalton M. Sinensky M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 134-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and ground in a glass tissue grinder for an additional 2 min. Samples were then sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant fluid was collected and analyzed by Western blotting. The protein extracts were electrophoresed on 4-12% gradient polyacrylamide BisTris gels (Invitrogen); the size-fractionated proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a sheet of nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. The antibody dilutions were 1:400 for anti-lamin A/C goat IgG (sc-6215, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:1000 for anti-actin goat IgG, and 1:6000 for horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-goat IgG (sc-2020, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibody binding was detected with the ECL Plus chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare) and exposure to x-ray film. Western blots were also analyzed with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). In those experiments, the nitrocellulose membrane was rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min before incubation in Odyssey blocking buffer. The membrane was incubated with the primary antibodies in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The antibody dilutions were 1:400 for anti-lamin A/C rabbit IgG (sc-20681, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and 1:1000 for anti-actin goat IgG (sc-1616, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing the membrane three times for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, it was incubated with 1:5000 IRDye 700 anti-goat IgG antibody and 1:5000 IRDye 800 anti-rabbit IgG antibody (both from Rockland Immunochemicals) in Odyssey blocking buffer. After washing, the membranes were scanned on an Odyssey infrared imaging system, and images were acquired and analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from primary fibroblasts and mouse tissues with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified with a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). The integrity of the RNA was verified with an ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gel. Reverse transcriptase reactions were carried out with 1 μg of RNA that had been treated with DNase (DNA-Free, Ambion, Foster City, CA), Superscript III (Invitrogen), and a mixture of oligo(dT) (Invitrogen) and random primers (Invitrogen). The cDNA samples were incubated with RNase (RNase H, Ambion, Foster City, CA) and then diluted to 10 ng/μl for PCRs. The progerin and prelamin A cDNAs were amplified with primers corresponding to exon 10 and exon 12 sequences (forward, 5′-CTGACCATGGTTGAGGACAA-3′; reverse, 5′-TTAGGAGAGCAGGCCTGAAG-3′). Arbp, used as the internal control, was amplified with primers 5′-ACTGAGATTCGGGATATGCTGT-3′ and 5′-TCCTAGACCAGTGTTCTGAGCTG-3′. All primers were designed with Primer 3 software. The RT-PCR was performed with AmpliTaq (ABI Foster City, CA) and 50 ng of cDNA. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s, for a total of 26 cycles. The RT-PCR fragment spanning exon 10-12 was 456 bp in the wild-type Lmna allele and 306 bp in the LmnaHG allele. The RT-PCR fragment for Arbp was 108 bp. 10 μl of Arbp PCR products were mixed with 25 μl of lamin A and progerin PCR products and loaded onto a 1.3% agarose gel containing SYTO 60 nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen) (1:16,000 dilution). Images of the gels were acquired with the Odyssey infrared imaging system, and band intensity was quantified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Early passage fibroblasts (matched for passage number) were grown on coverslips, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with bovine serum albumin (20Fong L.G. Ng J.K. Meta M. Cote N. Yang S.H. Stewart C.L. Sullivan T. Burghardt A. Majumdar S. Reue K. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 18111-18116Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 60 min with antibody against lamin A (1:200, sc-20680, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing, cells were stained with anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (to visualize DNA). Images were obtained on an Axiovert 200 MOT microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a 63×/1.25 oil immersion objective and processed with Axo-Vision 4.2 software (Zeiss). The number of misshapen nuclei (exhibiting blebs or folds) was scored by three independent observers blinded to genotype. Differences in the percentages of misshapen nuclei between cells with different genotypes were assessed with a χ2 test. Mouse Phenotypes—Body weights of Lmna+/+, LmnaHG/+, and LmnaHG/LCO mice were monitored weekly. Body weight curves for different groups of mice were compared with repeated measures analysis of variance and the log-rank test. For survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed, and the log-rank test was used to compare the survival curves. At the time that each mouse died, the heart and lungs were removed, and the thorax was photographed with a digital camera, and the number of rib fractures was counted. The number of rib fractures in different groups of mice was compared with a two-tailed Student's t test. To determine whether the absence of lamin A synthesis would affect the disease phenotypes elicited by the LmnaHG allele, we compared the phenotypes of LmnaHG/LCO and littermate LmnaHG/+ mice. As expected, the LmnaHG/LCO mice synthesized lamin C and progerin, whereas LmnaHG/+ mice produced lamin A, lamin C, and progerin (Fig. 1). LmnaHG/LCO and LmnaHG/+ mice appeared similar at weaning. By 10-15 weeks of age, however, the body weight curves in LmnaHG/LCO mice were significantly better than those of LmnaHG/+ mice (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2A). These differences were apparent in both males and females (p < 0.0001 for both groups). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that LmnaHG/LCO mice lived longer than LmnaHG/+ mice (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2B). Again, this difference was significant in both males and females (p < 0.0001). Also, the number of rib fractures was lower in LmnaHG/LCO mice than in LmnaHG/+ mice (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2C), despite the fact that the LmnaHG/LCO mice were older at the time of death (27 ± 1.65 weeks versus 23 ± 0.70 weeks in LmnaHG/+ mice). A hallmark of LmnaHG/+ fibroblasts is misshapen cell nuclei. Given the less severe disease phenotypes in LmnaHG/LCO mice, we hypothesized that the frequency of misshapen nuclei in LmnaHG/LCO fibroblasts might be lower than in LmnaHG/+ fibroblasts. To test this possibility, we scored nuclear shape abnormalities in primary embryonic fibroblasts from LmnaHG/LCO (n = 5), LmnaHG/+ (n = 3), LmnaLCO/+ (n = 5), and Lmna+/+ (n = 2) mice (generated from two litters). The frequency of misshapen nuclei (i.e. nuclei with folds or blebs) was lower in LmnaHG/LCO fibroblasts than in LmnaHG/+ fibroblasts (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3, A and B). The number of misshapen nuclei in LmnaLCO/+ mice was somewhat greater than in Lmna+/+ cells (p < 0.001), consistent with results of earlier studies (9Fong L.G. Ng J.K. Lammerding J. Vickers T.A. Meta M. Cote N. Gavino B. Qiao X. Chang S.Y. Young S.R. Yang S.H. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. Bennett C.F. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. J. Clin.

Chem. 2006; 281: 25768-25780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism for the less severe phenotypes in LmnaHG/LCO mice and LmnaHG/LCO fibroblasts, we performed Western blot analyses on mouse fibroblasts and tissues. We reasoned that the less severe phenotypes of LmnaHG/LCO mice and fibroblasts would make sense if the altered composition of the nuclear lamina in LmnaHG/LCO cells (i.e. complete absence of mature lamin A) resulted in a reduced steady-state level of progerin. Indeed, this proved to be the case. Western blots quantified with an Odyssey infrared imaging system revealed that the expression of progerin, relative to actin, was lower in LmnaHG/LCO fibroblasts (n = 8) than in LmnaHG/+ fibroblasts (n = 8) (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4, A and B). The expression of lamin C, relative to actin, tended to be lower in LmnaHG/+ cells than in LmnaHG/LCO cells (p = 0.057). Similarly, the levels of progerin in the heart and skin of LmnaHG/LCO mice, relative to actin, were lower in LmnaHG/LCO mice than in LmnaHG/+ mice (Fig. 4, C-F). The differences in progerin expression levels could not be ascribed to different mRNA levels. Progerin mRNA levels, as judged by quantitative RT-PCR, were not different in LmnaHG/LCO (n = 8) and LmnaHG/+ fibroblasts (n = 8) (Fig. 5, A and C). Also, progerin mRNA levels in the heart and skin of LmnaHG/LCO and LmnaHG/+ mice were virtually identical (Fig. 5, B and C). Previous studies have established, quite unequivocally, that progerin is the culprit molecule in HGPS (22Glynn M.W. Glover T.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2959-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23Goldman R.D. Shumaker D.K. Erdos M.R. Eriksson M. Goldman A.E. Gordon L.B. Gruenbaum Y. Khuon S. Mendez M. Varga R.

Med. 2005; 11: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Higher levels of progerin produce more severe nuclear shape abnormalities than lower levels of progerin (22Glynn M.W. Glover T.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2959-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23Goldman R.D. Shumaker D.K. Erdos M.R. Eriksson M. Goldman A.E. Gordon L.B. Gruenbaum Y. Khuon S. Mendez M. Varga R. Collins F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8963-8968Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Also, LMNA mutations that yield particularly high levels of progerin result in particularly severe forms of progeria (14Moulson C.L. Fong L.G. Gardner J.M. Farber E.A. Go G. Passariello A. Grange D.K. Young S.G. Miner J.H. Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study, we studied an entirely new issue, whether changes in the composition of the nuclear lamina might modulate the phenotypes associated with the synthesis of a fixed amount of progerin. To explore this issue, we compared disease phenotypes in LmnaHG/+ and LmnaHG/LCO mice. The wild-type allele in LmnaHG/+ mice produces both lamin A and lamin C, whereas the LmnaLCO allele in LmnaHG/LCO mice produces exclusively lamin C (9Fong L.G. Ng J.K. Lammerding J. Vickers T.A. Meta M. Cote N. Gavino B. Qiao X. Chang S.Y. Young S.R. Yang S.H. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. Bennett C.F. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The disease phenotypes in LmnaHG/LCO mice were milder than those in LmnaHG/+ mice; the LmnaHG/LCO mice exhibited significantly improved body weight curves, improved survival, and fewer rib fractures. In addition, LmnaHG/LCO fibroblasts had fewer misshapen nuclei. The differences between LmnaHG/LCO and LmnaHG/+ mice were reproducible and highly significant, but the mechanism was not immediately obvious. However, we reasoned that the most parsimonious explanation for these phenotypic differences would be altered steady-state levels of progerin. Indeed, this was the case; progerin levels in LmnaHG/LCO fibroblasts and tissues were significantly lower than those in LmnaHG/+ mice. Thus, changing the protein composition of the nuclear lamina, by replacing a wild-type Lmna allele with a lamin C-only allele, lowered steady-state levels of progerin and reduced disease phenotypes elicited by the LmnaHG allele. We gained insight into the probable mechanisms for the reduced steady-state levels of progerin in LmnaHG/LCO mice. The quantitative RT-PCR experiments revealed equal amounts of progerin transcripts in LmnaHG/+ and LmnaHG/LCO cells and tissues, so the reduced levels of progerin protein in LmnaHG/LCO cells and tissues cannot be ascribed to changes in progerin transcript levels. It is a formal possibility that the lower progerin levels in LmnaHG/LCO cells and tissues are because of reduced translation of the LmnaHG transcript. However, we believe that it is more likely that the altered composition of the nuclear lamina in LmnaHG/LCO cells and tissues (i.e. a complete absence of mature lamin A) is responsible for the alterations in progerin levels. We suspect that the cellular machinery responsible for the turnover of progerin could be more efficient when that protein is surrounded by lamin C than when it is surrounded by a mixture of lamin A and lamin C. Part of this may relate to the abilities of lamin A, lamin C, and progerin to interact with each other. More than 15 years after a molecular understanding of lamin A and lamin C biogenesis (4Lin F. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16321-16326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no one has conclusively determined whether lamins A and C form heterodimers in the cell or exist solely in homodimers. Recently, however, Delbarre et al. (17Delbarre E. Tramier M. Coppey-Moisan M. Gaillard C. Courvalin J.C. Buendia B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) examined the polymerization of green fluorescent protein-tagged and red fluorescent protein-tagged wild-type and mutated lamins in the nuclear envelope by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer. They concluded that both wild-type lamin A and lamin B1 form homopolymers that interact further in the nuclear lamina. In contrast, their studies suggested that progerin co-assembles with both lamin B1 and lamin A to form a heteropolymer, so that the usual segregation of A-type and B-type lamins is lost (17Delbarre E. Tramier M. Coppey-Moisan M. Gaillard C. Courvalin J.C. Buendia B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Assuming that these fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies with green fluorescent protein-tagged and red fluorescent protein-tagged lamins accurately portray the ability of native untagged progerin to interact with other lamin proteins, it is not at all farfetched to imagine that changes in the composition of the lamina could influence the steady-state levels of progerin in the cell. The phenotypic differences between LmnaHG/+ and LmnaHG/LCO mice were unequivocal and highly significant, but we emphasize that the reduction in disease phenotypes in LmnaHG/LCO mice was only partial. The LmnaHG/LCO mice still had markedly abnormal body weight curves, still developed spontaneous bone fractures, and still died prematurely. A similar situation was observed in LmnaHG/+ mice that had been treated with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor. Treatment of LmnaHG/+ mice with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor significantly improved disease phenotypes but that treatment fell far short of a complete cure (15Yang S.H. Bergo M.O. Toth J.I.

This study shows that the absence of mature lamin A affects steady-state progerin levels and progerin-induced disease phenotypes. These studies lay the foundation for a new concept that compositional changes in the nuclear lamina have secondary effects on progerin levels and progeria disease phenotypes. This concept can now be explored in more detail. For example, it would be intriguing to determine whether transgenic overexpression of lamins A and C (27Varga R. Eriksson M. Erdos M.R. Olive M. Harten I. Kolodgie F. Capell B.C. Cheng J. Faddah D. Perkins S. Avallone H. San H. Qu X. Ganesh S. Gordon L.B. Virmani R. Wight T.N. Nabel E.G. Collins F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similarly, it would be interesting to determine whether a lamin B1 knock-out allele (28Vergnes L. Peterfy M. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Reue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10428-10433Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) would influence the severity of progeria. Ultimately, these genetic studies could yield clues regarding the functional relevance of different lamin proteins in the pathogenesis of progeria."

Mutations that decrease DNA binding by UL42 decrease long chain DNA synthesis by the polymerase. The crystal structure of UL42 bound to the C terminus of UL30 revealed an extensive positively charged surface (“back face”). We tested two hypotheses, 1) the C terminus of UL30 affects DNA binding and 2) the positively charged back face mediates DNA binding. Addressing the first hypothesis, we found that the presence of a peptide corresponding to the UL30 C terminus did not result in altered binding of UL42 to DNA. Addressing the second hypothesis, previous work showed that substitution of four conserved arginine residues on the basic face with alanines resulted in decreased DNA affinity. We tested the affinities for DNA and the stimulation of long chain DNA synthesis of mutants in which the four conserved arginine residues were substituted individually or together with lysines and also a mutant in which a conserved glutamine residue was substituted with an arginine to increase positive charge on the back face. We also engineered cysteines onto this surface to permit disulfide cross-linking studies. Last, we assayed the effects of ionic strength on DNA binding by UL42 to estimate the number of ions released upon binding. Our results taken together strongly suggest that the basic back face of UL42 contacts DNA and that positive charge on this surface is important for this interaction.

These ring shaped proteins, also known as “sliding clamps,” cannot bind DNA on their own and require protein complexes called clamp loaders to be loaded onto DNA as toroidal homomultimers in an ATP-dependent manner (6Jeruzalmi D.

In contrast to sliding clamps, UL42 binds DNA directly as a monomer with nanomolar affinity and does not require ATP hydrolysis or accessory proteins for binding (10Gottlieb J. Marcy A.I. Coen D.M. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5976-5987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4937-4945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Weisshart K. Chow C.S.

Even though UL42 binds DNA tightly, it is able to diffuse on DNA and does not impede UL30 elongation (18Weisshart K. Chow C.S. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 55-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Randell J.C. Coen D.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 911-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of UL42 has been solved in complex with the C-terminal 36 residues of UL30 (21Zuccola H.J. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 267-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The structural fold of UL42 is remarkably similar to that of a monomer of PCNA even though these two proteins have no obvious sequence homology (21Zuccola H.J. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 267-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 22Appleton B.A. Loregian A. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The structure of UL42 reveals a basic surface on the side opposite the UL30 binding site (back face). Substitution of any of four conserved arginine residues on this face with alanines results in decreased DNA binding affinity (23Randell J.C. Komazin G. Jiang C. Hwang C.B. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12025-12034Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These alanine substitution mutants and other mutants that decrease DNA binding affinity of UL42 also decrease long chain DNA synthesis of UL30/UL42 even though these mutants retain wild-type affinity for the C-terminal 36 residues of UL30, suggesting that DNA binding by UL42 is important for processive DNA synthesis (23Randell J.C. Komazin G. Jiang C. Hwang C.B. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12025-12034Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Chow C.S. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6965-6971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings, however, did not address whether the importance of the arginine residues for DNA binding is due to their basic charge, whether the basic surface contacts DNA, and, if it does, how many charge-charge interactions are involved in binding. Addressing these issues should aid understanding of how this processivity factor can bind DNA tightly yet diffuse on DNA. Another mechanism by which processivity factors could modulate their interaction with DNA is by undergoing a conformational change upon binding to interacting proteins. Indeed, it has been proposed that the interaction of UL42 with UL30 leads to a conformational change that results in increased affinity of the polymerase for DNA (25Chaudhuri M. Parris D.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10270-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have previously found that the affinity for DNA of UL44, a subunit of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA polymerase, increases when it interacts with the C terminus of its cognate catalytic subunit, UL54 (26Appleton B.A. Brooks J. Loregian A. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5224-5232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This increased affinity correlates with differences between the crystal structures of unliganded UL44 and UL44 in complex with a peptide from the C terminus of UL54 (22Appleton B.A. Loregian A. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Appleton B.A. Brooks J. Loregian A. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5224-5232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In both structures UL44 forms a head-to-head homodimer in the shape of a C clamp. In the peptide bound structure, however, the C-shaped clamp is more open (26Appleton B.A. Brooks J. Loregian A. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5224-5232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting a conformational change that increases affinity for DNA. We, therefore, wished to investigate whether the peptide corresponding to the C terminus of UL30 is able to alter the affinity of UL42 for DNA. To investigate these questions, we used a combination of biochemical, mutational, and cross-linking approaches. Although we found no support for the notion that the C terminus of UL30 affects DNA binding by UL42, our data strongly suggest that UL42 interacts with DNA via its basic back face and further suggests that positive charge on this surface participates in this interaction. Plasmids—The pMBP-PP-UL42ΔC340 and MBP-PP-UL42ΔC320 plasmids, which express the N-terminal 340 and 320 residues of UL42, respectively, with a maltose-binding protein (MBP) at the N terminus and a PreScission Protease site in between MBP and UL42 were described previously (21Zuccola H.J. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 267-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Randell J.C. Komazin G. Jiang C. Hwang C.B. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12025-12034Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These proteins retain the biochemical and biological activities of full-length UL42 (27Bridges K.G. Chow C.S. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4990-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Digard P. Chow C.S. Pirrit L. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and will be referred to as wild type below. The MBP-PP-UL42ΔC320 plasmid was used as a starting point to construct plasmids expressing the R51C and R182C mutant proteins. All other plasmids expressing mutant proteins used in this study were constructed from pMBP-PP-UL42ΔC340. Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's directions. Primer sequences used to create these mutants are listed in supplemental Table 1. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation(s) and the absence of undesired mutations. Proteins and Peptides—Wild-type and mutant UL42 proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (23Randell J.C. Komazin G. Jiang C. Hwang C.B. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12025-12034Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, all UL42 proteins were expressed at room temperature for 3–5 h in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen). They were purified first on amylose resin (New England Biolabs) followed by a heparin HiTrap column (GE Healthcare). The proteins were eluted from heparin columns using a 50 mm–1 m rather than a 10–500 mm NaCl gradient. The wild-type, R51C, and R182C UL42ΔC320 proteins were cleaved with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) to remove the MBP tag before being purified on heparin column. The 36-residue UL30 peptide and the corresponding Oregon-Green-labeled peptide were synthesized at the Biopolymers Facility of the Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology (Harvard Medical School). Concentrations of proteins and peptides were determined by amino acid analysis at the Molecular Biology Core Facility at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. DNA Binding Assays—Filter binding assays to compare DNA binding by wild-type UL42 in the absence or presence of 50 μm peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 36 residues of UL30 or to compare DNA binding by wild-type and mutant UL42 proteins were performed as previously described (18Weisshart K. Chow C.S. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 55-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 fmol of radiolabeled ∼100-bp DNA was incubated with increasing concentrations of either wild-type or mutant UL42. To separate protein-bound DNA from free DNA, samples were passed through nitrocellulose and DE81 filters. Filters were then washed and dried, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Because the concentration of DNA was much less than the observed Kd values, the apparent Kd values could be determined by a saturation isotherm analysis in which the data were fit to the equation Fraction DNA bound = [UL42]/(Kd + [UL42]). Best fit plots are presented in the figures. Filter binding assays to measure the affinity of UL42 for DNA in different ionic environments were performed as previously described for HCMV UL44 (29Loregian A. Sinigalia E. Mercorelli B. Palu G. Coen D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4779-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), except that a 30-bp DNA was used. Calculations of charge-charge interactions were performed using the analyses developed by Record and co-workers (30deHaseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4783-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 31Record Jr., M.T. Anderson C.F. Lohman T.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 103-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, 32Record Jr., M.T. Lohman T.M. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) as previously described (29Loregian A. Sinigalia E. Mercorelli B. Palu G. Coen D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4779-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, according to these analyses, when a ligand with Z-positive charges in its DNA-binding site binds to a nucleic acid, Z phosphates are effectively neutralized, releasing the counterions that were previously associated with the phosphates into solution along with ions involved in long-range screening interactions. The theory predicts that in the presence of a monovalent salt MX, the amount of counterion release can be determined from the formula dlog Kobs/dlog[M+] = –Zψ, where ψ is a constant (0.88 for duplex B-form DNA), and Kobs is calculated as 1/observed Kd. This permits determination of Z from the dependence of log Kobs on log[M+]. To help assess whether anion release meaningfully contributes to the salt effects observed, one can assess the effect of a different monovalent salt and also the effect of a divalent cation such as Mg2+ on binding. In this latter case, dlog Kobs/dlog[M2+] = –Zφ, where φ = 0.47 for B-form DNA. In the absence of meaningful anion effects, when the same anion is used, then dlog Kobs/dlog[M2+] = (φ/ψ)dlog Kobs/dlog[M+] should hold, i.e. the ratio of the slopes should be 0.53. Measurements of Binding of UL42 to the C Terminus of UL30—The interactions between wild-type or mutant UL42 proteins and a 36-residue peptide corresponding to the C terminus of UL30 were measured either by isothermal titration calorimetry or by fluorescence polarization (FP), which yield similar affinities for the wild-type UL42-UL30 peptide interaction (27Bridges K.G. Chow C.S. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4990-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 33Pilger B.D. Cui C. Coen D.M. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed as described previously (27Bridges K.G. Chow C.S. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4990-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Concentrations of UL42 proteins were 2–20 μm, and the concentration of the 36-residue UL30 peptide ranged between 146 and 218 μm. FP assays were performed as described previously with minor modifications (33Pilger B.D. Cui C. Coen D.M. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 nm of Oregon Green-labeled 36-residue UL30 peptide was added to increasing concentrations of wild-type or mutant UL42 protein in 96-well plates in a total volume of 80 μl per well. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the FP values were determined by using an Analyst plate reader (LJL Biosystems) at the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology-Longwood Screening Facility (Harvard Medical School). Assays of UL42-mediated Long Chain DNA Synthesis—DNA polymerase assays were performed as described previously (23Randell J.C. Komazin G. Jiang C. Hwang C.B. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12025-12034Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Chow C.S. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6965-6971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a poly(dA)/oligo(dT) primer-template, radiolabeled dTTP, 200 fmol of UL30, and either 800 or 1200 fmol of UL42. Reaction products were analyzed on alkaline agarose gels that were exposed to a PhosphorImager. UL42-DNA Cross-linking—The thiol-tethered oligonucleotide (5′-taccgcagccatcagagt-3′) was synthesized using the method previously described (34Banerjee A. Santos W.L. Verdine G.L. Science. 2006; 311: 1153-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The thiol tether was attached to the backbone phosphate between bases 11 and 12. The unmodified oligonucleotide and its complementary strand were purchased polyacrylamide gel-purified from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Double-stranded DNA was formed by mixing the two complementary oligonucleotides 1:1 in a buffer containing 25 mm NaCl and 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The mixture was heated to 85 °C and then cooled slowly to room temperature. Cross-linking reactions were performed by mixing either wild-type or mutant UL42 proteins (1 μm) with either unmodified or thiol-tethered double-stranded DNA (2 μm) in 15 μl of reaction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mm NaCl, and 10 μm dithiothreitol (DTT)) for 1 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of 2 mm DTT. The reactions were stopped by capping the free thiol groups with S-methyl methane thiosulfate (40 mm). The quenched reaction mixtures were analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions. The gel was stained using SimplyBlue™ Safe Stain (Invitrogen) overnight and destained in water. Lack of Effect of UL30 C Terminus on UL42 Binding to DNA—We wished to investigate whether the presence of the UL30 C terminus, which interacts with UL42 (13Digard P. Bebrin W.R. Weisshart K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 398-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Zuccola H.J. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 267-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Bridges K.G. Chow C.S. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4990-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), alters the affinity of UL42 for DNA, as previously seen for HCMV UL44 and the C terminus of its catalytic subunit, UL54 (26Appleton B.A. Brooks J. Loregian A. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5224-5232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To address this question we performed filter binding assays in the presence or absence of an excess of a 36-residue peptide that corresponds to the C terminus of UL30 and is sufficient to bind to UL42 (21Zuccola H.J. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 267-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Bridges K.G. Chow C.S. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4990-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We added increasing amounts of protein to 1 fmol of 5′-end labeled 102-bp DNA and measured the fraction of bound DNA, which was plotted against protein concentration (Fig. 1). The plots were very similar in the presence or absence of the UL30 peptide, providing no evidence for a change in affinity of UL42 for DNA upon binding of the UL30 C terminus. We, therefore, conducted all subsequent assays in the absence of this peptide. Effects of UL42 Back Face Arginine to Lysine Substitutions on Binding to DNA—The crystal structure of UL42 reveals a positively charged back face (face opposite to that which binds UL30) with four arginines (Arg-113, Arg-182, Arg-279, Arg-280) that are conserved among alphaherpesviral homologues of UL42 (Fig. 2). A previous study by Randell et al. (23Randell J.C. Komazin G. Jiang C. Hwang C.B. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12025-12034Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) had shown that substitution of any of these four arginines with alanine residues resulted in decreased affinity of UL42 for DNA with an even greater reduction in DNA binding observed when all four of the arginines were substituted with alanines. To test whether the positive charge of the arginines was the feature important for DNA binding, we substituted each of the arginine residues with lysines, individually or together. We then measured the affinities of the mutant proteins for double-stranded DNA using a filter binding assay. Because the assay was performed under conditions where the DNA concentration was very low, we could use saturation isotherm analysis to calculate the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) from the concentration of the protein that led to half saturation. The Kd values are apparent rather than absolute because for any length of DNA longer than the binding site for UL42, there are multiple potential binding sites. Most single mutants exhibited apparent Kd values for DNA similar to that of the wild-type UL42 protein (Fig. 3, Table 1). The R113K mutant showed an ∼3-fold increase in apparent Kd for DNA compared with the wild-type protein. However, this increase was small in comparison to the more than 25-fold increase in apparent Kd of the R113A mutant, measured in parallel using a filter binding assay (Fig. 3, Table 1), and the 22-fold increase for the R113A mutant found previously using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (23Randell J.C. Komazin G. Jiang C. Hwang C.B. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12025-12034Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The mutant that had all four arginines substituted with lysines also showed little or no decrease in affinity for DNA when compared with wild-type UL42 (Fig. 3, Table 1). All of these mutants retained wild-type affinity for the C-terminal 36 residues of polymerase as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry, indicating that they were properly folded (Table 1). These results combined with those from Randell et al. (23Randell J.C. Komazin G. Jiang C. Hwang C.B. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12025-12034Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) suggest that it is the positive charge of the arginines on the back face of UL42 that is important for DNA binding.FIGURE 3Arginine to lysine substitutions have little effect on DNA binding.

Open table in a new tab A UL42 Mutant That Binds DNA with Higher Affinity—To investigate further the role of the back face of UL42 in DNA binding, we asked whether the affinity of UL42 for DNA could be increased by increasing the amount of positive charge on this surface of UL42. UL42 contains a glutamine residue on the back face that is conserved among alphaherpesvirus homologues (Fig. 2). We engineered a mutant of UL42 in which this glutamine was substituted with an arginine residue (Q282R). When compared side-by-side with wild-type UL42 in the filter binding assay (Fig. 4A), this mutant exhibited an ∼4-fold increase in affinity for DNA (apparent Kd for mutant, 0.68 ± 0.1 nm; apparent Kd for wild type, 2.4 ± 0.4 nm). This mutant retained wild-type affinity for the C-terminal 36 residues of polymerase as measured using an FP assay (Fig. 4B), indicating that the Q282R mutation has a specific effect on DNA binding. These data further support our hypothesis that the back face of UL42 mediates DNA binding. The Substitutions Exert Modest Effects at Most on Long Chain DNA Synthesis by UL30/UL42—We have previously observed that single arginine to alanine substitutions on the back face of UL42 reduced long chain DNA synthesis by the UL30/UL42 complex (23Randell J.C. Komazin G. Jiang C. Hwang C.B. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12025-12034Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We tested each of the substitution mutants constructed here for their ability to stimulate long chain DNA synthesis by UL30, which is a measure of holoenzyme processivity. The assay used measures the incorporation of radionucleotides on an oligo(dT)-primed poly(dA) template and analysis on alkaline-agarose gels. As previously observed (e.g. Ref. 23Randell J.C. Komazin G. Jiang C. Hwang C.B. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12025-12034Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in the absence of UL42, only short products were faintly detected (Fig. 5), and no products could be observed using wild-type UL42 alone. All of the UL42 arginine to lysine substitution mutants stimulated long chain DNA synthesis, although two of the single substitutions (R113K and R280K) and the quadruple substitution resulted in somewhat decreased incorporation and slightly shorter products (Fig. 5). The Q282R substitution that results in higher affinity binding to DNA also resulted in slightly less incorporation and shorter products. In contrast, an arginine to alanine substitution mutant (R280A) was much more defective for stimulation of long chain DNA synthesis in these assays, resulting in much less incorporation and only short products. Thus, the lysine and Q282R substitutions, as expected from their modest effects on DNA binding, exerted, at most, modest effects on long chain DNA synthesis. Disulfide Cross-linking of UL42 to a Thiol-modified DNA—Our mutational analysis indicated that positive charge on the back face of UL42 is important for DNA binding, but it did not necessarily show that this surface of UL42 directly contacts DNA. We, therefore, used a disulfide cross-linking strategy to covalently trap UL42 bound to DNA. We synthesized an 18-bp DNA molecule that has a single thiol tether (34Banerjee A. Santos W.L.

https://openalex.org/W2130053482,"The formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis) and of lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) actively contributes to cancer progression and inflammation. Thus, there has been a quest for identifying the molecular mechanisms that control lymphatic and blood vessel formation and function. Membrane and extracellular matrix proteins can serve as suitable targets for imaging and/or therapeutic targeting; however, conventional proteomic technologies often fail to identify them systematically due to insolubility in water and low abundance of membrane proteins. To circumvent this problem, we applied a gel-free proteomics methodology termed two-dimensional peptide mapping (2D-PM) to cultured blood vascular (BECs) and lymphatic (LECs) endothelial cells. 2D-PM comprises biotinylation of surface-accessible proteins, their selective enrichment, separation by HPLC, and analysis by mass spectrometry. We identified 184 proteins that were specifically or predominantly expressed by LECs and 185 proteins specifically expressed by BECs, whereas 377 additional proteins were equally detected in both cell types. For representative proteins, the differential, lineage-specific expression was confirmed by Western analyses of cultured cells and by differential immunofluorescence analyses of tissue samples. Our results identify the surface-accessible, vascular lineage-specific proteome, and they also reveal 2D-PM as a powerful technology for the large-scale screening of lineage-specific protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W1991790666,"The localization and density of Kir2.3 channels are influenced by the balance between PDZ protein interaction at the cell surface and routing into the endocytic pathway. Here, we explore mechanisms by which the Kir2.3 channel is directed into the endocytic pathway. We found that Kir2.3 channels are constitutively internalized from the cell surface in a dynamin-dependent manner, indicative of vesicle-mediated endocytosis. The rate of Kir2.3 endocytosis was dramatically attenuated following RNA interference-mediated knockdown of either α adaptin (AP-2 clathrin adaptor) or clathrin heavy chain, revealing that Kir2.3 is internalized by an AP-2 clathrin-dependent mechanism. Structure-rationalized mutagenesis studies of a number of different potential AP-2 interaction motifs indicate that internalization of Kir2.3 is largely dependent on a non-canonical di-isoleucine motif (II413) embedded within the C terminus. Internalization assays using CD4-Kir2.3 chimeras demonstrate that the di-isoleucine signal acts in an autonomous and transplantable manner. Kir2.3 co-immunoprecipitates with α adaptin, and disruption of the di-isoleucine motif decreased interaction of the channel with AP-2. Replacement of the di-isoleucine motif with a canonical di-leucine internalization signal actually blocked Kir2.3 endocytosis. Moreover, in yeast three-hybrid studies, the Kir2.3 di-isoleucine motif does not bind the AP-2 αC-σ2 hemicomplex in the way that has been recently observed for canonical di-leucine signals.

Haass F.A. Jan L.Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has become evident that physiological activity of Kir channels is not simply controlled by gating mechanisms (2Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) but also strongly influenced by surprisingly complex intracellular trafficking processes (3Ma D. Jan L.Y. Curr. Opin.

Individually tailored for specific physiological demands, different members of the Kir family are thought to contain unique repertoires of trafficking signals, directing traffic in the biosynthetic pathway as well as between the endosomal compartments and plasma membrane.

Routing into the endocytic pathway can, in fact, influence the subcellular localization and surface density of Kir channels. Consider, for example, the polarized targeting of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.3, important for regulation of kaliuresis and potassium homeostasis (12Millar I.D. Taylor H.C. Cooper G.J. Kibble J.D. Robson L. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 211: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 13Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar). Present evidence indicates that a hierarchy of trafficking processes, coordinated by several distinct signals, controls the number and location of Kir2.3 channels at the basolateral membrane. One signal at the C terminus of Kir2.3 directs the channel to the basolateral membrane in the biosynthetic pathway (14Le Maout S. Welling P.A. Brejon M. Olsen O. Merot J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10475-10480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), preventing apical missorting. Another signal, an adjacent PDZ interaction motif (15Olsen O. Liu H. Wade J.B. Merot J. Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C183-C195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), offers a different localization mechanism. By facilitating Kir2.3 interaction with Lin-7, a component of an evolutionary conserved PDZ scaffolding complex at the basolateral membrane, the PDZ binding motif effectively retains the channel at the polarized locale (15Olsen O. Liu H. Wade J.B. Merot J. Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C183-C195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Alewine C. Kim B.Y. Hegde V. Welling P.A. Am. J.

Cell. 2006; 17: 4200-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In fact, mutation of the PDZ motif or expression of TIP-1, a negative regulator of the PDZ complex, disrupts Kir2.3 interaction with the Lin-7 scaffold and causes a dramatic shift in the localization of the channel from the basolateral membrane to an endosomal compartment (15Olsen O. Liu H. Wade J.B. Merot J. Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C183-C195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Alewine C. Olsen O. Wade J.B. Welling P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4200-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, the polarized localization and surface density of Kir2.3 is not simply dependent on sorting in the biosynthetic pathway but is also controlled by the balance between PDZ scaffolding protein interaction and internalization from the basolateral membrane. The cytoplasmic Kir2.3 C terminus contains several sites that resemble clathrin-dependent trafficking signals, raising the possibility that Kir2.3 channels may be endocytosed by a clathrin-mediated process. Typically recognized by canonical tyrosine-based sequences (“YXXΦ”or“NPXY,” where X represents any amino acid and Φ represents bulky hydrophobic amino acids) or di-leucine-containing structures ((D/E)XXXL(L/I)), these degenerate trafficking signals serve as binding sites for the different heterotetrameric clathrin-adaptor complexes (AP1–4) (18Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 19Edeling M.A. Smith C. Owen D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although the AP complexes generally engage clathrin and simultaneously mark interacting proteins as cargo for incorporation into clathrin-coated vesicles, each AP subtype differently controls the routing and destination of vesicular cargo. Endocytosis from the plasma membrane is mediated by AP-2 (20Rappoport J.Z. Benmerah A. Simon S.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Rappoport J.Z. Kemal S.

The other clathrin-adaptor complexes coordinate delivery of proteins from the trans-Golgi to endosomal-lysosomal system (AP-1A) (23Nakatsu F. Ohno H. Cell Struct.

The precise mechanisms controlling specificity of cargo interactions with appropriate AP subtypes are still not well understood but are likely to be governed by subtype-specific requirements for distinct phosphatidylinositol lipids at donor membranes (28Cremona O.

In addition, the type of internalization motif (i.e. tyrosine- or di-leucine-based) present on a particular protein can have functional consequences for trafficking (38Coleman S.H. Van Damme N. Day J.R. Noviello C.M. Hitchin D. Madrid R. Benichou S. Guatelli J.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2066-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our effort to elucidate the mechanism by which Kir2.3 is controlled by endocytosis expands the repertoire of signals known to interact with AP complexes. In the present study, we found Kir2.3 channels are targeted for AP-2 clathrin-dependent endocytosis by an unusual di-isoleucine containing motif, sharing resemblance to the canonical di-leucine signals. The discovery of this motif provides reason to suggest that there is a broader spectrum of clathrin-dependent trafficking signals than previously recognized. Antibodies—Antibodies were purchased from commercial suppliers: rabbit anti-Kir2.3 antibody (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel), rat anti-HA 3F10 (Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-adaptin α, mouse anti-clathrin heavy chain, and mouse A.v. monoclonal JL-8 for GFP detection (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rat antibody (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences), and mouse anti-human CD4 Alexa fluor 488 (Caltag-Invitrogen). Molecular Biology—Studies were performed using modified Kir2.3 (14Le Maout S. Welling P.A. Brejon M. Olsen O. Merot J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10475-10480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), containing either an external hemagglutinin (HA) or FLAG epitope tag. The constructs used for the Xenopus oocyte studies were subcloned into the modified pSD64 vector between the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region of the Xenopus β-globin gene to increase expression efficiency (39Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). A polyadenylate sequence is also present in the 3′-untranslated region of this vector (dA23dC30). CD4-Kir2.3 chimeras were constructed using a PCR-based approach and contained the entire extracellular and transmembrane domains of the human CD4 protein. The Kir2.3 C-terminal end (amino acids 340–445) was fused at amino acid 422 of CD4. The control CD4 construct (CD4 stop) was obtained by introducing a stop codon at the fusion site, resulting in truncation of most of the native cytoplasmic C terminus. All constructs used for mammalian expression were subcloned into pcDNA 3.1+ (Invitrogen). Several constructs for the yeast three-hybrid experiments were a generous gift from the Bonifacino laboratory. These include the pBridge plasmid containing wild-type Nef fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain with σ2 inserted in the second multiple cloning site and the pGADT7 containing αC fused to the activation domain. For the DNA binding domain-only negative control, the Nef protein was removed with the EcoRI and SalI restriction enzymes and the ends were blunted and ligated back together. Alternatively, the Nef protein was removed and a PCR-amplified terminal portion of Kir2.3 containing amino acids 398–445 was inserted in the pBridge plasmid. The short fragment of Kir2.3 was preferentially used in the yeast three-hybrid assay, because a longer fragment contained an acidic cluster, which resulted in auto-activation. A PCR-based strategy with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (QuikChange, Stratagene) was employed for site-directed mutagenesis. Dye termination DNA sequencing was used to verify the sequence of all modified cDNAs (University of Maryland School of Medicine Biopolymer Core). cRNA Synthesis—In vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase (mMessage Machine, Ambion Inc.) was used to produce complementary RNA from linearized plasmids containing the desired cDNA. Purification of the cRNA by spin column chromatography (MEGAclear, Ambion Inc.) followed. Yield was determined spectrophotometrically and verified using agarose gel electrophoresis. Oocyte Isolation and Injection—Oocytes from female Xenopus Laevis (Xenopus Express, Homosassa, FL) were isolated and maintained using the standard procedures as described previously (13Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, frogs were anesthetized using 0.15% ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt, and a partial oophorectomy was performed through an abdominal incision. Oocyte aggregates were manually dissected from the ovarian lobes and then incubated in OR-2 medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing collagenase (type 3, Worthington) for 2 h at room temperature to remove the follicular layer. After extensive washing with collagenase-free OR-2, oocytes were stored at 19 °C in OR-3 medium (50% Leibovitz medium, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing penicillin/streptomycin). 12–24 h later, healthy looking Dumont stage V–VI oocytes were pneumatically injected with 50 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water containing 0.25 ng of channel cRNA with or without 1 ng of dynamin cRNA. Oocytes were then stored in OR-3 medium at 19 °C. Electrophysiology—Whole cell currents in Xenopus oocytes were measured using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp as described previously (13Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar, 40Flagg T.P. Tate M. Merot J. Welling P.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were bathed in a 45 mm K+ solution (45 mm KCl, 45 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Voltage-sensing and current-injecting microelectrodes had resistances of 0.5–1.5 MΩ when backfilled with 3 m KCl. Once a stable membrane potential was attained, oocytes were clamped to a holding potential of –20 mV, and currents were recorded during 500-ms voltage steps, ranging from –100 mV to +40 mV in 20-mV increments. Data were collected using an ITC16 analog-to-digital, digital-to-analogue converter (Instrutech Corp.), filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized on-line at 2 kHz using Pulse software (HEKA Electronik) for later analysis. Data shown are based on the average maximum current, measured at –100 mV. Surface Expression—Plasmalemma expression of the external HA-tagged Kir2.3 channel was measured in single oocytes following procedures outlined by Zerangue and colleagues (8Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) with slight modifications as before (41Yoo D. Kim B.Y. Campo C. Nance L. King A. Maouyo D. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23066-23075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In these studies, oocytes were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in OR-2 for 15 min at 4 °C and washed four times in OR-2. To block spurious antibody binding, oocytes were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in OR-2 containing 1% m bovine serum albumin (BSA). Exposed HA epitopes on the surface of intact oocytes were labeled with a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (0.5 μg/ml, Roche 3F10, 1% BSA, 4 °C, overnight), and then oocytes were washed with OR-2 containing 1% BSA, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rat (1 μg/ml, Jackson Laboratories, 1% BSA, 1.5 h). Cells were washed for 1 h with OR-2 containing 1% BSA and again for 10 min in OR-2 medium without BSA. Individual oocytes were placed in 50 μl of Enhanced Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce) and incubated for 7 min at room temperature. Luminescence from single oocytes was measured for 10 s in a Sirius luminometer and reported as relative light units (RLUs) per second. Oocyte Membrane Protein Purification—Oocytes were processed following the protocol described by Kamsteeg and Deen (42Kamsteeg E.J. Deen P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to isolate total membrane proteins. In brief, oocytes were washed twice in homogenization buffer (80 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) and then broken by trituration with a 25-gauge syringe. To pellet yolk proteins and nuclei, homogenates were spun twice at low speed (100 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were then spun at high speed (16,100 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C to collect the total membrane fraction. Pellets were washed once in the homogenization buffer and spun at top speed again for 15 min and then placed in solubilization buffer (4% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, containing the protease inhibitors) and rocked at room temperature for 15 min. Particulate material was pelleted (16,100 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and the solubilized proteins in the supernatant were resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Oocyte Surface Biotinylation Assay—The extracellular FLAG (DYKDDDDK)-tagged Kir2.3 channel was utilized for all biotinylation experiments. The lysine residues in the external epitope tag provide free amino-group substrates for biotinylation. Oocytes were washed with OR-2 and then incubated with 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in OR-2 for 40 min. Free biotin reagent was quenched with OR-2 containing 50 mm Tris for 10 min. Oocytes were then washed three times with OR-2, and the membranes were purified as described. Protein concentrations were determined, and 100 μg of sample was added to 50 μl of prewashed NeutrAvidin-agarose beads (Pierce), and the volume was brought up to 325 μl using homogenization buffer. Samples were then rotated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were centrifuged at high speed (16,100 × g) for 5 min and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Biotinylated protein was eluted from the beads at room temperature with 3× SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol (1-h incubation). A Bio-Rad dot blot apparatus facilitated precise sample migration into nitrocellulose membrane using gravity. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Stable Cell Line Generation—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells (ATCC) or COS-7 (ATCC) cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and then grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine. For stable cell lines, HEK 293 cells were plated at ∼75% confluence in 6-well dishes. Cells were transfected with 6 μg of recombinant pcDNA3.1+ plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfection medium was replaced with growth medium 5 h after transfection. Cells were detached 24 h after transfection with citric saline and plated at a low density in 100-mm Petri dishes. Selection medium containing 600 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) was added 48 h post transfection. Control HEK cell clones were produced by transfecting cells with the pcDNA3.1+ plasmid alone. COS-7 cells were transfected with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). Cell Lysis—HEK 293 cells were washed once in Ringer's solution, harvested in HEENG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol), and resuspended in HEENG containing 1% Triton and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were resuspended by pipetting, incubated on ice for 45 min, and centrifuged at max speed to pellet insoluble material. Protein concentrations were assessed by Bradford Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad). Biotinylation Internalization Assay—Cells were washed with ice-cold Ringer's solution (5 mm HEPES, 144 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4), and the surface proteins were biotinylated using EZ-link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (0.3 mg/ml, Pierce) in Ringer's solution at 5 °C for 45 min. Remaining biotin was quenched with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, in Ringer's solution for 20 min at 5 °C. Cells were then placed at room temperature for the indicated amount of time (0–15 min) to allow internalization. The membrane-impermeant reducing agent MesNa (100 mm MesNa, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% BSA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8) was added three times for 20 min at 4 °C to cleave biotin linked to the cell surface. Cells were then washed four times with Ringer's solution and lysed. 15 μg of total protein was added to NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) in a solution containing phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% SDS and rotated overnight at 5 °C. Beads were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% SDS, and biotinylated protein was eluted from the beads with 3× SDS sample buffer (1 h at room temperature). A Bio-Rad dot blot apparatus facilitated precise sample migration into nitrocellulose membrane using gravity. Internalization Rate Calculations—The amount of MesNa-resistant channel was quantified by densitometry for each time point and normalized to the total surface pool of channel. Internalization rates were then calculated using best fit linear regression for each experiment, and statistics were performed by comparing the rates of individual experiments. In preliminary studies, endocytic rates calculated with values measured every 3 min over a 15-min time course yielded identical results as those measured from three time points (0, 5, and 15 min). Therefore, the 0-, 5-, and 15-min time points were examined for the majority of the experiments to reduce the required number of samples. Biotinylation Recycling Assay—Cell surface was biotinylated and quenched as above, then cells were placed at room temperature for 30 min to allow surface-biotinylated channels to internalize. Cells were subjected to MesNa treatment (4 °C) as above to strip biotin from proteins remaining at the cell surface, resulting in a biotin-labeled internalized pool of channel. The cells were returned to room temperature again for variable amounts of time to permit recycling to the cell surface in either Ringer's medium (no MesNa control groups to correct for degradation) or MesNa solution (to measure recycling). The MesNa-treated samples were placed in additional MesNa solution at 4 °C (two times, 20 min each) to ensure complete removal of biotin from channel that returned to the cell surface. The cells were then washed again four times with Ringer's solution and lysed. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were precleared with Protein-G Plus Protein-A-agarose beads (Calbiochem) for 2 h at room temperature. The supernatants were then rotated overnight with the appropriate antibodies and new Protein-G Plus Protein-A beads. Beads were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and then eluted for 30 min at room temperature with SDS sample buffer. Eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (0.1%) (TBS-T) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk containing primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, washed in TBS-T for 10 min, incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk containing a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and then washed extensively for 20 min in TBS-T. Bound antibodies were then revealed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce) and fluorography (HyBlot CL, Denville). Increased levels of Kir2.3 II413AA protein expression relative to wild-type channel were consistently observed, possibly as a result of slower internalization and degradation. Consequently, we transfected less Kir2.3 II413AA DNA to achieve approximately equal expression of wild-type and mutant channels relative to total cellular protein. Densitometric measurements were made using Image (National Institutes of Health). siRNA Knockdown—The AP-2 complex and clathrin heavy chain were targeted with sequences previously published (43Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The α subunit of the AP-2 complex target sequence was NNGAGCAUGUGCACGCUGGCCA, and the clathrin heavy chain target sequence was NNUCCAAUUCGAAGACCAAUU. siRNAs were synthesized as option A4 (2′-deprotected, duplexed, and desalted) by Dharmacon, Inc. Scrambled siRNA was used for controls (AllStars Negative Control siRNA, Qiagen). Cells were transfected with 50 nm final concentration of siRNA using TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus) and analyzed 72 h after transfection. Chimera Internalization Assay—48 h following transfection with DNA encoding the CD4-Kir2.3 chimeras, COS-7 (ATCC) cells were washed with low glucose DMEM and labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-CD4 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Excess antibody was removed by washing w"

Lengsin has no GS activity, suggesting that it has a structural rather than catalytic role in lens. In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence showed that lengsin is expressed in terminally differentiating secondary lens fiber cells. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and recombinant protein experiments showed that full-length lengsin can bind the 2B filament region of vimentin. In affinity chromatography, lengsin also bound the equivalent region of CP49 (BFSP2; phakinin), a related intermediate filament protein specific to the lens. Both the vimentin and CP49 2B fragments bound lengsin in surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy with fast association and slow dissociation kinetics. Lengsin expression correlates with a transition zone in maturing lens fiber cells in which cytoskeleton is reorganized. Lengsin and lens intermediate filament proteins co-localize at the plasma membrane in maturing fiber cells. This suggests that lengsin may act as a component of the cytoskeleton itself or as a chaperone for the reorganization of intermediate filament proteins during terminal differentiation in the lens.

The optical properties of the vertebrate eye lens depend upon hierarchies of organization from the cellular to the molecular level. A population of relatively undifferentiated epithelial cells proliferates and elongates under the control of growth factors from other parts of the eye to produce concentric layers of extremely elongated fiber cells (1Piatigorsky J.

As new layers of fiber cells are added, the older cells pack more tightly, forming complex interdigitations between and within layers (4Kuszak J.R. Zoltoski R.K. Sivertson C. Exp.

Wiley Interscience, New York1981: 49-84Google Scholar). In addition, the fiber cells undergo a characteristic terminal differentiation, with some interesting similarities to apoptosis, in which lens nuclei and other organelles are lost, and the cytoskeleton is reorganized (6Wride M.A. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Sandilands A.

At the molecular level, this program involves developmentally and spatially regulated expression of crystallins; to produce the gradients of refractive index necessary to diffract and focus light and to minimize spherical and chromatic aberrations; and of tissue-specific cytoskeletal and membrane proteins that organize the structure and junctions of the epithelial and fiber cells (1Piatigorsky J.

Here we show that lengsin is lens-specific and, furthermore is tightly regulated for expression specifically at the onset of terminal differentiation of secondary lens fiber cells. Furthermore, lengsin is capable of interacting with major intermediate filament proteins of the lens, and its expression correlates with the reorganization of lens fiber cell cytoskeleton. This suggests that lengsin arose from origins in an enzyme superfamily to a highly specialized, highly conserved role in vertebrate lens development and cellular differentiation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNorthern and Western Blots—A mouse multitissue Northern blot was purchased from Seegene (Seoul, Korea). RNA from rat eye tissues was prepared and used to make a Northern blot by standard methods. A full-length pSport1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) cDNA clone for mouse lengsin was selected from an NEI-Bank mouse whole eye library (17Wistow G. Wyatt K. David L. Gao C. Bateman O. Bernstein S.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2276-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 5 μg was linearized at an internal PstI site to and used to generate an antisense RNA probe (∼600 bp) labeled with psoralen biotin using the Ambion Strip EZ Sp6 kit (Ambion, Austin TX). Blots were hybridized at 68 °C overnight; washed for 20 min with low stringency buffer (Ambion) at room temperature, then twice with high stringency buffer at 68 °C for 20 min. Blots were visualized using the Ambion Biodetect kit (CDP star) and exposure to film. Western blots of mouse lens epithelium and fiber cells were performed using rabbit antibody to recombinant mouse lengsin as described previously (15Wyatt K. White H.E. Wang L. Bateman O.A.

The mouse lengsin cDNA in pSport1 was linearized with either Mlu I or NotI to generate ∼2kb sense and antisense probes from Sp6 and T7 promoters. Probes were radiolabeled with 35S, fragmented by mild alkali hydrolysis, and used to hybridize mouse whole eye sections (18Hoover S.B. Sung C. Cottler-Fox M. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Mahler J.F. Maronprot R.R. Sundberg J.P. Frederickson R.M. eds. Pathology of Genetically Engineered Mice.

Orlova E.V. Wistow G. Structure. 2006; 14: 1823-1834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Commercially available antibodies were purchased for vimentin: V9 mouse monoclonal (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), mouse polyclonal 7752 (Abcam, Cambridge UK), chicken polyclonal ab24525 to rat vimentin (Abcam); and for CP49/phakinin: guinea pig polyclonal (03-GP63) to calf phakinin (ARP, Belmont MA) (includes reactivity to filensin).Immunofluorescence Localization—10-μm frozen sections from adult mouse eye were used for immunofluorescence staining. Sections on Superfrost/Plus slides (Daigger, Wheeling, IL) were dried at room temperature, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in ICC buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.3) plus 5% goat serum. Slides were incubated with rabbit anti-lengsin, 1:200 dilution in ICC buffer, plus either chicken anti-vimentin (Abcam, 1:200 dilution) or guinea pig anti-phakinin (American Research Products, 1:50) as primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed with ICC buffer, and incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Invitrogen, 1:300 dilution) plus goat anti-guinea pig Cy3 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, 1:100 dilution) or goat anti-chicken Cy3 antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:200 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with ICC buffer, slides were incubated with DAPI (Invitrogen) 1 μg/ml)) for 10 min, washed, coverslipped, and sealed. Samples were examined under Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Exton, PA). Primary antibodies were omitted from negative control slides.Yeast Two-hybrid—Poly(A)+ RNA from adult C57Bl/6 mouse lenses was used to make a yeast two-hybrid library in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 using the Match Maker System at Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Bait constructs of mouse lengsin were cloned into NdeI and XhoI sites of the pGBKT7 bait vector and transformed into yeast strain Y187. Lengsin expression in yeast transformed with bait clones was determined by Western blot using anti-lengsin and GAL4 DNA-BD monoclonal (Clontech) antibodies. Bait and library yeast were mated overnight at 30 °C according to the manufacturer's protocols. Yeast zygotes were rinsed with 0.5× YPD medium (Clontech), spread onto plates containing 4-DO yeast medium (-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp) (Clontech) and incubated at 30 °C for 3-5 days.Yeast colonies that appeared on 4-DO medium were replated on 4-DO plates, supplemented with 20 μg/ml X-Alpha-Gal (Clontech). The plates were incubated for 12-18 h at 30 °C and checked for the appearance of blue colonies. Blue colonies were inoculated into -Leu 1-DO medium (Clontech) and grown for 1-2 days. Prey plasmid DNA in pGADT7-Rec was isolated using Lyticase (Sigma) 100 units/ml, heat/thaw treatment and Wizard Plus SV Miniprep DNA purification system (Promega, Madison WI) and were then transformed into Escherichia coli XL-2 Blue (Stratagene) and plated on LB/Amp. Purified prey and bait plasmids were tested for self activation by transformation into AH109 and Y187 yeast with either the empty bait vector or empty prey vector, plated on 4-DO medium, and compared with Clontech positive controls following the manufacturer's protocols.Specific prey clones for mouse CP49 and filensin were also prepared by PCR from cDNA clones and cloning into NdeI/XhoI sites of the prey vector pGADT7-Rec. These were introduced into yeast hosts, examined for expression of prey protein by Western blot using Gal4-AD monoclonal antibody (Clontech) and tested for interaction with the lengsin bait construct.Expression, Co-expression, and Purification of Vimentin and Lengsin—Full-length mouse lengsin and the Vim2B fragment of mouse vimentin were cloned separately into pET31b (Novagen, EMD Biosystems San Diego, CA) for individual expression and were also cloned together into pCOLADuet-1 (Novagen) for co-expression in E. coli, BL-21 codon plus RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For lengsin and co-expressed lengsin/Vin 2B, soluble whole cell lysates were dialyzed against 25 mm malonic acid pH 6.0/1 mm DTT then loaded onto an SP-fast flow, 26/60, cationic exchange column (Amersham Biosciences/GE Biosciences, Piscataway NJ) run on an AKTA Explorer 100 (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were eluted using a salt gradient in 25 mm malonic acid, pH 6, 1 mm DTT, 0.3-1 m NaCl. For Vim2B alone, whole cell lysate was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris pH 8.5, 1 mm DTT and separated using a Q-Sepharose, fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences) using a salt gradient of 0-1.0 m NaCl.Co-expressed lengsin and Vim2B, either from E. coli lysate or from ion-exchange purified material, were loaded on a Sephacryl, S-400 column (1 CV = 880 ml, XK 50) (Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mm malonic acid, pH 6.0, 1 mm DTT, and eluted at 0.5 ml/min. The fractions were collected and evaluated using SDS-PAGE, Western blot and Voyager-DE (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in reflector mode.Expression of Recombinant HA-CP492B—The region of mouse CP49 equivalent to the Vim2B filament region was amplified from the pGADT7-Rec construct, incorporating the HA tag from the vector as an NheI/XhoI fragment. The HA-CP492B fragment was then cloned into pET17-b and expressed. The HA-tagged protein was isolated using an HA affinity column (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted using recombinant mouse lengsin and hamster vimentin (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) following the methods of Yabe et al. (19Yabe J.T. Chan W.K. Wang F.S. Pimenta A. Ortiz D.D. Shea T.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 1 mg of soluble protein was incubated in 60 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2% SDS, 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Tween 20 with 1:10 dilution antibodies against vimentin overnight at 4 C with constant mixing. Immobilized IgM (Sigma, A4540) or IgG1 (Sigma A6715) secondary antibody slurries were added to reactions and incubated at room temperature using constant agitation for 3 h. Negative controls were prepared by adding immobilized secondary antibodies in the absence of primary antibodies. The beads were then collected by centrifugation, washed three times with the binding reaction buffer for 5 min using constant agitation. The protein/antibody complex was then eluted by adding 1% SDS, 100 mm DTT, and 50 mm Tris, ph 7.5 heated at 90 C for 5 min. The eluted fractions were then analyzed by Western blot analysis using the ECL Western blotting Analysis System (Amersham Biosciences).Affinity Chromatography—An affinity column for CP492B was produced by binding HA-CP492B to an HA affinity column (Roche Applied Science). Mouse lengsin was applied to the column, washed, and then eluted using HA peptide, following the manufacturer's protocols. Flow-through, wash, and elute fractions were checked by Western blot for both lengsin and HA-CP492B.Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—The interactions of mouse lengsin with Vim2B and Ha-CP492B fragments were analyzed using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore 3000, Biacore). Antibody to lengsin was bound in analysis and reference cells of a CM5 sensor chip, following the manufacturer's protocols to reach 11,000 resonance units (RU). Recombinant mouse lengsin, (0.6 mg/ml in PBS), was manually injected into one flow cell, 10 μl/min and captured to reach 2000 resonance units. Following capture, lengsin was covalently bound using 50 μl of 0.2 m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbo-diimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxy-sulfosuccinimide at a flow rate of 50 μl/min for 30 s. Activated amine groups in both cells were blocked with ethanolamine.Association kinetics were studied by injecting increasing concentrations of purified Vim2B or HA-CP492B in PBS over both cells. Protein solutions were injected for 150 s during the association phase at a constant flow rate of 20 μl/min. The dissociation was followed for 200 s at the same flow rate. In all experiments, cell regeneration was performed by injecting NaCl, 2 m for 1 min. BiaEvalution 3.0 software was used to analyze and determine rate affinity constants.RESULTSLocalization in Lens—A cDNA probe for mouse lengsin was used to probe an adult mouse multitissue Northern blot using colorimetric methods (Fig. 1A). A positive signal was seen only in whole eye, just above the size of 18 S rRNA. The same probe was used in a Northern blot of newborn and adult rat lens and retina (Fig. 1B). Clear expression of a 2-kb mRNA was detected in adult lens, but not in retina or in newborn lens. This specificity is consistent with the observation of ESTs for lengsin, which, in libraries made from dissected tissues, are restricted to lens in all species examined. A Western blot of dissected mouse epithelial and fiber cells showed the doublet of lengsin bands at 62 and 51 kDa that correspond to full-length protein and to the loss of the N-terminal domain (15Wyatt K. White H.E. Wang L. Bateman O.A. Slingsby C. Orlova E.V. Wistow G. Structure. 2006; 14: 1823-1834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) only in fiber cells (Fig. 1C).Detailed expression of lengsin mRNA in the mouse eye was examined by in situ hybridization (ISH) (Fig. 2). Consistent with the results of Northern blotting, no signal was observed in newborn or embryonic eye sections (not shown). However, in adult eye sections an intense, discrete ring of hybridization was observed in the region of terminal differentiation of secondary fiber cells. Staining patterns showed that while cell nuclei were present in cells expressing lengsin, no nuclei were present below these layers of secondary fiber cells.FIGURE 2Lengsin mRNA is specific to maturing lens fiber cells. ISH of adult mouse eye, using radiolabeled antisense and sense probes to mouse lengsin. Panel a, whole eye. A ring of silver grains marks lengsin expression in lens (arrow).

Panel d, sense probe version of panel b.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This result was confirmed by immunofluorescence using the protein A-purified polyclonal antiserum to mouse lengsin (Fig. 3). No signal was seen in the central region of the lens (the lens nucleus), which contains primary fibers that formed in the embryonic lens. Staining was seen throughout the terminally differentiated secondary fibers, with expression first appearing in the ring of cells corresponding to the region of loss of cell nuclei. Although immunoreactivity was distributed through the cell cytoplasm, intense staining was also occasionally observed in nuclei immediately above the layers of nuclear breakdown. Occasionally, some lens sections also showed apparent immunoreactivity in a subpopulation of lens epithelial cells (as can be seen in Fig. 3), however this was not reproducible. Because neither ISH nor Western blotting detected lengsin in lens epithelium, this staining probably results from a sectioning artifact.FIGURE 3Lengsin protein localization in adult mouse lens by immunofluorescence. Signal for anti-mouse lengsin is green; nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). Lens epithelium (Le) and bow region (zone of fiber cell elongation) are indicated. Strong lengsin immunoreactivity is seen throughout maturing and mature secondary fiber cells. Arrow indicates an intensely stained cell nucleus. Some signal is visible in regions of epithelium, but this probably a sectioning artifact. The unstained region in the center of the lens corresponds to the lens nucleus, consisting largely of primary lens fiber cells, which is intact in this section.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Full-length mouse lengsin was cloned as bait in the BD Clontech Matchmaker Y2H system and was used to screen a random-primed, adult mouse lens cDNA expression library (Fig. 4A). This produced a limited number of positive targets all of which corresponded either to lengsin itself or to the lens cytoskeleton intermediate filament protein vimentin (7Sandilands A. Prescott A.R. Carter J.M. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. Richards J. FitzGerald P.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1397-1406PubMed Google Scholar). The vimentin clones obtained were identical and corresponded to partial sequence from the helix 2B region of the vimentin filament domain (Vim2B) (20Strelkov S.V. Herrmann H. Geisler N. Wedig T.

Previous studies have shown a marked decrease in vimentin levels close to the region of lens fiber cell terminal differentiation (7Sandilands A. Prescott A.R. Carter J.M. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. Richards J. FitzGerald P.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1397-1406PubMed Google Scholar) and hence to the region of lengsin expression. The vertebrate lens also contains two highly abundant, lens-specific intermediate filament proteins BFSP1(CP94;filensin) and BFSP2 (CP49;phakinin) (here we refer to these two proteins as filensin and CP49), which are structurally related to vimentin (21Georgatos S.D. Gounari F. Remington S. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These two proteins also appear to undergo reorganization at a generally similar stage to the onset of lengsin expression (7Sandilands A. Prescott A.R. Carter J.M. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. Richards J. FitzGerald P.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1397-1406PubMed Google Scholar). Although CP49 has some sequence similarity to vimentin in the helix 2B region, filensin is more distantly related to vimentin and has very little sequence similarity in the helical regions (Fig. 4B). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), another filament protein that has significant sequence similarity to vimentin, is also expressed in lens but at much lower abundance and is restricted to epithelial cells (22Hatfield J.S. Skoff R.P. Maisel H. Eng L. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1895-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Boyer S. Maunoury R. Gomes D. de Nechaud B. Hill A.M. Dupouey P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Other cytokeratin-like filament proteins may also be present in lens at much lower levels than vimentin, GFAP, and the beaded filament proteins (24Quinlan R.A. Sandilands A. Procter J.E.

Eye. 1999; 13: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).To see if lengsin is also capable of interaction with the other major lens filament proteins expressed in lengsin-positive cells, the regions equivalent to the Vim2B regions in both CP49 and filensin (Fig. 4B) were cloned into the prey vector and used in pair-wise Y2H experiments with the lengsin bait vector. In Y2H neither CP49 nor filensin preys produced positive Y2H interactions with the lengsin bait. However, examination of the bait and prey fusion proteins by Western blot for the Gal4 activation domain showed that although full sized products for the vimentin and filensin fusions were expressed, the CP49 prey fusion was consistently too small (not shown). DNA sequence was verified for these clones, and the Y2H experiment repeated, yielding the same result. This suggested that modification of the CP49 fusion protein, perhaps by proteolysis, occurs in yeast. Thus Y2H provides evidence that lengsin can interact with the helical region of vimentin but not with the equivalent region of filensin. However interaction between CP49 and lengsin could not be examined by this technique.Recombinant Proteins—To verify the vimentin interaction seen in Y2H and to further examine the possibility of an interaction between lengsin and the helical region of CP49, recombinant proteins were used. The Vim2B construct expressed at high levels in the soluble fraction in E. coli and was co-expressed with lengsin. When the total soluble bacterial cell extract was subjected to size exclusion chromatography, both lengsin and Vim2B, which could be visualized by SDS-PAGE, were found to co-purify in the same size range, while Vim2B expressed in the absence of lengsin ran in later fractions corresponding to smaller size aggregates (Fig. 5A). Co-expressed lengsin and Vim2 also co-purified on cation exchange chromatography (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that full-length lengsin and Vim2B associate in both gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography.FIGURE 5Association of recombinant lengsin and vimentin.

Two different anti-vimentin antibodies, ab7752 and abV9, were linked to secondary antibody-agarose carrier beads and used to immunoprecipitate the mixture. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted and examined by Western blotting. Both antibodies immunoprecipitated vimentin but only abV9 also precipitated lengsin. Beads with no antibody did not IP lengsin. This suggests that vimentin-lengsin complexes can form in solution and can be immunoprecipitated in an antibody-specific manner. The lack of co-IP with ab7752 may reflect epitope masking in the complex so that lengsin/vimentin complex does not bind antibody.FIGURE 6Co-immunoprecipitation of isolated lengsin and vimentin. A solution of lengsin and vimentin was treated with V9 or 7752 antibodies to vimentin as indicated. Immunoprecipitated (IP) proteins were then examined by Western blotting for lengsin (left) and vimentin (right). Both vimentin antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate vimentin (right). In addition, V9 co-precipitated lengsin (left).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The region of CP49 equivalent to the Vim2B fragment was cloned in a similar way but gave only very low levels of expression in E. coli.

The ectopic expression of carA restored early developmental gene expression to the rasC–/rasG– strain, rendering it suitable for an analysis of cAMP signal transduction. Because there was negligible signaling through both the cAMP chemotactic pathway and the adenylyl cyclase activation pathway in the rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA strain, it is clear that RasG and RasC are the only two Ras subfamily proteins that directly control these pathways. The position of Rap1 in the signal transduction cascade was clarified by the finding that Rap1 activation was totally abolished in rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA and rasG– cells but only slightly reduced in rasC– cells. Rap1 activation, therefore, occurs downstream of the Ras proteins and predominantly, if not exclusively, downstream of RasG. The finding that in vitro guanylyl cyclase activation is also abolished in the rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA strain identifies RasG/RasC as the presumptive monomeric GTPases required for this activation.

The finding that in vitro guanylyl cyclase activation is also abolished in the rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA strain identifies RasG/RasC as the presumptive monomeric GTPases required for this activation. The Ras subfamily proteins are monomeric GTPases that function as molecular switches by cycling between the active GTP-bound and the inactive GDP-bound state (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, activated Ras proteins impact multiple cellular signaling pathways that include mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) 3The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase; ACA, adenylyl cyclase A; PKB, protein kinase B; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; RBD, Ras-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase. -regulated pathways and RalGDS-dependent activation of Ral (2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). These Ras-mediated responses regulate a wide range of cellular processes, including proliferation, cytoskeletal function, and differentiation. The discovery of a large number of Ras subfamily homologues in mammals and in the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Dictyostelium discoideum (3Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 4Wilkins A. Insall R.H. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 41-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) has raised important questions regarding the specific functions of individual Ras proteins. For example, the human Ras subfamily consists of 36 gene products that can be divided into several groups (5Mitin N. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R563-R574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The search for downstream effectors has revealed some specificity but also an enormous complexity of apparently overlapping functions (6Rodriguez-Viciana P. Sabatier C. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4943-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus, a major step in understanding the patterns of Ras signal transduction would be to identify the contributions made by each Ras subfamily member to a specific signaling pathway. This analysis is difficult, if there is cross-talk between the components of different pathways, or if a single input signal results in multiple responses. One useful tool in understanding Ras function is provided by examining genetically tractable organisms, such as Dictyostelium, that are disrupted in the ras gene of interest. In the presence of nutrients, the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium, grows as free-living, single-celled amoebae, but upon starvation these amoebae aggregate into a multicellular organism that progresses through a motile slug stage to form a spore mass or sorus supported by a stalk (7Kessin, R. H. (2001) Dictyostelium: Evolution, Cell Biology, and the Development of Multicellularity, Developmental and Cell Biology Series, pp. 1–8, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UKGoogle Scholar). The aggregation process is driven in response to cAMP, which is synthesized and secreted soon after the onset of starvation. cAMP binds to cell surface cAMP receptors (for example, the cAR1 receptor encoded by the carA gene), resulting in the dissociation and activation of a heterotrimeric G protein. This leads to chemotaxis to cAMP and to the activation of adenylyl cyclase A (ACA) (8Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 411-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Fourteen Dictyostelium Ras subfamily proteins, with a high level of amino acid identity to the mammalian H, N, and K-Ras proteins, have been described (9Weeks, G., Gaudet, P., and Insall, R. H. (2005) in Dictyostelium Genomics (Loomis, W. F., and Kuspa, A., eds) pp. 211–234, Horizon Bioscience, Norfold, UKGoogle Scholar). The rasC, rasS, rasG, and rasD genes have all been disrupted, and each of the resulting strains has a distinct phenotype, suggesting that each encoded product performs a different function (10Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Chubb J.R. Wilkins A. Thomas G.M. Insall R.H. J.

It has been previously shown that both RasC and RasG are activated in response to cAMP, suggesting roles for both RasC and RasG in cAMP signaling (15Kae H. Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Sasaki A.T. Chun C. Takeda K. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). A role for RasC and RasG has been further indicated by the finding that rasC– cells fail to aggregate and rasG– cells are delayed in aggregation (10Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4490-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ACA activation is more impacted than chemotaxis in the rasC– cells, whereas chemotaxis is more impacted than ACA activation in the rasG– cells (10Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the loss of RasG or RasC alone did not result in a total loss of either chemotaxis or ACA activation, suggesting three possibilities: some overlap of function between RasC and RasG; a requirement of both RasC and RasG for optimal chemotaxis and optimal ACA activation; or the existence of an additional pathway for cAMP signaling. The recent finding that Rap1 is activated in response to cAMP (17Jeon T.J. Lee D.J. Merlot S. Weeks G. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 1021-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) provides a potential mechanism for the third possibility: signaling through Rap1 acting in parallel to signaling through RasC or RasG. To eliminate this possibility, we have ectopically expressed the carA gene in a doubly disrupted rasC–/rasG– strain. This ectopic expression was necessary, because the rasC–/rasG– strain exhibited greatly reduced expression of gpaB and carA, the genes encoding the Gα2 subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein and the cAMP receptor cAR1, respectively, and was deficient in the developmentally induced production of ACA (10Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The absence of these essential components for cAMP signaling rendered the rasC–/rasG– strain inappropriate for an analysis of signal transduction. We report experiments that show that early developmental gene expression is restored in the rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA mutant, but these cells exhibit negligible chemotaxis and cAMP relay, conclusively demonstrating the essential role of RasC or RasG in these processes. In addition, an examination of cAMP-dependent Rap1 activation in the various ras null strains provided evidence that Rap1 activation occurs downstream of RasG. Finally, the availability of the rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA strain enabled us to demonstrate the essential role of RasC and RasG in guanylyl cyclase activation. Dictyostelium Strains—Generation of rasG–, rasC–, and rasC–/rasG– strains, all in the JH10 background, has been described previously (10Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To generate rasC–/rasG–/[act15]: carA strain, 20 μg of the PcAR1-B18 expression vector, which contains carA cDNA under the control of the constitutively active actin 15 promoter and a neomycin-resistance cassette (18Johnson R.L. Vaughan R.A. Caterina M.J. Van Haastert P.J. Devreotes P.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6982-6986Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was electroporated into rasC–/rasG– cells as previously described (19Alibaud L. Cosson P. Benghezal M. BioTechniques. 2003; 35: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Clones containing the selectable marker were isolated 8–15 days following the application of the selection conditions and maintained in HL5 media supplemented with 10 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cell Culture and Development—The JH10 strain was grown at 22 °C in HL5 medium (20Watts D.J. Ashworth J.M. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) containing 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml thymidine (Sigma). The various ras gene-disrupted strains were grown in the same medium without thymidine. In addition, the rasC–/rasG– strain was grown in the presence of 10 μg/ml blasticidin S (Calbiochem), and the rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA strain was grown in the presence of 10 μg/ml blasticidin S and 10 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Because the rasG–, rasC–/rasG–, and rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA cells grow poorly in shaken suspension, all strains were grown in Nunc tissue-culture plates. To obtain cAMP-pulsed cells, wild-type and mutant vegetative cells were harvested, washed twice in KK2 (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.1), and resuspended in KK2 to a final density of 5 × 106 cells/ml. 30 ml of this cell suspension was shaken at 150 rpm for 1 h and then pulsed with 100 μl of cAMP to a final concentration of 50 nm every 6 min for 5 h. To observe aggregation streaming, vegetative or 5-h cAMP-pulsed cells were washed twice in Bonner's salts (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2), seeded at ∼4 × 105 cells/cm2 in Nunc tissue culture dishes submerged under Bonner's salts, incubated at 22 °C, and photographed with a Leica DMIL inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), a Leica DFC350F camera (Leica Microsystems), and Openlab software (Improvision, Coventry, England). cAMP Binding Assay— cAMP-pulsed cells were treated with 2mm caffeine for 30 min, washed twice in ice-cold KK2, and resuspended to a density of 1.5 × 108 cells/ml. The binding of [3H]cAMP to the cell surface was measured by the ammonium sulfate stabilization assay (21Van Haastert P.J. Kien E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9636-9642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (1.5 × 107) were incubated with 100 μl of KK2 containing 10 nm [3H]cAMP (0.9 TBq/mmol, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, England) and 5 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) for 1 min at 0 °C. 1 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate was then added, followed immediately by the addition of 100 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml, Sigma). After 5-min incubation at 0 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 110 μlof1 m acetic acid. 100 μl of the resuspended pellet was mixed with 4 ml of scintillation mixture (Ready Safe liquid scintillation cocktails, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), and the amount of bound [3H]cAMP was measured using a Beckman LS6000IC scintillation counter. Chemotaxis Assays—For cAMP micropipet assays, cells were pulsed with cAMP as described above, washed twice with Bonner's salts, and then seeded in Nunc tissue culture dishes at a cell density of ∼5 × 105 cell/cm2 in Bonner's salts. At t = 0, an Eppendorf Femtotip Micropipet (Hamburg, Germany) filled with 100 μm cAMP was placed in the field of view, and cell movements toward the micropipet were monitored by time-lapse video microscopy using an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope, a DAGE-MTI CCD-100 camera (Michigan City, IN), and Scion Image 4.0 software (Frederick, MD). Instantaneous velocities and chemotaxis indices were determined as described previously (22Wessels D. Brincks R. Kuhl S. Stepanovic V. Daniels K.J. Weeks G. Lim C.J. Spiegelman G. Fuller D. Iranfar N. Loomis W.F. Soll D.R. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 646-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analyses and PKB Phosphorylation Assays— Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in 1× Laemmli SDS-PAGE loading buffer (6× buffer: 350 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 600 mm dithiothreitol, 0.012% w/v bromphenol blue, 30% glycerol) by boiling for 5 min (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 10 μg of protein was then fractionated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), which were then blocked with nonfat milk (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and probed with the appropriate antibody. Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, GE Healthcare). PKB phosphorylation was determined as described previously (14Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4490-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, cAMP-pulsed cells were washed twice in KK2, resuspended to 5 × 107 cells/ml in KK2, and then stimulated by addition of cAMP to a final concentration of 100 nm. Aliquots of 100 μl were removed at intervals, before and after stimulation, and mixed with 20 μlof6× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. 10 μg of protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to Western blot analysis using a phosphothreonine-specific antibody (Cat#9381, Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA). Equal sample loading was verified by staining a duplicate gel with Coomassie Blue. To assess equal PKB expression levels in all strains, Western blots were also analyzed using a PKB-specific antibody. The protein concentration was determined using the protein assay from Bio-Rad. Northern Blot Analyses—For Northern blot analyses, cells were pulsed with cAMP as described above, and total RNA was extracted at intervals using guanidinium isothiocyanate (24Chomczynki P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). 15-μg aliquots were size-fractionated on 1.25% agarose-formaldehyde gels, blotted onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with DNA fragments from plasmids carrying the specific genes of interest, as previously described (25Robbins S.M. Williams J.G. Jermyn K.A. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Adenylyl Cyclase Assay—In vitro adenylyl cyclase activity was determined as described previously (14Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4490-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), except that cell suspensions were frozen on dry ice and thawed, and then vortexed in the presence of glass beads (<106 μm, Sigma). cAMP was recovered by sequential chromatography through Dowex and Alumina columns, and the eluted [32P]cAMP was measured using a Beckman LS6000IC scintillation counter. cGMP Production and Guanylyl Cyclase Activation—To measure cGMP production, cells were pulsed with cAMP as described above, washed twice with KK2, and resuspended to a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml in KK2 containing 2 mm caffeine. The cells were stimulated with 100 nm cAMP, and 100-μl samples were lysed at intervals by the addition of 100 μl of 3.5% perchloric acid, followed by the addition of 50 μl of 50% saturated KHCO3. cGMP levels were then measured using a [3H]cGMP assay kit (GE Healthcare, TRK500). In vitro guanylyl cyclase assay was determined as described previously (26Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Van Haastert P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 387-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cAMP-pulsed cells were washed and resuspended to a density of 2 × 108 cells/ml in KK2. One volume of cell suspension was mixed with one volume of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 1.5 mm EGTA, 500 mm sucrose, in the presence or absence of 200 μm GTPγS, and immediately lysed by pushing the cells through a 5 μm Isopore Membrane Filter (Millipore, Ireland) placed directly between a 1-ml syringe and a B-D 26G1/2 needle (BD Biosciences). 150 μl of cell lysate was mixed with an equal volume of assay mix (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 250 mm sucrose, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm GTP, 5 mm MgCl2), and the mixture was incubated at 22 °C for 60 s. Aliquots (100 μl) were mixed with 100 μl of 3.5% perchloric acid, followed by addition of 50 μl of 50% saturated KHCO3. cGMP levels were then measured using a [3H]cGMP assay kit (GE Healthcare TRK500). RasG, RasC, and Rap1 Activation Assays—The Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Byr2 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion protein and purified as described previously (15Kae H. Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The purified GST-Byr2-RBD was used for the detection of activated proteins. After cAMP pulsing, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml in KK2 containing 1 mm caffeine. After 30 min, aliquots (2 ml) of cell suspension were stimulated by addition of cAMP to a final concentration of 15 μm. Cell suspensions (350 μl) were lysed at the indicated times by mixing with an equal volume of 2 × lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2mm EDTA, 2mm Na3VO4, 10mm NaF, containing two tablets of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) per 50-ml buffer). The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the protein assay from Bio-Rad. 400 μg of protein was incubated with 100 μg of GST-Byr2-RBD on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Bio-sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times in 1 × lysis buffer. 50 μlof1 × SDS gel loading buffer was then added to the pelleted beads, and the suspension was boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-RasG, RasC, or Rap1 antibodies. Restoration of Early Developmental Gene Expression in rasC–/ rasG– Strain by the Ectopic Expression of carA—Characterization of a rasC–/rasG– double mutant by Northern blot analysis had revealed that expression of the early developmentally genes, carA, gpaB, and csaA, was dramatically reduced, with the effect on carA expression being the most pronounced (10Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, any signaling phenotype observed in this strain could be due to insufficient levels of essential developmentally expressed signaling proteins, such as cAR1, Gα2, and ACA. Because carA expression was the most defective, we expressed the gene encoding cAR1 (carA) from the constitutively active act15 promoter in the rasC–/rasG– strain, in an attempt to provide sufficient cAR1 to allow at least some cAMP signaling. As anticipated, carA was now clearly expressed in vegetative cells of this strain, whereas, in contrast it was undetectable in vegetative JH10 and rasC–/rasG– cells. Surprisingly gpaB and csaA were also expressed in vegetative rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA cells at much greater levels than in JH10 or rasC–/rasG– cells. Even more surprisingly, the developmental expression of carA, gpaB, and csaA was restored by the ectopic expression of carA (Fig. 1, A and C). Thus, the presence of cAR1 in vegetative cells at the onset of development is a positive regulator of early gene expression and is able to offset the absence of RasG and RasC, normally required for this induction. Because early gene expression was restored in the rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA strain, it enabled an investigation of the possible roles of other Ras proteins in cAMP-induced signal transduction. To demonstrate that the restored carA expression in the rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA strain produced functional cAR1, we determined the binding of cAMP to the cell surface of cAMP-pulsed cells. The results, shown in Table 1, indicated that cAMP binding was reduced, as expected, in the rasC–/rasG– relative to JH10, but restored to greater than wild-type levels in the rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA cells. This result demonstrated that the overexpression of carA indicated in Fig. 1 resulted in functional protein being localized on the surface of the rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA cells.TABLE 1Cell surface cAMP bindingStraincAMP boundaThe values are the means of two experiments.nmol/107 cellsJH104.3 ± 0.4rasC-/rasG-0.8 ± 0.2rasC-/rasG-/[act15]:carA6.6 ± 0.5a The values are the means of two experiments.

The rasC–/rasG– and rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA cells exhibited no growth whatsoever in shaken suspension and grew less efficiently than rasG– cells on a plastic surfaces (data not shown). These results indicate that RasC is capable of performing some of the RasG functions in vegetative cells. In addition, it was shown previously that, although rasC– cell grew normally, they exhibited deficiencies in some vegetative cell functions, indicating an important role for RasC in vegetative cells (27Lim C.J. Zawadzki K.A. Khosla M. Secko D.M. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 306: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Developmental Phenotype—When grown in association with bacteria, the rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA cells did not form aggregates on bacterial lawns (data not shown). In addition, aggregation streams were not observed when cells were plated in plastic dishes under non-nutrient buffer, although small cell clumps were formed after prolonged incubation (Fig. 2C), results similar to those observed previously for AX2/rasC– (14Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4490-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and JH10/rasC– cells (10Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The rasC–/rasG– cells did not form small clumps under these conditions (Fig. 2B). The formation of aggregation streams by the control JH10 cells was observed 10 h after plating, and typical tight aggregates formed by 12 h (Fig. 2A). When pulsed with cAMP for 5 h before plating in plastic dishes, rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA exhibited the same phenotype as the non-pulsed cells (data not shown). Thus, cells containing neither RasG nor RasC are incapable of aggregation under any of the experimental conditions tested, and this defect is not due to the inability to express the early developmental genes (Fig. 1C). These results show that aggregation is totally blocked in the absence of both RasC and RasG. To determine the role played by these proteins in the cAMP relay and chemotaxis signal pathways, these downstream responses to cAMP were further explored. The Presence of Either RasG or RasC Is Essential for ACA Activation—The activation of ACA by signaling through the heterotrimeric G protein is essential during aggregation to provide the extracellular cAMP to relay the signal through the population (8Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 411-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). GTPγS activates ACA by uncoupling the Gα subunits from the Gβγ subunits without the requirement for receptor occupation by cAMP (8Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 411-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 28Theibert A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15121-15125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACA activity in the absence of GTPγS was reduced in the lysates of cAMP-pulsed rasC–/rasG– cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that these cells expressed less ACA, a result consistent with the defect in early gene expression (Fig. 1). In contrast, lysates prepared from cAMP-pulsed rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA cells, had wild-type levels of ACA activity. When stimulated with GTPγS, there was no increase in ACA activity in either rasC–/rasG– or in rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA cells (Fig. 3). This result indicates that rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA cells are incapable of cAMP-induced signal relay and is in marked contrast to those observed previously for cells with single ras gene disruptions, which exhibit some ACA activation (10Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4490-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, signal transduction from the heterotrimeric G protein to ACA must involve either RasC or RasG. The Presence of Either RasG or RasC Is Essential for Chemotaxis, PKB Phosphorylation, and Guanylyl Cyclase Activation— To investigate the requirement of RasC and RasG for chemotaxis, cells that had been pulsed for 5 h with cAMP were subjected to a spatial gradient created by diffusion of cAMP from the tip of a micropipet. Under these conditions, chemotaxis-competent cells respond by migrating toward the tip (29Firtel R.A. Chung C.Y. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Chemotactic indices for the rasC–/rasG– and the rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA cells revealed the virtual absence of chemotaxis in these two strains (Table 2). Thus, cAMP-induced chemotaxis toward cAMP requires signal transduction through either RasC or RasG. The results for the double ras gene deletion strains are in marked contrast to those obtained previously for the single ras gene deletion strains, which both exhibited appreciable chemotaxis (see Table 2 for comparative values). The calculated average instantaneous velocities of the rasC–/rasG– and rasC–/rasG–/[act15]:carA cells were lower than those for the wild type, although the values clearly indicate that both strains are still capable of random motility (Table 2).TABLE 2Chemotaxis analysis of Dictyostelium cells in a spatial gradient of cAMPStrainNumber of cellsInstantaneous velocityChemotaxis indexaChemotaxis index was calculated as the net distance traveled toward the source of chemoattractant divided by the total distance traveled in that time period.μm/minJH102011.18 ± 1.510.62 ± 0.12rasG-215.98 ± 1.730.45 ± 0.14rasC-2212.97 ± 3.990.71 ± 0.15rasC-/rasG-206.60 ± 3.330.05 ± 0.02rasC-/rasG-/[act15]:carA205.91 ± 3.410.04 ± 0.01a Chemotaxis index was calculated as the net distance traveled toward the source of chemoattractant divided by the total distance traveled in that time period.

Silica may alter the sensitivity of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), to other types of infection; however, the exact nature of these exchanges remains uncertain. The purpose of the present study is to characterize the effect of silica exposure on innate pulmonary defense mechanisms following Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand-induced activation using DCs as a model APC and determine whether these signals act in synergy or opposition to one another. Using C57Bl/6 mice, pattern recognition receptor expression on DCs was examined in vitro and in vivo using flow cytometry, and the activation state of pulmonary and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-derived DCs was assessed in response to silica in combination with TLR ligands (lipopolysaccharide, cytosine-phosphate-guanine, or polyinosinic:polycytid..."
https://openalex.org/W2060023876,"Serum opacity factor (SOF) is a unique multifunctional virulence determinant expressed at the surface of Streptococcus pyogenes and has been shown to elicit protective immunity against GAS infection in a murine challenge model. SOF consists of two distinct domains with different binding capacities: an N-terminal domain that binds apolipoprotein AI and a C-terminal repeat domain that binds fibronectin and fibrinogen. The capacity of SOF to opacify serum by disrupting the structure of high density lipoproteins may preclude its use as a vaccine antigen in humans. This study generated mutant forms of recombinant SOF with reduced (100-fold) or abrogated opacity factor (OF) activity, for use as vaccine antigens. However, alterations introduced into the N-terminal SOF peptide (SOFΔFn) by mutagenesis to abrogate OF activity, abolish the capacity of SOF to protect against lethal systemic S. pyogenes challenge in a murine model. Mutant forms of purified SOFΔFn peptide were also used to assess the contribution of OF activity to the pathogenic processes of cell adhesion and cell invasion. Using latex beads coated with full-length SOF, SOFΔFn peptide, or a peptide encompassing the C-terminal repeats (FnBD), we demonstrate that adhesion to HEp-2 cells is mediated by both SOFΔFn and FnBD. The HEp-2 cell binding displayed by the N-terminal SOFΔFn peptide is independent of OF activity. We demonstrate that while the N terminus of SOF does not directly mediate intracellular uptake by epithelial cells, this domain enhances epithelial cell uptake mediated by full-length SOF, in comparison to the FnBD alone.

The serum opacity factor (SOF) is a large protein of ∼110 kDa, which is expressed at the cell surface by approximately half of all clinical isolates (4Goodfellow A.M. Hibble M. Talay S.R.

Similar to a number of other surface proteins expressed by S. pyogenes, SOF binds fibronectin via a C-terminal-repeated domain (FnBD) (6Jeng A. Sakota V. Li Z. Datta V. Beall B. Nizet V. J.

Immun. 2004; 72: 4302-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast to the conserved C terminus, the N terminus of SOF (SOFΔFn) is highly variable, exhibiting ∼55% identity between different serotypes of S. pyogenes. The N-terminal domain of SOF was originally thought to cleave apolipoprotein A1 (apoAI) in human serum leading to the precipitation of high density lipoproteins (HDLs) (10Saravani G.A. Martin D.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 56: 35-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Katerov V. Lindgren P.E. Totolian A.A. Schalen C. Curr. Microbiol. 2000; 40: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been demonstrated that the OF activity of SOF is not enzymatic; rather, the direct binding of apoAI by SOF triggers the release of the HDL lipid cargo of apoAI, initiating the opacity reaction (12Courtney H.S. Zhang Y.M. Frank M.W. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5515-5521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This OF domain of SOF promotes GAS invasion of epithelial cells (13Timmer A.M. Kristian S.A. Datta V. Jeng A. Gillen C.M. Walker M.J. Beall B. Nizet V. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether the OF activity itself or a discrete domain within the N terminus of SOF contributes to this phenotype. SOF is a virulence determinant of GAS, with insertional inactivation or allelic replacement of sof reducing mortality in an intraperitoneal and subcutaneous murine infection model (13Timmer A.M.

SOF is also a vaccine candidate, parenteral immunization of mice with SOF protects against lethal intraperitoneal challenge (15Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Dale J.B. Infect.

It is not known what physiological effect that the precipitation of HDL would have upon the human host or how the interaction of SOF with apoAI contributes to the pathogenesis of GAS. ApoAI exerts a potent anti-inflammatory effect by preventing contact between infected T-cells and monocytes, thereby inhibiting cytokine production (namely tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1) in monocytes (16Hyka N. Dayer J.M. Modoux C. Kohno T. Edwards C.K. Roux-Lombard 3rd, P. Burger D. Blood. 2001; 97: 2381-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In vitro, both HDL and apoAI exert anti-inflammatory effects against the potent bacterial endotoxins, Gram-negative LPS and Gram-positive lipoteichoic acid, binding strongly to both endotoxins and inhibiting the production of TNF-α (17Levels J.H.

In vivo, transgenic animal studies of the toxicity of LPS have shown that expression of human apoAI transgenes protected mice from a lethal dose of LPS (20Levine D.M. Parker T.S. Donnelly T.M. Walsh A. Rubin A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12040-12044Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). ApoAI also possesses specific anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties (21Tada N. Sakamoto T. Kagami A. Mochizuki K. Kurosaka K. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1993; 119: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Srinivas R.V. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Rui Z. Owens R.J. Gupta K.B. Srinivas S.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P.

Investig. 1990; 86: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The administration of active SOF protein as a vaccine when the downstream effects of disrupting HDL and its activity in vivo are unknown would not be recommended, as the most effective protection against GAS infection is delivered when the SOF protein is administered parenterally (15Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Dale J.B. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the localized depletion of HDL may reduce the body's defense against other pathogens or may result in inflammation at the site of immunization. Thus, before SOF could be used as a potential vaccine antigen (alone or as part of a multivalent vaccine formulation) it would be prudent to eliminate the OF activity of the protein. To this end, this study generated mutant forms of recombinant SOF protein with attenuated or eliminated OF activity, for use as vaccine formulations. These mutant SOF proteins have also been used to further delineate OF activity and cell binding activity within the N terminus of SOF. Site-directed Mutagenesis—A pQE30-based vector encoding a fusion protein of residues 33-872 of SOF from a M75 GAS strain (lacking signal sequence and fibronectin binding repeat region, pSOF75ΔFn) (24Kreikemeyer B. Talay S.R. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), was used as the template for all mutagenesis reactions. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as previously described (25Sanderson-Smith M.L. Walker M.J. Ranson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25965-25971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Primers for site-directed mutagenesis are given in supplemental Table S1. Two mutagenesis strategies were employed, amino acid residues were substituted with alanine (single residues up to 5 residues) and small deletions were made within rSOF75ΔFn. Deletions within rSOF75ΔFn were generated by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce two AvrII restriction sites flanking the region to be deleted, followed by digestion with AvrII. The digested fragments were then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the DNA fragment containing the portion of pSOF75ΔFn of interest was extracted from the gel and re-ligated. Expression and Purification of Wild Type and Mutant Forms of rSOF75 and rSOF75ΔFn Protein—Large scale expression and purification of rSOF75 proteins was conducted essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen), and has been previously described (13Timmer A.M.

To ensure correct refolding of proteins was achieved, wild type purified proteins were subsequently tested for opacity factor activity using an agarose overlay method (7Kreikemeyer B. Martin D.R. Chhatwal G.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 305-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural Characterization of Wild Type and Mutant Forms of rSOF75ΔFn Protein—To determine the structural integrity of mutant rSOF75ΔFn proteins in comparison to the wild type, a comparison of the secondary structure of wild type and mutant rSOF75ΔFn proteins was conducted using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. CD spectra were acquired using a Jasco J-810 Spectropolarimeter (Jasco). Experiments were conducted at room temperature with proteins at a concentration of ∼0.2 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 containing 50% trifluoroethanol (27Ionescu R.M. Matthews C.R.

Far UV spectra were recorded from 190-250 nm in a 0.1-cm pathlength cell (Starna) containing 400 μl of protein solution. The data shown represents an average of ten scans, corrected for a buffer baseline. Mean residue ellipticity (MRE; [θ]) was calculated using Equation 1 (29Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. ed.

The serum overlay method permits visual confirmation of OF activity, as binding of apoA1 by SOF causes precipitation of apoAI and HDL, which appears as an opaque white band on the solid serum/agarose medium. Data are presented as an inversion of the actual blot with opacity activity appearing as a dark band on a light background. Quantitative opacity factor assays were conducted using purified HDL or human serum using the method of Courtney et al. (12Courtney H.S. Zhang Y.M. Frank M.W. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

ApoAI Binding Capacity—Wells of a microtiter plate were coated with 20 μg/ml rSOF75 protein or gelatin in 0.01 m sodium bicarbonate for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed with PBS and blocked with gelatin (1 mg/ml in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C, 100 μl of biotinylated (Pierce) apoAI (Calbiochem) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Following washing, 100 μl of avidin-peroxidase (0.5 μg/ml) was added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plates were then washed and 3,3′-5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate added. Color development was stopped using 1 m phosphoric acid, and the absorbance at 450 nm was recorded. Assays were performed in triplicate. Interaction of SOF-coated Latex Beads with HEp-2 Cells—Assays of the interaction of SOF-coated latex beads with HEp-2 cells were conducted per previously published methods (13Timmer A.M.

However, differential binding was observed between these two assay conditions, the rSOF75ΔFn only mediated binding to HEp-2 cells when incubated in DMEM HEPES 1% FCS, and thus these conditions were used for all further latex bead adherence assays. The efficiency of protein loading onto latex beads was measured by FLUOstar fluorescent plate reader (BMG Labtech) using anti-SOF75 rabbit serum and fluorescent labeling with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (green) (Molecular Probes) (data not shown), protein loading efficiency was found to be comparable for all protein domains. To determine the effect of exogenous addition of the rFNBD domain on the adhesion and internalization of rSOFΔFn-coated latex beads, purified rFnBD at 1, 5, or 10 μg/ml was preincubated with the HEp-2 cells for 1 h prior to addition of the coated latex beads, and was maintained throughout the subsequent 4-h incubation with the latex beads. Confocal Microscopy Studies—HEp-2 cells (after incubation with the coated latex beads) were fixed for 30 min on ice in 500 μl/well of prechilled 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and then washed twice in PBS. Cells were then blocked by the addition of 200 μl/well of PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The blocking solution was then removed, and the cells were incubated with either protein-G-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-SOF75 antibodies (26Gillen C.M. Towers R.J. McMillan D.J. Delvecchio A. Sriprakash K.S. Currie B. Kreikemeyer B. Chhatwal G.S. Walker M.J.

Following washing with PBS, cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 diluted 1:400 in PBS containing 10% BSA (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently washed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 200 μl/well of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min on ice, washed in PBS, followed by storage at 4 °C overnight. The following day, cells were treated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 633 diluted 1:400 in PBS containing 10% BSA (Molecular Probes) for 1 h and washed three times in PBS. Cells were then mounted onto a glass slide using Mowiol solution (Calbiochem). Images were recorded using a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope mounted on a Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope with Leica TCS NT software (Version 2.61; Leica Microsystems). Mouse Immunization and Challenge—To determine the protective efficacy of rSOF75ΔFn proteins challenge studies were performed. BALB/c mice (n = 10) were immunized subcutaneously with 25 μg of wild type or mutant forms of rSOF75ΔFn protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Control mice received a subcutaneous injection of PBS. After 2 weeks, the mice were boosted with an intramuscular injection of another 25 μg of each protein in PBS. Control mice received a PBS injection. Two weeks after the booster injections, all mice were challenged by an intraperitoneal injection of ∼1 × 109 CFU of the SOF-positive M49 GAS strain 591 (33Podbielski A. Woischnik M. Leonard B.A.B. Schmidt K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1051-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The number of surviving mice was recorded daily. Moribund mice were sacrificed and recorded as dead. Serum samples were collected on days 0 and 28, and stored at -20 °C prior to determination of rSOF75ΔFn-specific antibodies. In brief, 96-well Nunc-Immuno MaxiSorp assay plates (Nunc) were coated with 2 μg/ml of wild type rSOF75ΔFn in coating buffer (bicarbonate, pH 9.4). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, plates were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37 °C. Serial 2-fold dilutions of serum in PBS with 1% BSA were added (100 μl/well), and plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After four washes, secondary biotinylated antibodies were added followed by 1 h of incubation at 37 °C. After six washes, 50 μl/well of peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen), diluted 1:1000, was added, and plates were further incubated for 45 min at room temperature. After a final six washes, the substrate ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) in 0.1 m citrate-phosphate buffer containing 0.1% H2O2 was added, and plates were incubated for 30-60 min at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 405 nm. Statistical Analyses—For apoAI binding experiments, an unpaired Student's t test was used to determine if there was any significant difference in the apoAI binding ability of wild type and mutant SOF proteins. For latex bead experiments, a one way analysis of variance using Bartlett's test for equal variance was used to determine whether there was any significant variation in the median number of beads attached to or taken up by HEp-2 cells, followed by a Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test for individual comparison of adherence and internalization mediated by two different proteins. For immunization and challenge experiments, a Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine whether there was any significant variation in the median titers of the four groups of antisera. Dunn's Multiple Comparison test was used for individual comparison of two groups of antisera. Difference in survival curves was determined by log rank test. All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.02 (Graph-Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). SOF is a unique multifunctional protein, capable of binding fibronectin via a C-terminal domain designated FnBD (8Rakonjac J.V. Robbins J.C. Fischetti V.A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 622-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kreikemeyer B. Talay S.R. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and apoAI via an N-terminal domain (12Courtney H.S. Zhang Y.M. Frank M.W. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5515-5521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal domain of SOF (SOFΔFn) has been shown to mediate adhesion to HEp-2 cells and promote HEp-2 cell invasion by whole GAS cells. To assess the contribution of the OF activity of SOF in the processes of HEp-2 epithelial cell adhesion and invasion, deletion mutagenesis was used to eliminate the OF activity of recombinant rSOF75ΔFn. Deletion was undertaken to remove between 22 and 63 amino acid residues of the rSOF75ΔFn protein (between Pro148 and Lys211, Pro210 and Glu232, Lys231 and Asp286, Val285 and Glu315). Each of the rSOF75ΔFn deletion mutants lacked OF activity (Fig. 1B). The rSOF75ΔFnDEL[P210→ E232] mutant was also found to lack OF activity when incubated in human serum or human HDL (Fig. 2). To delineate specific amino acid residues that contribute to OF activity, site-directed mutagenesis to alanine was undertaken on 52 amino acids of SOF75ΔFn that are 100% conserved in 16 different SOF sequences (supplemental Table S1). A mutant form of rSOF75ΔFn with attenuated OF activity (100-fold reduction in activity) was constructed by simultaneously substituting 5 amino acids with alanine (Asp218, Ser226, Lys228, Met229, Glu232). The rSOF75ΔFn[D218A-S226A-K228A-M229A-E232A] protein has attenuated OF activity when incubated with either human serum or human HDL (Fig. 2). To determine whether the loss or attenuation of OF activity was due to a decrease in the apoAI binding capacity of SOF, the ability of rSOF75ΔFnWT, rSOF75ΔFn[D218A-S226A-K228A-M229A-E232A], and rSOF75ΔFnDEL[P210→ E232] to bind biotinylated apoAI was assayed (Fig. 2D). There was no significant decrease in apoAI binding by the mutant proteins, suggesting that the loss of OF activity occurs via an alternative mechanism.FIGURE 2The OF activity and apoAI binding capacity of wild type and mutant forms of rSOF75ΔFn. A, OF activity over 24 h was determined by adding 1 μg/ml of either rSOF75ΔFnBDWT, rSOF75ΔFn[D218A-S226A-K228A-M229A-E232A], or rSOF75ΔFnDEL[P210→ E232] to human serum and recording the A405 nm at timed intervals. B and C, the opacification of serum (B) or HDL (C) as a function of protein concentration. Human serum or purified human HDL was treated with the indicated concentration of protein for 24 h and the absorbance determined at 405 nm. D, binding of biotinylated apoAI by either rSOF75ΔFnBDWT, rSOF75ΔFn[D218A-S226A-K228A-M229A-E232A], rSOF75ΔFnDEL[P210→ E232], or gelatin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The impact of the mutations to rSOF75ΔFn on protein structure was analyzed using far-UV CD spectroscopy. rSOF75ΔFnWT had a CD emission spectrum typical of proteins containing both α-helices and β-sheets, with a characteristic minimum at ∼220 nm, a second larger minimum at ∼207 nm and a maximum at 190 nm (34Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Fasman G.D. 1st Ed. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 69-107Google Scholar). Of the rSOF75ΔFnDEL mutant proteins generated, rSOF75ΔFnDEL[K231→ D286] could not be purified for structural analysis. Far-UV CD spectra obtained for rSOF75ΔFnDEL[P148→ K211], rSOF75ΔFnDEL[P210→ E232], and rSOF75ΔFnDEL[V285→ D315] indicate perturbation to the secondary structure of the proteins. The rSOF75ΔFnWT is predicted to contain 27% α-helicity, with a predicted 24% α-helical content in rSOF75ΔFnDEL[P148→ K211], 21% in rSOF75ΔFnDEL[P210→ E232], and 22% in rSOF75ΔFnDEL[V285→ D315]. A concomitant shift toward a more disordered structure was observed for each deletion mutant, as indicated by a shift in the 207 nm minima to a shorter wavelength of 204 nm for rSOF75ΔFnDEL[P148→ K211] and rSOF75ΔFnDEL[P210→ E232] and 205.5 nm for rSOF75ΔFnDEL[V285→ D315] (Fig. 3) (34Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Fasman G.D. 1st Ed. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 69-107Google Scholar, 35Freifelder D. 2nd Ed. Physical Biochemistry. Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1982Google Scholar). In contrast to the loss of secondary structural elements in the rSOF75ΔFnDEL mutants, the rSOF75ΔFn[D218A-S226A-K228A-M229A-E232A] mutant had increased secondary structure when compared with rSOF75ΔFnWT, with an increase in predicted α-helicity from 27 to 29% (Fig. 3). To assess the direct contribution of the OF activity of SOF in the processes of HEp-2 epithelial cell adhesion and invasion, the ability of latex beads coated with wild type OF-positive, mutant OF-negative, and OF-attenuated forms of the rSOF75ΔFn protein to bind to the human pharyngeal epithelial cell line HEp-2 was assayed. These studies indicate that the SOFΔFn domain mediates attachment to HEp-2 cells, with the latex beads coated with rSOF75ΔFnWT adhering to HEp-2 cells in numbers equivalent to latex beads coated with the full-length rSOF75 (p > 0.05), and significantly more latex beads coated with rSOF75ΔFnWT adhering to HEp-2 cells than latex beads coated with a protein encompassing only the fibronectin binding domain of the SOF protein (rFNBD) (p < 0.01). Furthermore, this HEp-2 adherence mediated by the SOFΔFn domain is not dependent on OF activity, with latex beads coated with rSOF75ΔFn[D218A-S226A-K228A-M229A-E232A] (attenuated OF activity) and rSOF75ΔFnDEL[P148→ K211] (abolished OF activity) mediating adherence at the same level as the rSOF75ΔFnWT protein (p > 0.05) (Fig. 4, A and C). Latex beads coated with rSOF75ΔFnDEL[P210→ E232] and rSOF75ΔFnDEL[V285→ D315] have a significantly reduced capacity to attach to HEp-2 cells when compared with rSOF75ΔFnWT (p < 0.01), however, there were significantly more latex beads coated with rSOF75ΔFnDEL mutants attached to HEp-2 cells than were observed with the BSA control (p < 0.01). It has been previously demonstrated that the SOFΔFn domain of SOF possesses pro-invasive properties when expressed on the surface of non-invasive GAS strains or non-invasive Lactococcus lactis (13Timmer A.M. Kristian S.A. Datta V. Jeng A. Gillen C.M. Walker M.J. Beall B. Nizet V. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, while the SOFΔFn promotes epithelial cell invasion in these backgrounds, this study has shown that the SOFΔFn protein domain is not sufficient per se to mediate intracellular invasion of HEp-2 cells (Fig. 4, B and C). However, while it is apparent that the N terminus of SOF does not directly mediate epithelial cell invasion, it may be concluded that the higher uptake by epithelial cells of latex beads coated with full-length SOF, in comparison to the FnBD domain alone, is attributable to the N-terminal domain of SOF. A significantly greater proportion of latex beads coated with rSOF75 were found to be intracellular (57.1%) than latex beads coated with FnBD alone (31.8% intracellular) (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B). While SOF is a protective antigen in murine vaccination studies, the capacity of SOF to opacify serum raises questions about its use in humans.

This family is highly conserved throughout evolution and comprises three members in Dictyostelium discoideum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and four in humans and mice. In Dictyostelium, previous analysis demonstrated that TM9 proteins are implicated in cellular adhesion. In this study, we generated TM9 mutants in S. cerevisiae and analyzed their phenotype with particular attention to cellular adhesion. S. cerevisiae strains lacking any one of the three TM9 proteins were severely suppressed for adhesive growth and filamentous growth under conditions of nitrogen starvation. In these mutants, expression of the FLO11-lacZ reporter gene was strongly reduced, whereas expression of FRE(Ty1)-lacZ was not, suggesting that TM9 proteins are implicated at a late stage of nutrient-controlled signaling pathways. We also reexamined the phenotype of Dictyostelium TM9 mutant cells, focusing on nutrient-controlled cellular functions. Although the initiation of multicellular development and autophagy was unaltered in Dictyostelium TM9 mutants, nutrient-controlled secretion of lysosomal enzymes was dysregulated in these cells. These results suggest that in both yeast and amoebae, TM9 proteins participate in the control of specific cellular functions in response to changing nutrient conditions.

These results suggest that in both yeast and amoebae, TM9 proteins participate in the control of specific cellular functions in response to changing nutrient conditions. TM9 proteins constitute a well defined family of proteins characterized by the presence of nine transmembrane domains and a high degree of similarity (1Tapia Chluba-de J. Tapia de M. Jaggin V. Eberle A.N. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There are three members of this family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dictyostelium amoebae, and Drosophila flies and four in humans and mice (2Benghezal M. Cornillon S. Gebbie L. Alibaud L. Bruckert F. Letourneur F. Cosson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2890-2899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although their high degree of evolutionary conservation suggests that they play an important role in cellular physiology, little is known about the role of TM9 proteins. The most detailed studies to date concerning the role of TM9 proteins stem from the study of Dictyostelium amoebae. The cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum has been used previously as a model organism to study phagocytosis and the endocytic pathway. During the course of a systematic search for mutants affected in phagocytosis, a mutant cell line with a defective TM9 protein (named Phg1 or Phg1a) was identified (3Cornillon S. Pech E. Benghezal M. Ravanel K. Gaynor E. Letourneur F. Bruckert F. Cosson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34287-34292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Loss of Phg1a function led to a defect in cellular adhesion, resulting in inefficient phagocytosis. Although it was initially proposed that Phg1a might be an adhesion molecule (3Cornillon S. Pech E. Benghezal M. Ravanel K. Gaynor E. Letourneur F. Bruckert F. Cosson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34287-34292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), a more detailed analysis suggested that it might rather indirectly affect cell adhesion by controlling the cell surface level of an as yet unidentified cell surface adhesion molecule (2Benghezal M. Cornillon S. Gebbie L. Alibaud L. Bruckert F. Letourneur F. Cosson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2890-2899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are two other members in the TM9 family in Dictyostelium (Phg1b and Phg1c) and Phg1a and Phg1b appear to play synergistic roles in the control of cell adhesion (2Benghezal M. Cornillon S. Gebbie L. Alibaud L. Bruckert F. Letourneur F. Cosson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2890-2899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast or in human, the function of TM9 proteins has essentially not been studied. To understand better the function of TM9 proteins, we analyzed the phenotypes of TM9 mutants in S. cerevisiae as well as in D. discoideum. Our results suggest that TM9 proteins play a role in late stages of a nutrient-controlled signaling cascade that ultimately controls cellular adhesion and filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae. Similarly, D. discoideum TM9 proteins, in addition to their role in cellular adhesion, appear to be involved in nutrient-controlled steps of intracellular transport.

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Secretion of Lysosomal Enzymes by Dictyostelium Cells—Secretion of lysosomal enzymes was assessed as described previously (19Dimond R.L. Knecht D.A. Jordan K.B. Burns R.A. Livi G.P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, to measure secretion kinetics, the cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in fresh HL5 and then incubated at 21 °C with mild shaking. At each indicated time, an aliquot of the cell suspension was recovered and centrifuged. To assess enzymatic activity, 50 μl of sample (supernatants or cell pellets resuspended in 0.1% Triton-X-100) and 50 μl of substrate mix (10 mm substrate in 5 mm NaOAc, pH 5.2) were mixed and incubated for ∼1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 500 mm Na2CO3, and the optical density at 405 nm was determined in a microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Enzyme substrates (Sigma) were dissolved in dimethylformamide at a concentration of 250 mm and stored at –20 °C. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate, p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl β-d-glucosamide, and p-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside were used as substrates for acid phosphatase, N-acteyl β-glucosaminidase, and α-mannosidase, respectively. To examine the constitutive secretion of lysosomal enzymes over longer periods of time, the cells were grown in HL5 medium for 3 days to a final density of 2 × 106 cells/ml, and then enzymatic activities were determined in the cell pellets and in the supernatants as described above. Multicellular Development of Dictyostelium Amoebae—The ability of Dictyostelium amoebae to initiate multicellular development was assessed as previously described (20Cherix N. Froquet R. Charette S.J. Blanc C. Letourneur F. Cosson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4982-4987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested at a density of 106 cells/ml, washed in HL5, and plated at 106 cells/ml in Petri dishes containing HL5 diluted with phosphate buffer (2 mm Na2HPO4, 14.7 KH2PO4, pH 6.5) as indicated. The cells were incubated at 21 °C to allow development. The presence of multicellular aggregates and the expression of contact site A (csA) 2The abbreviations used are:csAcontact site AMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinase. were assessed after 24 h. Depending on the batch of tryptone used for the preparation of the HL5 medium, the concentration of HL5 needed to inhibit development of wild-type Dictyostelium varied significantly (data not shown). This accounts for the fact that the results presented in this study are quantitatively different from results presented in a previous study (20Cherix N. Froquet R. Charette S.J. Blanc C. Letourneur F. Cosson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4982-4987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). contact site A mitogen-activated protein kinase. Western Blot Analysis—To test whether secreted lysosomal enzymes had undergone proteolytic maturation in endosomal compartments, the cells were incubated in HL5 medium for 3 days. 106 cells were harvested and centrifuged. Proteins in supernatants were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Cellular pellets and precipitated supernatants were resuspended in sample buffer (0.103 g/ml sucrose, 5 × 10–2 m Tris, pH 6.8, 5 × 10–3 m EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 2% SDS), and proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose Protran BA 85 membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were incubated with an anti-cathepsin D rabbit antiserum (1/1500) and then with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad), washed, and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To assess csA expression, 1.5 × 106 cells were harvested and lysed in 40 μl of sample buffer. Proteins (15 μl) were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The membranes were incubated with the anti-csA antibody and then with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences), washed, and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Real Time PCR—The cells (wild-type cells, phg2 cells, and all the phg1 mutants) were grown in HL5 medium for 3 days to a final density of 106 cells/ml. As a positive control, 107 of each mutant cells were incubated for 6 h in phosphate buffer to allow induction of autophagy genes. The cells were harvested, and RNAs were purified with a NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany). The Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used to assess RNA quality. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Amplicons were designed over exon boundaries using the program Primer Express v 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with default parameters. The sequences were aligned against the Dictyostelium genome by BLAST to ensure that they were specific for the gene being tested. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen, and the sequences are as follows: ATG1, 5′-aaacaaatgaaccctttgccata-3′ and 5′-ccgctaatctacaaacatcgacaac-3′; ATG8, 5′-aacgaccacccactcgacaa-3′ and 5′-tgatctaatacgttcagctacttctcttc-3′; and ATG9, 5′-ttaaaactggaagagtcgaccaaa-3′ and 5′-ggagatcgttgacagcgtttaaa-3′. The efficiency of each design was tested with serial dilutions of cDNA. PCRs (10 μl volume) contained diluted cDNA (16 ng), SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 300 nm of forward and reverse primers. PCR was performed on a SDS 7900 HT instrument (Applied Biosystems) with the following parameters: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C 15 s to 60 °C 1 min. Each reaction was performed in triplicate on 384-well plates. Raw Ct values obtained with SDS 2.2.2 (Applied Biosystems) were imported in Excel (Microsoft Corporation) and normalization factors, and fold changes were calculated. Fluid Phase Uptake and Recycling—To measure fluid phase uptake, the cells were incubated for 1 h in HL5 containing 10 μg/ml of Alexa 647-coupled dextran (Molecular Probes, Oregon, WA) at 21 °C. The cells were then washed, and internalized fluorescence was measured. To analyze recycling, the cells were pulsed with HL5 containing 10 μg/ml of Alexa 647-coupled dextran for 2 h. The cells were then chased for various times by incubation in HL5 medium at 21 °C without dextran. The remaining internal fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur (San Jose, CA). TM9 Proteins in S. cerevisiae—Three genes encoding members of the TM9 family can be identified in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae genome: YLR083c(TMN1 (transmembranenine 1)), YDR107c (TMN2), and YER113c (TMN3). Tmn1 (also called Emp70) was previously described as an endosomal membrane protein (21Singer-Kruger B. Frank R. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14376-14386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is 86 and 41% similar to Tmn2 and Tmn3 proteins, respectively. As described earlier (2Benghezal M. Cornillon S. Gebbie L. Alibaud L. Bruckert F. Letourneur F. Cosson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2890-2899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sugasawa T. Lenzen G. Simon S. Hidaka J. Cahen A. Guillaume J.L. Camoin L. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), TM9 proteins can be separated in two groups. Group I is characterized by a conserved motif at position 50 (VGPYXNXQETY) and a short N-terminal domain (220 amino acids), whereas group II exhibits a characteristic sequence immediately after the signal peptide (FY(V/L)PG(VL)AP), and a longer N-terminal domain (280 amino acids). Tmn1 and Tmn2 exhibit the characteristic group II motif (FYLPGVAP and FSLPGLSP, respectively) and a long N-terminal domain (310 and 316 amino acids, respectively). Tmn3, like Dictyostelium Phg1c, does not exhibit characteristics of either group and cannot be classified unambiguously based on these criteria only. Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees based on sequence similarities with human and Dictyostelium TM9 proteins led to the same conclusions (Fig. 1A): Tmn1 and Tmn2 are closely related to Dictyostelium Phg1a (group II); no S. cerevisiae TM9 protein could be unambiguously attributed to group I. In agreement with this, Tmn1 and Tmn2 exhibited the highest degree of identity with Dictyostelium Phg1a (Fig. 1B). TM9 Proteins Are Essential for Yeast Cell Adhesion and Filamentous Growth—TM9 proteins play an essential role in D. discoideum cellular adhesion (2Benghezal M. Cornillon S. Gebbie L. Alibaud L. Bruckert F. Letourneur F. Cosson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2890-2899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in budding yeast, we decided to first examine their role in adhesion. For this, we generated haploid and diploid yeast strains in the dimorphic ∑1278b genetic background carrying deletions in the TMN1, TMN2, and TMN3 genes in all possible combinations. The single, double, or triple deletion strains exhibited no obvious growth defect, suggesting that TM9 proteins are involved in a nonessential cellular function (data not shown). We also failed to detect differential growth in media containing various carbon sources including glucose, galactose, maltose, glycerol, and sucrose (data not shown). Finally, no effect of TM9 mutations on cell morphology or colony shape was apparent (data not shown). In contrast, haploid strains lacking at least one of the three TM9 proteins were severely defective for adhesive growth (Fig. 2A). Single tmn2Δ and Tmn1Δ mutant strains retained a minimal capacity to adhere to the agar surface, whereas no adhesion was observed in the single tmn3Δ mutant or in any of the double and triple mutants. In diploid S. cerevisiae strains, cellular adhesion is required for the development of pseudohyphal filaments in response to nitrogen starvation (12Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 23Mosch H.U. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1997; 145: 671-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the requirement of TM9 proteins for filament formation was tested in homozygous diploid TM9 mutant strains grown on solid nitrogen starvation medium. We found that homozygous diploid single TM9 mutant strains had only a slightly reduced capacity to develop pseudohyphal filaments, whereas the double and triple mutants were completely unable to grow in the filamentous form (Fig. 2B). Thus, although the mechanisms governing cellular adhesion in S. cerevisiae and in D. discoideum are very different, TM9 proteins also play an essential role in cellular adhesion and filamentous growth in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. TM9 Proteins Are Required for Expression of FLO11 and Act Downstream of Ras2 and TOR—The morphogenetic switch to filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae involves the cooperation of at least two different signaling pathways, a MAPK cascade and a cAMP-dependent pathway (16Rupp S. Summers E. Lo H.J. Madhani H. Fink G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 24Gancedo J.M. FEMS Microbiol.

A central element of these two pathways is the GTP-binding protein Ras2, which is thought to stimulate the transcription factor Ste12 via the MAPK pathway. In the cAMP-dependent pathway, activated Ras2 can interact with adenylate cyclase, and this results in an increase of cAMP, which in turn activates cAMP-dependent protein kinases and leads to the activation of Flo8. The TOR pathway also plays a role in sensing nitrogen sources and regulating physiological responses independently of the MAPK and cAMP pathways (28Cutler N.S. Pan X. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4103-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These pathways converge to regulate the expression of the FLO11 gene, which encodes a cell surface flocculin (Fig. 3A), which mediates cell adhesion (29Guo B. Styles C.A. Feng Q. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12158-12163Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 30Verstrepen K.J. Klis F.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown specifically that in the dimorphic ∑1278b genetic background, expression of the cell surface flocculin Flo11 is essential for adhesive growth and filament formation (16Rupp S. Summers E. Lo H.J. Madhani H. Fink G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 31Lo W.S. Dranginis A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 32Braus G.H. Grundmann O. Bruckner S. Mosch H.U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4272-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether expression of FLO11 might be affected by mutations in TM9 genes. We found that in all haploid TM9 mutant strains, expression of a FLO11-lacZ reporter gene was strongly reduced when compared with a wild-type strain (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained with diploid strains (data not shown). Thus, TM9 proteins appear to be involved in the regulation of the expression of adhesion molecules in yeast. To further explore the role of TM9 proteins in regulation of cellular adhesion, we performed a genetic epistasis analysis by expressing the dominant active RAS2VAl19 allele. As expected, this led to increased filament formation in the control strains, but this effect was completely inhibited in all TM9 double and the triple mutant strains (data not shown). Similarly, TOR1 overexpression did not restore filamentous growth in double or triple TM9 mutants (data not shown). These results indicate that TM9 proteins act downstream of the Ras/cAMP and TOR pathways to control FLO11 expression. The activity of the MAPK pathway can be monitored by the FRE(Ty1)-lacZ reporter gene, the expression of which depends on elements of the Kss1-MAPK cascade and the combined action of the transcription factors Ste12 and Tec1 (15Mosch H.U.

https://openalex.org/W2130339832,"Recent evidence suggests that unscheduled cell cycle activity leads to neuronal cell death. 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) is an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase and induces cell death in both striatum and cerebral cortex. Here we analyzed the involvement of aberrant cell cycle progression in 3-NP-induced cell death in these brain regions. 3-NP reduced the level of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 in striatum but not in cerebral cortex. 3-NP also induced phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, a marker of cell cycle progression at late G1 phase, only in striatum. Pharmacological experiments revealed that cyclin-dependent kinase activity and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor were cooperatively involved in cell death by 3-NP in striatal neurons, whereas only NMDA receptor was involved in 3-NP-induced neurotoxicity in cortical neurons. Death of striatal neurons was preceded by elevation of somatic Ca2+ and activation of calpain, a Ca2+-dependent protease. Both striatal p27 down-regulation and cell death provoked by 3-NP were dependent on calpain activity. Moreover, transfection of p27 small interfering RNA reduced striatal cell viability. In cortical neurons, however, there was no change in somatic Ca2+ and calpain activity by 3-NP, and calpain inhibitors were not protective. These results suggest that 3-NP induces aberrant cell cycle progression and neuronal cell death via p27 down-regulation by calpain in striatum but not in the cerebral cortex. This is the first report for differential involvement of cell cycle reactivation in different brain regions and lightens the mechanism for region-selective vulnerability in human disease, including Huntington disease.

Increasing evidence suggests that neuronal apoptosis is involved in neurodegenerative disorders (1Stefanis L. Burke R.E. Greene L.A. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A greater understanding of the cellular signaling pathways that regulate neuronal apoptosis may lead to novel therapeutic targets. However, the signaling pathways are not yet fully understood. Cell cycle progression is regulated through complex events controlled through the actions of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-aldehyde; HD, Huntington disease; Hoechst 33342, bisbenzimide H 33342; MDL28170, Z-Val-Phe-aldehyde; MK801 maleate, (5R, 10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5-10-imine maleate; MSN, medium size spiny neuron; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; NMDA,N-methyl-d-aspartate; 3-NP, 3-nitropropionic acid; OGB-1, Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, AM; PD150606, 3-(4-lodophenyl)-2-mercapto-(Z)-2-propenoic acid; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone. and cyclins. In addition, two classes of CDK inhibitors are involved in cell cycle arrest mechanisms (2Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a growing body of work shows that cell cycle components are involved in neuronal apoptotic death. For instance, neuronal apoptosis is accompanied by changes in CDK activity and cyclin expression (3Freeman R.S. Estus S. Johnson E.M.

Moreover, agents that inhibit cell cycle progression protect neuronal PC12 cells, cortical neurons, sympathetic neurons, and cerebellar granule neurons from apoptotic death (8Farinelli S.E.

These results suggest that cell cycle-related molecules play pivotal roles in multiple forms of neuronal cell death. 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) irreversibly inhibits mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase and interrupts electron transport, inducing impairment of energy metabolism (reviewed in Ref. 14Brouillet E. Jacquard C. Bizat N. Blum D. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1521-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Despite the mitochondrial inhibition broadly in brain (15Brouillet E. Guyot M.C. Mittoux V.

Thus, understanding molecular machinery in 3-NP-induced selective neurodegeneration in striatum gives clues to a therapeutic strategy for HD. Although the mechanism by which 3-NP produces selective vulnerability of the striatal region is not fully understood, Galas et al. (22Galas M.C. Bizat N. Cuvelier L. Bantubungi K. Brouillet E. Schiffmann S.N. Blum D. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 15: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) demonstrated that calpain, a Ca2+-dependent protease, is selectively activated in striatal neurons after 3-NP administration. We previously showed that calpain activation induces cell cycle progression in glutamate-induced neurotoxicity (23Akashiba H. Matsuki N. Nishiyama N. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The first aim of the present study is to examine the involvement of aberrant cell cycle progression in 3-NP-induced neuronal cell death. Our results show that 3-NP treatment induced calpain activation and cell cycle activation in striatal but not in cortical neurons. Primarily cultured neurons derived from both striatum and cerebral cortex are known to be vulnerable to 3-NP (24Behrens M.I. Koh J. Canzoniero L.M.T. Sensi S.L. Csernansky C.A. Choi D.W. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The second aim of the present study is to investigate the shared mechanisms of 3-NP neurotoxicity between cultured striatal and cortical neurons. Our results show that NMDA receptor-dependent neurotoxic mechanisms are common between neurons taken from the two regions. Thus, we here delineated both the difference and commonality in molecular machineries in 3-NP-induced death in striatal and cortical neurons. Primary Neuronal Culture—Primary neuronal cultures of rat striatum and cerebral cortex were prepared as described previously (25Okuda S. Nishiyama N. Saito H. Katsuki H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12553-12558Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) with some modifications. All animal experiments conformed to the Japanese Pharmacological Society guide for the care and use of laboratory animals and the guidance of the University of Tokyo, with care to minimizing the number of animals and their suffering. In brief, whole brains were isolated from fetal rats of the Wistar strain (SLC Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) at embryonic days 17-18, and the striata and cerebral cortices were dissected out and treated with 0.25% trypsin (Difco) and 0.01% deoxyribonuclease I (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were suspended in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest SAS, Nuaille, France). Then they were plated at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/cm2 in 96-well plates (Corning), in 6-well plates (Corning), in a 35-mm dish (Corning), or on glass coverslips (Matsunami Glass Ind. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) equipped with FlexiPerm (Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany) precoated with 0.02% (v/v) polyethyleneimine (Sigma). Cultures were kept at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air. At 24 h after plating, the medium was changed to serum-free Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen). Half of the culture medium was changed every 3 days. Drug Treatment—On day 8 in vitro, drugs were treated by changing half of the culture medium. 3-NP (Sigma) was dissolved in water and brought to pH 7.5 with 1 n NaOH. Caspase-3-specific inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-DEVD-FMK) (Enzyme Systems Products Inc., Livermore, CA); N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) (Sigma); three calpain inhibitors (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (ALLN) (Sigma), Z-Val-Phe-CHO (MDL28170) (Merck), and 3-(4-lodophenyl)-2-mercapto-(Z)-2-propenoic acid (PD150606) (Merck)); and ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (Sigma) were added to the cell cultures simultaneously as they were treated with 3-NP. NMDA receptor antagonist (5R, 10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5-10-imine maleate ((+)-MK801 maleate) (TOCRIS, Park Ellisville, MO) and three pharmacological CDK inhibitors (olomoucine (Sigma), purvalanol A (Merck), and roscovitine (Merck)) were added to the cell cultures 1 h prior to the treatment of 3-NP. All drugs were treated during 3-NP exposure, with continued treatment until assay. 3-NP Injection in Vivo—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (12-16 weeks old, 300-400 g) were housed at two per cage and kept under temperature- and humidity-controlled conditions (23 ± 1 °C and 50 ± 10%, respectively). 3-NP injection was conducted by two methods. In the first group, rats were injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg 3-NP (Sigma; dissolved in 0.9% (w/v) saline and pH adjusted to 7.5 with 1 n NaOH) once every 4 days for 3 weeks (26Borlongan C.V. Koutouzis T.K. Randall T.S. Freeman T.B. Cahill D.W. Sanberg P.R. Brain. Res. Bull. 1995; 36: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the second group, rats were injected intraperitoneally with 7.5 mg/kg 3-NP (Sigma) twice daily for 5 days (27Guyot M.-C. Hantraye P. Dolan R. Palfi S. Maziere M. Brouillet E. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In both groups, control animals received 0.9% (w/v) saline. All rats survived after 3-NP injection. Assessment of Cell Viability—Neuronal cell viability was assessed with two methods. In the first method, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were stained and visualized with cresyl violet (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and also identified as neurons as judged from their morphological characteristics. The number of surviving neurons was counted and normalized by setting the number of surviving neurons in nondrug control cultures as 100%. In the second method, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity that reduces 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to MTT formazan was used to determine cell survival in a quantitative colorimetric assay, a biochemical index for cellular viability (28Abe K. Matsuki N. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 38: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with 0.25 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) for 35 min at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air. The reaction was stopped by a solution (pH 4.7) containing 50% dimethylformamide (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and 20% SDS (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). The amount of intracellular MTT formazan product was quantified spectrophotometrically using a microplate reader (model 550; Bio-Rad) at an excitation wavelength of 570 nm and an emission wavelength of 655 nm. Immunocytochemistry—After fixation as described above, cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 125 mm NaCl) for 15 min. The cultures were incubated with TBS containing 5% goat serum (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature and then with a primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used were anti-p27 (mouse, 1:200 dilution; BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein-2) (rabbit, 1:1000; Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), and anti-DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After washing, the cells were incubated with a fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-goat IgG, 1:1000 dilution; Alexa 568-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, 1:1000 dilution; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. For the last 5 min, cells were incubated with the bisbenzimide, Hoechst 33342 (Sigma), at 5 μg/ml and a fluorescent probe was intercalated into nuclear DNA. After washing, images were acquired with a cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu ORCA II; Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Hamamatsu, Japan) and a ×40 objective lens equipped with an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE300; Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Those images were analyzed using an Aqua-Cosmos system (Hamamatsu Photonics). Immunoblotting—In in vitro analysis, cells were washed with cold TBS and lysed for 30 min on ice in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA disodium salt dihydrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin (Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan), 1 μg/ml pepstatin A (Peptide Institute), 1 mm NaF (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), and 1 mm Na3VO4 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). In in vivo analysis, brains were removed and sectioned at 400-μm thickness, and striatum and cerebral cortex were dissected under a microscope, homogenized, and lysed for 1 h on ice in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer, adding 10 mm aprotinin (Roche Applied Science) and 0.01% deoxyribonuclease I (Sigma). Proteins were denatured by heating at 65 °C in sample buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 0.01% w/v bromphenol blue) for 10 min. Protein concentration was measured using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Samples (20-50 μg) were separated electrophoretically and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 4% nonfat milk in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4 °C on a rotary platform with gentle agitation. The primary antibodies used were anti-p27 (mouse, 1:1000 dilution; BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-β-actin (mouse, 1:2000 dilution; Sigma), and anti-phosphoretinoblastoma protein (Rb) (Ser795) antibody (rabbit, 1:2000 dilution; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). They were subsequently probed with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (diluted 1:1000-1:2000; Sigma). After washing, detection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Biosciences). Equal protein loading was confirmed using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gels or probing with anti-β-actin. To provide semiquantitative analysis, band densitometry analysis of the membrane was performed using scanned images of nonsaturated immunoblot films, using software (Scion Image, version Beta 4.0.2; Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Pixel intensities of the bands obtained in each experiment were normalized using β-actin signals and then calculated as a percentage of control bands in the same membrane. Assessment of Calpain Activity—Assessment of calpain activity was performed by detecting the calpain-mediated breakdown products of α-spectrin in immunoblotting. Cell lysates were prepared as described above; samples were processed for gel electrophoresis and blotting. The primary antibody used was anti-α-spectrin (mouse, 1:1000 dilution; Chemicon). (Pixel intensity × area of 145-kDa α-spectrin breakdown product)/(pixel intensity × area of (145-, 150-, and 280-kDa α-spectrin)) was measured densitometrically using software (Scion Image, version Beta 4.0.2; Scion Corp.). The individual band density was calculated as a percentage of control signals. In Vitro Degradation of p27 with Purified Calpain—On days 7-8 in vitro, striatal cells were washed with cold TBS and then lysed for 30 min on ice in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 1 μg/ml pepstatin A (Peptide Institute), 1 mm NaF (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), and 1 mm Na3VO4 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Calpain inhibitors (ALLN, MDL28170, and PD150606) or ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor (lactacystin) were included in the radioimmunoprecipitation buffer. The cell lysates were incubated with 3.8 units/ml of calpain 1 (Merck) at 25 °C for 10 min. Calcium chloride dihydrate (10 μm) was added to the reaction mixture to increase the free Ca2+ concentration. After the reaction, sample buffer was added. The samples were processed for gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Control experiments verified that the addition of CaCl2 to the radioimmunoprecipitation buffer over the range used in this study did not measurably alter the buffer pH. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Preparation and Transfection—siRNAs were prepared and transfected as previously described (29Akashiba H. Matsuki N. Nishiyama N. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2006; 63: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). siRNAs were synthesized by Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). The target sequences were as follows. Control siRNA was 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′. The 3′-sense strand was labeled with Alexa Fluor-488. Scrambled p27 siRNA was 5′-AAGACCGAGCCATTGAGGTAA-3′. p27 siRNA was 5′-AAGCACUGCCGAGAUAUGGAA-3′. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, Lipofectamine 2000 (5 μl/well) and siRNA (5 μl/well) were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min, and both were mixed at 25 °C for 20 min. The siRNA-lipid mixture was added to the cultures. The final amount of the siRNAs was 100 pmol/well. siRNA was removed by changing the medium at 4 h after the transfection. Ca2+ Imaging—On day 8 in vitro, cells in a 35-mm dish were filled with 2 ml of dye solution and incubated for 1 h in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air as previously described (30Sasaki T. Matsuki N. Ikegaya Y. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The dye solution was Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 10 μl of 0.1% Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, AM (OGB-1; Invitrogen)/Me2SO. Images (16-bit intensity) were captured with a Nipkow-disk confocal unit (CSU10; Yokogawa Electric, Tokyo, Japan), a cooled CCD camera (Cascade 512B/F, Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ), an upright microscope (AxioSkop2; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), water immersion objective (×40, Achroplan; Zeiss), and MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Fluorophores were excited at 488 nm with an argon-krypton laser (15 milliwatts, 641-YB-A01; Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA) and visualized with a 507-nm long pass emission filter. For quantitative analysis, OGB-1 fluorescence intensity in the soma area of each neuron (data in nonneuronal cells were excluded by phase-contrast image) were measured using software (Image J, version 1.371.20; Microsoft Java, Redmond, WA) and then calculated as a percentage of control in nontreated cultures. Statistical Evaluation—Data are shown as mean ± S.E. To avoid possible variation of the cell cultures, data were pooled from at least two independent experiments. For statistical analyses, one-way analysis of variance was followed by Tukey's test. 3-NP Induces Cell Death both in Cultured Striatal and Cortical Neurons—3-NP treatment of cultured striatal cells resulted in concentration- and time-dependent reduction in the number of surviving neurons, as observed in cresyl violet (Nissl) staining (Fig. 1A). 3-NP did not affect neuronal viability at 0.1 and 0.3 mm, but marked cell death was apparent in cultures treated with 3-NP at concentrations as low as 1 mm (Fig. 1A). In the presence of 1 and 3 mm 3-NP, about 60 and 70% of total neurons degenerated at 48 h, respectively. Similarly, exposure of cortical neurons to 3-NP resulted in concentration- and time-dependent reduction in the number of surviving neurons (Fig. 1B). 3-NP did not show toxic effect at 0.1 and 0.3 mm, but marked cell death was apparent in cultures treated with 3-NP at more than 1 mm (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 1 and 3 mm 3-NP, about 30 and 40% of total cortical neurons degenerated at 48 h, respectively. In both striatal and cortical cultures, the surviving neurons, as judged from the cresyl violet-positive staining, displayed deformed morphology (Fig. 1, C-F). We also evaluated cell survival by MTT assay. The results obtained with this method showed concentration- and time-dependent toxicity of 3-NP both in cultured striatal and cortical neurons, which were almost identical with the results of the cresyl violet staining method (Fig. 1, G and H). Because the two methods gave similar results, the following experiments to assess neuronal viability were performed with MTT assay. Next we examined whether striatal neurons sensitive to 3-NP were medium size spiny neurons (MSNs). We performed immunocytochemical analysis using labeling for DARPP-32, a molecule enriched in MSNs (31Bogush A. Pedrini S. Pelta-Heller J. Chan T. Yang Q. Mao Z. Sluzas E. Gieringer T. Ehrlich M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7352-7359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Under control conditions, about 90% of striatal neurons were DARPP-32-positive in our experiment (data not shown). In cultures exposed to 3-NP (1 mm) for 48 h, the number of DARPP-32-positive cells decreased by about 30% compared with nontreated controls (Fig. 1, I-K). 3-NP Decreases p27 Expression in Cultured Striatal but Not in Cortical Neurons—Our previous work suggests that among CDK inhibitors involved in cell cycle arrest, p27 plays a critical role in regulation of cell cycle progression and neuronal survival (29Akashiba H. Matsuki N. Nishiyama N. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2006; 63: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis using triple labeling for a neuronal marker MAP2, p27, and a nuclear marker Hoechst dye revealed that p27 is localized in the nucleus of striatal neurons under control conditions (Fig. 2, A-D). This pattern of p27 expression in cultured striatal neurons is similar to that in cultured cortical neurons, as shown in our previous research (23Akashiba H. Matsuki N. Nishiyama N. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Next, we analyzed the p27 expression after 3-NP treatment in both cultures with an immunoblotting method. 3-NP treatment decreased the expression level of p27 concentration- and time-dependently in striatal neurons (Fig. 2, E and F). However, p27 expression in cortical neurons was unchanged by 3-NP treatment at all concentrations and times examined (Fig. 2, G and H). Transfection of p27 siRNA Induces Cell Death in Cultured Striatal Neurons—We previously showed that transfection of p27 siRNA induced cell death through elevating cell cycle activity in cultured cortical neurons, suggesting that reduction of endogenous p27 is sufficient for cell death in cortical neurons (29Akashiba H. Matsuki N. Nishiyama N. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2006; 63: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The same p27 siRNA was transfected to cultured striatal neurons to examine its effect on cell cycle progression and cell viability. The expression level of p27 was decreased at 48 h after the transfection of p27 siRNA at 100 pmol/well, whereas control siRNA or scrambled p27 siRNA had no effect on p27 expression (Fig. 3A). When the cell cycle transits from G1 to S phase, tumor suppressor Rb is phosphorylated by CDKs (32Liu D.X. Greene L.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To examine whether reduction of p27 is critical for cell cycle progression, we analyzed the Rb phosphorylation status on a CDK consensus site, Ser-795, by p27 knockdown. Transfection of p27 siRNA increased the expression level of phosphorylated Rb at 48 h after transfection, whereas control siRNA or scrambled p27 siRNA had no effect on Rb phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). p27 siRNA reduced striatal neuronal viability at about 55% at 48 h after the transfection, whereas control siRNA or scrambled p27 siRNA did not affect the viability of striatal neurons (Fig. 3B). 3-NP Induces Rb Phosphorylation in Cultured Striatal but Not in Cortical Neurons—Next, we analyzed the Rb phosphorylation status after 3-NP treatment using the phosphoepitope antibody in cultured striatal and cortical neurons. Only a trace level of phosphorylated Rb immunoreactivity was detected in nontreated cultures from both regions (Fig. 4, A-D). The expression level of phosphorylated Rb was up-regulated concentration- and time-dependently after 3-NP treatment in striatal neurons (Fig. 4, A and B). On the other hand, expression level of phosphorylated Rb did not increase after 3-NP treatment in cortical neurons at all concentrations and times examined (Fig. 4, C and D). CDK and NMDA Receptor Activities Are Cooperatively Involved in 3-NP-induced Cell Death in Cultured Striatal Neurons, whereas Only NMDA Receptor Activity Is Involved in 3-NP-induced Cell Death in Cultured Cortical Neurons—We next examined whether CDK activity is involved in the 3-NP-induced cell death in striatal and cortical cultures with pharmacological experiments. Three pharmacological CDK inhibitors, olomoucine (0.1-1 μm), purvalanol A (1-3 μm), and roscovitine (0.3-1 μm), partially but significantly protected striatal neurons from 3-NP-induced cell death (Fig. 5A). These pharmacological CDK inhibitors, however, did not exert a protective effect against 3-NP toxicity in cortical neurons (Fig. 5B). 3-NP-induced blockade of ATP production may hamper sodium-potassium-ATPase pumps and lead to reduced plasma membrane potentials (33Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 31: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). This would produce relief of voltage-dependent Mg2+ blockade of NMDA receptors"
https://openalex.org/W2084237334,"The PfPMT enzyme of Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of severe human malaria, is a member of a large family of known and predicted phosphoethanolamine methyltransferases (PMTs) recently identified in plants, worms, and protozoa. Functional studies in P. falciparum revealed that PfPMT plays a critical role in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine via a plant-like pathway involving serine decarboxylation and phosphoethanolamine methylation. Despite their important biological functions, PMT structures have not yet been solved, and nothing is known about which amino acids in these enzymes are critical for catalysis and binding to S-adenosyl-methionine and phosphoethanolamine substrates. Here we have performed a mutational analysis of PfPMT focused on 24 residues within and outside the predicted catalytic motif. The ability of PfPMT to complement the choline auxotrophy of a yeast mutant defective in phospholipid methylation enabled us to characterize the activity of the PfPMT mutants. Mutations in residues Asp-61, Gly-83 and Asp-128 dramatically altered PfPMT activity and its complementation of the yeast mutant. Our analyses identify the importance of these residues in PfPMT activity and set the stage for advanced structural understanding of this class of enzymes.

About 41% of the population of the world lives in malaria endemic areas, and every year more than 2 million people die from the disease (1WHO Expert Committee on Malaria (2000) World Health Organ. Tech. Rep. Ser. 892, i-v, 1-74Google Scholar). Malaria is caused by an intraerythrocytic protozoan parasite of the genus Plasmodium. Of the four species that infect humans, Plasmodium falciparum causes the most lethal form of the disease and has developed resistance to almost all the available drugs in the antimalarial armamentarium (2White N.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). New chemotherapeutic strategies are now needed to combat this disease. One strategy is to target the metabolic pathways that the parasite uses to synthesize new membranes, which are critical for parasite development and multiplication within erythrocytes (3Vial H.J. Ben Mamoun C. Sherman I.W. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC2005: 327-352Google Scholar). Various inhibitors of lipid metabolism have been shown to inhibit P. falciparum proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and several efforts are being made to advance these compounds for treatment of malaria.Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) 3The abbreviations used are: PtdChophosphatidylcholinePfPMTP. falciparum phosphoethanolamine methyltransferaseSAMS-adenosyl-l-methioninePtdInsphosphatidylinositolPtdSerphosphatidylserinePtdEtnphosphatidylethanolamine. 3The abbreviations used are: PtdChophosphatidylcholinePfPMTP. falciparum phosphoethanolamine methyltransferaseSAMS-adenosyl-l-methioninePtdInsphosphatidylinositolPtdSerphosphatidylserinePtdEtnphosphatidylethanolamine. composes half of the phospholipid content of the parasite membranes (4Vial H. Ancelin M. Sherman I. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Biogenesis, Protection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1998: 159-175Google Scholar). Biochemical studies demonstrated that PtdCho synthesis occurs via two metabolic routes (5Pessi G. Ben Mamoun C. Future Medicine, Future Lipidology. 2006; 1: 173-180www.futuremedicine.com/loi/flpCrossref Google Scholar, 6Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Ben Mamoun C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The first route is the CDP-choline pathway, which uses host choline as a precursor. In this pathway choline is first phosphorylated to phosphocholine and then converted to CDP-choline. Subsequently, CDP-choline and diacylglycerol function as substrates for PtdCho synthesis. The second route is the serine decarboxylation-phosphoethanolamine methylation pathway (6Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Ben Mamoun C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This pathway uses serine either transported from the host or generated by degradation of host proteins as a phospholipid precursor. The serine is first decarboxylated to produce ethanolamine, by an unknown serine decarboxylase. The ethanolamine is next phosphorylated by a parasite-specific ethanolamine kinase. A SAM-dependent triple methylation of the resulting phosphoethanolamine by a plant-like phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase results in the synthesis of phosphocholine (6Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Ben Mamoun C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This product is then integrated into the CDP-choline pathway for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (6Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Ben Mamoun C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, no PfPMT homologs could be found in mammalian databases, suggesting that this protein could be an ideal target for development of novel antimalarial lipid inhibitors.In this paper we report the biochemical and genetic characterization of PfPMT using yeast as a surrogate system. Scanning alanine mutagenesis of 24 conserved residues was performed followed by analysis of the activity of the mutant enzymes in vitro and in vivo using a functional complementation assay in yeast. Three residues, Asp-61, Gly-83, and Asp-128, were found to play a critical role in PfPMT catalysis and substrate binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrain Construction, Growth Conditions, and Media—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain pem1Δpem2Δ (Matα his3ΔI leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 pem1::Kanrpem2::Kanr) was used in this study. Standard methods for yeast culture and manipulation were used (13Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology in Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). Yeast was cultivated at 30 °C in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose or in synthetic minimal media containing 2% glucose (SD medium) or 2% galactose (SG medium) supplemented with histidine (30 μg/ml), leucine (100 μg/ml), ethanolamine (200 μg/ml), or choline (140 μg/ml) as required to maintain cell growth.Site-directed Mutagenesis—To generate PfpmtD61A, PfpmtD61E, PfpmtD61N PfpmtG83A, PfpmtD128A, PfpmtD128E, and PfpmtD128N mutants for expression in S. cerevisiae, site-directed mutagenesis using the GeneTailor™ site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen) with primers described in supplemental Table SI was performed on the codon-optimized version of PfPMT (PfPMTCO) cloned in the pYes2.1-/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The primary structures of all the clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For expression in Escherichia coli, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on PfPMT cloned in the pET15b vector (Novagen) using the primers described in supplemental Table S2. Expression and purification of recombinant PfpmtD61A, PfpmtD61E, PfpmtD61N PfpmtG83A, PfpmtD128A, PfpmtD128E, and PfpmtD128N was accomplished in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus strain (Stratagene) and purified as previously described (6Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Ben Mamoun C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Complementation Assay—pem1Δpem2Δ strains harboring wild-type or mutant PfpmtCO under the regulatory control of the GAL1 promoter were grown overnight in SD medium supplemented with 1 mm choline, then washed three times and starved for choline by incubation in SD medium lacking choline (SD-Cho) overnight. Cells were washed again and inoculated at an A660 = 0.03 in SD or SG media containing choline, ethanolamine, or neither. The A660 was measured at different time points during the 4 days of continuous culture.Immunoblotting—S. cerevisiae wild-type and pem1Δpem2Δ cells harboring pYES2.1, pYES2.1 GAL1::PfPMTco, and mutant forms of Pfpmtco were grown in 30 ml of SD or SG media to A600 = 1 at 30 °C. Y-PER reagent was used to extract the soluble protein fractions from the S. cerevisiae strains. Western blot analysis was performed using proteins from cells grown in minimal medium containing choline with or without glucose or galactose. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-V5 primary antibody (Invitrogen, 1:5000 dilution) to detect Pfpmt and anti-hexokinase (1:10000) antibodies as a loading control.Lipid Phosphorus Measurement—pem1Δpem2Δ cells harboring the pYES2.1 vector containing either wild-type PfPMTCO or mutant forms of PfPMTCO were pre-grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C in synthetic uracil-dropout media containing 4% galactose (SG-URA medium) supplemented with ethanolamine (2 mm) and choline (2 mm). The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with water, and diluted to A600 = 0.03 in 50 ml of SG medium lacking uracil (SG-URA) but supplemented with ethanolamine (2 mm) and grown to A600 ∼ 1.5. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with water. The lipids were extracted as described previously (14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42028) Google Scholar). The phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica 60 plates using chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (84.5/45/6.5 v/v/v) followed by chloroform/acetic acid/methanol/water (90/30/6/2.6 v/v/v). Lipids were visualized with iodine vapor and six classes of phospholipids (PtdCho, PtdEtn, PtdSer, PtdIns, Ptd2Gro (cardiolipin), phosphatidic acid) were excised from the plate and quantified by measuring phosphorus (15Rouser G. Siakatose A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). The results are shown as the percentage of total lipid phosphorus in each phospholipid fraction. Data are the means ± S.D. for three independent experiments.Analysis by Circular Dichroism—The purified proteins were dialyzed against 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 100 mm sodium chloride, and just before the measurement, the buffer was exchanged with 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 100 mm sodium fluoride. The protein concentration was determined using the Edelhoch method (16Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). The circular dichroism spectrum of the purified recombinant protein (10 μm) was recorded between 190 and 280 nm using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter as previously described (17Nikulina K. Patel-King R.S. Takebe S. Pfister K.K. King S.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 57: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Enzyme Assays—The in vitro enzymatic activities of the purified wild-type and mutant Pfpmt proteins were determined by measuring the incorporation of radioactivity from [methyl-14C]SAM into N-methylated derivatives of phosphoethanolamine as previously described (6Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Ben Mamoun C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The kinetic properties of Pfpmt for the phosphoethanolamine substrate were determined under saturating concentrations of the cosubstrate SAM (2 mm) and with increasing concentrations of phosphoethanolamine (30 μm to2mm). Likewise, the affinity of Pfpmt for its cosubstrate SAM was determined by using different concentrations of SAM (30 μm to2mm) and a saturating concentration of phosphoethanolamine (2 mm). Fifty to 100 μg of purified enzyme was used for the assay.RESULTSMutagenesis and Functional Complementation in Yeast—We have previously shown that a codon-optimized P. falciparum Pfpmt gene complements the choline auxotrophy of the yeast pem1Δpem2Δ mutant lacking the two phospholipid methyltransferases, Pem1p and Pem2p (7Pessi G. Choi J.Y. Reynolds J.M. Voelker D.R. Ben Mamoun C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12461-12466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To characterize residues in PfPMT that play a critical role in the transmethylation reaction leading to the formation of phosphocholine from phosphoethanolamine, a sequence alignment of PfPMT with PMTs from other species was analyzed (Fig. 1). Twenty-four conserved residues in or near the predicted catalytic motifs of PfPMT were mutated to alanine in the pYes-PfPMTCO vector, which harbors the codon-optimized PfPMTCO. In this vector expression of wild-type and mutant PfPMTs is under the regulatory control of the yeast GAL1 promoter that enables expression in the presence of galactose as the sole carbon source but is repressed when glucose is added. The resulting wild-type and mutated proteins harbor a C-terminal V5 and hexahistidine double tag, which allows monitoring of expression in yeast. Transformants were selected on choline-containing medium and then tested for growth on glucose or galactose media lacking choline and/or supplemented with ethanolamine. Of the 24 mutants tested, only three, Asp-61, Gly-83, and Asp-128, failed to complement the choline auxotrophy of pem1Δpem2Δ mutant (Fig. 2). The mutations in PfPMT in these three mutants reside in catalytic motifs I and P-I and outside of catalytic motif II, respectively (Fig. 1). As expected, transformants harboring an empty vector failed to grow in the absence of choline, whereas those harboring a wild-type copy of PfPMT grew normally on galactose medium lacking choline (Fig. 2). To further investigate the phenotype of these three mutants, pem1Δpem2Δ strains harboring PfpmtD61A, PfpmtG83A, PfpmtD128A were inoculated at 104 cells/ml of culture, and cell growth was followed by measuring changes in cell density over time. As a control, pem1Δpem2Δ strains harboring an empty vector, wild-type PfPMT, or the mutated PfpmtG63A and PfpmtG153A, which were not affected by choline deprivation, were also tested. Using this assay, no growth could be detected in pem1Δpem2Δ harboring PfpmtD61A, PfpmtG83A, and PfpmtD128A during 2 days of culture in galactose medium lacking choline. The phenotype of strains expressing PfpmtG83A and PfpmtD128A was indistinguishable from that of pem1Δpem2Δ harboring an empty vector (Fig. 3). By comparison, strains expressing PfpmtD61A showed a severe growth defect during the first 48 h of incubation, but a significant increase in cell density was observed after 2.5 days of incubation. The pem1Δpem2Δ strains harboring wild-type PfPMT or mutated PfpmtG63A or PfpmtG153A exhibited a similar growth rate in galactose medium lacking or supplemented with choline (Fig. 3). To further investigate the side chain contribution in residues Asp-61 and Asp-128 in PfPMT activity, these amino acids were also mutated to glutamate and asparagine, and the growth of the pem1Δpem2Δ strains harboring PfpmtD61E, PfpmtD61N, PfpmtD128E, and PfpmtD128N was monitored. Similar to PfpmtD61A and PfpmtD128A mutants, PfpmtD61E, PfpmtD61N, PfpmtD128E, and PfpmtD128N mutants did not grow in galactose medium lacking choline (Fig. 3). As expected, none of the strains grew in glucose medium lacking choline. To rule out the possibility that the lack of activity was due to lack or reduced expression of recombinant proteins in yeast, immunoblot analyses were performed on protein extracts from pem1Δpem2Δ strains harboring wild-type or mutated PfPMT proteins using anti-V5 antibodies. Similar PfPMT expression levels were detected in all strains, and as expected, no signal could be detected using protein extracts from pem1Δpem2Δ strains harboring an empty vector (Fig. 4). As a control, antibodies against the yeast hexokinase were used and showed similar levels in all strains (Fig. 4).FIGURE 2Functional complementation of choline auxotrophic S. cerevisiae strain, pem1Δpem2Δ, by expression of the wild-type (WT) PfPMT, mutated forms (PfpmtD61A, PfpmtG83A, PfpmtD128A, PfpmtG63A, PfpmtG153A), or the empty expression vector.

Phospholipids were prepared from pem1Δpem2Δ strains harboring wild-type and mutant forms of PfPMT, grown in the absence of choline, analyzed by TLC, and quantified (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). Whereas no differences in the levels of PtdEtn could be detected among the various strains tested, the PtdCho level was dramatically affected in the pem1Δpem2Δ strain expressing PfpmtG83A, PfpmtD128A, or PfpmtD61A. The PtdCho content of the pem1Δpem2Δ mutant harboring a wild-type PfPMT was 14% that of total phospholipid. In contrast, the pem1Δpem2Δ strain harboring PfpmtG83A or PfpmtD128A or PfpmtD61A had PtdCho contents of ∼0.5, ∼2, or ∼3%, respectively (Fig. 5). As expected for the pem1Δpem2Δ strain containing PfpmtG63A or PfpmtG153A, the PtdCho contents were 7 and 13%, respectively, consistent with their ability to grow in the absence of exogenous choline. The PtdSer level was also significantly lower in the pem1Δpem2Δ strain with PfpmtG83A, PfpmtD128A, or PfpmtD61A compared with that with PfPMT, PfpmtG63A, and PfpmtG153A (Fig. 6). Conversely, the PtdIns level was ∼3-fold higher in pem1Δpem2Δ strain containing PfpmtG83A, PfpmtD128A, and PfpmtG63A, and PfpmtG153A (Fig. 6).FIGURE 5Two-dimensional TLC fractionation of the phospholipid constituents of pem1Δpem2Δ strains expressing wild-type PfPMT, mutated forms (PfpmtD61A, PfpmtG83A, PfpmtD128A, PfpmtG63A, and PfpmtG153A), or the empty vector, grown in the absence of choline.

The CD profiles of PfpmtD61A, PfpmtG83A, and PfpmtD128A were similar to that of wild-type PfPMT, with a strong peak around 222 nm indicative of extensive helix content. The molar ellipticity of each mutant is consistent with normally folded proteins when compared with wild type. The secondary structure content of PfpmtG83A is comparable with wild type, whereasPfpmtD128A exhibited decreased helical content, and PfpmtD61A exhibited increased helical content relative to wild type. Thermal unfolding experiments were consistent with the equilibrium measurements of secondary structure content; PfpmtG83A exhibited a Tm close to that of wild type, whereas PfpmtD61A and PfpmtD128A exhibited Tm values above and below wild type, respectively (Fig. 7B). The thermal unfolding transition for PfpmtD128A is broader than wild type, consistent with a less cooperative unfolding transition expected on the basis of lower helical content.FIGURE 7A, circular dichroism analysis of the conformational state of the wild-type and mutated forms of PfPMT proteins. The spectrum of 10 μm concentrations of each protein is plotted as the mean residue ellipticity (Θ) versus wavelength.

The apparent Km of wild-type PfPMT for SAM and phosphoethanolamine was estimated to be ∼35.23 and 66.1 μm, respectively, whereas its Vmax for SAM and phosphoethanolamine was 0.30 and 0.95 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). No activity could be detected with the mutated Pfpmt proteins.DISCUSSIONThe transmethylation of phosphoethanolamine by the malarial phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase, PfPMT, is critical for the synthesis of PtdCho in the human parasite P. falciparum (5Pessi G.

They share significant sequence similarity but seem to have evolved different structural and biochemical properties. The plant PMTs have two catalytic domains, with the N-terminal domain involved in the methylation of phosphoethanolamine into monomethylphosphoethanolamine and the C-terminal domains involved in the last two methylation reactions to form phosphocholine (8Bolognese C.P.

https://openalex.org/W2068673241,"We previously reported that chronic nicotine infusion blocks development of Pneumocystis pneumonia. This discovery developed from our work demonstrating the inability of this fungal pathogen to synthesize the critical metabolic intermediate S-adenosylmethionine and work by others showing nicotine to cause lung-specific reduction of S-adenosylmethionine in guinea pigs. We had found nicotine infusion to cause increased lung ornithine decarboxylase activity (rate-controlling enzyme of polyamine synthesis) and hypothesized that S-adenosylmethionine reduction is driven by up-regulated polyamine biosynthesis. Here we report a critical test of our hypothesis; inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase blocks the effect of nicotine on lung S-adenosylmethionine. Further support is provided by metabolite analyses showing nicotine to cause a strong diversion of S-adenosylmethionine toward polyamine synthesis and away from methylation reactions; these shifts are reversed by inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase. Because the nicotine effect on Pneumocystis is so striking, we considered the possibility of tissue specificity. Using laser capture microdissection, we collected samples of lung alveolar regions (site of infection) and respiratory epithelium for controls. We found nicotine to cause increased ornithine decarboxylase protein in alveolar regions but not airway epithelium; we conclude that tissue specificity likely contributes to the effect of nicotine on Pneumocystis pneumonia. Earlier we reported that the full effect of nicotine requires 3 weeks of treatment, and here we show recovery is symmetrical, also requiring 3 weeks after treatment cessation. Because this time frame is similar to pneumocyte turnover time, the shift in polyamine metabolism may occur as new pneumocytes are produced.

Pneumocystis is an opportunistic fungus causing Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) 2The abbreviations used are: PCPPneumocystis pneumoniaAdoMetS-adenosylmethioninedcAdoMetdecarboxylated AdoMetODCornithine decarboxylaseSSATspermine/spermidine acetyl transferaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMTAmethylthioadenosineDFMOdl-α-difluoromethylornithineAdoMetDCAdoMet decarboxylaseLCMlaser capture microdissection. in people immunosuppressed because of AIDS, cancer chemotherapy, treatment to prevent transplant rejection, treatment for rheumatic diseases, severe malnutrition, etc. S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is a critical biochemical intermediate serving both as the methyl donor for a myriad of biochemical events and as the aminopropyl donor for polyamine synthesis. This pivotal intermediate is synthesized from ATP and methionine by all cells, the only known exceptions being Pneumocystis and some rickettsial bacteria that scavenge AdoMet from their hosts. The unprecedented requirement of a eukaryote for exogenous AdoMet was discovered in work initially directed toward improving Pneumocystis culture. We found that the addition of AdoMet to axenic Pneumocystis culture allows limited growth that is not possible without exogenous AdoMet and that Pneumocystis uses a highly specific transporter to acquire this essential metabolite (1Merali S. Vargas D. Franklin M. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14958-14963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We also reported that AdoMet consumption by Pneumocystis affects host AdoMet; plasma AdoMet is depleted in a rat model of PCP (2Merali S. Saric M. Chin K. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and in patients with PCP (3Skelly M. Hoffman J. Fabbri M. Holzman R.S. Clarkson A.B. Merali S.

Dis. 2008; 46: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This led to the prediction that deliberate reduction of host AdoMet will reduce susceptibility to PCP. A means for testing this was suggested by data reported 20 years ago: parenteral nicotine administration to guinea pigs causes selective reduction of lung AdoMet (5Godin C.S. Crooks P.A. Toxicol. Lett. 1986; 31: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Encouraging circumstantial support came from a large clinical study of factors that might relate to rates of PCP relapse in people with AIDS. Smoking was included as one of the parameters, and although no explanation was offered, a significant negative correlation was reported between smoking and PCP relapse (6Shivji M. Burger S. Moncada C.A. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Merali S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15219-15228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We tested whether nicotine would reduce rat lung AdoMet, as reported for guinea pigs (5Godin C.S. Crooks P.A. Toxicol. Lett. 1986; 31: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and found the effect to be similar (6Shivji M. Burger S. Moncada C.A. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Merali S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15219-15228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Infusion of the R-(+)-nicotine isomer caused a 15-fold reduction in lung AdoMet with no change in plasma or liver AdoMet. When nicotine was evaluated in a rat model of PCP, it was strongly protective (6Shivji M. Burger S. Moncada C.A. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Merali S. J. Biol.

Understanding the shifts in metabolic pathways that drive nicotine-induced lung AdoMet depletion is interesting from a biochemical point of view and important for understanding how nicotine blocks development of PCP. Furthermore, it is possible that some part of nicotine toxicity relates to decreased lung AdoMet. We began our investigation by applying proteomic and biochemical techniques, and results led to the hypothesis that polyamine metabolism is involved (6Shivji M. Burger S. Moncada C.A. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Merali S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15219-15228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We found that nicotine causes no change in lung activity of the AdoMet-synthesizing enzyme methionine-adenosyl transferase; thus we concluded that AdoMet synthesis is likely not affected. Because the major use of AdoMet is for methylation reactions, we looked for changes in response to nicotine. Shifts in methylation rates are reflected by changes in the “methylation index,” the ratio of the byproduct of methyl donation, S-adenosyl homocysteine, to AdoMet (7Fojtova M. Kovarik A. Votruba I. Holy A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This index increases whenever there is a significant increase in the rate of AdoMet-mediated methylation reactions for nucleic acid or protein methylation, for methionine regeneration, for lipid synthesis, or for any other methyl donation pathway or combination of pathways. We found nicotine treatment not to affect the lung methylation index, an observation confirmed by data in Table 2 of this publication; thus we concluded that AdoMet depletion was not driven by increased methylation activity. Using two-dimensional gel separation of protein extracts from lungs of rats treated with nicotine and controls, densitometry of gel spots for quantitation of differentially expressed proteins, and peptide mass fingerprint for identification of these proteins, we found ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to be up-regulated 14-fold. Subsequent enzymatic assay of lung homogenates showed a 20-fold increase. ODC is the regulating enzyme for polyamine synthesis, an AdoMet-consuming pathway. The first steps of polyamine synthesis are parallel decarboxylations of ornithine by ODC and AdoMet by AdoMetDC; the former produces putrescine, and the latter produces decarboxylated AdoMet (dcAdoMet). Spermidine is the result of an aminopropyl transfer from dcAdoMet onto one of the amino groups of putrescine. Spermine results from transfer of a second aminopropyl group onto the other amino group of the putrescine core of spermidine. This increase in ODC led us to consider up-regulation of polyamine metabolism as the mechanism underlying nicotine-induced lung AdoMet depletion (6Shivji M. Burger S. Moncada C.A. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Merali S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15219-15228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the polyamine content of lungs showed only an approximate 2-fold increase in putrescine, the product of ODC, and no change in the other major polyamines, spermidine and spermine, results confirmed by the data in Table 1. One interpretation is that, despite changes in ODC, polyamine synthesis does not increase significantly and is not responsible for AdoMet depletion. An alternative hypothesis is that polyamine synthesis does increase, but catabolism also increases, resulting in increased AdoMet consumption with little change in lung polyamine concentrations; we found evidence of increased polyamine catabolism. The key polyamine catabolic enzyme spermine/spermidine acetyl transferase (SSAT) is increased 4.5-fold in the lungs of nicotine-treated rats, and N-1-acetylspermidine, a product of that enzyme, is increased 11-fold. The 2-fold increase in putrescine without increases in spermidine and spermine is consistent with increased catabolism in that enhanced SSAT activity will accelerate spermidine/spermine degradation, whereas declining AdoMet concentration will cause slower spermidine/spermine synthesis, thus increasing the ratio of putrescine to spermidine/spermine. Although these data support the hypothesis that nicotine causes lung AdoMet depletion by stimulating polyamine metabolism, the evidence is indirect. Here we report data directly demonstrating that nicotine-induced rat lung AdoMet depletion treatment is driven by increased polyamine metabolism. We also report that AdoMet reduction in response to nicotine is not a general lung response but is specific for the alveolar region, the site of Pneumocystis infection.TABLE 2AdoMet and AdoMet metabolites in response to treatment with nicotine, DFMO, and nicotine plus DFMOAdoMetanmol (g of wet tissue)–1AdoMetDCbnmol dcAdoMet (mg of protein) –1 h–1dcAdoMetanmol (g of wet tissue)–1MTAanmol (g of wet tissue)–1AdoHcyanmol (g of wet tissue)–1Group 1: nicotinecNicotine and DFMO were dissolved in saline.

However, the correct control data set was used to calculate changes induced by DFMO alone Open table in a new tab Chemicals and Supplies—DFMO was from ILEX Oncology, (San Antonio, TX). Ultrapure AdoMet, spermidine, spermine, putrescine and R-(+)-nicotine were from Sigma-Aldrich. AccQ.Fluor reagent kits were from Waters Corp. (Milford, MA). Dexamethasone sodium phosphate (10 mg ml-1 for injection) was from Elkins-Sinn, Inc. (Cherry Hill, NJ). Administration of Drugs—Nicotine and DFMO were delivered to animals by infusion pumps (Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, Plano, TX) implanted subcutaneously in the suprascapular region as previously described (8Merali S. Chin K. Grady R.W. Weissberger L. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The pumps had a chamber volume of 1.0 ml, a flow rate of 500 μl day-1, and a catheter to deliver drug to the peritoneum. Pump solutions were changed as follows. The needle of an “infusion set” was inserted percutaneously into the pump fill port, and the pump was drained into an attached syringe to measure the volume remaining; this allowed delivery rate calculation and confirmation of the manufacturer's reported delivery rate when implanted and filled with our drug solution. To flush and refill, a second infusion set was inserted, and 3 ml of fresh solution was slowly injected into the pump and drained through the first infusion set. The draining infusion set was then removed, and 1.0 ml of fresh solution was injected to refill the pump reservoir. The 1.0-ml reservoir required refilling every other day, but because AdoMet degrades rapidly, solutions containing AdoMet were replaced daily. At the time the pumps were implanted, the animals weighed 160–170 g. Immunosuppression by dexamethasone without Pneumocystis carinii inoculation typically caused a weight drop to 130–140 grams after 4 weeks. Nominal dose rates reported in the results were calculated at the beginning of the experiment based on a mean body weight of 160 g; however, because of weight loss resulting from dexamethasone treatment, the dose rate can increase by as much as 20% by the end of the treatment period. Immunosuppression of Animals—Specific pathogen-free SD rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were housed in a barrier colony and maintained on multiple antibiotics to avoid other opportunistic infections, as previously described (9Saric M. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The rats were pretreated with a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for 21 days to reduce latent infections. After trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole treatment, infusion pumps were implanted and delivered saline during the 7 days allowed for recovery before immunosuppression was begun by adding dexamethasone in the drinking water (1.5 mg l-1), and drug delivery was begun by changing pump solutions. This protocol was used because earlier nicotine lung AdoMet data were collected with immunosuppressed rats. To control for dexamethasone, we performed an experiment using four groups of four rats each that were treated by pump infusion of the following: saline only, saline plus dexamethasone, nicotine only, and nicotine plus dexamethasone. After 3 weeks treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and the lungs were analyzed for AdoMet. The respective mg of AdoMet (g lung)-1 were: 6.78 ± 1.2, 7.22 ± 0.55, 0.78 ± 0.44, and 0.67 ± 0.23. Thus nicotine treatment caused an 88.5% reduction in lung AdoMet in animals not treated with dexamethasone and a 91.7% reduction in animals treated with dexamethasone. Because these results are similar, we conclude that dexamethasone does not interfere with the action of nicotine on lung AdoMet, nor is it required. Analysis for AdoMet, AdoMet Metabolites, and Polyamines—The AdoMet contents of lung, liver, and plasma samples were measured by HPLC analysis using Waters AccQ.Fluor derivitizing reagent as previously reported (1Merali S. Vargas D. Franklin M. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14958-14963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For biological samples, the limit of detection is 0.5 nmol, and linearity extends to 5,000 nmol. All of the samples were analyzed in triplicate, and the coefficient of variation ranged from 5 to 17%, depending on the amount of AdoMet in the sample. The polyamines spermidine, spermine, and putrescine and AdoMet metabolites methylthioadenosine (MTA) and dcAdoMet were analyzed by HPLC using Waters' AccQ.Fluor derivitizing reagent as previously reported (10Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1996; 675: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Polyamine and AdoMet metabolite pools are expressed as nmol polyamine (g lung)-1. Analysis for Nicotine—Measurement of R-(+)-nicotine in plasma was by our capillary zone electrophoresis method (6Shivji M. Burger S. Moncada C.A. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Merali S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15219-15228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A P/ACE MDQ system equipped with a photodiode array detector allowed electropherograms to be monitored at 257 and 205 nm. Sample preparation involved adding 20 μl of 10% perchloric acid to 80 μl of plasma to precipitate proteins that were removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were stored for up to 7 days at -20 °C before analysis. Just prior to analysis, the samples were diluted 1:1 with water. Separation utilized an amine capillary kit (Beckman, Inc.; 50-mm inner diameter × 60-cm total length, 50 cm to the detector window) and the following protocol: 20 p.s.i. rinse with kit “amine regenerator solution” (2 min), 20 p.s.i. rinse with 50 mm Tris pH 8.0 buffer (2 min), sample injection, and separation using 30 kV in reverse polarity mode at 25 °C (7 min). Specificity was assured by demonstrating that nicotine was resolved from all other peaks in plasma. Instrument precision was monitored by making triplicate injections from a single pooled standard. Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM)—Sections (6 μm) were cut from frozen lung tissue specimens embedded in OCT using a OTF/AS cryostat (Jencons, Brigeville, PA) and mounted on PEN membrane slides (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA). The sections were stained with hematoxylin to reveal lung architecture, and areas of interest were collected using a Veritas (Arc-turus) LCM instrument equipped with Veritas image archiving software. The laser cutting mode was used to cut out and collect selected regions of sections. The cutting beam diameter was 3.0 μm, and the laser intensity control was set at 4.46 mV. Typically, 10–25 laser pulses were required to cut out the selected area, which was then captured on mounted films (Arcturus) according to manufacturer's directions. Portions of the films holding captured areas were placed in microcentrifuge tubes for further processing. ODC Activity—The proteins were extracted from the pooled LCM material collected in microcentrifuge tubes by adding NKPD buffer (2.68 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 51.1 mm Na2HPO4, 7.43 mm NaH2PO4, 62 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol), vortexing, sonicating for 20 min at 40 watts and 70% duty cycle (Heat System, Ultrasonics Inc., Plainview, NY), and clarifying by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. A 2-μl aliquot was retained for protein assay (Nanodrop Technology, Wilmington, DC), and the balance was immediately used for ODC activity measurements as previously described in Ref. 11Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. AdoMetDC Activity—A lung homogenate was prepared by freezing ∼500 mg of tissue in liquid nitrogen and then grinding in a mortar and pestle. The resulting powder was immediately resuspended in 2 ml of buffer (150 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgSO4), sonicated for about 2 min at 40 watts with a 70% duty cycle, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. An aliquot of the collected supernatant was used for a protein assay (Bio-Rad Bradford assay), and the balance was for the AdoMetDC assay. Assay conditions were as described for ODC except for substitution of substrate. Detection of the dcAdoMet product was as described above. Nicotine and DFMO were delivered by implanted infusion pumps as previously reported (6Shivji M. Burger S. Moncada C.A. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Merali S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15219-15228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Merali S. Chin K. Grady R.W. Weissberger L. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and summarized under “Experimental Procedures.” After surgically implanting saline-filled infusion pumps in the suprascapular region of groups of five rats each, saline was delivered over a 7-day surgical recovery period. After recovery, the pump solution for Group 1 rats was replaced with one containing 10.5 mg of R-(+)-nicotine tartrate ml-1 in saline to deliver a dosage of ∼475 μg nicotine kg-1 h-1. For Group 2, the exchange solution contained 94.5 mg DFMO ml-1 to deliver a dosage of ∼12 mg DFMO kg-1 h-1. For Group 3, the exchange solution contained the nicotine content of Group 1 plus the DFMO content of Group 2. Group 4 rats were controls, and the exchange solution was fresh saline. After 21 days of treatment, the four groups were sacrificed, and the lungs were collected. Infusion of nicotine at this rate produced a blood concentration of 14.3 ± 2.5 μm at 21 days. Appropriate homogenates were prepared from portions of each lung with other portions immediately frozen in OTC embedding medium for subsequent sectioning. Aliqu"
https://openalex.org/W2030271081,"Mammalian telomeres are composed of G-rich repetitive double-stranded (ds) DNA with a 3' single-stranded (ss) overhang and associated proteins that together maintain chromosome end stability. Complete replication of telomeric DNA requires de novo elongation of the ssDNA by the enzyme telomerase, with telomeric proteins playing a key role in regulating telomerase-mediated telomere replication. In regards to the protein component of mammalian telomeres, TRF1 and TRF2 bind to the dsDNA of telomeres, whereas POT1 binds to the ssDNA portion. These three proteins are linked through either direct interactions or by the proteins TIN2 and TPP1. To determine the biological consequence of connecting telomeric dsDNA to ssDNA through a multiprotein assembly, we compared the effect of expressing TRF1 and POT1 in trans versus in cis in the form of a fusion of these two proteins, on telomere length in telomerase-positive cells. When expressed in trans these two proteins induced extensive telomere elongation. Fusing TRF1 to POT1 abrogated this effect, inducing mild telomere shortening, and generated looped DNA structures, as assessed by electron microscopy, consistent with the protein forming a complex with dsDNA and ssDNA. We speculate that such a protein bridge between dsDNA and ssDNA may inhibit telomerase access, promoting telomere shortening."
https://openalex.org/W2118520777,"Abstract Nonesterified fatty acids may influence mitochondrial function by alterations in gene expression, metabolism, and/or mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) homeostasis. We have previously reported that polyunsaturated fatty acids induce Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria, an action that may deplete [Ca2+]m and thus contribute to nonesterified fatty acid-responsive mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we show that the chaperone protein heat shock protein 90 β1 (hsp90β1) is required for polyunsaturated fatty acid-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux (PIMCE). Retinoic acid induced differentiation of human teratocarcinoma NT2 cells in association with attenuation of PIMCE. Proteomic analysis of mitochondrial proteins revealed that hsp90β1, among other proteins, was reduced in retinoic acid-differentiated cells. Blockade of PIMCE in NT2 cells by 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, a known inhibitor of the chaperone activity of hsp90, and hsp90β1 RNA interference demonstrated that hsp90β1 is essential for PIMCE. We also show localization of hsp90β1 in mitochondria by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Distinctive effects of inhibitors binding to the N or C terminus of hsp90 on PIMCE in isolated mitochondria suggested that the C terminus of hsp90β1 plays a critical role in PIMCE."
https://openalex.org/W2140713239,"Alpha-actinins are critical components of the actin cytoskeleton. Here we show that alpha-actinins serve another important biological function by binding to and competitively inhibiting calcium-dependent activation of endothelial NOS (eNOS). Alpha-actinin-2 was found to associate with eNOS in a yeast two-hybrid screen. In vascular endothelial cells, which only express alpha-actinin-1 and -4, alpha-actinin-4 interacted and colocalized with eNOS. Addition of alpha-actinin-4 directly inhibited eNOS recombinant protein, and overexpression of alpha-actinin-4 inhibited eNOS activity in eNOS-transfected COS-7 cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs). In contrast, knockdown of alpha-actinin-4 by siRNA increased eNOS activity in BAECs. The alpha-actinin-4-binding site on eNOS was mapped to a central region comprising the calmodulin-binding domain, and the eNOS-binding site on alpha-actinin-4 was mapped to the fourth spectrin-like rod domain, R4. Treatment of endothelial cells with a calcium ionophore, A23187, decreased alpha-actinin-4-eNOS interaction, leading to translocation of alpha-actinin-4 from plasma membrane to cytoplasm. Indeed, addition of calmodulin displaced alpha-actinin-4 binding to eNOS and increased eNOS activity. These findings indicate that eNOS activity in vascular endothelial cells is tonically and dynamically regulated by competitive interaction with alpha-actinin-4 and calmodulin."
