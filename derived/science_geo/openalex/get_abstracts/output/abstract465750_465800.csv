https://openalex.org/W2000453869,"Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and the CS-rich extracellular matrix structures called perineuronal nets (PNNs) restrict plasticity and regeneration in the CNS. Plasticity is enhanced by chondroitinase ABC treatment that removes CS from its core protein in the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans or by preventing the formation of PNNs, suggesting that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in the PNNs control plasticity. Recently, we have shown that semaphorin3A (Sema3A), a repulsive axon guidance molecule, localizes to the PNNs and is removed by chondroitinase ABC treatment (Vo, T., Carulli, D., Ehlert, E. M., Kwok, J. C., Dick, G., Mecollari, V., Moloney, E. B., Neufeld, G., de Winter, F., Fawcett, J. W., and Verhaagen, J. (2013) Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 56C, 186-200). Sema3A is therefore a candidate for a PNN effector in controlling plasticity. Here, we characterize the interaction of Sema3A with CS of the PNNs. Recombinant Sema3A interacts with CS type E (CS-E), and this interaction is involved in the binding of Sema3A to rat brain-derived PNN glycosaminoglycans, as demonstrated by the use of CS-E blocking antibody GD3G7. In addition, we investigate the release of endogenous Sema3A from rat brain by biochemical and enzymatic extractions. Our results confirm the interaction of Sema3A with CS-E containing glycosaminoglycans in the dense extracellular matrix of rat brain. We also demonstrate that the combination of Sema3A and PNN GAGs is a potent inhibitor of axon growth, and this inhibition is reduced by the CS-E blocking antibody. In conclusion, Sema3A binding to CS-E in the PNNs may be a mechanism whereby PNNs restrict growth and plasticity and may represent a possible point of intervention to facilitate neuronal plasticity."

Using complete nutrient deprivation of cells in culture as a simple model of stress, we have addressed whether LD biogenesis has a protective role in cells committed to die. Complete nutrient deprivation induced the biogenesis of LD in human LN18 glioblastoma and HeLa cells and also in CHO and rat primary astrocytes. In all cell types, death was associated with LD depletion and was accelerated by blocking LD biogenesis after pharmacological inhibition of Group IVA phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α) or down-regulation of ceramide kinase. Nutrient deprivation also induced β-oxidation of fatty acids that was sensitive to cPLA2α inhibition, and cell survival in these conditions became strictly dependent on fatty acid catabolism. These results show that, during nutrient deprivation, cell viability is sustained by β-oxidation of fatty acids that requires biogenesis and mobilization of LD.Background: Cellular stress leading to cell death induces the formation of lipid droplets.Results: Nutrient deprivation induces LD biogenesis and mobilization, fueling fatty acid oxidation to sustain cell viability.Conclusion: β-Oxidation requires biogenesis and mobilization of LD.Significance: The role of LD in cell survival and β-oxidation might provide new potential targets for antitumor therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2014589733,"Activation of glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) by angiotensin II (Ang II) leads to extracellular matrix accumulation. Here, we demonstrate that, in MCs, Ang II induces endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling with enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased production of NO. Ang II promotes a rapid increase in 3-nitrotyrosine formation, and uric acid attenuates Ang II-induced decrease in NO bioavailability, demonstrating that peroxynitrite mediates the effects of Ang II on eNOS dysfunction. Ang II rapidly up-regulates Nox4 protein. Inhibition of Nox4 abolishes the increase in ROS and peroxynitrite generation as well as eNOS uncoupling triggered by Ang II, indicating that Nox4 is upstream of eNOS. This pathway contributes to Ang II-mediated fibronectin accumulation in MCs. Ang II also elicits an increase in mitochondrial abundance of Nox4 protein, and the oxidase contributes to ROS production in mitochondria. Overexpression of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase prevents the stimulatory effects of Ang II on mitochondrial ROS production, loss of NO availability, and MC fibronectin accumulation, whereas manganese superoxide dismutase depletion increases mitochondrial ROS, NO deficiency, and fibronectin synthesis basally and in cells exposed to Ang II. This work provides the first evidence that uncoupled eNOS is responsible for Ang II-induced MC fibronectin accumulation and identifies Nox4 and mitochondrial ROS as mediators of eNOS dysfunction. These data shed light on molecular processes underlying the oxidative signaling cascade engaged by Ang II and identify potential targets for intervention to prevent renal fibrosis."

Although extensively investigated, the receptor for this endogenous peptide has not previously been described. This study describes the use of a series of studies that show G protein-coupled receptor-mediated biological activity of TLQP-21 signaling in CHO-K1 cells. Unbiased genome-wide sequencing of the transcriptome from responsive CHO-K1 cells identified a prioritized list of possible G protein-coupled receptors bringing about this activity. Further experiments using a series of defined receptor antagonists and siRNAs led to the identification of complement C3a receptor-1 (C3AR1) as a target for TLQP-21 in rodents. We have not been able to demonstrate so far that this finding is translatable to the human receptor. Our results are in line with a large number of physiological observations in rodent models of food intake and metabolic control, where TLQP-21 shows activity. In addition, the sensitivity of TLQP-21 signaling to pertussis toxin is consistent with the known signaling pathway of C3AR1.

The vgf (non-acronymic) gene encodes a protein that undergoes multiple processing events resulting in a number of bioactive peptides (1Ferri G.L. Noli B. Brancia C. D'Amato F. Cocco C.

In addition, TLQP-21 has been shown to promote glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and to protect primary rat pancreatic islet cells from thapsigargin-induced apoptosis (12Stephens S.B.

TLQP-21 has also been shown to modulate mammotrophic cell differentiation in the GH3 cell line (13Petrocchi Passeri P. Biondini L. Mongiardi M.P. Mordini N. Quaresima S. Frank C. Baratta M.

Beyond its contribution to metabolism, TLQP-21 was reported to play a role in stress responses in vivo (14Razzoli M. Bo E. Pascucci T. Pavone F. D'Amato F.R. Cero C. Sanghez V. Dadomo H. Palanza P.

Therefore, identifying a receptor for TLQP-21 would facilitate the understanding of the regulation of metabolism and might point to novel entry points for pharmacological intervention. Increasing evidence points toward such a membrane receptor for TLQP-21 (8Possenti R. Muccioli G. Petrocchi P. Cero C. Cabassi A. Vulchanova L. Riedl M.S. Manieri M. Frontini A. Giordano A. Cinti S.

RNA-Seq is a recent technique that can be used to analyze changes in gene expression across the entire transcriptome (17Mortazavi A. Williams B.A. McCue K. Schaeffer L. Wold B.

RNA-Seq: a revolutionary tool for transcriptomics.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (8463) Google Scholar). This technology is now being applied to a rapidly increasing number of organisms (19Jiménez-Guri E. Huerta-Cepas J. Cozzuto L. Wotton K.R. Kang H. Himmelbauer H. Roma G. Gabaldón T. Jaeger J. Comparative transcriptomics of early dipteran development.BMC Genomics. 2013; 14: 123Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and presents distinct advantages over microarrays, including greater sensitivity and a much higher dynamic range. Beyond the ability of RNA-Seq to monitor gene expression, it can identify novel transcripts, novel isoforms, alternative splice sites, allele-specific expression, and rare transcripts (18Wang Z. Gerstein M. Snyder M. RNA-Seq: a revolutionary tool for transcriptomics.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (8463) Google Scholar). As RNA-Seq does not require a reference genome to gain useful transcriptomic information, it can be particularly useful in non-model species that have not had their genomes sequenced yet. In this work, we describes the measurement of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; C3AR1, complement C3a receptor-1; PTX, pertussis toxin. -mediated activity for TLQP-21 in two different rodent cell lines. A set of different techniques (including unbiased transcriptome sequencing of the genes expressed in these cell lines, followed by antagonist and siRNA screening to identify the putative receptor, all subsequently supported by recombinant expression of the receptor showing signaling) has been used to demonstrate that the TLQP-21 activity in these two cell lines is mediated by complement C3a receptor-1 (C3AR1). Originally, C3AR1 was thought to be restricted to the innate immune response, having a role in the complement cascade, but its participation has been extended to roles in cancer (20Opstal-van Winden A.W. Vermeulen R.C. Peeters P.H. Beijnen J.H. van Gils C.H. Early diagnostic protein biomarkers for breast cancer: how far have we come?.Breast Cancer Res.

Consistent with its role in metabolism, c3ar1 knock-out mice are transiently resistant to diet-induced obesity and are protected against high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance (23Mamane Y.

The observations we made describe a novel ligand/receptor association and provide insight into the interconnection between inflammation and metabolism. Human C3a was purchased from Calbiochem. Rat TLQP-21 was purchased from Tocris, Phoenix, and Bachem, and human TLQP-21 was from Bachem. 125I-Labeled human complement C3a was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen unless stated otherwise. CHO-K1 cells were seeded either onto poly-d-lysine-coated 384-well plates (CELLCOAT, Greiner bio-One) for other cells, non-coated 384-well plates (Costar) were used. 24 h before the experiment, cells were seeded at a concentration of 10,000 cells/well for a total of 50 μl. On the day of the experiment, the medium was manually removed and replaced with 40 μl of 1.6 μm Fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes) in dilution buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and 0.1% BSA (Calbiochem) and supplemented with 2.5 mm probenecid (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were subsequently washed with 20 mm HEPES, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and 2.5 mm probenecid with a BioTek cell washer, leaving 30 μl of buffer covering the cells. Calcium-induced fluorescence was detected using a Hamamatsu FDSS7000 system. Base-line fluorescence was measured, followed by pipetting 15 μl of 3× concentrated compound-containing solution onto the cells. Calcium-induced fluorescence was measured 60 times every 1 s and then 40 times every 2 s. The data were calculated as ΔF/F (maximum of response − base line/base-line signal). For each assay, values were obtained in quadruplicates, and data are expressed as means ± S.D. For the priming protocol, we activated the cells with 100 μm ATP, monitored the signal as indicated above, and let the cells rest for 30 min. The cells were then activated by the ligand as described above. We used a positive control mixture (each at a final concentration of 1 μm) containing ATP (Tocris), lysophosphatidic acid 18:1 (Cayman Chemical), sphingosine 1-phosphate (Tocris), carbachol (Sigma), and bradykinin (Tocris). Total RNA was isolated from CHO-K1 and CCL39 cells using an RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen). RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using an Illumina RNA prep kit and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. A total of 750 million 76-bp end reads were mapped to the Chinese hamster genome (24Xu X. Nagarajan H. Lewis N.E. Pan S. Cai Z. Liu X. Chen W. Xie M. Wang W. Hammond S. Andersen M.R. Neff N.

TopHat parameters were set to default. Final transcript levels of all known hamster genes were calculated in fragments/kb of exon/million fragments mapped by counting the number of mapped and spliced reads to exons, normalized by the length of the exons, and averaged over all used exons for each transcript. On average, 87% of the total reads (equivalent to 654 million sequences) were mapped to the genome. The Cuffdiff tool from the Cufflinks package (version 1.1.0) (27Roberts A. Pimentel H. Trapnell C.

For the correct interpretation of the GPCR expression profiling, this class of genes was re-annotated with a reciprocal best hit approach using the BLASTn algorithm (BLAST e-value cut-off of 10−10) (28Altschul S.F.

After 35 cycles of amplification, the PCR products were purified and subcloned for sequencing using a Zero Blunt® TOPO® PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Three independent siRNA duplexes for each candidate gene were designed (2 × 21-mer with a 5′–3′-dTdT overhang) and purchased from Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland). Transfection was performed in a 96-well format using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine reagent was diluted in 50 μl of Opti-MEM I and added to 50 μl of Opti-MEM I containing 40 pmol of siRNA. After 15 min, 200 μl of a CHO-K1 cell suspension diluted to 2 × 105 cells/ml was added to each well. The transfection mixture was then transferred in four wells for a quadruplicate measurement in a 384-well plate for calcium measurement. Cells were grown for 24 h before the response of the cells to TLQP-21 was monitored using the calcium flux assay. A panel of 110 compounds known to inhibit 90 GPCRs was tested for activity in CHO-K1 cells upon TLQP-21 stimulation. Cells were incubated with 30 μm antagonists for 15 min and then stimulated with 1 μm (EC80) TLQP-21. Compounds causing >70% inhibition of the TLQP-21 response were retested over a range of concentrations to determine their IC50 values. Hamster C3AR1 cDNA was amplified from CHO-K1 cDNA by PCR (forward primer 5′-CACCATGGAGTCTTTCTCTGCTGAC and reverse primer 5′-TACATCTGTACTCAAATTGT) and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1D-TOPO-V5-His vector (Invitrogen). The expression vector was sequenced to confirm integrity of the coding sequence. The same procedure was used for rat C3AR1 (cDNA from O-342 cells used as template with forward primer 5′-CACCATGGAGTCTTTCACTGCTGACACC and reverse primer 5′-CACATCCGTACTCATATGG), for human C3AR1 (forward primer 5′-CACCATGGCGTCTTTCTCTGCT and reverse primer 5′-CACAGTTGTACTATTTCTTTC), and for mouse C3AR1 (cDNA from RAW264.7 cells used as template with forward primer 5′-CACCATGGAGTCTTTCGATGCTGACACC and reverse primer 5′-CACATCTGTACTCATATTG). C3AR1 expression vectors were transfected in HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573). 2.5 μg of plasmid was transfected in one well of a subconfluent 6-well plate using Lipofectamine 2000. 24 h after transfection, cells were transferred to a 10-cm dish and grown in selective medium containing 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) until emergence of resistant colonies. A limiting dilution was carried out on this cell population to obtain single clones expressing C3AR1. CHO-K1 or hamster C3AR1-expressing HEK293 cells were grown to confluence, harvested in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C before freezing (−80 °C). Frozen pellets were homogenized with a 30-ml Sartorius glass homogenizer vessel in ice-cold Tris buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7) and 5 mm EDTA) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) before centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was washed, and the process was repeated once more before the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The protein content was evaluated (Pierce BCA protein assay kit), and membrane aliquots were kept frozen at −80 °C until used. CHO-K1 or hamster C3AR1-expressing HEK293 cell membranes (10–50 μg/ml) were incubated for 60 min at room temperature in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5% BSA in a final volume of 200 μl with 125I-labeled C3a and the test compound. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of a minimum of 30 nm human C3a. The reaction was stopped by rapid filtration through a UniFilter GF/B presoaked with polyethyleneimine (0.5%), followed by three successive washes with ice-cold buffer. Filters were then counted in a microplate scintillation counter (TopCount NXT, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 65% efficiency. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism 6 software. For displacement studies, rat TLQP-21, human TLQP-21, and human C3a were diluted in water at final concentrations of 10−5–10−12 m and tested against 125I-labeled C3a at 8 pm. Inhibition constants were calculated according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (using GraphPad Prism 6 software): Ki = IC50/(1 + (L/KD)), where IC50 is the inhibitory concentration 50, L is the ligand concentration, and KD is the dissociation constant of the radioligand. Rat TLQP-21 and SB290157 (Calbiochem) dilutions were prepared at the indicated concentrations in migration medium (serum-free RAW264.7 growth medium: RPMI 1640 medium, 1% minimal Eagle's medium nonessential amino acid solution, 1% sodium pyruvate, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Bioconcept), and 10% FCS (Bioconcept)) and distributed in quadruplicates at 160 μl/well to the lower chamber of a CIM-Plate 16 device (ACEA Bioscience). After locking the upper and lower chambers together, 30 μl of migration medium was added to each well. The CIM-Plate 16 device was then loaded onto an xCELLigence RTCA DP analyzer (ACEA Bioscience) and equilibrated for 1 h at 37 °C. In the meantime, ∼70% confluent RAW264.7 cells were washed with PBS and detached with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer; and after centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in migration medium. Cells were counted and adjusted to 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. Once the equilibration with medium was complete, the background measurement was performed, and 100 μl of cell suspension was added to each well of the upper chamber. To allow the cells to sediment and settle, the CIM-Plate 16 device was left at room temperature for 30 min. After loading the plate again onto the xCELLigence RTCA DP analyzer at 37 °C, the electrical impedance was measured in 5-min intervals for 8 h. The slope of the normalized cell index was then monitored as a measure of cell migration. Direct activation of CHO-K1 cells by rat or human TLQP-21 did not lead to measurable Fluo-4-based calcium detection (data not shown). This suggests that TLQP-21 does not activate a Gq-coupled receptor in these cells. However, it is possible to redirect non-Gq coupling to a calcium-releasing pathway by presensitization of the cells with a strong stimulus, a process called priming (30Rosethorne E.M. Leighton-Davies J.R. Beer D. Charlton S.J. ATP priming of macrophage-derived chemokine responses in CHO cells expressing the CCR4 receptor.Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 370: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Priming CHO-K1 cells with 100 μm ATP revealed a TLQP-21-driven signal when using Fluo-4 (Fig. 1A). This signal was more potent with rat TLQP-21 than with the human peptide (91 and 276 nm, respectively). The amplitude of this response is significant, as it compares with the endogenous response of these cells to 100 μm ATP (ΔF/F = 2.8 in the same experiment). Such a large signal suggests that the receptor is either highly expressed or efficiently coupled to intracellular signaling pathways. The TLQP-21-mediated increase in intracellular calcium flux could be blocked by pertussis toxin (PTX), indicating that the receptor could be either a Gi- or a Go-coupled receptor (Fig. 1A). To gain a better understanding of the nature of the activated signaling pathways, we screened for additional TLQP-21-responsive cell lines and further interrogated classical GPCR pathways. For example, another hamster cell line (CCL39) was unresponsive to rat TLQP-21, as shown in Fig. 1B. However, we identified another rodent ovary cell line (O-342) as being responsive to TLQP-21 (Fig. 1C). In this rat cell line, TLQP-21 has a slightly higher EC50 of 347 nm. TLQP-21-directed signaling mediated by cAMP or inositol phosphate accumulation could not be detected in CHO-K1 cells (data not shown). This indicates that the TLQP-21 receptor endogenously expressed in CHO-K1 cells is not Gs-, Gi-, or Gq-coupled. To gain deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying"

Using a murine astrocytoma tumor cell line, ALTS1C1, the present study demonstrates that whole brain irradiation prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice, although the mice eventually died associated with increased tumor infiltration. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis indicated that RT decreased the microvascular density (MVD) of the primary tumor core, but increased the MVD of the tumor invasion front. RT also increased the number of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) at the tumor invasion front. SDF-1 expression suppressed by siRNA (SDFkd tumors) showed a decrease in RT-enhanced tumor invasiveness, leading to prolonged survival of mice bearing these tumors. The invasion front in SDFkd tumors showed a lower MVD and TAM density than that in the islands of the control or irradiated ALTS1C1 tumors. Our results indicate that tumor-secreted SDF-1 is one key factor in RT-induced tumor invasiveness, and that it exerts its effect likely through macrophage mobilization and tumor revascularization."

DNA methylation is dynamic, and the mechanisms involved in methylation and demethylation represent an interface between the environment and gene expression (1.Jaenisch R. Bird A. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression: how the genome integrates intrinsic and environmental signals.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4661) Google Scholar). Changes in DNA methylation have been implicated in a wide range of pathologies including cancer (2.Tsai H.C. Baylin S.B. Cancer epigenetics: linking basic biology to clinical medicine.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 502-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), neurodevelopmental disorders (3.Millan M.J.

Efforts to understand mechanisms involved in DNA methylation and demethylation therefore have enormous translational potential. DNA methylation is established and maintained by the family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), 3The abbreviations used are: DNMTDNA methyltransferaseANOVAanalysis of varianceAP2APOBEC2DCF-DA2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateGCLCglutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit5hmC5-hydroxymethylcytosineHQhydroquinone5mC5-methylcytosineMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumNACN-acetylcysteine8-oxo-dG8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosineqRT-PCRquantitative RT-PCRROSreactive oxygen speciesTET1Ten Eleven Translocation 1. although mechanisms underlying demethylation have been more difficult to elucidate. Whereas Arabidopsis DNA glycosylases DME and ROS1 participate in exchanging methylcytosines with cytosines, no analogous pathway has been discovered in mammalian cells (5.Ponferrada-Marín M.I.

A number of chemicals, such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, decrease DNA methylation passively by inhibiting maintenance methylation as DNA is synthesized (6.Christman J.K. 5-Azacytidine and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine as inhibitors of DNA methylation: mechanistic studies and their implications for cancer therapy.Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5483-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism depends on cell division and may not explain active demethylation in post-mitotic cells such as neurons (7.Guo J.U. Ma D.K. Mo H. Ball M.P. Jang M.H.

Pharmaceutical, industrial, and environmental chemicals have also been shown to decrease DNA methylation, but the mechanisms are unclear (8.O'Driscoll C.M. Coulter J.B. Bressler J.P.

Several chemicals have been shown to have a passive effect on methylation by modifying DNMT activity (10.Lee B.H. Yegnasubramanian S. Lin X. Nelson W.G.

An interesting target that could explain active demethylation involves the Ten Eleven Translocation (TET) family of Fe2+ and α-ketoglutarate-dependent 5mC dioxygenases (12.Tahiliani M. Koh K.P. Shen Y. Pastor W.A. Bandukwala H. Brudno Y. Agarwal S. Iyer L.M. Liu D.R. Aravind L. Rao A.

In a mechanism proposed by Guo et al., TET proteins catalyze the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), followed by deamination to 5-hydroxymethyluracil by cytidine deaminases. Subsequent base excision repair machinery would then replace 5-hydroxymethyluracil with unmethylated cytosine (14.Guo J.U. Su Y. Zhong C. Ming G.L. Song H.

In this study, we focused on changes in DNA methylation by the benzene metabolite hydroquinone (HQ). Benzene is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant found in petroleum products and cigarette smoke (15.Ong C.N. Lee B.L. Shi C.Y. Ong H.Y. Lee H.P.

Although benzene and benzene metabolite exposures have also been shown to be associated with loss of genomic methylation (9.Bollati V. Baccarelli A. Hou L. Bonzini M. Fustinoni S. Cavallo D.

In our study, we investigated a mechanism of DNA demethylation induced by exposure to HQ in a cell culture model. Evidence will be presented showing that HQ mediates DNA demethylation in a mechanism involving ROS and the TET1 pathway in HEK293 cells. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Nit-GFP, human APOBEC2 (AP2), and TET1 catalytic domain plasmids were obtained from Dr. Hongjun Song's laboratory (JHU) and used according the published methods (14.Guo J.U. Su Y. Zhong C. Ming G.L.

Silencer Select Pre-designed siRNA against Tet1(4392420; ID s37194) and control (4390846) were obtained from Ambion and used at 10 nm. HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Hydroquinone, menadione, buthionine sulfoximine, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) stocks were freshly prepared in H2O and sterile-filtered. Cytotoxicity was measured using standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) protocol. In brief, 1.5 × 104 cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate. Cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of HQ for 24 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with 10 mg/ml MTT reagent in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were lysed, and formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide. Absorbance was read at 570 nm using a microplate reader, and data were expressed as a percentage of nonexposed cell MTT reduction. Whole cell lysates were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and included addition of protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay, and 30 μg of whole cell lysates was separated on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Invitrogen). Nuclear lysates were prepared using Panomics Nuclear Extract kit (Fremont, CA) and measured using the Bradford assay. 15 μg of nuclear lysates was separated on a 4–12% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Invitrogen). Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 0.5% casein, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against V5©(Invitrogen; 1:5000), FLAG-M2©(Sigma; 1:2000), actin (Sigma; 1:5000), TET1 (Abnova; 1:1000), or TATA-binding protein (Millipore; 1:1000). Blots were incubated with secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1 h before visualization on the Licor Odyssey Imager. RNA was isolated using TRIzol and quantified using NanoDrop. 1 μg was used to generate cDNA (SuperscriptIII; Invitrogen). qPCR was performed using a Bio-Rad iCycler and iQ SYBR Green supermix according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used were as follows: 14-3-3σ forward, GGCCATGGACATCAGCAAGAA and reverse, CGAAAGTGGTCTTGGCCAGAG; GAPDH forward, ACATCGCTCAGACACCATG and reverse, TGTAGTTGAGGTCAATGAAGGG; GCLC forward, AAAAGTCCGGTTGGTCCTG and reverse, CCTGGTGTCCCTTCAATCATG; TET1 forward, TTCGTCACTGCCAACCTTAG and reverse, ATGCCTCTTTCACTGGGTG; TET2 forward, CACTGCATGTTTGGACTTCTG and reverse, TGCTCATCCTCAGGTTTTCC; TET3 forward, TCCGGATTGAGAAGGTCATC and reverse, CCAGGCCAGGATCAAGATAA. Genomic DNA was isolated using GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA kit (Sigma) and measured using a NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific). 250 ng was denatured with 0.4 m NaOH at 95 °C for 10 min. DNA was immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane, dried, and fixed by vacuum baking at 80 °C. The membrane was then blocked with 0.5% casein and probed with antibodies against 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) (Trevigen; 1:2500), 5-mC (Active Motif; 1:1000), or 5-hmC (Active Motif; 1:8000). Mouse anti-single-stranded DNA (Abcam; 1:1500) antibody was used simultaneously for normalizing 5hmC. Antibody binding was measured using the Licor Odyssey. Methylene blue staining of DNA (0.04% with 0.3 m sodium acetate) was used for normalization of 8-oxo-dG and 5mC antibodies. Intensity of methylene blue was measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Linear range of detection of DNA was determined by loading increasing amounts of single-stranded DNA and probing with increasing dilutions of anti-single-stranded DNA antibody. 5hmC Ab specificity was confirmed by blocking antibody with 2 μg/ml 5hmC or 5mC at room temperature for 2 h and blotting DNA from mock-transfected and TET1-overexpressing HEK293 cells. Nit-GFP plasmid was methylated using 4 units of CpG methyltransferase and 0.6 mm S-adenosylmethionine (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 12 h and purified using Qiagen gel extraction columns. 2.5 × 105 HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of methylated or unmethylated Nit-GFP plasmid, and co-transfections were used at 1:4 GFP:TET1 (+ control), AP2, or βgal for 48 h using Lipofectamine. Cells were exposed to 60 μm HQ for 24 h, beginning 24 h after transfection. Cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, fixed using ice-cold methanol:acetone (1:1), and stored at −20 °C. Cells were washed three times and resuspended in 4 °C PBS. GFP fluorescence was measured using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using CellQuest software. Dead cell and doublet discrimination were accomplished using forward scatter versus side scatter gating, and at least 10,000 events were analyzed in each sample for all experiments. Bisulfite sequencing was performed as reported by Guo et al. (14.Guo J.U. Su Y. Zhong C. Ming G.L. Song H. Hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine by TET1 promotes active DNA demethylation in the adult brain.Cell. 2011; 145: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). At the end of the 24-h exposure to 60 μm HQ, DNA from cells transfected with methylated Nit-GFP plasmid was isolated and bisulfite modified using the EpiTect bisulfite kit (Qiagen). The Nit-GFP promoter was PCR-amplified using primers recognizing the bisulfite-modified sequence and gel-purified.

Cells were grown in black 96-well plates and incubated with 50 μm (final concentration) 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) in DMEM lacking phenol red for 30 min. DCF-DA was removed by washing twice with PBS, and cells were exposed to HQ, NAC (5 mm), or in combination. Fluorescence was measured at 485em 522ex beginning at 30 min and followed through indicated time points. Genomic DNA was isolated from cells exposed to hydroquinone or control conditions. 8 μg of DNA was sheared using intermittent sonication and validated to be 100–500 bp by gel electrophoresis. 2 μg of DNA was heat-denatured for 10 min and placed immediately in an ice bath. DNA was incubated with antibody against 5mC, 5hmC, or matched isotype control at 4 °C overnight. Protein G magnetic beads (Invitrogen) were added for 1 h at 4 °C, and bead-antibody-DNA complexes were magnetically separated, followed by three washes in immunoprecipitation buffer (4 °C PBS with 0.05%Triton X-100). Protein was digested using proteinase K digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA) overnight at 50 °C. Proteinase K was inactivated by incubation at 80 °C for 30 min. DNA was purified using nucleic acid columns (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated DNA was used as a template for qPCR, and -fold enrichment was calculated using input DNA. Total TET activity was measured using the Epigentek Epigenase 5mC hydroxylase kit (Farmingdale, NY) according to the supplier's protocol. Nuclear lysates were prepared using Panomics Nuclear Extraction kit (Fremont, CA) and measured using the Bradford assay. Hydroxymethylated product formed was measured within a standard curve (0–2 ng), and activity was calculated as ng/min/mg. Data are expressed as -fold change over unexposed nuclear lysates. Overexpression of the TET1 catalytic domain was used as a positive control.

Cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, resuspended in 300 μl of PBS at 4 °C, and fixed overnight at −20 °C in 1:1 methanol:acetone, added dropwise with intermittent vortexing. Cells were washed with cold PBS and incubated with 0.25 ml of 5 μg/ml RNase, 15 min at 37 °C. 0.25 ml of 100 μg/ml propidium iodide was added for 60 min at room temperature. DNA content was measured using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analyzed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Doublet discrimination was accomplished by gating on forward scatter-H v. FL3A and FL3A v. FL3-H. At least 10,000 events were analyzed in each sample. GraphPad Prism version 5 was used for statistical analyses. All data are summarized as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was performed for all single analyses. Multiple comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's, Dunnett's, or Newman-Keul post hoc tests. p values = 0.05 were considered significant. The MTT assay was used to determine concentrations of HQ which did not affect viability of HEK293 cells. Significant changes in MTT reduction were observed following exposure for 24 h to concentrations of 100 μm and higher (Fig. 1A). Preincubation of cells with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, increased the sensitivity of cells to HQ, indicating the involvement of glutathione and that toxicity is mediated in part by ROS. 8-oxo-dG was also measured by immunodotblotting genomic DNA. Significant increases in 8-oxo-dG staining were observed at 100 μm HQ and 500 μm H2O2 (Fig. 1B) but not at 60 μm HQ, although a 40% decrease in genomic 5mC was observed (Fig. 1C). Increases in ROS were observed as early at 4 h following exposure to 60 μm HQ and levels of ROS were lower in cells incubated with the anti-oxidant (NAC) (Fig. 1D). A possible mechanism involved in decreased methylation in the absence of oxidative DNA damage could involve inhibition of DNMT1, as many of the cells would have passed through S phase within 24 h. A reporter assay was established to examine this possibility. The Nit-GFP plasmid is replication-incompetent and would therefore be less likely to undergo demethylation passively (16.International Agency for Research on Cancer Overall evaluations of carcinogenicity: an updating of IARC monographs volumes 1 to 42.IARC Monogr. Eval. Carcinog. Risks Hum. Suppl. 1987; 7: 1-440PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the functionality of CpG methylation could be ascertained by measuring GFP expression. A nearly complete repression of GFP was observed in cells transfected with the reporter plasmid that was methylated with CpG methyltransferase and S-adenosylmethionine (data not shown). At 24 h following exposure to 60 μm HQ, a >2-fold increase in the number of GFP+ cells was observed (Fig. 1E). Moreover, the increase in GFP+ cells was prevented by co-incubating HQ-exposed cells with NAC, suggesting that ROS was involved in reactivation of the methylated plasmid by HQ. Bisulfite sequencing of the promoter confirmed both methylation of the plasmid promoter and an increase in unmethylated CpGs following 24-h exposure to HQ (Fig. 1F). Due to the recent interest in active demethylation pathways involving TET proteins, immunodotblotting was used to measure 5hmC in genomic HEK293 DNA following HQ exposure. Noting a decrease in 5mC following 24 h of HQ exposure, a time course of 5hmC was conducted to examine the potential for 5hmC as a demethylation intermediate. 5hmC levels increased at 8 and 12 h of HQ exposure, but were not significantly higher at 24 h (Fig. 2A). A dose response was observed for 5hmC levels 18 h following exposure to HQ (Fig. 2B) and menadione (data not shown), which is chemically similar to HQ and other ROS-inducing quinones. TET activity was higher in HEK293 cells exposed to HQ to levels similar in cells overexpressing TET1 catalytic domain (Fig. 2C). Although there are three distinct family members of TET proteins, we found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of TET1 led to an approximate 75% decrease in both Tet1 mRNA (Fig. 2D) and total TET activity (Fig. 2E). siRNA against Tet1 did not affect Tet2 or Tet3 mRNA levels (Fig. 2D), but completely abrogated HQ-induced increases in 5hmC (Fig. 2F), indicating that the increase in 5hmC in HEK293 cells exposed to HQ requires TET1. To determine the relationship between TET1 protein and activity, levels of TET1 protein were measured in nuclei by Western blotting. A 75% increase was observed in TET1 protein following exposure to 60 μm HQ (Fig. 3, A and B). A 60% decrease in the band was also observed in cells transfected with TET1 siRNA, thereby confirming the identity of the band as TET1 (Fig. 3, C and D). Because HQ exposure led to functional demethylation, 5hmC formation, and an increase in total Tet activity and nuclear TET1 levels, we reasoned that overexpression of deaminase proteins should enhance reactivation of the methylated GFP reporter. Indeed, overexpression of V5-tagged human AP2 increased the GFP+ population ∼2-fold following 60 μm HQ exposure (Fig. 3E). The results from the experiments involving the reporter plasmid suggest that HQ increases 5hmC and the involvement of TET1. Genomic regions enriched for 5hmC and 5mC were identified by immunoprecipitation and qPCR. A 3-fold enrichment of the open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of LINE-1 was observed in cells exposed to 60 μm HQ for 12 h without a significant change in 5mC (Fig. 4A). At 24 h, the enrichment of 5mC and 5hmC was decreased by 10- and 2-fold, respectively. The data support a role for HQ-induced 5hmC formation prior to demethylation, consistent with recently described Tet-mediated oxidation-deamination demethylation pathways. In addition, the effects of HQ are widespread, considering the frequency of LINE-1 in the human genome (26.Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M.

We next investigated 5hmC at promoters of genes that respond to HQ. GCLC is a component of the glutamate-cysteine ligase protein, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis. ROS disrupts Keap1-dependent sequestration of the transcription factor Nrf2, resulting in the transcription of numerous antioxidant response element-containing genes, including GCLC. 5hmC was enriched ∼12-fold at the promoter of GCLC following a 12-h exposure to HQ, whereas 5mC levels were significantly lower at 12 and 24 h (Fig. 4B). Whereas GCLC mRNA was induced by ∼2.5-fold in response to HQ in HEK293 cells, induction was attenuated in cells following siRNA-mediated TET1 knockdown (Fig. 4C). No changes in oxidized glutathione were observed following exposure to HQ with or without"
https://openalex.org/W2116615330,"New viral strains can be evolved to recognize different host glycans through mutagenesis and experimental adaptation. However, such mutants generally harbor amino acid changes that affect viral binding to a single class of carbohydrate receptors. We describe the rational design and synthesis of novel, chimeric adeno-associated virus (AAV) strains that exploit an orthogonal glycan receptor for transduction. A dual glycan-binding AAV strain was first engineered as proof of concept by grafting a galactose (Gal)-binding footprint from AAV serotype 9 onto the heparan sulfate-binding AAV serotype 2. The resulting chimera, AAV2G9, continues to bind heparin affinity columns but interchangeably exploits Gal and heparan sulfate receptors for infection, as evidenced by competitive inhibition assays with lectins, glycans, and parental AAV strains. Although remaining hepatotropic like AAV2, the AAV2G9 chimera mediates rapid onset and higher transgene expression in mice. Similarly, engraftment of the Gal footprint onto the laboratory-derived strain AAV2i8 yielded an enhanced AAV2i8G9 chimera. This new strain remains liver-detargeted like AAV2i8 while selectively transducing muscle tissues at high efficiency, comparable with AAV9. The AAV2i8G9 chimera is a promising vector candidate for targeted gene therapy of cardiac and musculoskeletal diseases. In addition to demonstrating the modularity of glycan receptor footprints on viral capsids, our approach provides design strategies to expand the AAV vector toolkit."
https://openalex.org/W2041208958,"Bone has remarkable regenerative capacity, but this ability diminishes during aging. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) promote terminal osteoblast differentiation and extracellular matrix production in culture. The epigenetic events altered by HDIs in osteoblasts may hold clues for the development of new anabolic treatments for osteoporosis and other conditions of low bone mass. To assess how HDIs affect the epigenome of committed osteoblasts, MC3T3 cells were treated with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and subjected to microarray gene expression profiling and high-throughput ChIP-Seq analysis. As expected, SAHA induced differentiation and matrix calcification of osteoblasts in vitro. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed that SAHA increased histone H4 acetylation genome-wide and in differentially regulated genes, except for the 500 bp upstream of transcriptional start sites. Pathway analysis indicated that SAHA increased the expression of insulin signaling modulators, including Slc9a3r1. SAHA decreased phosphorylation of insulin receptor β, Akt, and the Akt substrate FoxO1, resulting in FoxO1 stabilization. Thus, SAHA induces genome-wide H4 acetylation and modulates the insulin/Akt/FoxO1 signaling axis, whereas it promotes terminal osteoblast differentiation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2012444311,"Retinal dystrophies (RD) are a group of hereditary diseases that lead to debilitating visual impairment and are usually transmitted as a Mendelian trait. Pathogenic mutations can occur in any of the 100 or more disease genes identified so far, making molecular diagnosis a rather laborious process. In this work we explored the use of whole exome sequencing (WES) as a tool for identification of RD mutations, with the aim of assessing its applicability in a diagnostic context.We ascertained 12 Spanish families with seemingly recessive RD. All of the index patients underwent mutational pre-screening by chip-based sequence hybridization and resulted to be negative for known RD mutations. With the exception of one pedigree, to simulate a standard diagnostic scenario we processed by WES only the DNA from the index patient of each family, followed by in silico data analysis. We successfully identified causative mutations in patients from 10 different families, which were later verified by Sanger sequencing and co-segregation analyses. Specifically, we detected pathogenic DNA variants (∼50% novel mutations) in the genes RP1, USH2A, CNGB3, NMNAT1, CHM, and ABCA4, responsible for retinitis pigmentosa, Usher syndrome, achromatopsia, Leber congenital amaurosis, choroideremia, or recessive Stargardt/cone-rod dystrophy cases.Despite the absence of genetic information from other family members that could help excluding nonpathogenic DNA variants, we could detect causative mutations in a variety of genes known to represent a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes in 83% of the patients analyzed. Considering the constant drop in costs for human exome sequencing and the relative simplicity of the analyses made, this technique could represent a valuable tool for molecular diagnostics or genetic research, even in cases for which no genotypes from family members are available."

This study aimed to compare the mortality of patients with severe SHPT submitted to parathyroidectomy(PTX) with those who did not have access to surgery.This is a retrospective study in a cohort of 251 CKD patients with severe SHPT who were referred to a CKD-MBD Center for PTX from 2005 until 2012.Most of our patients had indication of PTX, but only 49% of them had access to this surgical procedure. After a mean follow-up of 23 months, 72 patients had died. Non-survivors were older; more often had diabetes, lower serum 25 vitamin D and mostly had not been submitted to surgery. The relative risk of death was lower in the PTX patients (0.428; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.67; p<0.0001). After adjustments, mortality risk was dependent on age (1.04; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.07; p = 0.002), 25 vitamin D (0.43; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81; p = 0.006) and no access to PTX (4.13; 95% CI, 2.16 to 7.88; p<0.0001). Results remained the same in a second model using the PTX date as the study start date for the PTX group.Our data confirms the benefit of PTX on mortality in patients with severe SHPT. The high mortality encountered in our population is significant and urges the need to better treat these patients."

By catalyzing the conversion of l-cysteine to l-alanine, the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme IscS generates S0, which is transferred to Cys-328 to form a persulfide and then transferred to IscU (11.Schwartz C.J.

These mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm with N-terminal extensions that facilitate mitochondrial entry and are cleaved off upon protein maturation in mitochondria (20.Tong W.H. Rouault T. Distinct iron-sulfur cluster assembly complexes exist in the cytosol and mitochondria of human cells.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The mature form of human ISCU, which shares 77% sequence identity with E. coli IscU (Fig. 1A), has been shown to play an important role in cellular iron homeostasis (21.Tong W.H. Rouault T.A. Functions of mitochondrial ISCU and cytosolic ISCU in mammalian iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and iron homeostasis.Cell Metabol. 2006; 3: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A tissue-specified splicing mutation of human ISCU has been associated with the disease ISCU myopathy (22.Mochel F. Knight M.A. Tong W.H. Hernandez D. Ayyad K. Taivassalo T. Andersen P.M.

It has been proposed that the small protein ISD11 stabilizes the cysteine desulfurase NFS1 (23.Wiedemann N. Urzica E. Guiard B. Müller H. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Mühlenhoff U.

Bornhövd C. Prokisch H. Neupert W. Hell K.

Barondeau D.P. Human frataxin is an allosteric switch that activates the Fe-S cluster biosynthetic complex.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 9132-9139Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), little is known about the interactions among these three proteins. Human mtHSP70 (also termed Mortalin, PBP74, GRP75, or HSPA9) appears to be a multifunctional DnaK-type chaperone (27.Schilke B. Williams B. Knieszner H. Pukszta S. D'Silva P. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. Evolution of mitochondrial chaperones utilized in Fe-S cluster biogenesis.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1660-1665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (unlike E. coli HscA, which is involved only in Fe-S cluster biogenesis). Human mtHSP70 is known to perform other cellular functions, including protein folding, intracellular trafficking, antigen processing, and aging (28.Wadhwa R. Taira K. Kaul S.C. An Hsp70 family chaperone, mortalin/mthsp70/PBP74/Grp75. What, when, and where?.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 29.Kaul S.C. Deocaris C.C. Wadhwa R. Three faces of mortalin. A housekeeper, guardian, and killer.Exp. Gerontol. 2007; 42: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It has been shown that mtHSP70 binds a variety of substrates, including cancer suppressor protein p53 and Parkinson disease-related protein DJ-1, and mtHSP70 has been associated with Alzheimer disease (30.Deocaris C.C.

Genet. 2010; 19: 4437-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because mtHSP70 is the only Hsp70 chaperone present in human mitochondria, it has been suggested that it plays a role in the human ISC machinery similar to that of E. coli HscA (32.Rouault T.A. Biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters in mammalian cells. New insights and relevance to human disease.Dis. Model Mech. 2012; 5: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the mtHSP70 homolog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ssc1) participates in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis when the specialized Hsp70 chaperone (Ssq1) is knocked out (33.Voisine C. Cheng Y.C. Ohlson M. Schilke B. Hoff K. Beinert H. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Jac1, a mitochondrial J-type chaperone, is involved in the biogenesis of Fe/S clusters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1483-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). HSC20 recently has also been found to be involved in human mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis (34.Shan Y. Cortopassi G. HSC20 interacts with frataxin and is involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and iron homeostasis.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21: 1457-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Given the sequence similarities of the bacterial and human proteins, it was of interest to determine, whether the human scaffold protein (ISCU) shares the conformational duality of the E. coli ortholog (IscU) and, if so, whether the two states exhibit differential interaction with the cysteine desulfurase, co-chaperone, and chaperone proteins. We report here that the human scaffold protein for Fe-S cluster biogenesis (ISCU), like its E. coli counterpart (IscU), populates two conformational states, a more structured state (S) and a partially disordered state (D). However, the relative population of the S-state of human ISCU is lower (28%) than the corresponding population of E. coli IscU (80%) under comparable solution conditions. Human cysteine desulfurase (NFS1) alone and in the NFS1-ISD11 complex were found to bind preferentially to the D-state of ISCU. However, ISCU does not interact directly with ISD11. The co-chaperone (HSC20) was found to bind preferentially to the S-state of ISCU, whereas the chaperone (mtHSP70) was found to bind preferentially to the D-state of ISCU. HSC20 activated the ATPase activity of mtHSP70, and this activation was greatly increased by the addition of ISCU. The cDNAs encoding the human mitochondrial proteins ISCU, NFS1, ISD11, mtHSP70, and HSC20 were ordered from the Mammalian Gene Collection (Thermo Fisher; Pittsburgh, PA). The genes coding for bacterial proteins were isolated by PCR directly from E. coli genomic DNA (Sigma). The clones for the mitochondrial proteins were designed to yield the mature protein sequences; the gene sequence coding for N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide was excluded (Fig. 1A, red box), and the clones coded for a SUMO fusion containing an N-terminal His-tag. The genes were cloned into the pE-SUMO-Kan vector (Lifesensors; Malvern, PA) by using BsaI and XhoI restriction sites in the PCR gene fragments and vector. DNA primers used in these experiments were ordered through either the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center or Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Restriction enzymes were purchased from either Promega (Madison, WI) or New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). All PCR DNA primers used for cloning included nine additional base pairs at the 5′ ends upstream of the restriction sites to make digestion more efficient at the termini of PCR products. DNA ligation and construction of the expression plasmid were carried out in 10-μl reactions with a PCR-based ligation thermo cycling program (30 s at 30 °C and 30 s at 10 °C repeated 800 times for 12 h). The ligation reaction was heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 25 min and then used to transform chemically competent 10G cells (Lucigen; Madison, WI), which were plated onto YT plates (containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. An E. coli recombinant colony archive was constructed by picking individual colonies and storing them in 30 μl of 20% sterile glycerol. 3-μl aliquots were removed for use in a PCR colony screen (20-μl reaction using Promega 2× PCR master mix) to identify positive clones. The original PCR primers used for isolating the target genes were employed in this PCR colony screen, and the reactions were analyzed on 1% agarose gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). To prepare plasmids for DNA sequence analysis, the E. coli colony glycerol stocks that yielded positive recombinants according to the PCR colony screens were grown overnight at 37 °C in 2–3 ml of CircleGrow® broth (MP Biomedicals; Santa Ana, CA) in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin. All DNA sequencing reactions were carried out on a Bio-Rad Dyad Peltier Thermal cycler at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center, and SeqMan software (DNASTAR; Madison, WI) was used to analyze and identify targets with the correct DNA sequence. We chose sites for production of single amino acid variants of ISCU to match those known to affect the D ⇄ S conformational equilibrium of E. coli IscU (35.Markley J.L. Kim J.H. Dai Z. Bothe J.R. Cai K. Frederick R.O. Tonelli M. Metamorphic protein IscU alternates conformations in the course of its role as the scaffold protein for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and delivery.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The positions of these residues on Mus musculus Zn2+ bound ISCU (a model for the S-state) are shown in Fig. 1B (PDB code 1WFZ). M. musculus ISCU shares 98% sequence identity with human ISCU (Fig. 1A). Genes for these variants were produced by using the Polymerase Incomplete Primer Extension (PIPE) site-directed mutagenesis method (36.Klock H.E. Lesley S.A. The polymerase incomplete primer extension (PIPE) method applied to high-throughput cloning and site-directed mutagenesis.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 498: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Single colonies containing validated genes for the target proteins (human ISCU variants, NFS1, ISD11, mtHSP70, and HSC20 and E. coli IscS) were picked from the YT or MDAG plates (37.Blommel P.G. Martin P.A. Wrobel R.L. Steffen E. Fox B.G. High efficiency single step production of expression plasmids from cDNA clones using the Flexi Vector cloning system.Protein Expr.

For large scale protein production, 1 liter of unlabeled Terrific Broth (TB) auto-inducing medium or M9 isotopic medium was prepared, and 500-ml aliquots were transferred into sterile PET soda bottles (38.Zhao Q. Frederick R. Seder K. Thao S. Sreenath H. Peterson F. Volkman B.F. Markley J.L. Fox B.G.

Purif. 2005; 40: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Each 500-ml aliquot was inoculated with 10 ml of the overnight MDAG starter culture, and the cell cultures were grown at 37 °C (250–320 rpm) for 2–5 h before dropping the growth temperature to 10–25 °C for 24–36 h. For induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG), the cell cultures were grown to A600 of 1.0–1.5; then the temperature was dropped to 10–25 °C, and IPTG (0.1–0.2 mm final concentration) was added when the temperature had stabilized (after about 15–30 min). For stable isotope labeling, we used an M9-based medium consisting of 100 ml/liter 10× M9 salts (70 g/liter Na2HPO4, 30 g/liter KH2PO4, and 5 g/liter NaCl), 1 ml of 1000× metal mix, 1 ml of vitamin mixture (40.Blommel P.G. Becker K.J. Duvnjak P. Fox B.G. Enhanced bacterial protein expression during auto-induction obtained by alteration of lac repressor dosage and medium composition.Biotechnol. Prog. 2007; 23: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), 30 mg/liter thiamine, 0.5 ml of 0.2 m CaCl2 (0.1 mm final concentration), 2–5 drops of sterile antifoam, 2 ml of 1 m MgSO4 (2 mm final concentration), [U-13C]glucose (2–4 g/liter), 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter), plus the appropriate antibiotics (chloramphenicol to 35 μg/ml and kanamycin to 50–100 μg/ml). At the end of cell growth, the cultures were harvested by centrifugation for 30 min at 4000 × g in a centrifuge with a JS-4.0 rotor (Beckman Coulter; Brea, CA). The cell pastes were stored at −80 °C until needed for protein purification. The composition of the 1st immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300–500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1–2 mm β-mercaptoethanol or DTT, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5–10% glycerol, and 5 mm imidazole. The composition of the 2nd IMAC buffer was the same as the 1st IMAC buffer except that it contained 250 mm imidazole. The SUMO-fusion cleavage buffer contained 20 mm Tris buffer at pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT (or β-mercaptoethanol), and 5–10% glycerol. The TND buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 0.3% NaN3. The TKDM buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2. All E. coli cell pastes were quickly thawed either on ice or at room temperature and then resuspended in 60–70 ml of lysis buffer: 1st IMAC buffer supplemented with Benzonase (Novagen, Millipore; Billerica, MA) or OmniCleave nuclease (Epicenter, Illumina; Madison, WI), rLysozyme (Novagen), RNase (Qiagen; Valencia, CA), and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). To break open the resuspended cells, we used sonication with a total time of 15–30 min at 4 °C, with a duty cycle of 2 s on and 4 s off. Cell lysates were clarified by high-speed centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 30 min in a centrifuge with a JA 30.5Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). The clear cell lysate was then treated with 0.1% w/v polyethylene imine (PEI) to precipitate RNA and then was spun again for 30 min at 25,000 rpm and eluted. DTT was added to a level of 2 mm to ensure reduction of cysteines. The cell lysate was refrigerated at 4 °C, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to 70% (w/v) saturation to precipitate total protein and to remove PEI. Then the sample was spun at 25,000 rpm for 30 min. The protein pellet was resuspended in 30–50 ml of 1st IMAC buffer (without NaCl but with 2 mm DTT), and any debris was discarded after a final centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 30 min. The clarified protein solution was loaded onto a Qiagen Superflow FF or Ni-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) IMAC resin at 1–5 ml/min. The IMAC column was washed first with ∼10 column volumes of 1st IMAC buffer and second with 5–10 column volumes of wash buffer (1st IMAC buffer + 30 mm imidazole). The target protein was eluted with the 2nd IMAC buffer, and fractions were collected. SDS-PAGE was used to analyze and assess the purity of the eluted target protein in the collected fractions. The His-tagged, N-terminal SUMO fusion protein was digested with 0.5 mg of SUMO protease. The reaction was carried out in SUMO-fusion cleavage buffer either by desalting the fusion protein by size exclusion chromatography and adding SUMO protease or, more usually, by dialyzing the fusion protein in the presence of SUMO protease overnight at 4 °C against the cleavage buffer. The cleaved sample was loaded onto a freshly equilibrated subtractive IMAC column, which bound the cleaved His-tagged SUMO domain and allowed the cleaved target protein to pass through to a fraction collector. The purities of the target protein fractions were assessed by SDS-PAGE. Mass spectrometry was used to determined target protein masses and the level of stable isotope incorporation. For NMR samples the TND and TKDM buffers were modified to contain 10% D2O for the frequency lock. All NMR spectra were collected on 600 MHz (1H) Bruker BioSpin (Billerica, MA) NMR spectrometers equipped with a z-gradient cryogenic probe. All sample temperatures were regulated at 25 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2147966944,"The stacking of Golgi cisternae involves GRASP65 and GRASP55. The oligomerization of the N-terminal GRASP domain of these proteins, which consists of two tandem PDZ domains, is required to tether the Golgi membranes. However, the molecular basis for GRASP assembly is unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structures of the GRASP domain of GRASP65 and GRASP55. The structures reveal similar homotypic interactions: the GRASP domain forms a dimer in which the peptide-binding pockets of the two neighboring PDZ2 domains face each other, and the dimers are further connected by the C-terminal tail of one GRASP domain inserting into the binding pocket of the PDZ1 domain in another dimer. Biochemical analysis suggests that both types of contacts are relatively weak but are needed in combination for GRASP-mediated Golgi stacking. Our results unveil a novel mode of membrane tethering by GRASP proteins and provide insight into the mechanism of Golgi stacking."

Increased oxidative stress impairs NO bioavailability and has been described in plasma of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. The aim of the study was to highlight a potential dysfunction of the metabolic profile of NO in red blood cells and in plasma from CAD patients compared with healthy controls. Methods We determined L-arginine/NO pathway by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography methods. The ratio of oxidized and reduced forms of glutathione, as index of oxidative stress, was measured by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. NO synthase expression and activity were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and ex-vivo experiments of L-[15N2]arginine conversion to L-[15N]citrulline respectively. Results Increased amounts of asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginines were found both in red blood cells and in plasma of CAD patients in respect to controls. Interestingly NO synthase expression and activity were reduced in CAD red blood cells. In contrast, oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio was increased in CAD and was associated to arginase activity. Conclusion Our study analyzed for the first time the whole metabolic pathway of L-arginine/NO, both in red blood cells and in plasma, highlighting an impairment of NO pathway in erythrocytes from CAD patients, associated with decreased NO synthase expression/activity and increased oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2009036978,"The study of the components of mitochondrial metabolism has potential benefits for health span and lifespan because the maintenance of efficient mitochondrial function and antioxidant capacity is associated with improved health and survival. In yeast, mitochondrial function requires the tight control of several metabolic processes such as coenzyme Q biosynthesis, assuring an appropriate energy supply and antioxidant functions. Many mitochondrial processes are regulated by phosphorylation cycles mediated by protein kinases and phosphatases. In this study, we determined that the mitochondrial phosphatase Ptc7p, a Ser/Thr phosphatase, was required to regulate coenzyme Q6 biosynthesis, which in turn activated aerobic metabolism and enhanced oxidative stress resistance. We showed that Ptc7p phosphatase specifically activated coenzyme Q6 biosynthesis through the dephosphorylation of the demethoxy-Q6 hydroxylase Coq7p. The current findings revealed that Ptc7p is a regulator of mitochondrial metabolism that is essential to maintain proper function of the mitochondria by regulating energy metabolism and oxidative stress resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2032431749,"Mutations in the rhodopsin gene cause approximately one-tenth of retinitis pigmentosa cases worldwide, and most result in endoplasmic reticulum retention and apoptosis. Other rhodopsin mutations cause receptor mislocalization, diminished/constitutive activity, or faulty protein-protein interactions. The purpose of this study was to test for mechanisms by which the autosomal dominant rhodopsin mutation Ter349Glu causes an early, rapid retinal degeneration in patients. The mutation adds an additional 51 amino acids to the C terminus of the protein. Folding and ligand interaction of Ter349Glu rhodopsin were tested by ultraviolet-visible (UV-visible) spectrophotometry. The ability of the mutant to initiate phototransduction was tested using a radioactive filter binding assay. Photoreceptor localization was assessed both in vitro and in vivo utilizing fluorescent immunochemistry on transfected cells, transgenic Xenopus laevis, and knock-in mice. Photoreceptor ultrastructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Spectrally, Ter349Glu rhodopsin behaves similarly to wild-type rhodopsin, absorbing maximally at 500 nm. The mutant protein also displays in vitro G protein activation similar to that of WT. In cultured cells, mislocalization was observed at high expression levels whereas ciliary localization occurred at low expression levels. Similarly, transgenic X. laevis expressing Ter349Glu rhodopsin exhibited partial mislocalization. Analysis of the Ter349Glu rhodopsin knock-in mouse showed a rapid, early onset degeneration in homozygotes with a loss of proper rod outer segment development and improper disc formation. Together, the data show that both mislocalization and rod outer segment morphogenesis are likely associated with the human phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2073544224,"Streptozotocin (STZ) is widely used as diabetogenic agent in animal models for diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, it is also directly cytotoxic to kidneys, making it difficult to distinguish between DN-related and STZ-induced nephropathy. Therefore, an improved protocol to generate mice for DN studies, with a quick and robust achievement of the diabetic state, without direct kidney toxicity is required. To investigate the mechanism leading to STZ-induced nephropathy, kidney damage was induced with a high dose of STZ. This resulted in delayed gastric emptying, at least partially caused by impaired desacyl ghrelin clearance. STZ uptake in the kidneys is to a large extent mediated by the sodium/glucose cotransporters (Sglts) because the Sglt inhibitor phlorizin could reduce STZ uptake in the kidneys. Consequently, the direct toxic effects in the kidney and the gastric dilatation were resolved without interfering with the β-cell toxicity. Furthermore, pancreatic STZ uptake was increased, hereby decreasing the threshold for β-cell toxicity, allowing for single low non-nephrotoxic STZ doses (70 mg/kg). In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into the mechanism of STZ toxicity in kidneys and suggests a more efficient regime to induce DN with little or no toxic side effects.Background: The diabetogenic agent streptozotocin (STZ) induces direct kidney injury, which is a setback in diabetic nephropathy (DN) research.Results: The Sglt inhibitor phlorizin reduces STZ uptake and hence toxicity in the kidneys.Conclusion: In the kidney, STZ toxicity is mediated by Sglts.Significance: Using the proposed STZ regimen, researchers can now induce DN without direct damage to proximal tubuli.

However, besides β-cells, other tissues such as the kidney are also susceptible to STZ toxicity (5Weiss R.B. Streptozocin: a review of its pharmacology, efficacy, and toxicity.Cancer Treat.

In this regard, single high doses of STZ have a nonspecific cytotoxic effect that causes acute kidney damage in rodents (7Tay Y.-C. Wang Y. Kairaitis L. Rangan G.K. Zhang C. Harris D.C.H.

In addition, STZ induces direct damage to the liver, causing lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial swelling, and peroxisome proliferation, which occur before the onset of hyperglycemia (10Kume E. Fujimura H. Matsuki N. Ito M. Aruga C. Toriumi W. Kitamura K. Doi K. Hepatic changes in the acute phase of streptozotocin (SZ)-induced diabetes in mice.Exp. Toxicol. Pathol. 2004; 55: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). STZ is also immunosuppressive in vitro and in vivo (11Muller Y.D. Golshayan D. Ehirchiou D. Wyss J.C. Giovannoni L. Meier R.

To overcome direct STZ-mediated effects to the kidneys in mouse models of DN, the Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium (AMDCC) recommends multiple low doses of STZ over single high dose regimens (reviewed in Ref. 2Brosius 3rd, F.C. Alpers C.E. Bottinger E.P. Breyer M.D. Coffman T.M. Gurley S.B. Harris R.C. Kakoki M. Kretzler M. Leiter E.H. Levi M. McIndoe R.A. Sharma K. Smithies O. Susztak K. Takahashi N. Takahashi T. Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium Mouse models of diabetic nephropathy.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). However, studies using these multiple low dose protocols show that the diabetes incidence rate with non-fasting blood glucose levels ≥400 mg/dl after 3 weeks is only 50% in C57BL/6 mice (3Tesch G.H. Allen T.J. Rodent models of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy.Nephrology (Carlton). 2007; 12: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a clear need for optimization of the STZ protocols to generate mouse models for DN, with a quicker achievement of the diabetic state, higher diabetes incidence rates, and most importantly, absence of direct toxicity to the kidneys. To address this challenge, a single high dose STZ regimen was used to characterize the mechanism of STZ-mediated kidney injury. Furthermore, we present a new model for STZ-induced DN, by pretreating mice with the nonspecific sodium-glucose cotransporter (Sglt) inhibitor phlorizin, a natural product found in a number of fruit trees (16Ehrenkranz J.R.L. Lewis N.G. Kahn C.R. Roth J. Phlorizin: a review.Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2005; 21: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). This modification results in a quick and robust induction of hyperglycemia by using a single low dose of STZ that does not induce direct renal damage. Experiments were conducted in 12-week-old male C57BL/6J (Janvier, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France), according to the guidelines approved by the KU Leuven Ethical Committee. After overnight fasting, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 125, 200, or 250 mg/kg of bodyweight STZ (Sigma) freshly dissolved in 0.05 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5. Blood glucose levels were assessed daily at 9 a.m. using a Contour glucose meter (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) via tail puncture. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 3 days after injection with STZ or vehicle. Tissues from the hypothalamus, kidneys, liver, and stomach were collected for histological analysis and RNA isolation. The relative stomach weight was determined by dividing the stomach weight after dissection at the pylorus and the gastroesophageal junction by the total body weight. To block Sglt1 and Sglt2 in the kidney, mice were injected with phlorizin. Because phlorizin is injected subcutaneously while STZ is injected intraperitoneally, pretreatment with phlorizin is required before STZ injection. Here, mice were injected twice subcutaneously with 400 mg/kg of phlorizin (Sigma; dissolved in 10% EtOH, 15% dimethyl sulfoxide and 75% normal saline (0.9% w/v NaCl)) 16 and 2 h prior to STZ administration. Mouse tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS (Invitrogen), embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5-μm thickness. Sections were stained with Gill's hematoxylin and eosin to determine overall histology according to standard procedures. Glut2 staining was performed on kidney sections. Rehydrated sections were heated for 20 min in Target Retrieval Solution (pH 6.1, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). After blocking with 20% normal goat serum (Dako) in PBS, slides were incubated for 2 h with polyclonal rabbit anti-Glut2 antibody (1:5000, Millipore, Billerica, MA) diluted in Dako antibody diluent followed by rabbit EnVision (Dako) for 1 h. 3′-3-Diaminobenzidine (DAB+, Dako) was used as substrate chromogen. Overall histology and Glut2-positive tubular cells were evaluated for each section using a Leica DM 2500 M upright microscope (Leica, Solms, Germany). Total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA II (Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA was synthesized using iScript Select cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) using random hexamers. Primers were designed with the ProbeFinder software (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland, listed in supplemental Table S1). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in triplicate with MyiQ single-color real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green. Samples were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh). Blood was taken from the tail vein for analysis of kidney function parameters. Plasma creatinine and urea levels were determined using the QuantiChrom creatinine assay kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA) and the urea assay kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasma desacyl ghrelin concentrations were measured using a desacyl ghrelin ELISA kit (Gentaur, Paris, France). Twelve-week-old C57Bl/6J mice were fasted overnight and injected subcutaneously with 400 mg/kg of phlorizin or buffer alone 16 and 2 h prior to STZ administration. Total kidney and pancreas were isolated 20 min after STZ injection and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax disperser (IKA, Staufen, Germany) in 2 ml of 6% perchloric acid. The lysate was centrifuged at 3,500 rpm, and STZ content in the supernatant was quantified as described in Ref. 17Schnedl W.J. Ferber S. Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. STZ transport and cytotoxicity. Specific enhancement in GLUT2-expressing cells.Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1326-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, 0.2 ml of the supernatant was mixed with 0.5 ml of color reagent (0.5% sulfanilic acid, 0.2% [N-1-naphtyl]ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in 30% acetic acid), and 0.1 ml of 6 m HCl. The mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 10 min, and the absorbance at 595 nm was determined with a Victor X3 plate reader (PerkinElmer). Absorbance values were converted to μg of STZ by fitting to the standard curve prepared with different concentrations of STZ in acetate buffer (0.1 m acetic acid, 0.02 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0). Results were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with the unpaired Student's t test or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's correction. The follow-up of body weight and blood glucose was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. To characterize direct renal toxicity of STZ, 12-week-old C57BL/6J males were divided in different STZ dosage groups. STZ toxicity to kidneys is known to occur in Glut2-expressing cells in the S1 segment of kidney proximal tubule (5Weiss R.B. Streptozocin: a review of its pharmacology, efficacy, and toxicity.Cancer Treat. Rep. 1982; 66: 427-438PubMed Google Scholar). Average kidney Glut2 expression tended to be higher in 125 and 200 mg/kg STZ-treated animals, but was not significantly different from control (Fig. 1a). However, expression levels in the highest dosage group decreased drastically to 20.7 ± 8.5% of control values (p < 0.01), indicating a loss in Glut2-positive cells. Likewise, the expression of Sglt2, which is expressed exclusively near the early proximal convoluted tubule (termed S1) (18Santer R. Calado J. Familial renal glucosuria and SGLT2: from a mendelian trait to a therapeutic target.Clin. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2010; 5: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), also decreased significantly after treatment with 250 mg/kg of STZ (Fig. 1a). In contrast, the expression of Sglt1, which is expressed near the medullary proximal tubule (termed S3) (18Santer R. Calado J. Familial renal glucosuria and SGLT2: from a mendelian trait to a therapeutic target.Clin. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2010; 5: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), remained unaltered after STZ treatment (Fig. 1a). This indicates a loss of the early proximal convolute tubule expressing Glut2 and Sglt2, but not of the medullary proximal tubule expressing Sglt1. Immunohistochemistry for Glut2 on kidney slides (Fig. 1b) showed partial loss of cylindrical tubule cells and desquamation, indicating necrosis of Glut2-expressing cells in the highest dose group. In rare cases, non-necrotic cells with a basal-to-apical shift of the Glut2 expression pattern were also observed. Overall, the Glut2 signal in this dosage group was much lower as compared with control. No abnormalities were observed for 125 and 200 mg/kg of STZ. To evaluate the presence of acute kidney injury, the expression of physiological markers for acute kidney injury was quantified by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1c). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (Ngal) expression in total kidney samples increased 4.3-fold in 125 mg/kg (p < 0.05) and 27.4-fold in 200 mg/kg (p < 0.001), but was the highest in the 250 mg/kg dosage group (863.2-fold increase as compared with control, p < 0.001). Kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) expression increased 4.7-fold in 125 mg/kg (p < 0.01) and 96.1-fold in 200 mg/kg (p < 0.01), with the highest expression observed in the 250 mg/kg dosage group (515.5-fold as compared with control, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1c). To confirm acute kidney injury histologically, standard hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed (Fig. 1d). Kidneys in the highest dose group showed occasional loss of nuclei in proximal tubule cells and disruption of the brush border, suggesting at least moderate acute tubular injury. Dilatation of non-proximal tubules was observed. These data suggest severe kidney damage in the highest dosage group, caused by direct STZ toxicity. As shown in Fig. 2a, there was a variable increase in blood glucose levels depending on the administered STZ dose, which differed significantly 1 day after injection between each dosage group (125 mg/kg versus 200 mg/kg, p < 0.01; 125 mg/kg versus 250 mg/kg, p < 0.05; 200 mg/kg versus 250 mg/kg, p < 0.001). A sudden drop in blood glucose (Fig. 2a) and total body weight (supplemental Fig. S1a) was observed for the highest dosage group (250 mg/kg of STZ) after 3 days (p < 0.05). At this time point, mice that were administered the highest dose were hunched up and appeared to be in poor health. Mice were sacrificed, and stomachs were dissected and weighed. Mice in the highest STZ dose group showed extensive gastric dilatation after sacrifice (Fig. 2b). The stomach weight relative to total body weight was significantly increased after injection with the high dose of STZ (Fig. 2c). The increased stomach weight was not caused by an increased food intake as the food intake in mice injected with high dose of STZ was significantly reduced 1 and 2 days after STZ injection (supplemental Fig. S1b). Likewise, the water intake was also significantly reduced 1 day after STZ injection (supplemental Fig. S1c). Nevertheless, as onset of diabetes is characterized by thirst, a significant increase of the water intake was observed 3 days after STZ injection. It is unlikely that this would explain the gastric dilation because excessive urination was also observed. Mouse stomachs of the highest dose group showed no gross histological abnormalities, and expression of endocrine effectors was unaltered, ruling out a direct effect of STZ on the stomach (supplemental Fig. S2). Direct toxicity to Glut2-expressing hypothalamic neurons is also unlikely to explain the gastric dilatation because STZ itself is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier (19Martindale W. Westcott W. Martindale: the Extra Pharmacopoeia. 29th Ed. Pharmaceutical Press, London1989: 649Google Scholar). Indeed, there was no reduction observed in hypothalamic Glut2 expression (supplemental Fig. S3). However, expression of orexigenic Agrp and anorexigenic Pomc increased and decreased, respectively, but there was no difference between the lowest and the highest STZ dose, marking this as a mere effect of the diabetic state (20Kim E.M. Grace M.K. Welch C.C. Billington C.J. Levine A.S. STZ-induced diabetes decreases and insulin normalizes POMC mRNA in arcuate nucleus and pituitary in rats.Am. J.

STZ-induced liver injury has been described before (10Kume E. Fujimura H. Matsuki N. Ito M. Aruga C. Toriumi W. Kitamura K. Doi K. Hepatic changes in the acute phase of streptozotocin (SZ)-induced diabetes in mice.Exp. Toxicol. Pathol. 2004; 55: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Kume E. Ohmachi Y. Itagaki S. Tamura K. Doi K. Hepatic changes of mice in the subacute phase of streptozotocin (SZ)-induced diabetes.Exp. Toxicol. Pathol. 1994; 46: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), both in the subacute and in the acute phase of toxicity, hereby distinguishing direct effects from hyperglycemia-related changes. Livers from mice in different treatment groups showed a dose-dependent decrease in Glut2 expression (supplemental Fig. S4), indicating that direct STZ-induced liver toxicity is most likely mediated through Glut2. Consistent with these findings, we observed dose-dependent liver damage, as evidenced by progressive foaming of the cytoplasm, more frequently in hepatocytes in the vicinity of central veins. However, not all the mice in the highest dose group showed liver injury to the same extent, which was in some cases not even detectable via standard H&E staining. Thus, changes in the liver cannot account for the observed stomach phenotype. Because decreased stomach motility is common in patients with end-stage kidney disease (23Ravelli A.M. Gastrointestinal function in chronic renal failure.Pediatr. Nephrol. 1995; 9: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Hirako M. Kamiya T. Misu N. Kobayashi Y. Adachi H. Shikano M.

Delay in gastric emptying in patients with chronic renal failure.Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 2004; 39: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and in nephrectomized rats (26Belangero V.M. Collares E.F. Gastric emptying of liquids in rats with acute renal insufficiency.Arq. Gastroenterol. 1998; 35: 278-282PubMed Google Scholar), impaired kidney function as a result of direct STZ toxicity was further investigated as a cause of this stomach phenotype. To assess kidney function, blood plasma was collected 3 days after STZ administration, and kidney function parameters were quantified. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) increased to 52.9 mg/dl in mice treated with 250 mg/kg of STZ as compared with 27.2 mg/dl in controls (p < 0.001), whereas plasma creatinine levels rose to 0.48 mg/dl (controls, 0.33 g/dl; p < 0.01), demonstrating kidney damage in the 250 mg/kg STZ-treated group (Fig. 3a). Plasma desacyl ghrelin levels are increased in end-stage kidney disease patients and nephrectomized rats, suggesting that the kidney is an important site for clearance and/or degradation of this hormone (27Yoshimoto A. Mori K. Sugawara A. Mukoyama M. Yahata K. Suganami T. Takaya K. Hosoda H. Kojima M. Kangawa K. Nakao K. Plasma ghrelin and desacyl ghrelin concentrations in renal failure.J. Am. Soc.

IGF Res. 2005; 15: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Plasma desacyl ghrelin levels were significantly higher in the 250 mg/kg STZ-treated group as compared with vehicle-treated mice (3547 ± 269 fmol/ml versus 849 ± 183 fmol/ml, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3b). These data indicate a substantial impairment of kidney function in the highest STZ dosage group. It has been described that accumulation of desacyl ghrelin impairs gastric motility in mice (30Asakawa A. Inui A. Fujimiya M. Sakamaki R. Shinfuku N. Ueta Y. Meguid M.M. Kasuga M. Stomach regulates energy balance via acylated ghrelin and desacyl ghrelin.Gut. 2005; 54: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), which would explain the disturbed gastric motility at least partially in the 250 mg/kg STZ-treated group. Sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters Sglt1 and Sglt2 are expressed in the proximal tubule of the nephron and contribute to renal glucose reabsorption (31Kinne R.K.H. Castaneda F. SGLT inhibitors as new therapeutic tools in the treatment of diabetes.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2011; : 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because Sglt1 and Sglt2 are in direct contact with the blood filtrate, we hypothesized that administered STZ could be taken up, at least partially, by these cotransporters due to its glucose moiety, resulting in toxicity to proximal tubule cells. To test this hypothesis and to investigate whether or not the kidney damage is a causative factor of the reduced gastric emptying, mice were pretreated with phlorizin, a competitive Sglt inhibitor that does not inhibit Glut2 (31Kinne R.K.H. Castaneda F. SGLT inhibitors as new therapeutic tools in the treatment of diabetes.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2011; : 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). This would block STZ transport through Sglt1 and Sglt2 and as such reduce STZ toxicity in the kidney. If kidney damage is the causative factor for the delayed gastric emptying, the stomach phenotype should be rescued as well. Indeed, pretreatment with 400 mg/kg of phlorizin 2 h before administration of 250 mg/kg of STZ prevented the stomach enlargement completely (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, loss of Glut2 expression caused by injection with 250 mg/kg of STZ was also rescued by pretreatment with phlorizin (250 mg/kg of STZ, 18 ± 3.5% of control; 250 mg/kg of STZ + phlorizin, 80 ± 11.3%, not significantly different from control) (Fig. 4b). Ngal and Kim-1 expression was significantly reduced in the phlorizin group as compared with the group treated with 250 mg/kg of STZ + buffer alone (Fig. 4b). Proximal tubule cells were more eosinophilic in the phlorizin group, and loss of nuclei and disruption of brush-border membrane were less apparent as compared with treatment with buffer alone (Fig. 4, c and d). These data suggest at least a partial rescue of the stomach phenotype by inhibiting STZ entry in proximal tubule cells. Sglt1 is not expressed in the stomach and hypothalamus and only expressed at low levels in the liver (32Yoshikawa T. Inoue R. Matsumoto M. Yajima T. Ushida K. Iwanaga T. Comparative expression of hexose transporters (SGLT1, GLUT1, GLUT2 and GLUT5) throughout the mouse gastrointestinal tract.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2011; 135: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Sglt2 is highly expressed in the kidney but not in the stomach, liver, and hypothalamus (supplemental Fig. S5). As such, this experiment strongly suggests that the kidney damage is the causative factor of the reduced gastric motility. To further substantiate the hypothesis that STZ can enter tubular cells via Sglts, in vivo STZ uptake experiments were performed with or without phlorizin pretreatment (Fig. 5). Kidney STZ content was significantly lower in the phlorizin group 20 min after STZ injection (Fig. 5a; 19.6 ± 0.9 μg of STZ per total kidney versus 29.7 ± 2.5 μg for the control group, p < 0.01), indicating inhibition of STZ entry in tubular cells. In contrast, uptake in the pancreas was significantly increased after phlorizin pretreatment (21.4 ± 1.7 μg of STZ per total pancreas versus 11.8 ± 2 μg for controls, p < 0.01). This suggests that phlorizin inhibits the uptake of STZ in the kidney and increased uptake in the pancreas. Blood glucose measured 2 h after phlorizin pretreatment was significantly reduced as compared with pretreatment with buffer alone (Fig. 5b). This is consistent with the established blood glucose-lowering effect of phlorizin due to blocked reabsorption of the filtere"
https://openalex.org/W2113531253,"It is important to understand changes in cell distribution that occur as a part of disease progression. This is typically achieved using standard sectioning and immunostaining, however, many structures and cell distribution patterns are not readily appreciated in two-dimensions, including the distribution of neural stem and progenitor cells in the mouse forebrain. Three-dimensional immunostaining in the mouse brain has been hampered by poor penetration. For this reason, we have developed a method that allows for entire hemispheres of the mouse brain to be stained using commercially available antibodies. Brains stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein, doublecortin and nestin were imaged in three-dimensions using optical projection tomography and serial two-photon tomography. This staining method is simple, using a combination of heat, time and specimen preparation procedures readily available, so that it can be easily implemented without the need for specialized equipment, making it accessible to most laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W1999290778,"Animal personalities, i.e. consistent differences in behavior across time and/or context, have received increased attention of behavioral biologists over the last years. Recent research shows that personalities represent traits on which natural and sexual selection work and which can have substantial fitness consequences. The aim of this study is to establish the personality structure of crested macaque (Macaca nigra) males as foundation for future studies on its adaptive value. We collected behavioral data through focal animal sampling and additionally conducted two sets of playback experiments. Results of a factor analysis on the behavioral data revealed a four factor structure with components we labeled Anxiety, Sociability, Connectedness and Aggressiveness. Results from the experiments revealed an additional and independent Boldness factor but the absence of Neophilia. Overall, this structure resembles other macaque and animal species with the exception of Connectedness, which might be a consequence of the species' tolerant social style. Our results thus not only form the basis for future studies on the adaptive value of personality in crested macaques but also contribute an important data point for investigating the evolution of personality structure from a comparative perspective by refining, for example, which personality factors characterized the last common ancestor of hominids and macaques."
https://openalex.org/W2010326838,"Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and associated spinal disorders are leading sources of morbidity, and they can be responsible for chronic low back pain. Treatments for degenerative disc diseases continue to be a challenge. Intensive research is now focusing on promoting regeneration of degenerated discs by stimulating production of the disc matrix. Link protein N-terminal peptide (LPP) is a proteolytic fragment of link protein, an important cross-linker and stabilizer of the major structural components of cartilage, aggrecan and hyaluronan. In this study we investigated LPP action in rabbit primary intervertebral disc cells cultured ex vivo in a three-dimensional alginate matrix. Our data reveal that LPP promotes disc matrix production, which was evidenced by increased expression of the chondrocyte-specific transcription factor SOX9 and the extracellular matrix macromolecules aggrecan and collagen II. Using colocalization and pulldown studies we further document a noggin-insensitive direct peptide-protein association between LPP and BMP-RII. This association mediated Smad signaling that converges on BMP genes leading to expression of BMP-4 and BMP-7. Furthermore, through a cell-autonomous loop BMP-4 and BMP-7 intensified Smad1/5 signaling though a feedforward circuit involving BMP-RI, ultimately promoting expression of SOX9 and downstream aggrecan and collagen II genes. Our data define a complex regulatory signaling cascade initiated by LPP and suggest that LPP may be a useful therapeutic substitute for direct BMP administration to treat IVD degeneration and to ameliorate IVD-associated chronic low back pain."
https://openalex.org/W2018265937,"Background/Objective Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposed on apoptotic cells has been shown to stimulate production of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and promote anti-inflammatory responses. However, the PS receptor(s) responsible for this induction has not been clearly determined. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, using RAWTβRII cells in which a truncated dominant negative TGF-β receptor II was stably transfected in order to avoid auto-feedback induction of TGF-β, we show that TGF-β1 synthesis is initiated via activation of the scavenger receptor, CD36. The response requires exposure of PS on the apoptotic cell surface and was absent in macrophages lacking CD36. Direct activation of CD36 with an anti-CD36 antibody initiated TGF-β1 production, and signaling pathways involving both Lyn kinase and ERK1/2 were shown to participate in CD36-driven TGF-β1 expression. Conclusion/Significance Since CD36 has been previously implicated in activation of secreted latent TGF-β, the present study indicates its role in the multiple steps to generation of this important biological mediator."
https://openalex.org/W2018973560,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) undergo dynamic transitions between active and inactive conformations. Usually, these conversions are triggered when the receptor detects an external signal, but some so-called constitutively activating mutations, or CAMs, induce a GPCR to bind and activate G proteins in the absence of external stimulation, in ways still not fully understood. Here, we investigated how a CAM alters the structure of a GPCR and the dynamics involved as the receptor transitions between different conformations. Our approach used site-directed fluorescence labeling (SDFL) spectroscopy to compare opsin, the ligand-free form of the GPCR rhodopsin, with opsin containing the CAM M257Y, focusing specifically on key movements that occur in the sixth transmembrane helix (TM6) during GPCR activation. The site-directed fluorescence labeling data indicate opsin is constrained to an inactive conformation both in detergent micelles and lipid membranes, but when it contains the M257Y CAM, opsin is more dynamic and can interact with a G protein mimetic. Further study of these receptors using tryptophan-induced quenching (TrIQ) methods indicates that in detergent, the CAM significantly increases the population of receptors in the active state, but not in lipids. Subsequent Arrhenius analysis of the TrIQ data suggests that, both in detergent and lipids, the CAM lowers the energy barrier for TM6 movement, a key transition required for conversion between the inactive and active conformations.

https://openalex.org/W2058268468,"While “vibrational noise” induced by rotating components of machinery is a common problem constantly faced by engineers, the controlled conversion of translational into rotational motion or vice-versa is a desirable goal in many scenarios ranging from internal combustion engines to ultrasonic motors. In this work, we describe the underlying physics after isolating a single degree of freedom, focusing on devices that convert a vibration along the vertical axis into a rotation around this axis. A typical Vibrot (as we label these devices) consists of a rigid body with three or more cantilevered elastic legs attached to its bottom at an angle. We show that these legs are capable of transforming vibration into rotation by a “ratchet effect”, which is caused by the anisotropic stick-slip-flight motion of the leg tips against the ground. Drawing an analogy with the Froude number used to classify the locomotion dynamics of legged animals, we discuss the walking regime of these robots. We are able to control the rotation frequency of the Vibrot by manipulating the shaking amplitude, frequency or waveform. Furthermore, we have been able to excite Vibrots with acoustic waves, which allows speculating about the possibility of reducing the size of the devices so they can perform tasks into the human body, excited by ultrasound waves from the outside."
https://openalex.org/W2090387119,"Moraxella catarrhalis is a mucosal pathogen that causes childhood otitis media and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. During the course of infection, M. catarrhalis needs to adhere to epithelial cells of different host niches such as the nasopharynx and lungs, and consequently, efficient adhesion to epithelial cells is considered an important virulence trait of M. catarrhalis. By using Tn-seq, a genome-wide negative selection screenings technology, we identified 15 genes potentially required for adherence of M. catarrhalis BBH18 to pharyngeal epithelial Detroit 562 and lung epithelial A549 cells. Validation with directed deletion mutants confirmed the importance of aroA (3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyl-transferase), ecnAB (entericidin EcnAB), lgt1 (glucosyltransferase), and MCR_1483 (outer membrane lipoprotein) for cellular adherence, with ΔMCR_1483 being most severely attenuated in adherence to both cell lines. Expression profiling of M. catarrhalis BBH18 during adherence to Detroit 562 cells showed increased expression of 34 genes in cell-attached versus planktonic bacteria, among which ABC transporters for molybdate and sulfate, while reduced expression of 16 genes was observed. Notably, neither the newly identified genes affecting adhesion nor known adhesion genes were differentially expressed during adhesion, but appeared to be constitutively expressed at a high level. Profiling of the transcriptional response of Detroit 562 cells upon adherence of M. catarrhalis BBH18 showed induction of a panel of pro-inflammatory genes as well as genes involved in the prevention of damage of the epithelial barrier. In conclusion, this study provides new insight into the molecular interplay between M. catarrhalis and host epithelial cells during the process of adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2090864924,"Heterochromatin silences transcription, contributing to development, differentiation, and genome stability in eukaryotic organisms. Budding yeast heterochromatic silencing is strictly dependent on the silent information regulator (SIR) complex composed of the Sir2 histone deacetylase and the chromatin-interacting proteins Sir3 and Sir4. We use reconstituted SIR heterochromatin to characterize the steps in transcription that are disrupted to achieve silencing. Transcriptional activator binding is permitted before and after heterochromatin assembly. A comprehensive proteomic approach identified heterochromatin-mediated disruption of activator interactions with coactivator complexes. We also find that if RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is allowed to initiate transcription, the SIR complex blocks elongation on chromatin while maintaining Pol II in a halted conformation. This Pol II elongation barrier functions for even one nucleosome, is more effective when assembled with multiple nucleosomes, and is sensitive to a histone mutation that is known to disrupt silencing. This dual mechanism of silencing suggests a conserved principle of heterochromatin in assembling a specific structure that targets multiple steps to achieve repression."
https://openalex.org/W1998131361,"Music has a pervasive tendency to rhythmically engage our body. In contrast, synchronization with speech is rare. Music's superiority over speech in driving movement probably results from isochrony of musical beats, as opposed to irregular speech stresses. Moreover, the presence of regular patterns of embedded periodicities (i.e., meter) may be critical in making music particularly conducive to movement. We investigated these possibilities by asking participants to synchronize with isochronous auditory stimuli (target), while music and speech distractors were presented at one of various phase relationships with respect to the target. In Exp. 1, familiar musical excerpts and fragments of children poetry were used as distractors. The stimuli were manipulated in terms of beat/stress isochrony and average pitch to achieve maximum comparability. In Exp. 2, the distractors were well-known songs performed with lyrics, on a reiterated syllable, and spoken lyrics, all having the same meter. Music perturbed synchronization with the target stimuli more than speech fragments. However, music superiority over speech disappeared when distractors shared isochrony and the same meter. Music's peculiar and regular temporal structure is likely to be the main factor fostering tight coupling between sound and movement."
https://openalex.org/W2127294067,"The transcriptional co-repressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) interacts with a number of repressor proteins and chromatin modifying enzymes. How the biochemical properties including binding of dinucleotide, oligomerization, and dehydrogenase domains of CtBP1 direct the assembly of a functional co-repressor to influence gene expression is not well understood. In the current study we demonstrate that CtBP1 assembles into a tetramer in a NAD(H)-dependent manner, proceeding through a dimeric intermediate. We find that NAD-dependent oligomerization correlates with NAD(+) binding affinity and that the carboxyl terminus is required for assembly of a dimer of dimers. Mutant CtBP1 proteins that abrogate dinucleotide-binding retain wild type affinity for the PXDLS motif, but do not self-associate either in vitro or in vivo. CtBP1 proteins with mutations in the dehydrogenase domain still retain the ability to self-associate and bind target proteins. Both co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid experiments demonstrate that CtBP1 self-association occurs within the nucleus, and depends on dinucleotide binding. Repression of transcription does not depend on dinucleotide binding or an intact dehydrogenase domain, but rather depends on the amino-terminal domain that recruits PXDLS containing targets. We show that tryptophan 318 (Trp(318)) is a critical residue for tetramer assembly and likely functions as a switch for effective dimerization following NAD(+) binding. These results suggest that dinucleotide binding permits CtBP1 to form an intranuclear homodimer through a Trp(318) switch, creating a nucleation site for multimerization through the C-terminal domain for tetramerization to form an effective repression complex."
https://openalex.org/W2023901552,"Photosystem II (PSII) is a membrane-bound enzyme that utilizes solar energy to catalyze the photooxidation of water. Molecular oxygen is evolved after four sequential light-driven oxidation reactions at the Mn4CaO5 oxygen-evolving complex, producing five sequentially oxidized states, Sn. PSII is composed of 17 membrane-spanning subunits and three extrinsic subunits, PsbP, PsbQ, and PsbO. PsbO is intrinsically disordered and plays a role in facilitation of the water oxidizing cycle. Native PsbO can be removed and substituted with recombinant PsbO, thereby restoring steady-state activity. In this report, we used reaction-induced Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to obtain information concerning the role of PsbP, PsbQ, and PsbO during the S state cycle. Light-minus-dark difference spectra were acquired, monitoring structural changes associated with each accessible flash-induced S state transition in a highly purified plant PSII preparation (Triton X-100, octylthioglucoside). A comparison of S2 minus S1 spectra revealed that removal of PsbP and PsbQ had no significant effect on the data, whereas amide frequency and intensity changes were associated with PsbO removal. These data suggest that PsbO acts as an organizational template for the PSII reaction center. To identify any coupled conformational changes arising directly from PsbO, global (13)C-PsbO isotope editing was employed. The reaction-induced Fourier transform infrared spectra of accessible S states provide evidence that PsbO spectral contributions are temperature (263 and 277 K) and S state dependent. These experiments show that PsbO undergoes catalytically relevant structural dynamics, which are coupled over long distance to hydrogen-bonding changes at the Mn4CaO5 cluster."

Brucella abortus is an intracellular pathogen that circumvents host defenses, but little is known about the precise infection mechanisms that involve interaction with lipid raft-associated mediators. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clathrin-mediated phagocytic mechanisms of B. abortus. The clathrin dependence of B. abortus infection in HeLa cells was investigated using an infection assay and immunofluorescence microscopy. The redistribution of clathrin in the membrane and in phagosomes was investigated using sucrose gradient fractionation of lipid rafts and the isolation of B. abortus-containing vacuoles, respectively. Clathrin and dynamin were concentrated into lipid rafts during B. abortus infection, and the entry and intracellular survival of B. abortus within HeLa cells were abrogated by clathrin inhibition. Clathrin disruption decreased actin polymerization and the colocalization of B. abortus-containing vacuoles with clathrin and Rab5 but not lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1). Thus, our data demonstrate that clathrin plays a fundamental role in the entry and intracellular survival of B. abortus via interaction with lipid rafts and actin rearrangement. This process facilitates the early intracellular trafficking of B. abortus to safe replicative vacuoles."
https://openalex.org/W1964811368,"Long-standing dogma proposes a profound contribution of membrane binding by prothrombin in determining the rate at which it is converted to thrombin by prothrombinase. We have examined the action of prothrombinase on full-length prothrombin variants lacking γ-carboxyglutamate modifications (desGla) with impaired membrane binding. We show an unexpectedly modest decrease in the rate of thrombin formation for desGla prothrombin but with a major effect on the pathway for substrate cleavage. Using desGla prothrombin variants in which the individual cleavage sites have been singly rendered uncleavable, we find that loss of membrane binding and other Gla-dependent functions in the substrate leads to a decrease in the rate of cleavage at Arg(320) and a surprising increase in the rate of cleavage at Arg(271). These compensating effects arise from a loss in the membrane component of exosite-dependent tethering of substrate to prothrombinase and a relaxation in the constrained presentation of the individual cleavage sites for active site docking and catalysis. Loss of constraint is evident as a switch in the pathway for prothrombin cleavage and the intermediate produced but without the expected profound decrease in rate. Extension of these findings to the action of prothrombinase assembled on platelets and endothelial cells on fully carboxylated prothrombin reveals new mechanistic insights into function on physiological membranes. Cell-dependent enzyme function is probably governed by a differential ability to support prothrombin binding and the variable accumulation of intermediates from the two possible pathways of prothrombin activation."

We assessed NT pro-BNP and other parameters of cardiac dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis, with or without ascites, in order to determine whether the behaviour of NT pro BNP is linked to the stage of liver disease or to secondary cardiac dysfunction.Fifty eight consecutive hospitalized patients mostly with viral or NAFLD-related cirrhosis were studied. All underwent abdominal ultrasound and upper GI endoscopy. Cardiac morpho-functional changes were evaluated by echocardiography and NT-pro-BNP plasma levels determined upon admission. Twenty-eight hypertensive patients, without evidence of liver disease served as controls.Fifty eight cirrhotic patients (72% men) with a median age of 62 years (11% with mild arterial hypertension and 31% with type 2 diabetes) had a normal renal function (mean creatinine 0.9 mg/dl, range 0.7-1.06). As compared to controls, cirrhotic patients had higher NT pro-BNP plasma levels (365.2±365.2 vs 70.8±70.6 pg/ml; p<0.001). Left atrial volume (LAV) (61.8±26.3 vs 43.5±14.1 ml; p = 0.001), and left ventricular ejection fraction (62.7±6.9 vs. 65.5±4%,; p = 0.05) were also altered in cirrhotic patients that in controls. Patients with F2-F3 oesophageal varices as compared to F0/F1, showed higher e' velocity (0.91±0.23 vs 0.66±0.19 m/s, p<0.001), and accordingly a higher E/A ratio (1.21±0.46 vs 0.89±0.33 m/s., p = 0.006).NT-pro-BNP plasma levels are increased proportionally to the stage of chronic liver disease. Advanced cirrhosis and high NT-pro-BNP levels are significantly associated to increased LAV and to signs of cardiac diastolic dysfunction. NT pro-BNP levels could hence be an useful prognostic indicators of early decompensation of cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W2023708410,"Recent studies report that STAT3 signaling is a master regulator of mesenchymal transformation of gliomas and that STAT3 modulated genes are highly expressed in the mesenchymal transcriptome of gliomas. A currently studied experimental treatment for gliomas consists of intratumoral injection of oncolytic viruses (OV), such as oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (oHSV). We have described one particular oHSV (rQNestin34.5) that exhibits potent anti-glioma activity in animal models. Here, we hypothesized that alterations in STAT3 signaling in glioma cells may affect the replicative ability of rQNestin34.5. In fact, human U251 glioma cells engineered to either over-express STAT3 or with genetic down-regulation of STAT3 supported oHSV replication to a significantly higher or lesser degree, respectively, when compared to controls. Administration of pharmacologic agents that increase STAT3 phosphorylation/activation (Valproic Acid) or increase STAT3 levels (Interleukin 6) also significantly enhanced oHSV replication. Instead, administration of inhibitors of STAT3 phosphorylation/activation (LLL12) significantly reduced oHSV replication. STAT3 led to a reduction in interferon signaling in oHSV infected cells and inhibition of interferon signaling abolished the effect of STAT3 on oHSV replication. These data thus indicate that STAT3 signaling in malignant gliomas enhances oHSV replication, likely by inhibiting the interferon response in infected glioma cells, thus suggesting avenues for possible potentiation of oncolytic virotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2028693184,"Due to the low percentage of fetal DNA present in maternal plasma (< 10%) during early gestation, efficient extraction processes are required for successful downstream detection applications in non-invasive prenatal diagnostic testing. In this study, two extraction methods using similar chemistries but different workflows were compared for isolation efficiency and percent fetal DNA recovery. The Akonni Biosystems TruTip technology uses a binding matrix embedded in a pipette tip; the Circulating Nucleic Acids Kit from Qiagen employs a spin column approach. The TruTip method adds an extra step to decrease the recovery of DNA fragments larger than 600 bp from the sample to yield an overall higher percentage of smaller molecular weight DNA, effectively enriching for fetal DNA. In this evaluation, three separate extraction comparison studies were performed - a dilution series of fragmented DNA in plasma, a set of clinical maternal samples, and a blood collection tube time point study of maternal samples. Both extraction methods were found to efficiently extract small fragment DNA from large volumes of plasma. In the amended samples, the TruTip extraction method was ~15% less efficient with overall DNA recovery, but yielded an 87% increase in % fetal DNA relative to the Qiagen method. The average percent increase of fetal DNA of TruTip extracted samples compared to the Qiagen method was 55% for all sets of blinded clinical samples. A study comparing extraction efficiencies from whole blood samples incubated up to 48 hours prior to processing into plasma resulted in more consistent % fetal DNA recoveries using TruTip. The extracted products were tested on two detection platforms, quantitative real-time PCR and droplet digital PCR, and yielded similar results for both extraction methods."
https://openalex.org/W2065388862,"Because of its ability to rapidly depolymerize F-actin, plasma gelsolin has emerged as a therapeutic molecule in different disease conditions. High amounts of exogenous gelsolin are, however, required to treat animal models of different diseases. Knowing that the F-actin depolymerizing property of gelsolin resides in its N terminus, we made several truncated versions of plasma gelsolin. The smaller versions, particularly the one composed of the first 28-161 residues, depolymerized the F-actin much faster than the native gelsolin and other truncates at the same molar ratios. Although G1-G3 loses its dependence on Ca(2+) or low pH for the actin depolymerization function, interestingly, G1-G2 and its smaller versions were found to regain this requirement. Small angle x-ray scattering-based shape reconstructions revealed that G1-G3 adopts an open shape in both the presence and the absence of Ca(2+) as well as low pH, whereas G1-G2 and residues 28-161 prefer collapsed states in Ca(2+)-free conditions at pH 8. The mutations in the g2-g3 linker resulted in the calcium sensitivity of the mutant G1-G3 for F-actin depolymerization activity, although the F-actin-binding sites remained exposed in the mutant G1-G3 as well as in the smaller truncates even in the Ca(2+)-free conditions at pH 8. Furthermore, unlike wild type G1-G3, calcium-sensitive mutants of G1-G3 acquired closed shapes in the absence of free calcium, implying a role of g2-g3 linker in determining the open F-actin depolymerizing-competent shape of G1-G3 in this condition. We demonstrate that the mobility of the G1 domain, essential for F-actin depolymerization, is indirectly regulated by the gelsolin-like sequence of g2-g3 linker."

At their active sites, copper amine oxidases contain both a mononuclear copper ion and a protein-derived quinone cofactor. Proposals have been made for the activation of molecular oxygen via both a Cu(II)-aminoquinol catalytic intermediate and a Cu(I)-semiquinone intermediate. Using protein crystallographic freeze-trapping methods under low oxygen conditions combined with single-crystal microspectrophotometry, we have determined structures corresponding to the iminoquinone and semiquinone forms of the enzyme. Methylamine reduction at acidic or neutral pH has revealed protonated and deprotonated forms of the iminoquinone that are accompanied by a bound oxygen species that is likely hydrogen peroxide. However, methylamine reduction at pH 8.5 has revealed a copper-ligated cofactor proposed to be the semiquinone form. A copper-ligated orientation, be it the sole identity of the semiquinone or not, blocks the oxygen-binding site, suggesting that accessibility of Cu(I) may be the basis of partitioning O2 activation between the aminoquinol and Cu(I)."

Although ChlD is absolutely required for catalysis, the role of ChlD in the chelation reaction is unknown. ChlD contains three domains: a C-terminal integrin domain, a proline-rich linker domain, and an N-terminal AAA+ domain. The C-terminal integrin domain contains an essential MIDAS motif, proposed to be involved in Mg2+ binding (7.Fodje M.N. Hansson A. Hansson M. Olsen J.G. Gough S. Willows R.D. Al-Karadaghi S.

The proline-rich linker is essential, but its role is unknown (11.Gräfe S. Saluz H.P. Grimm B. Hänel F.

We address here the significance of the AAA+ domain of ChlD and show that mutating conserved residues in the ATPase site of ChlD substantially reduces chelatase activity and specificity toward both MgATP2− and Mg2+. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Porphyrins were obtained from Frontier Scientific (Logan, UT). The expression vectors pET9a-ChlI, pET9a-His6ChlD, and pET9a-His6ChlH were used to produce recombinant protein (12.Jensen P.E. Gibson L.C. Hunter C.N.

The temperature was then lowered to 18 °C and cells harvested after 15 h. Proteins were then purified essentially as described previously (1.Reid J.D. Hunter C.N.

Site-directed mutants were produced using the QuikChange method (Agilient, Cheshire, UK) and verified by sequencing (University of Sheffield, Core Genomics Facility). Spectra were recorded with a JASCO-810 spectrometer (JASCO, Great Dunmow, UK). Protein (0.1 mg ml−1) was in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4. Spectra were recorded in a cuvette with a 0.2-cm path length. Spectra were recorded stepwise, from 250 to 190 nm (1-nm increments, 4 s/nm). Thermal stability was determined by monitoring the change in ellipticity of protein at 222 nm with temperature. Complex formation between His6-ChlD and ChlI was determined by mixing 2 μm ChlD and 2 μm ChlI (15 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tricine, 0.3 m glycerol, pH 7.9) in the presence or absence of 5 mm ADP with 40 μl Ni(II) chelating Sepharose (GE Healthcare), at room temperature in a total volume of 200 μl. The resin was washed three times with buffer (as above), and 40 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added directly to the resin and heated to 95 °C for 15 min. A 10-μl sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Chelatase assays were performed at 34 °C, I 0.1, and pH 7.7 in 50 mm MOPS/KOH, 0.3 m glycerol, 1 mm DTT (1.Reid J.D. Hunter C.N.

Assays were initiated by the addition of enzyme to give a final concentration of 0.1 μm ChlD, 0.2 μm ChlI, and 0.4 μm ChlH. Substrate concentrations are given in the figure legends, but assays generally contained 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 8 μm DIX. Deuteroporphyrin (DIX) solutions were prepared weekly in assay buffer and discarded if precipitated, magnesium deuteroporphyrin (MgDIX) was prepared on the day of use. ATP was determined spectrophotometrically, ϵ260 15,400 m−1 cm−1 as were DIX and MgDIX (after the instantaneous conversion to DIX in 0.1 m HCl), ϵ398 433 000 m−1 cm−1 in 0.1 m HCl (14.Dawson R.M.C. Data for Biochemical Research. Oxford University Press, Oxford1969: 105Google Scholar, 15.Falk J.E. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier, London1964: 236Google Scholar). Reactions were followed using a continuous fluorometric assay for MgDIX. Reactions (100 μl) were observed in a FLUOStar Optima plate-reader using a xenon flash lamp (BMG Labtech, Aylesbury, Buckshire, UK) with excitation through a 420-nm (bandpass 10 nm) filter and emission through a 580-nm (bandpass 10 nm) filter. Chelatase assays were performed as described above with 0.1 μm ChlD, 0.4 μm ChlH, and variable amounts of ChlI. Rates were estimated using the software supplied with the instrument (MARS Data Analysis Software Version 1.20 R2; BMG Labtech). Nonlinear regression was performed using Igor Pro 6.22A (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting Equation 1 or 2 to the data, and errors were determined from least squares analysis of the fits. To estimate kcat, the concentration of active enzyme was assumed to be the concentration of the ChlH subunit. In these equations, Km is the Michaelis constant, K0.5 is the substrate concentration that gives half-maximal velocity in the Hill equation, and n is the Hill parameter, an empirical measure of cooperativity. Vss=kcat[E][S]Km+[S](Eq. 1) Vss=kcat[E]1+(K0.5[S])n(Eq. 2) Assembly titrations were analyzed by fitting Equation 3 to the steady-state rates. Vss=Vlim[Chll]+nd+Kapp−([Chll]+nd+Kapp)2−4nd[Chll]2nd(Eq. 3) In Equation 3, vss is the observed steady-state rate, vlim is the limiting steady-state rate reached at saturating ChlI, nd is the concentration of binding sites for ChlI, i.e. [ChlD] × (number of sites/ChlD), and Kapp is the apparent disassociation constant for the active ChlI-ChlD complex. The ATP binding site is conserved across the AAA+ superfamily. Previous studies have shown that mutation of conserved residues in this site affects a range of steps in the ATP hydrolysis pathway, including nucleotide binding, nucleotide hydrolysis, and hydrolysis-dependent conformational changes (for review, see Refs. 16.Hanson P.I. Whiteheart S.W. AAA+ proteins: have engine, will work.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 17.Wendler P. Ciniawsky S. Kock M. Kube S. Structure and function of the AAA+ nucleotide binding pocket.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We selected residues for mutation that in other members of the superfamily are involved in all of these steps. The conserved lysine residue in Walker A motifs often binds nucleotide phosphates, and mutation of these residues frequently prevents or reduces nucleotide binding (18.Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. The Vps4p AAA ATPase regulates membrane association of a Vps protein complex required for normal endosome function.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2982-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In contrast, the conserved glutamate in the Walker B motif often activates water for nucleophilic attack on the terminal phosphate. Mutation of this residue frequently prevents nucleotide hydrolysis, but not nucleotide binding (18.Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D.

The Sensor II arginine often directly interacts with the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP, and mutations in this residue can prevent ATP binding or hydrolysis (17.Wendler P. Ciniawsky S. Kock M. Kube S. Structure and function of the AAA+ nucleotide binding pocket.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 20.Ogura T. Whiteheart S.W. Wilkinson A.J.

Biol. 2004; 146: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This arginine is found in the C-terminal helical domain, so if ChlD shows a domain rearrangement similar to that seen in the homologous BchI, this residue will be acting across the protomer interface (7.Fodje M.N. Hansson A. Hansson M. Olsen J.G. Gough S. Willows R.D. Al-Karadaghi S. Interplay between an AAA module and an integrin I domain may regulate the function of magnesium chelatase.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Arginine finger residues also act across protomer interfaces, and mutations in these residues often result in complete loss of activity (17.Wendler P. Ciniawsky S. Kock M. Kube S. Structure and function of the AAA+ nucleotide binding pocket.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 20.Ogura T. Whiteheart S.W. Wilkinson A.J.

Biol. 2004; 146: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We have produced a series of mutants in the AAA+ domain of ChlD from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. These are K49A in the Walker A motif, E152Q in the Walker B motif, R208A removing the arginine finger and R289A removing the Sensor II arginine. All four mutant ChlD proteins can be purified by conventional methods. CD spectra for the wild type protein, K49A, and E152Q are essentially identical, whereas the R208A mutant shows a slightly increased helical content and the R289A mutant shows a reduced amount of secondary structure (Fig. 1). These CD spectra are all consistent with folded protein, although both arginine mutants (R208A and R289A) have some changes in secondary structure (Fig. 1). These residues are generally found at the interface between individual subunits in the oligomeric complex, and assembly of AAA+ complexes often depends on nucleotide binding (17.Wendler P. Ciniawsky S. Kock M. Kube S. Structure and function of the AAA+ nucleotide binding pocket.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This suggests that mutating the ATPase sites could reduce the stability of the complexes. We determined whether these mutants form stable complexes with the ChlI protein. Intact complexes can be co-purified on a Ni2+ column (6.Jensen P.E. Gibson L.C. Hunter C.N. ATPase activity associated with the magnesium-protoporphyrin IX chelatase enzyme of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803: evidence for ATP hydrolysis during Mg2+ insertion, and the MgATP-dependent interaction of the ChlI and ChlD subunits.Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Control experiments demonstrate that ChlI does not bind these columns in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. 2, odd numbered lanes). All four of the mutant ChlD proteins discussed here bind to ChlI (Fig. 2). Co-purification does not allow us to quantify binding, but the R289A mutant appears to bind less ChlI than the other mutants or the wild type protein. To quantify the binding interaction between ChlI and the ChlD mutants, we titrated ChlI against ChlD under assay conditions, monitoring the formation of porphyrin product. This assay directly evaluates the production of catalytically active complexes and allows us to disentangle the effects of mutation on complex formation (appearing in Kapp and nd) and the activity of the complex (appearing in vlim). These titrations demonstrate that the arginine mutants have a reduced binding affinity, but that under our assay conditions (0.2 μm ChlI, 0.1 μm ChlD, 0.4 μm ChlH) the vast majority of ChlD is found in active complexes (Fig. 3). Despite the low activity of the E152Q mutant, this species assembles into complexes very much like the wild type protein. The binding titration shows a characteristic tight-binding curve, with an estimated binding constant, Kapp, of 0.35 nm, much below the protein concentration in our assays (Fig. 3). The extent of complex formation seen with the E152Q mutant is essentially indistinguishable from the wild type protein with 99.6% of ChlD in the complex (extent of complex formation was calculated from Equation 3 and the parameters in Fig. 3). The R208A mutant of ChlD will form an active chelatase complex, with the same optimal subunit ratio as the wild type enzyme. This mutant however shows weaker binding into the chelatase with a Kapp of 14 nm (Fig. 3). As we are working with an excess of ChlI and at concentrations well above Kapp, the R208A mutant is overwhelmingly (approximately 89%) found in active chelatase complexes. In contrast, the R289A mutant has a Kapp of 52 nm, approaching the concentrations of protein used in these assays (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, at assay concentrations of ChlI and ChlD (0.2 and 0.1 μm, respectively), 71% of this mutant will be present in the active complex. This mutant shows <10% of the activity of the wild type (see below); this loss in activity cannot be attributed to impaired complex formation. Our series of mutants probe the role of the conserved AAA+ domain in ChlD. All of these mutant proteins are less active than the wild type enzyme (Fig. 4). The most active, the arginine finger mutant (R208A) shows just over 50% the activity of wild type enzyme, followed by the Walker B mutant (E152Q) and the Sensor II mutant (R289A). Metal ion chelation was undetectable with K49A, the Walker A mutant (Fig. 4). Clearly, the AAA+ site in ChlD is required for chelatase activity. We can gain further insight by examining the kinetic behavior of the mutant proteins in more detail. The R208A mutation removes the arginine finger. This protein retains substantial activity (kcat >50% of wild type) and is the least impaired of all the mutants examined (Fig. 4). The effect of this mutation on substrate handling is likewise modest. Specificity for MgATP2−, kcat/K0.5, is approximately 35% of the wild type (Fig. 4). This is a significant reduction in kcat/K0.5, but not as much as would be expected if this residue were directly involved in nucleotide hydrolysis. Specificity constants for Mg2+ and porphyrin are approximately 70% of wild type (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, respectively). This mutation has a small effect on specificity for Mg2+ and porphyrin.FIGURE 5Free magnesium dependence of the steady-state chelation rate with wild type (a), R208A (b), E152Q (c), and R289A (d) variants of ChlD.

This mutation affects the specificity for MgATP2− with kcat/K0.5 dropping to 16% of wild type (Fig. 4). Notably, this mutation also affects specificity toward Mg2+. The kcat/K0.5 for Mg2+ falls to approximately 30% of wild type, suggesting that this site affects metal-ion handling (Fig. 4). The effect on specificity for porphyrin is negligible because kcat/Km is essentially the same as the wild type enzyme (Fig. 6). In E152Q, both kcat and Km for deuteroporphyrin are reduced to the same extent. These results fit well with the expected behavior of this mutant; in other members of the AAA+ superfamily analogous mutants bind but do not hydrolyze nucleotide (16.Hanson P.I. Whiteheart S.W. AAA+ proteins: have engine, will work.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The R289A mutation in the Sensor II motif has a profound effect on the catalytic properties of the chelatase. This mutant does not show a cooperative response to MgATP2− and has at least an order of magnitude poorer specificity toward Mg2+. It is difficult to reach any mechanistic conclusion from a comparison of steady-state kinetic parameters of these cooperative and noncooperative enzymes as these parameters will arise from different sets of elementary rate constants. Nevertheless, the mutant kcat/Km of 0.3 m−1 s−1 is substantially lower than the wild type kcat/K0.5 of 15.7 m−1 s−1 (Fig. 4). Additionally, the magnesium specificity of the R289A mutant is substantially lower than the wild type (Fig. 5). This mutant shows a linear response to free magnesium, whereas all the other mutant proteins and the wild type enzyme show a cooperative, sigmoid, response. It is not possible to determine whether this mutant remains cooperative toward free magnesium. To define the shape of this curve, we would need to carry out assays at much higher concentrations of free magnesium (>50 mm ideally). Increasing the free magnesium concentration much above 10 mm will convert the substrate MgATP2− into Mg2ATP. The observed linear response is consistent with a Michaelis-Menten response with Km ≫ 10 mm or with a Hill curve with K0.5 ≫ 10 mm. The R289A mutant protein appears to have a lower specificity toward free porphyrin than the wild type enzyme (kcat/Km approximately 40% of wild type), but this mutant was not saturated with Mg2+. In the wild type enzyme, kcat/Km for porphyrin depends on the free Mg2+ concentration (1.Reid J.D. Hunter C.N. Magnesium-dependent ATPase activity and cooperativity of magnesium chelatase from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26893-26899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). So this apparent specificity constant for porphyrin only reflects the porphyrin specificity of this mutant at 10 mm Mg2+. The K49A mutation in the Walker A motif inactivates magnesium chelatase. Mutations in Walker A motifs often produce proteins with poorer MgATP2− binding (16.Hanson P.I. Whiteheart S.W. AAA+ proteins: have engine, will work.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). No activity is seen at 3 mm MgATP2−, by which point all the other proteins examined are saturated with nucleotide (Fig. 4). One difficulty in interpreting the behavior of the K49A mutant arises from the complete inactivity of this protein. It is not possible to verify magnesium chelatase complex formation by a kinetic assembly titration. As a result our evidence that this mutant can form intact complexes comes from the nucleotide-dependent co-purification of ChlI (Fig. 2). This co-purification demonstrates that the K49A mutant protein can form a detectable amount of ChlID complex, so the complete loss of activity implies that this complex is inactive. These results show that the AAA+ site in the D subunit of magnesium chelatase plays a significant role in the chelatase reaction. Mutations in this AAA+ site handicap chelation because the enzyme binds poorly to Mg2+ and MgATP2−. The oligomerization of AAA+ ATPases is often sensitive to mutations in the ATPase site, with mutations in residues that act across the protomer interface (e.g. the arginine finger) or mutations that prevent nucleotide binding (e.g. Lys to Ala in the Walker A motif), preventing assembly (17.Wendler P. Ciniawsky S. Kock M. Kube S. Structure and function of the AAA+ nucleotide binding pocket.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). AAA+ proteins with two AAA+ domains in a protomer show a varied response to mutations in their ATPase sites; frequently one AAA+ domain is highly active, whereas the other is responsible for oligomerization (17.Wendler P. Ciniawsky S. Kock M. Kube S. Structure and function of the AAA+ nucleotide binding pocket.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Whereas the magnesium chelatase subunits ChlI and ChlD each contain a single AAA+ domain, the combination of the two proteins is reminiscent of the twin domain members of the superfamily, and a similar division of labor has been proposed in magnesium chelatase (10.Axelsson E. Lundqvist J. Sawicki A. Nilsson S. Schröder I. Al-Karadaghi S. Willows R.D. Hansson M. Recessiveness and dominance in barley mutants deficient in Mg-chelatase subunit D, an AAA protein involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3606-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our activity titrations allow a simple, quantitative, assessment of the impact of these mutants on the formation of the magnesium chelatase complex. The wild type ChlD protein shows tight binding behavior, with an estimated Kapp far below the concentration of protein used in the assays (Fig. 3). The E152Q mutation in the Walker B motif does not perturb complex formation to any detectable level (Fig. 3). This behavior is similar to that seen in many other members of the AAA+ superfamily, where Glu to Gln mutations in the Walker B motif generally allow nucleotide binding and nucleotide-dependent complex assembly (17.Wendler P. Ciniawsky S. Kock M. Kube S. Structure and function of the AAA+ nucleotide binding pocket.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Both arginine mutants show impaired assembly, although mutant complexes remain stable under our assay conditions; the R208A mutant has a Kapp of 14 nm and the R289A mutant has a Kapp of 52 nm (Fig. 3). Interestingly, mutation in the sensor two arginine of AAA+ ATPases rarely affects complex assembly (17.Wendler P. Ciniawsky S. Kock M. Kube S. Structure and function of the AAA+ nucleotide binding pocket.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the only available structure of an AAA+ subunit of magnesium chelatase, the C-terminal helical domain that contains the Sensor II arginine occupies an unusual rearranged position, adjacent to the next protomer ATPase site (7.Fodje M.N. Hansson A. Hansson M. Olsen J.G. Gough S. Willows R.D. Al-Karadaghi S. Interplay between an AAA module and an integrin I domain may regulate the function of magnesium chelatase.J. Mol.

Al-Karadaghi S. ATP-induced conformational dynamics in the AAA+ motor unit of magnesium chelatase.Structure. 2010; 18: 354-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The reduction in binding affinity seen in our Sensor II arginine mutant is consistent with this residue acting across the protomer interface in the magnesium chelatase complex. Most of these mutations have a modest effect on enzyme activity, suggesting that the AAA+ site on ChlD does not harbor an essential ATPase activity. If this site were an essential ATPase, all of these mutations would result in a substantial loss of chelatase activity. The modest reduction in activity observed with most of these mutants suggests that this site plays an allosteric role. Magnesium chelatase with the K49A mutation in the Walker A motif of ChlD shows no detectable activity. In other AAA+ family members, this mutation is thought to impair nucleotide binding (16.Hanson P.I. Whiteheart S.W. AAA+ proteins: have engine, will work.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that ChlD binds nucleotide. Taken together, the undetectable activity of the K49A mutant and the modest reduction in activity of the R208A mutant in the arginine finger and E152Q in the Walker B motif suggest that this AAA+ site is a nucleotide-binding allosteric regulator of magnesium chelatase. The reduced kcat/K0.5ATP of the arginine finger mutant (R208A) is consistent with the removal of an interaction between the guanidinium side chain and ATP γ-phosphate. It is not yet established which nucleotide species binds in the AAA+ site of ChlD, but these data suggest that ATP could bind in this site. Mutating the sensor two arginine produces an enzyme without a cooperative response to ATP. As the active ATPase sites are found in ChlI, this observation suggests that ChlD is involved in mediating communication between the individual ChlI subunits. In the bacterial system, mutations in the sensor two position also cause substantial loss of activity. In Rhodobacter capsulatus the R194K mutation in BchD (capsulatus numbering) reduces activity to 25% of the wild type (10.Axelsson E. Lundqvist J. Sawicki A. Nilsson S. Schröder I. Al-Karadaghi S. Willows R.D. Hansson M. Recessiveness and dominance in barley mutants deficient in Mg-chelatase subunit D, an AAA protein involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3606-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This observation agrees with the data described here. The analogous mutation in R. capsulatus BchI (R298K) causes complete loss of chelatase activity (22.Hansson A. Willows R.D. Roberts T.H. Hansson M. Three semidominant barley mutants with single amino acid substitutions in the smallest magnesium chelatase subunit form defective AAA+ hexamers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13944-13949Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It would interesting to know whether Sensor II mutations in BchD from bacteriochlorophyll-producing systems also cause substantial changes in the response to free Mg2+ and MgATP2−. The significance of individual domains in ChlD has been investigated in the tobacco enzyme (11.Gräfe S. Saluz H.P. Grimm B. Hänel F. Mg-chelatase of tobacco: the role of the subunit ChlD in the chelation step of protoporphyrin IX.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Gräfe et al. demonstrated that truncated mutants of ChlD, lacking the N-terminal AAA+ domain, retain near wild type activity. Curiously, the fusion protein where the N-terminal AAA+ domain of ChlD was replaced with that of ChlI was much less active than the wild type or the truncated protein. It is not immediately obvious how to reconcile our data with those of Gräfe et al. One speculative hypothesis is that nucleotide-free ChlD binds tightly to one of the other subunits, inhibiting the chelatase. On nucleotide binding, this interaction loosens and chelation is activated. In this model, truncating ChlD produces an unregulated constitutively active chelatase. Assessing this proposal will require further mechanistic study of truncated ChlD and, ideally, higher resolution structures of the ChlID complex. Current models of the ID complex are based on cryo-EM data and cannot provide information on the contents of nucleotide binding sites (21.Lundqvist J. Elmlund H. Wulff R.P. Berglund L. Elmlund D. Emanuelsson C. Hebert H. Willows R.D. Hansson M. Lindahl M. Al-Karadaghi S.

Biol. 2008; 375: 934-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An isotope exchange study has demonstrated that an EPi complex is an intermediate on the ATP hydrolysis pathway (9.Adams N.B. Reid J.D. Non-equilibrium isotope exchange reveals a catalytically significant enzyme-phosphate complex in the ATP hydrolysis pathway of the AAA+ ATPase magnesium chelatase.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 2029-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Still, these three-dimensional models of BchID show large conformational differences between the ATP, ADP, and the nonhydrolyzable analog AMPPNP bound forms, so they are consistent with this proposal (21.Lundqvist J. Elmlund H. Wulff R.P. Berglund L. Elmlund D. Emanuelsson C. Hebert H. Willows R.D. Hansson M. Lindahl M. Al-Karadaghi S. ATP-induced conformational dynamics in the AAA+ motor unit of magnesium chelatase.Structure. 2010; 18: 354-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our data reveal that the AAA+ ATPase site in ChlD plays an important role in the reaction of magnesium chelatase. Although many questions remain to be answered, it is clear that the AAA+ site in ChlD is involved in the complex allosteric and cooperative response of magnesium chelatase to both Mg2+ and MgATP2− and is involved in the communication pathway between the active ATPase sites in ChlI."
https://openalex.org/W2159214339,"This study investigated the relationship between level of stress in middle and high school students aged 12-18 and risk of atopic dermatitis. Data from the Sixth Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS-VI), a cross-sectional study among 74,980 students in 800 middle schools and high schools with a response rate of 97.7%, were analyzed. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between stress and atopic dermatitis with severity. A total of 5,550 boys and 6,964 girls reported having been diagnosed with atopic dermatitis. Younger students were more likely to have atopic dermatitis. Interestingly, the educational level of parents was found to be associated with having atopic dermatitis and having more severe condition. In particular, girls with mothers with at least college education had a 41% higher risk of having atopic dermatitis and severe atopic condition (odds ratio (OR)) = 1.41, 95% CI, 1.22-1.63; P<0.0001) compared with those with mothers who had attended middle school at most. Similar trend was shown among both boys and girls for their father's education level. The stress level was found to be significantly associated with the risk of atopic dermatitis. Compared to boys with who reported ""no stress"", boys with ""very high"" stress had 46% higher the risk of having more severe atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.46, 95% CI, 1.20-1.78; P<0.0001), 44% higher (OR = 1.44, 95% CI, 1.19-1.73; P<0.0001) with ""high"" stress, and 21% higher (OR = 1.21, 95% CI, 1.00-1.45; P = 0.05) with ""moderate"" stress. In contrast, we found no statistically significant relationship between stress and atopic dermatitis in girls. This study suggests that stress and parents' education level were associated with atopic dermatitis. Specifically, degree of stress is positively correlated with likelihood of being diagnosed with this condition and increasing the severity."
https://openalex.org/W2134939911,"The SUMO-dependent ubiquitin ligase Slx8 plays key roles in promoting genome stability, including the processing of trapped Topoisomerase I (Top1) cleavage complexes and removal of toxic SUMO conjugates. We show that it is the latter function that constitutes Slx8's primary role in fission yeast. The SUMO conjugates in question are formed by the SUMO ligase Pli1, which is necessary for limiting spontaneous homologous recombination when Top1 is present. Surprisingly there is no requirement for Pli1 to limit recombination in the vicinity of a replication fork blocked at the programmed barrier RTS1. Notably, once committed to Pli1-mediated SUMOylation Slx8 becomes essential for genotoxin resistance, limiting both spontaneous and RTS1 induced recombination, and promoting normal chromosome segregation. We show that Slx8 removes Pli1-dependent Top1-SUMO conjugates and in doing so helps to constrain recombination at RTS1. Overall our data highlight how SUMOylation and SUMO-dependent ubiquitylation by the Pli1-Slx8 axis contribute in different ways to maintain genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W2022283793,"FBXO25 is one of the 69 known human F-box proteins that serve as specificity factors for a family of ubiquitin ligases composed of SKP1, Rbx1, Cullin1, and F-box protein (SCF1) that are involved in targeting proteins for degradation across the ubiquitin proteasome system. However, the substrates of most SCF E3 ligases remain unknown. Here, we applied an in chip ubiquitination screen using a human protein microarray to uncover putative substrates for the FBXO25 protein. Among several novel putative targets identified, the c-fos protooncogene regulator ELK-1 was characterized as the first endogenous substrate for SCF1(FBXO25) E3 ligase. FBXO25 interacted with and mediated the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ELK-1 in HEK293T cells. In addition, FBXO25 overexpression suppressed induction of two ELK-1 target genes, c-fos and egr-1, in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

Significance: FBXO25 is a potential mitogen pathway regulator through ELK-1 degradation. Substrates of the ubiquitin proteasome system are eventually degraded following covalent attachment of an ubiquitin chain to the target protein through sequential steps catalyzed by three different enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin-ligase enzyme (E3). The E3s are critical enzymes in this pathway because of their roles in substrate recognition. The polyubiquitinated substrates are directed to 26S proteasome where the ubiquitin is recycled and the protein is degraded (1.Ciechanover A.

They are composed of a Cullin1 (CUL1) subunit that serves as an organizing scaffold, an E2-recruiting RING-box protein 1 (Roc1/RBX1), an adaptor protein S phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1), and a substrate recognition subunit F-box protein (FBP) (3.Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J.

In addition to the F-box domain that binds to SKP1, FBP contains distinct protein-protein interaction domains that interact with their substrates. In humans, 69 SCF ligases have been identified to date, each one characterized by a different FBP subunit that provides specificity by recognizing different substrates (4.Cenciarelli C. Chiaur D.S.

FBXO25 localizes to the nucleus as a component of the nuclear body named FANDs (FBXO25-associated nuclear domains), partially colocalizes with CUL1, SKP1, ubiquitinated proteins, and the proteasome. In addition, FANDs recruit polyglutamine-containing proteins and prevent their accumulation in the nucleus (11.Manfiolli A.O. Maragno A.L. Baqui M.M. Yokoo S. Teixeira F.R. Oliveira E.B.

The insert was amplified by using the primers ΔF-forward (GAAGCTTATGCCGTTTCTGGG) and ΔF-reverse (CCTCGAGTCAGAACTTGAAG). The products were digested with HindIII and XhoI and subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO. DNA manipulation and transformation procedures were performed according to standard cloning techniques (17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

HEK293T (CRL-11268, American Type Culture Collection) cells were grown in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The transfections were carried out using FuGENE in accordance with manufacturer (Roche Applied Science) by 48 h. Six hours before lysis, 500 nm epoxomicin proteasome inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to cell culture medium. For c-fos and egr-1 expression evaluation, the cells were transfected with fbxo25 or empty vector for 24 h and then submitted to starvation in no-FBS DMEM for an additional 24 h. Thereafter, 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Invitrogen) was added for the indicated times, and the cell pellets were obtained after 0, 15, and 45 min. The total RNA was extracted, and the c-fos and egr-1 transcript levels were quantified by quantitative PCR. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding SCF1 complexes HA-SKP1, CUL1-FLAG, Myc-Roc1, and GST-HA-FBXO25-FLAG or GST-HA-FBXO25-ΔF-box-FLAG. After 48 h, the cells were rinsed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4; Sigma-Aldrich). The SCF1 complex purification was performed by GST pulldown. The lysates were incubated with Sepharose-glutathione resin (GE Healthcare) for 3 h at 4 °C with rocking. After that, the beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the SCF1 complexes were eluted with elution buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.1 m reduced glutathione). These eluates were dialyzed in ubiquitination buffer and stored at −20 °C until use. The procedures with ProtoArrays Human Protein Microarrays v4.1 were in according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The protoarray slides were treated in blocking buffer (50 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 0.08% Triton X-100, 25% glycerol, 20 mm reduced glutathione, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Invitrogen) for 60 min at 4 °C. The reactions were prepared: purified SCF1(FBXO25) or SCF1(FBXO25-ΔF-box) and 100 ng of E1 + 500 ng of E2 (UbcH5c) or 500 ng of E2DN (dominant negative) + 2.5 μg of ubiquitin N-terminally monobiotinylated + 1 μg of native ubiquitin + ubiquitination buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). The enzymes E1, E2, and ubiquitins were purchased from BostonBiochem (Boston, MA). 100 μl of the reaction was added to the slide and overlaid with a coverslip followed by incubation for 3 h at 30 °C in humid chamber (Corning Inc.). Slides were washed in assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% BSA) (Invitrogen), and the arrays were then incubated with 1.0 ng/μl streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) for 45 min at 4 °C. Then they were washed five times with assay buffer and once with water. Slides were dried by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min, and the images were acquired immediately. The protoarrays were scanned, and the data were acquired with GenePix4000B software (Molecular Devices). Background-subtracted intensities for all spots were normalized among slides centering all intensities on a single reference value. The centering factor for each slide was chosen as the biotin-positive controls average, and they were corrected to match the overall biotin-positive control of all slides. Significant intensity detection was carried out comparing each spot normalized signal with the negative control intensity distribution of the whole slide. For each slide, a background density function was fitted, and a p value was calculated for each spot. The significance cutoff was established in p value < 0.01. Proteins were further considered only if all internal replicates were consistently detected. The final target list was defined as the intersection between two slides with SCF1(FBXO25) minus negative controls, SCF1(FBXO25) with E2 dominant negative and SCF1(FBXO25-ΔF-box). Cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3) or GST-HA-FBXO25-FLAG or GST-HA-FBXO25-ΔF-box-FLAG. After 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS and DMEM without methionine (Sigma-Aldrich) and kept in this medium for 2 h. Then the cells were pulsed for 1 h with 150 μCi/well 35S-radiolabeled methionine (Express labeling mix 35S; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The time zero was collected immediately and after 12 h and 24 h T1 and T2 were obtained, respectively. The cell pellets were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (300 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), sonicated, and the supernatants were submitted to immunoprecipitation with rabbit polyclonal anti-ELK-1 antibody (Millipore). The eluted proteins by load buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE, and after the staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue the gels were dried and exposed to a Phosphor Screen (Amersham Biosciences,). After 24 h at room temperature, the Phosphor Screen was scanned in Molecular Image FX using the software PDQuest (Bio-Rad). Total RNA from HEK293T cells was extracted and isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). To synthesize cDNA we used the ImProm II Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. The c-fos and egr-1 transcript levels were quantified relative to GAPDH using the Mastercycler ep realplex real-time PCR system (Eppendorf). The c-fos primer set included forward (5′- GGGGCAAGGTGGAACAGTTATC-3′) and reverse (5′-CTCCGGTTGCGGCATTTGG-3′) primers; the egr-1 set primer was forward (5′-CGCCCACCATGGACAACTAC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGGAAAAGACTCTGCGGTCAG-3′). A gapdh primer set (forward (5′-TGCTGATGCCCCCATGTTCG-3′ and reverse (5′-TGCAGGAGGCATTGCTGATGA-3′)) was included as a sample loading control. The reaction was carried out with Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG/ROX (Invitrogen). The experiment was performed on three independent biological replicates. The c-Fos or EGR-1 transcript level was normalized with the endogenous GAPDH control according to the 2−-ΔΔCt method (18.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2-ΔΔCT method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123392) Google Scholar). The results were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's pairwise comparisons testing of significance between selected groups. The differences observed were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. Flip-InTM T-RexTM-293 cells contain a single stably integrated FRT site at a transcriptionally active genomic locus. For targeted integration of F-box deleted (ΔF) fbxo25 into the FRT site, we carried out cotransfection of FBXO25-ΔF-box/pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector and Flp recombinase vector pOG44 by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Flip-InTM T-RexTM-293 cells cotransfected with pcDNA5/FRT/TO empty vector and Flp recombinase were used as control. Forty-eight hours after transfection, 400 μg/ml hygromycin was added to the medium for selection of the cells with integrated sequences coding for FBXO25-ΔF-box. After 2 weeks of antibiotic selection the colonies were picked and expanded to confirm tetracycline-dependent expression of FBXO25-ΔF-box. HEK293T cells were transfected with ELK-1-FLAG-His6 and rinsed with lysis buffer. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG M2 beads, and the ELK-1-FLAG-His6 was eluted with 100 μg/ml 3×FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl). The in vitro ubiquitination reactions were developed as follows. Purified SCF1(FBXO25) or SCF1(FBXO25-ΔF-box) + ubiquitin mix (100 ng of E1 + 500 ng of E2 (UbcH5c) + 1 μg of native ubiquitin + 0.5 μg of N-terminal biotin-ubiquitin and ubiquitination buffer) were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. The proteins were loaded in SDS-PAGE, and the Western blots were probed with anti-polyubiquitin FK2 antibodies (Millipore) and with streptavidin-peroxidase (Thermo Pierce). HEK293T cells were transfected with ELK-1-FLAG-His6 and empty vector (pcDNA3) or GST-HA-FBXO25-FLAG or GST-HA-FBXO25-ΔF-box-FLAG. Six hours before lysis the cells were treated with epoxomicin and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, sonicated, and boiled prior to immunoprecipitation. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated with anti-ELK-1 antibodies (Millipore). Then, the resins were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and SDS-PAGE load buffer was added. The Western blotting was developed by probing the membranes with anti-polyubiquitin FK2 antibodies (Millipore). To identify FBXO25 substrate candidates, we have used the human protoarray as target and the purified SCF1(FBXO25) complexes as a source of E3 ligases (Fig. 1A). The protoarrays are based on a robust technology described previously (19.Zhu H. Bilgin M. Bangham R. Hall D. Casamayor A. Bertone P. Lan N. Jansen R. Bidlingmaier S. Houfek T. Mitchell T. Miller P. Dean R.A. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Global analysis of protein activities using proteome chips.Science. 2001; 293: 2101-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar) containing >8000 unique full-length proteins spotted in duplicate, covering almost the entire human proteome. We carried out the substrate search using four protoarrays as follows. Two arrays were probed with SCF1 complexes containing FBXO25 wild type (WT) and two negative controls containing SCF1(FBXO25-ΔF-box), depleted of F-box domain (ΔF), or SCF1(FBXO25), with E2DN (dominant negative, unable to transfer ubiquitin). Using the statistical criteria described under “Experimental Procedures,” 75 putative substrates of FBXO25 were identified with high confidence (supplemental Table 1). Because ELK-1 is a nuclear protein that has been reported to be a ubiquitin proteasome system substrate (19.Zhu H. Bilgin M. Bangham R. Hall D. Casamayor A. Bertone P. Lan N. Jansen R. Bidlingmaier S. Houfek T. Mitchell T. Miller P. Dean R.A. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Global analysis of protein activities using proteome chips.Science. 2001; 293: 2101-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar), we chose to further explore the possibility of ELK-1 being a FBXO25 substrate. ELK-1 is a ternary complex factor subfamily of ETS domain transcription factors that plays an important role in the induction of immediate early gene expression in response to a extracellular signal (20.Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Phosphorylation of transcription factor p62TCF by MAP kinase stimulates ternary complex formation at c-fos promoter.Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). ELK-1 was specifically ubiquitinated in the protoarray by SCF1(FBXO25) but not by SCF1(FBXO25-ΔF-box) (Fig. 1B) or SCF1 (FBXO25) with E2DN. This last negative control was used to exclude from the final hits any unspecific target such as those that got a biotin-ubiquitin directly from E1 or were able to keep bound with this molecule and after the washes. To evaluate the functional relationship of these proteins, we cotransfected HEK293T cells with ELK-1-FLAG-His6 and GFP in combination with increasing amounts of FBXO25 or FBXO25-ΔF-box or FBXO32. A statistically significant reduction of overexpressed ELK-1 protein levels in the presence of FBXO25 was observed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, left panel and graphic). In contrast, FBXO25-ΔF-box had a weak effect on the levels of ELK-1 protein (Fig. 2, middle panel and graphic), which is in agreement with the inability of the ΔF-box mutant version of FBOX25 to assemble in an active SCF1 complex to promote ubiquitination and degradation of its substrates. We sought to evaluate the specificity of ELK-1 degradation by FBXO25 through its cotransfection with the FBXO25 closest protein family member FBXO32. The overexpression of FBXO32 had no effect on the levels of the ELK-1, confirming the FBXO25 selectivity toward their substrates (Fig. 2, right panel and graphic). Moreover, FBXO25 did not change the steady-state levels of an irrelevant control GFP protein significantly (Fig. 2, right panel and graphic Bii), corroborating the specificity of ELK-1 degradation by FBXO25. Overall, these findings suggested that FBXO25 triggers the ELK-1 degradation, and this effect was dependent on its F-box domain, suggesting that ELK-1 is a substrate of an active SCF1(FBXO25) complex. The F-box family of proteins are known to use protein-protein domains to bind tightly and specifically to their protein targets (4.Cenciarelli C. Chiaur D.S. Guardavaccaro D. Parks W. Vidal M. Pagano M. Identification of a family of human F-box proteins.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1177-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 5.Winston J.T. Koepp D.M. Zhu C. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. A family of mammalian F-box proteins.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1180-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether FBXO25 interacts with ELK-1 through GST pulldown assays by using cell lysates from HEK293T cotransfected with ELK-1-FLAG-His6 in combination with pcDNA3 or FBXO25 or FBXO25-ΔF-box. GST-FBXO25 was purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and ELK-1-FLAG-His6 was detected by Western blotting using anti-His tag antibodies. Consistent with the results shown above, FBXO25 copurified with ELK-1, indicating that they are protein partners (Fig. 3A). To confirm the specificity of this association, we performed a reverse coimmunoprecipitation using HEK293T cell lysates transfected with the same combination of plasmids. Antibodies anti-ELK-1 copurified ELK-1-FLAG-His6 and GST-FBXO25 and FBXO25-ΔF-box (Fig. 3B). It is important to mention that ELK-1 was found associated with GST-FBXO25-ΔF-box in both types of copurification assays, highlighting its possibility to work as a dominant negative by competing with the endogenous FBXO25. To confirm the suggested dominant negative function of FBXO25-ΔF-box on ELK-1 degradation we generated HEK293T cells expressing stably and inductively this mutant form (Fig. 4A). In this system only clones with integrated genes were selected, avoiding the contamination signal of untransfected cells. The endogenous ELK-1 protein content was evaluated after immunoprecipitation with anti-ELK-1 antibodies before and after induction of the mutant FBXO25 gene with doxycycline. We observed in FBXO25-ΔF-box-induced cells an accumulation of ELK-1, indicating that this mutant was able to protect endogenous ELK-1 from degradation (Fig. 4, B and C). As the F-box proteins catalyze ubiquitination and degradation of their target proteins by the ubiquitin proteasome system, we surmise that the overexpression of FBXO25 would increase the turnover of ELK-1. To evaluate this possibility, we performed methionine chase labeling experiments in cells overexpressing ELK-1-FLAG-His6 either with FBXO25 or pcDNA3. The rate of 35S-labeled ELK-1-FLAG-His6 degradation was increased in cells overexpressing FBXO25 compared with those transfected with empty vector (Fig. 5, A and B). Treatment of the cells with the irreversible, highly specific, proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin blocked ELK-1 proteolysis. These data strongly suggest that the ELK-1 degradation was mediated by FBXO25 and is proteasome-dependent (Fig. 5, C and D). It is interesting to point out that the different levels of immunoprecipitated ELK-1-FALG-His6 comparing FBXO25 and pcDNA3 cotransfection in the T0 should be due to ELK-1 degradation during the 24 h of cotransfection prior to the methionine chase assay. The proteins spotted in the protoarrays are in fusion with GST, and they were purified from insect cells using the baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen information). To eliminate any artifact influence of GST tag or modifications in ELK-1 imposed by this expression system in our in vitro ubiquitination assay, we expressed and purified ELK-1-FLAG-His6 from HEK293T cells, the same cell line used in all experiments (data not shown). The ELK-1 protein purified from HEK293T cells was used as substrate for the in vitro ubiquitination assay. Two different concentrations of SCF1 complexes were used in the presence or absence of ELK-1, ATP, or biotin-ubiquitin (Fig. 6A). The protein ELK-1 was ubiquitinated by SCF1(FBXO25) (Fig. 6A, lanes 4 and 6) but not by ubiquitin mix (lanes 1 and 8) or SCF1(FBXO25-ΔF-box) (lanes 11 and 13). We also observed a more intense smear of polyubiquitinated ELK-1 in the higher concentration of wild type SCF1 complexes (lanes 4 and 6), but no differences were observed in the mutant complexes (lanes 11 and 13). No signal of polyubiquitination was visualized in the a"

Previous biochemical studies showed that optimal AUF1 binding requires 33–34 nucleotides with a strong preference for U-rich RNA despite observations that few AUF1-associated cellular mRNAs contain such extended U-rich domains. Using the smallest AUF1 isoform (p37AUF1) as a model, we employed fluorescence anisotropy-based approaches to define thermodynamic parameters describing AUF1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex formation across a panel of RNA substrates. These data demonstrated that 15 nucleotides of AU-rich sequence were sufficient to nucleate high affinity p37AUF1 RNP complexes within a larger RNA context. In particular, p37AUF1 binding to short AU-rich RNA targets was significantly stabilized by interactions with a 3′-purine residue and largely base-independent but non-ionic contacts 5′ of the AU-rich site. RNP stabilization by the upstream RNA domain was associated with an enhanced negative change in heat capacity consistent with conformational changes in protein and/or RNA components, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assays demonstrated that these contacts were required for p37AUF1 to remodel local RNA structure. Finally, reporter mRNAs containing minimal high affinity p37AUF1 target sequences associated with AUF1 and were destabilized in a p37AUF1-dependent manner in cells.

https://openalex.org/W2056643682,"Thy-1 is a cell surface protein that is expressed during the differentiation of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Optic nerve injury induces progressive loss in the number of RGCs expressing Thy-1. The rate of this loss is fastest during the first week after optic nerve injury and slower in subsequent weeks. This study was undertaken to determine whether oral treatment with a water-soluble N-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine derivative (OT-440) protects against loss of Thy-1 promoter activation following optic nerve crush and whether this effect targets the earlier quick phase or the later slow phase. The retina of mice expressing cyan fluorescent protein under control of the Thy-1 promoter (Thy1-CFP mice) was imaged using a blue-light confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (bCSLO). These mice then received oral OT-440 prepared in cream cheese or dissolved in water, or plain vehicle, for two weeks and were imaged again prior to unilateral optic nerve crush. Treatments and weekly imaging continued for four more weeks. Fluorescent neurons were counted in the same defined retinal areas imaged at each time point in a masked fashion. When the counts at each time point were directly compared, the numbers of fluorescent cells at each time point were greater in the animals that received OT-440 in cream cheese by 8%, 27%, 52% and 60% than in corresponding control animals at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after optic nerve crush. Similar results were obtained when the vehicle was water. Rate analysis indicated the protective effect of OT-440 was greatest during the first two weeks and was maintained in the second two weeks after crush for both the cream cheese vehicle study and water vehicle study. Because most of the fluorescent cells detected by bCSLO are RGCs, these findings suggest that oral OT-440 can either protect against or delay early degenerative responses occurring in RGCs following optic nerve injury."
https://openalex.org/W2111777358,"The influence of potassium content (at neutral pH and millimolar Mg(2+)) on the size distribution of FtsZ polymers formed in the presence of constantly replenished GTP under steady-state conditions was studied by a combination of biophysical methods. The size of the GTP-FtsZ polymers decreased with lower potassium concentration, in contrast with the increase in the mass of the GDP-FtsZ oligomers, whereas no effect was observed on FtsZ GTPase activity and critical concentration of polymerization. Remarkably, the concerted formation of a narrow size distribution of GTP-FtsZ polymers previously observed at high salt concentration was maintained in all KCl concentrations tested. Polymers induced with guanosine 5'-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate, a slowly hydrolyzable analog of GTP, became larger and polydisperse as the potassium concentration was decreased. Our results suggest that the potassium dependence of the GTP-FtsZ polymer size may be related to changes in the subunit turnover rate that are independent of the GTP hydrolysis rate. The formation of a narrow size distribution of FtsZ polymers under very different solution conditions indicates that it is an inherent feature of FtsZ, not observed in other filament-forming proteins, with potential implications in the structural organization of the functional Z-ring."
https://openalex.org/W2103781275,"The need for quantification of cell growth patterns in a multilayer, multi-cellular tissue necessitates the development of a 3D reconstruction technique that can estimate 3D shapes and sizes of individual cells from Confocal Microscopy (CLSM) image slices. However, the current methods of 3D reconstruction using CLSM imaging require large number of image slices per cell. But, in case of Live Cell Imaging of an actively developing tissue, large depth resolution is not feasible in order to avoid damage to cells from prolonged exposure to laser radiation. In the present work, we have proposed an anisotropic Voronoi tessellation based 3D reconstruction framework for a tightly packed multilayer tissue with extreme z-sparsity (2–4 slices/cell) and wide range of cell shapes and sizes. The proposed method, named as the ‘Adaptive Quadratic Voronoi Tessellation’ (AQVT), is capable of handling both the sparsity problem and the non-uniformity in cell shapes by estimating the tessellation parameters for each cell from the sparse data-points on its boundaries. We have tested the proposed 3D reconstruction method on time-lapse CLSM image stacks of the Arabidopsis Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) and have shown that the AQVT based reconstruction method can correctly estimate the 3D shapes of a large number of SAM cells."
https://openalex.org/W2152080897,"Aberrant Ca(2+) signals within pancreatic acinar cells are an early and critical feature in acute pancreatitis, yet it is unclear how these signals are generated. An important mediator of the aberrant Ca(2+) signals due to bile acid exposure is the intracellular Ca(2+) channel ryanodine receptor. One putative activator of the ryanodine receptor is the nucleotide second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), which is generated by an ectoenzyme ADP-ribosyl cyclase, CD38. In this study, we examined the role of CD38 and cADPR in acinar cell Ca(2+) signals and acinar injury due to bile acids using pharmacologic inhibitors of CD38 and cADPR as well as mice deficient in Cd38 (Cd38(-/-)). Cytosolic Ca(2+) signals were imaged using live time-lapse confocal microscopy in freshly isolated mouse acinar cells during perifusion with the bile acid taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate (TLCS; 500 μM). To focus on intracellular Ca(2+) release and to specifically exclude Ca(2+) influx, cells were perifused in Ca(2+)-free medium. Cell injury was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase leakage and propidium iodide uptake. Pretreatment with either nicotinamide (20 mM) or the cADPR antagonist 8-Br-cADPR (30 μM) abrogated TLCS-induced Ca(2+) signals and cell injury. TLCS-induced Ca(2+) release and cell injury were reduced by 30 and 95%, respectively, in Cd38-deficient acinar cells compared with wild-type cells (p < 0.05). Cd38-deficient mice were protected against a model of bile acid infusion pancreatitis. In summary, these data indicate that CD38-cADPR mediates bile acid-induced pancreatitis and acinar cell injury through aberrant intracellular Ca(2+) signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1983640288,"The Retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is a key tumor suppressor that is functionally inactivated in most cancers. pRB regulates the cell division cycle and cell cycle exit through protein-protein interactions mediated by its multiple binding interfaces. The LXCXE binding cleft region of pRB mediates interactions with cellular proteins that have chromatin regulatory functions. Chromatin regulation mediated by pRB is required for a stress responsive cell cycle arrest, including oncogene induced senescence. The in vivo role of chromatin regulation by pRB during senescence, and its relevance to cancer is not clear.Using gene-targeted mice, uniquely defective for pRB mediated chromatin regulation, we investigated its role during transformation and tumor progression in response to activation of oncogenic ras. We report that the pRB(∆L) mutation confers susceptibility to escape from HrasV12 induced senescence and allows transformation in vitro, although these cells possess high levels of DNA damage. Intriguingly, LSL-Kras, Rb1 (∆L/∆L) mice show delayed lung tumor formation compared to controls. This is likely due to the increased apoptosis seen in the early hyperplastic lesions shortly following ras activation that inhibits tumor progression. Furthermore, DMBA treatment to induce sporadic ras mutations in other tissues also failed to reveal greater susceptibility to cancer in Rb1 (∆L/∆L) mice.Our data suggests that chromatin regulation by pRB can function to limit proliferation, but its loss fails to contribute to cancer susceptibility in ras driven tumor models because of elevated levels of DNA damage and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2083697083,"When endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) or other transposable elements (TEs) insert into an intron, the consequence on gene transcription can range from negligible to a complete ablation of normal transcripts. With the advance of sequencing technology, more and more insertionally polymorphic or private TE insertions are being identified in humans and mice, of which some could have a significant impact on host gene expression. Nevertheless, an efficient and low cost approach to prioritize their potential effect on gene transcription has been lacking. By building a computational model based on artificial neural networks (ANN), we demonstrate the feasibility of using machine-learning approaches to predict the likelihood that intronic ERV insertions will have major effects on gene transcription, focusing on the two ERV families, namely Intracisternal A-type Particle (IAP) and Early Transposon (ETn)/MusD elements, which are responsible for the majority of ERV-induced mutations in mice. We trained the ANN model using properties associated with these ERVs known to cause germ-line mutations (positive cases) and properties associated with likely neutral ERVs of the same families (negative cases), and derived a set of prediction plots that can visualize the likelihood of affecting gene transcription by ERV insertions. Our results show a highly reliable prediction power of our model, and offer a potential approach to computationally screen for other types of TE insertions that may affect gene transcription or even cause disease."
https://openalex.org/W1983383670,"The cell cycle progression in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) is controlled by ion fluxes that alter cell volume [1]. This suggests that ion fluxes might control dynamic changes in morphology over the cell cycle, such as rounding up of the cell at mitosis. However, specific channels regulating such dynamic changes and the possible interactions with actomyosin complex have not been clearly identified. Following RNAseq transcriptome analysis of cell cycle sorted mESCs, we found that expression of the K+ ion channel Erg1 peaked in G1 cell cycle phase, which was confirmed by immunostaining. Inhibition of Erg channel activity caused loss of G1 phase cells via non-apoptotic cell death. Cells first lost the ability of membrane blebbing, a typical feature of cultured embryonic stem cells. Continued Erg inhibition further increased cell volume and the cell eventually ruptured. In addition, atomic force measurements on live cells revealed a decreased cortical stiffness after treatment, suggesting alterations in actomyosin organization. When the intracellular osmotic pressure was experimentally decreased by hypertonic solution or block of K+ ion import via the Na, K-ATPase, cell viability was restored and cells acquired normal volume and blebbing activity. Our results suggest that Erg channels have a critical function in K+ ion homeostasis of mESCs over the cell cycle, and that cell death following Erg inhibition is a consequence of the inability to regulate cell volume."
https://openalex.org/W2083813715,"Although consumers can strongly influence community recovery from disturbance, few studies have explored the effects of consumer identity and density and how they may vary across abiotic gradients. On rocky shores in Maine, recent experiments suggest that recovery of plant- or animal- dominated community states is governed by rates of water movement and consumer pressure. To further elucidate the mechanisms of consumer control, we examined the species-specific and density-dependent effects of rocky shore consumers (crabs and snails) on community recovery under both high (mussel dominated) and low flow (plant dominated) conditions. By partitioning the direct impacts of predators (crabs) and grazers (snails) on community recovery across a flow gradient, we found that grazers, but not predators, are likely the primary agent of consumer control and that their impact is highly non-linear. Manipulating snail densities revealed that herbivorous and bull-dozing snails (Littorina littorea) alone can control recovery of high and low flow communities. After ∼1.5 years of recovery, snail density explained a significant amount of the variation in macroalgal coverage at low flow sites and also mussel recovery at high flow sites. These density-dependent grazer effects were were both non-linear and flow-dependent, with low abundance thresholds needed to suppress plant community recovery, and much higher levels needed to control mussel bed development. Our study suggests that consumer density and identity are key in regulating both plant and animal community recovery and that physical conditions can determine the functional forms of these consumer effects."
https://openalex.org/W1973992235,"The repulsive interaction between oppositely charged macroions is investigated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations of an unrestricted primitive model, including the effect of inhomogeneous surface charge and its density, the depth of surface charge, the cation size, and the dielectric permittivity of solvent and macroions, and their contrast. The origin of the repulsion is a combination of osmotic pressure and ionic screening resulting from excess salt between the macroions. The excess charge over-reduces the electrostatic attraction between macroions and raises the entropic repulsion. The magnitude of the repulsion increases when the dielectric constant of the solvent is lowered (below that of water) and/or the surface charge density is increased, in good agreement with experiment. Smaller size of surface charge and the cation, their discreteness and mobility are other factors that enhance the repulsion and charge inversion phenomenons."

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the use of various data mining algorithms to characterize patients with dentofacial deformities. A total of 72 patients with skeletal malocclusions who had completed orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatments were examined. Each patient was characterized by 22 measurements related to dentofacial deformities. Clustering analysis and visualization grouped the patients into three different patterns of dentofacial deformities. A feature selection approach based on a false discovery rate was used to identify a subset of 22 measurements important in categorizing these three clusters. Finally, classification was performed to evaluate the quality of the measurements selected by the feature selection approach. The results showed that feature selection improved classification accuracy while simultaneously determining which measurements were relevant."
