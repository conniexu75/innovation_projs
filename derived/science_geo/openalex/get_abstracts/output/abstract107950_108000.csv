https://openalex.org/W2010237936,"The transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is critical for the inducible expression of multiple cellular and viral genes involved in inflammation and infection including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and adhesion molecules. The anti-inflammatory drugs sodium salicylate and aspirin inhibited the activation of NF-κB, which further explains the mechanism of action of these drugs. This inhibition prevented the degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor, IκB, and therefore NF-κB was retained in the cytosol. Sodium salicylate and aspirin also inhibited NF-κB-dependent transcription from the Igκ enhancer and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat (LTR) in transfected T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2001521752,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MAPKK) activates MAP kinase in a signal transduction pathway that mediates cellular responses to growth and differentiation factors. Oncogenes such as ras, src, raf, and mos have been proposed to transform cells by prolonging the activated state of MAPKK and of components downstream in the signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, constitutively active MAPKK mutants were designed that had basal activities up to 400 times greater than that of the unphosphorylated wild-type kinase. Expression of these mutants in mammalian cells activated AP-1-regulated transcription. The cells formed transformed foci, grew efficiently in soft agar, and were highly tumorigenic in nude mice. These findings indicate that constitutive activation of MAPKK is sufficient to promote cell transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1987081043,Magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine the involvement of the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum in cognitive operations. All seven people examined displayed a large bilateral activation in the dentate during their attempts to solve a pegboard puzzle. The area activated was three to four times greater than that activated during simple movements of the pegs. These results provide support for the concept that the computational power of the cerebellum is applied not only to the control of movement but also to cognitive functions.
https://openalex.org/W1552489964,"Characteristic features of mammalian small heat shock proteins are their rapid phosphorylation in response to stress and mitogenic signals and their ability to form multimeric particles of 200-700 kDa and large aggregates up to 5000 kDa. Recently, a chaperoning function and an actin polymerization-inhibiting activity were demonstrated for the recombinant murine and turkey small heat shock protein, respectively. In this paper, we demonstrate that the actin polymerization-inhibiting activity of the murine small heat shock protein HSP25 is dependent on the degree of its phosphorylation and structural organization. Non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated HSP25 monomers, as well as non-phosphorylated multimeric HSP25 particles, were isolated from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells by ammonium sulfate precipitation, column chromatography, and ultracentrifugation and tested for their actin polymerization-inhibiting activity. Fluorescence spectroscopy and electron microscopy were used to monitor actin polymerization. Non-phosphorylated HSP25 monomers were active in inhibiting actin polymerization with about 90% inhibition at a 1:1 ratio of actin to HSP25, while phosphorylated HSP25 monomers and non-phosphorylated multimeric HSP25 particles were inactive. Furthermore, we present electron microscopic data on the structure of HSP25 particles."

https://openalex.org/W2093634504,"Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) and kinases coregulate the critical levels of phosphorylation necessary for intracellular signalling, cell growth and differentiation. Yersinia, the causative bacteria of the bubonic plague and other enteric diseases, secrete an active PTPase, Yop51, that enters and suppresses host immune cells. Though the catalytic domain is only approximately 20% identical to human PTP1B, the Yersinia PTPase contains all of the invariant residues present in eukaryotic PTPases, including the nucleophilic Cys 403 which forms a phosphocysteine intermediate during catalysis. We present here structures of the unliganded (2.5 A resolution) and tungstate-bound (2.6 A) crystal forms which reveal that Cys 403 is positioned at the centre of a distinctive phosphate-binding loop. This loop is at the hub of several hydrogen-bond arrays that not only stabilize a bound oxyanion, but may activate Cys 403 as a reactive thiolate. Binding of tungstate triggers a conformational change that traps the oxyanion and swings Asp 356, an important catalytic residue, by approximately 6 A into the active site. The same anion-binding loop in PTPases is also found in the enzyme rhodanese."
https://openalex.org/W1610696702,"The protective antigen component (PA) of anthrax toxin binds to receptors on target cells and conveys the toxin's edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF) components into the cytoplasm. PA (83 kDa) is processed by a cellular protease, yielding a 63-kDa fragment (PA63), which binds EF and/or LF. When exposed to acidic pH, PA63 inserts into membranes and forms ion-conductive channels. By electron microscopy, a significant fraction of purified PA63 was found to be in the form of a multi-subunit ring-shaped oligomer (outer diameter, 10.4 nm). The rings are heptameric, as judged by inspection and by rotational power spectra. Purified PA63 showed a high M(r) band, apparently corresponding to the oligomer, on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and oligomer of similar size was formed in cells in a time-dependent manner after addition of full-length PA. Inhibitors of internalization and endosome acidification blocked conversion of cell-associated PA to a high molecular weight species, and medium at pH 5.0 induced oligomer formation in the presence or absence of the inhibitors. These results correlate PA63 oligomerization with conditions required for translocation of EF and LF across lipid bilayers, implying that the PA63 oligomer may function in translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1969476076,"The folding pathways of large, highly structured RNA molecules are largely unexplored. Insight into both the kinetics of folding and the presence of intermediates was provided in a study of the Mg2+-induced folding of the Tetrahymena ribozyme by hybridization of complementary oligodeoxynucleotide probes. This RNA folds via a complex mechanism involving both Mg2+-dependent and Mg2+-independent steps. A hierarchical model for the folding pathway is proposed in which formation of one helical domain (P4-P6) precedes that of a second helical domain (P3-P7). The overall rate-limiting step is formation of P3-P7, and takes place with an observed rate constant of 0.72 ± 0.14 minute-1. The folding mechanism of large RNAs appears similar to that of many multidomain proteins in that formation of independently stable substructures precedes their association into the final conformation."
https://openalex.org/W4231014363,"The critical discriminatory event in the activation of T lymphocytes bearing alpha beta T cell receptors (TCRs) is their interaction with a molecular complex consisting of a peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded class I or class II molecule on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. The kinetics of binding were measured of a purified TCR to molecular complexes of a purified soluble analog of the murine MHC class I molecule H-2Ld (sH-2Ld) and a synthetic octamer peptide p2CL in a direct, real-time assay based on surface plasmon resonance. The kinetic dissociation rate of the MHC-peptide complex from the TCR was rapid (2.6 x 10(-2) second-1, corresponding to a half-time for dissociation of approximately 27 seconds), and the kinetic association rate was 2.1 x 10(5) M-1 second-1. The equilibrium constant for dissociation was approximately 10(-7) M. These values indicate that TCRs must interact with a multivalent array of MHC-peptide complexes to trigger T cell signaling."

These mammalian orders have evolved separately for 55-80 million years (Myr). We conclude that ZOO-FISH can be used to generate comparative chromosome maps of a large number of mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W1990674615,"Periodic changes in membrane ionic current linked to intrinsic oscillations of energy metabolism were identified in guinea pig cardiomyocytes. Metabolic stress initiated cyclical activation of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium current and concomitant suppression of depolarization-evoked intracellular calcium transients. The oscillations in membrane current and excitation-contraction coupling were linked to oscillations in the oxidation state of pyridine nucleotides but were not driven by pacemaker currents or alterations in the concentration of cytosolic calcium. Interventions that altered the rate of glucose metabolism modulated the oscillations, suggesting that the rhythms originated at the level of glycolysis. The energy-driven oscillations in potassium currents produced cyclical changes in the cardiac action potential and thus may contribute to the genesis of arrhythmias during metabolic compromise."
https://openalex.org/W1578504987,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is a heterodimer composed of an 85-kDa subunit that binds tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins via its SH2 domains and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. Expression and mutagenesis experiments have shown that the 110-kDa subunit is a dual specificity kinase that possesses both lipid and serine kinase activities. Except for the 85- and 110-kDa subunits of PI 3-kinase, however, no endogenous substrates for the serine kinase have been identified. The results of the present study show that another target of this kinase is the insulin receptor substrate, IRS-1. Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 as well as the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase was demonstrated in immunoprecipitates of PI 3-kinase and IRS-1 isolated from rat adipocytes incubated with insulin. In adipocytes incubated in the absence of insulin, only the serine phosphorylation of p85 was observed in immunoprecipitates of PI 3-kinase. Both the serine and lipid kinase activities of PI 3-kinase were abolished by the fungal metabolite Wortmannin. Wortmannin also partially inhibited the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose transport and inhibit lipolysis in fat cells. These data raise the possibility that the serine kinase activity of PI 3-kinase is involved in insulin signaling. They also suggest that inhibition of the lipid or serine kinase activities of PI 3-kinase could explain the effect of Wortmannin to diminish insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W1974337917,"Dynamin I is a nerve terminal phosphoprotein with intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity that is required for endocytosis. Upon depolarization and synaptic vesicle recycling, dynamin I undergoes a rapid dephosphorylation. Dynamin I was found to be a specific high-affinity substrate for calcineurin in vitro. At low concentrations, calcineurin dephosphorylated dynamin I that had been phosphorylated by protein kinase C. The dephosphorylation inhibited dynamin I GTPase activity in vitro and after depolarization of nerve terminals. The effect in nerve terminals was prevented by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A. This suggests that in nerve terminals, calcineurin serves as a Ca(2+)-sensitive switch for depolarization-evoked synaptic vesicle recycling."

https://openalex.org/W1540017909,"The multicatalytic protease (MCP) can be activated by two distinct multisubunit complexes. One is the regulatory component of the 26 S protease, which contains at least 15 distinct subunits. The other is a hexameric activator composed of 31- and 29-kDa subunits. A cDNA for the smaller subunit has been cloned and sequenced. The cDNA encodes a protein of 249 amino acids. Embedded between sequences typical of globular protein domains is a stretch of 28 alternating lysine and glutamic acid residues. Similar regions, which we call KEKE motifs, are also found in two MCP subunits, in subunit 12 of the 26 S protease and in a variety of chaperonins including hsp90, hsp70, and calnexin. Expression of the activator cDNA in Escherichia coli produced a functional protein virtually indistinguishable from MCP activator purified directly from red blood cells. The recombinant protein formed three isoelectric species on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and it reacted with antibodies to red blood cell activator. Recombinant activator also bound the multicatalytic protease and stimulated cleavage at the carboxyl terminus of hydrophobic or charged residues. Synthesis of the activator subunit was induced by gamma interferon treatment of HeLa cells. These last two findings have implications for antigen presentation by class I major histocompatibility receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1542669094,"We have determined protein levels of total and individual nuclear retinoic acid (RAR-alpha, -beta, -gamma) and retinoid X (RXR-alpha, -beta, -gamma) receptors by ligand binding, Western analysis, and gel shift assays, in adult human skin, a major retinoid-responsive tissue. Total RARs and RXRs, measured by direct binding of specific ligands, were 0.24 +/- 0.01 fmol/micrograms (n = 13) and 1.26 +/- 0.08 fmol/micrograms (n = 7), respectively. These values calculated on an average per cell basis were 1790 RARs/cell and 9400 RXRs/cell. Similar results were obtained with competitive ligand binding assays. RAR-alpha, -beta, and -gamma were each specifically immunoprecipitated, and their levels determined by ligand binding assays of supernatants and Western analysis of precipitates. RAR-gamma was the most abundant, representing 87% of RAR protein. The remaining 12-14% of RAR protein was RAR-alpha. No RAR-beta was detected. Similar immunoprecipitation studies revealed that RXR-alpha represented 90% of RXR protein expressed in human skin. No RXR-beta or RXR-gamma proteins were detected by Western blot. Supershift gel retardation with antibodies to RARs detected probe-RAR-alpha and probe-RAR-gamma complexes in a 1 to 4 ratio. No probe-RAR-beta complex was detected. With antibodies to both RAR-gamma and RXR, a double supershifted complex was formed, indicating that RAR-gamma/RXR heterodimers bound to the probe. These data demonstrate 1) protein levels of RXRs are five times greater than RARs, 2) relative protein levels of RAR and RXR family members are compatible with their previously described relative mRNA levels, and 3) RXR-alpha/RAR-gamma heterodimers are the major retinoid receptors that have the potential to regulate transcription of target genes, in adult human skin."
https://openalex.org/W1576400113,"Several mammalian responses to UV irradiation, including the activation of NF-kappa B, are believed to involve tyrosine phosphorylation. UV irradiation and H2O2 treatment of T lymphocytes induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca2+ signals similar to those observed following biological stimulation. We have examined the role of cell surface molecules in these responses. Normal T lymphocytes whose surface expression of CD3 was depleted showed impaired UV-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca2+ signals. Similarly, Jurkat T cell lines deficient in CD3 or CD45 expression also gave impaired UV responses. However, all these cell types still gave strong Ca2+ and tyrosine phosphorylation responses to H2O2. The T cell tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 was found to be highly responsive to UV and H2O2 treatment. ZAP-70 responsiveness to UV required expression of both CD3 and CD45, whereas only CD3 was required for the response to H2O2. UV-induced activation of NF-kappa B was blocked by CD3 depletion, indicating the importance of such cell surface molecules in biological responses to UV. In nonlymphoid cells, the epidermal growth factor receptor displayed increased tyrosine phosphorylation within seconds of UV irradiation. These results suggest that UV-induced signal transduction is mediated via cell surface receptors that normally respond to biological stimulation, whereas H2O2 is able to partially bypass this requirement."
https://openalex.org/W1557386862,"NF-AT is a lymphoid-specific transcription factor that is though to be largely responsible for determining the cell type-specific expression of the interleukin 2 (IL2) gene. Using two different purification schemes, we found that the NF-AT binding site present in the IL2 promoter is the target for two distinct polypeptides with a relative molecular weight of 45,000 and 90,000. Direct extraction of NF-AT binding activity from highly purified nuclei confirms that p45 and p90 are components of the NF-AT complex. UV-induced covalent cross-linking of p45 and p90 to the NF-AT sequence indicates that both polypeptides interact with DNA. We demonstrate using in vitro transcription that antibodies to subunits p45 and p90 strongly reduce activation of an artificial promoter carrying three NF-AT recognition sites. The complex we have purified has the potential to interact with cis-acting elements identified in the promoter of genes expressed early during T cell activation and to the HIV long terminal repeat. We also show that phosphorylation modulates interaction of NF-AT to its cognate binding site. All together, our data suggest that p45 and p90 form the constitutively expressed nuclear factor(s) proposed by Yaseen et al. (Yaseen, N.R., Maizel, A. L., Wang, F., and Sharma, S. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14285-14293)."
https://openalex.org/W1565536510,"Focal adhesion kinase, pp125FAK, is a nonmyristylated cytosolic tyrosine kinase unrelated to protein-tyrosine kinase families categorized to date. The kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK are induced by beta 1 and beta 3 integrin-mediated cell adherence or aggregation. pp125FAK is also a tyrosine phosphorylation substrate in v-src-transformed cells and is localized to focal adhesion contracts of adherent fibroblasts and carcinoma cells. In this report, we have transiently expressed in COS cells a transmembrane-anchored chimeric receptor kinase, CD2FAK, consisting of CD2 and pp125FAK. We analyzed its kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation and compared to those of pp125FAK. We found that CD2FAK exhibited constitutive kinase activity and a high basal tyrosine phosphorylation level when COS transfectants were suspended in serum-free media. The kinase activity of CD2FAK was similarly up-regulated upon beta 1 integrin-mediated cell adherence as the endogenous pp125FAK. Both CD2FAK and pp125FAK appeared to be active as autophosphorylating kinases as shown by mutation of the ATP binding site. We determined the major tyrosine phosphorylation site, Tyr397, identical for both the constitutively activated CD2FAK and pp125FAK in response to beta 1 integrin-mediated cell adherence by site-directed mutagenesis. Deletions of the NH2- or the COOH-terminal noncatalytic domain of FAK, including Tyr397 did not lead to abolition of the kinase activity of pp125FAK or CD2FAK. Taken together, CD2FAK exhibits properties of an activated pp125FAK and the kinase activity does not appear to require tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro or in vivo."

It is unclear whether Sp1 activity is regulated in vivo; the mechanism by which Sp1 interacts with the basal transcription complex has not been firmly established. We report the identification of a ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved nuclear protein, p74, that specifically binds Sp1 in vivo and in vitro. p74 interacts with several portions of the Sp1 trans-activation domain in vitro, and we correlate the binding of p74 to the amino-terminal serine/threonine-rich subdomain of Sp1 with the inhibition of Sp1-mediated transcription in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1972897131,"Commonly, linear replicons that have protein covalently attached to 5' DNA termini replicate by protein-primed, strand-displacing, continuous synthesis of full-length strands. The synthesis of DNA in pSLA2, a 17-kilobase linear plasmid of Streptomyces rochei containing 5' terminal protein, occurs bidirectionally from an internally located replication origin. The replication intermediates are linear duplex molecules that have recessed (approximately 280 nucleotides) 5' ends rather than full-length single strands. The 3' over-hangs may serve as templates for the non-displacing synthesis of the lagging strand terminus primed by the covalently attached 5' DNA binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1530852292,"Mammalian cells respond to ionizing radiation (IR) with cell cycle arrest, activation of DNA repair, and induction of early response genes. The present work has examined the involvement of Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases in the response of irradiated HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. The results demonstrate little if any effect of IR on p59fyn, p56lck, and pp60c-src activity. In contrast, HL-60 cells responded to x-ray exposure with activation of p56/p53lyn. At a dose of 200 centigrays, induction of p56/p53lyn activity was detectable at 15 min. Doses as low as 50 centigrays were effective in activating p56/p53lyn. H2O2 and the scavenger N-acetylcysteine had no detectable effect on p56/p53lyn activation, while the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, herbimycin and genistein, blocked induction by IR. The results also demonstrate that incubation of a glutathione S-transferase-Lyn fusion protein with lysates of irradiated HL-60 cells is associated with binding of the cell cycle regulatory protein, p34cdc2. The interaction of p56/p53lyn and p34cdc was confirmed in similar experiments with a glutathione S-transferase-Cdc2 fusion protein. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrate the selective binding of activated p56/p53lyn to p34cdc2 in irradiated cells. These findings indicate that IR activates p56/p53lyn in HL-60 cells and that this tyrosine kinase may contribute to the regulation of p34cdc2."

https://openalex.org/W2029544203,"Measurements of solubility and vapor pressure indicate that the cost of making a cavity in a nonpolar solvent that is large enough to accommodate a single water molecule is just balanced by the attraction between the water molecule and the walls of the cavity. As a result of this unexpected coincidence, the equilibrium constant for entry of an isolated water molecule from the vapor phase into cyclohexane is almost exactly unity at room temperature. Molecules smaller than water prefer the vapor phase, whereas molecules larger than water prefer cyclohexane. In equilibrium with liquid water, the tendency of single water molecules to enter small nonpolar cavities, such as may be present in mutant proteins, is expected to be vanishingly small."
https://openalex.org/W1591999606,"We have identified two functions for RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis during DNA strand exchange. First, ATP hydrolysis renders RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange unidirectional (5' to 3' with respect to the single-stranded DNA). In the presence of a nonhydrolyzable analog adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S), DNA strand exchange is bidirectional. Second, ATP hydrolysis is required for extensive formation of hybrid DNA. In the presence of ATP hydrolysis, the length of the exchanged region is limited only by the available homology, whereas in the absence of ATP hydrolysis, only 2 kilobase pairs or less of hybrid DNA are formed before branch migration is blocked in the majority of paired intermediates. Both of these functions of RecA protein-mediated ATP hydrolysis are crucial in ensuring the effectiveness of recombinational DNA repair, especially when the lesion to be repaired is distant from the initial crossover point."
https://openalex.org/W1523660087,"Fetal rat liver possesses substantial levels of glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity toward aflatoxin B1-8,9-epoxide. The enzyme responsible for this activity is an Alpha-class GST heterodimer comprising Yc1 and Yc2 subunits. The cDNAs encoding these polypeptides have been cloned and shown to share approximately 91% identity over 920 base pairs, extending from nucleotide -23 to the AATAAA polyadenylation signal. GST Yc2Yc2 expressed in Escherichia coli was found to exhibit 150-fold greater activity toward aflatoxin B1-8,9-epoxide than GST Yc1Yc1. Comparison between the structures of Alpha-class GST suggests that tyrosine at residue 108 and/or aspartate at residue 208 is responsible for the high aflatoxin B1 detoxication capacity of Yc2. Immunoblotting and enzyme assays have shown that liver from adult female rats contains about 10-fold greater levels of Yc2 than is found in liver from adult male rats. This sex-specific expression of Yc2 in adult rat liver may contribute to the relative insensitivity of female rats to aflatoxin B1. Dietary administration of oltipraz, a synthetic antioxidant which protects against aflatoxin-hepatocarcinogenesis, serves as an inducer of GST Yc2."
https://openalex.org/W2134090814,"We recently identified a protein, designated receptor accessory factor (RAF), that interacts directly with and enhances the DNA binding of androgen (AR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptor peptide fragments. To determine its identity, RAF was purified from HeLa cell extracts by anion-exchange and DNA affinity chromatography. RAF activity co-purified with a 110-kDa protein, the partial amino acid sequence of which shares 97.5% identity with insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), a metalloendoprotease implicated in the intracellular degradation of insulin. The identity of RAF was confirmed in gel shift assays by demonstrating that AR.RAF and GR.RAF DNA complexes shifted to a slower mobility in the presence of an IDE antibody. Purified preparations of RAF had insulin degrading activity, and this activity was inhibited by AR. In addition, the interaction of AR or GR with RAF was competed by insulin and bacitracin, a competitive inhibitor of IDE. The interactions of AR and GR with IDE may have important implications for both insulin- and steroid-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1532079357,"A highly purified urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) inhibits not only tumor cell invasion in an in vitro assay but also production of experimental and spontaneous lung metastasis in an in vivo mouse model. UTI is present both in the lysate of tumor cells (human choriocarcinoma SMT-cc1 cells, human promyeloid leukemia U937 cells, and murine Lewis lung carcinoma 3LL cells) and human neutrophils. In each medium from tumor cells, most of the cell-associated UTI is on the cell surface. Cell-binding experiments employing cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry indicated that tumor cells (SMT-cc1 and 3LL cells) have specific binding sites for UTI on their cell surface. UTI binds rapidly and with relatively high affinity to SMT-cc1 and 3LL cells. UTI is bound to a specific surface receptor that is incompletely saturated. U937 cells and neutrophils did not show any specific binding to UTI, since UTI receptors on the cell surface of U937 cells and neutrophils were completely saturated with endogenous UTI. UTI forms yielded cross-linked 150- and 80-kDa ligand receptor complexes with cultured SMT-cc1 cells, suggesting molecular masses of 110 and 40 kDa for the UTI receptors. Purification of the two UTI receptor proteins by ligand affinity chromatography (ligand-blotting analysis) yielded two bands when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, corresponding in electrophoretic mobility to those calculated by cross-linking analysis. The results reported here showing that some tumor cells carry UTI receptors are in line with a possible role of surface-bound UTI in modulating plasmin activity to the close environment of the cell surface and in processes like prevention of tumor cell invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1531600133,"BTEB is a GC-box binding transcription factor that can activate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat and cellular gene promoters containing multiple GC boxes. The present studies showed that although BTEB mRNA was expressed in various tissues of mammals and cell lines, the expression of BTEB protein was confined to the brain and a neuroblastoma Neuro2A (N2A), suggesting that the BTEB expression was translationally regulated in a cell-specific or tissue-specific manner. The BTEB mRNA was characterized by a long (1.26 kilobases( 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) containing 10 upstream AUGs (uAUGs) and a GC-rich tract. To examine whether the 5'-UTR controlled the translation in a cell-specific manner, a fusion plasmid composed of the BTEB 5'-UTR and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was transfected into HeLa and N2A cells. Translational efficiency of the transcribed mRNA was estimated from the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity normalized on the basis of the amount of the mRNA. The 5'-UTR was found to decrease the translational efficiency by 7-fold in HeLa cells; that in N2A was not affected. When one of the uAUGs in the 5'-UTR was mutated to AAG, the inhibition of the translation by the 5'-UTR in HeLa cells was reversed; no effect of the mutation was observed in N2A cells. These results suggest that an uAUG in the 5'-UTR of the BTEB mRNA is, at least in part, responsible for the cell-specific translational control of the BTEB expression."
https://openalex.org/W1963536798,"The genome of Ascaris lumbricoides encodes both germline- and soma-specific proteins homologous to the eukaryotic small ribosomal protein (Rp) S19. The two Ascaris homologs differ by 24 amino acid substitutions and are both components of the small ribosomal subunits. In oocytes, the germline RpS19 homolog (RpS19G) predominates. During chromatin diminution, however, the gene is eliminated from all presomatic cells, and RpS19G is replaced by the product of the somatic gene (RpS19S). Chromatin diminution in A. lumbricoides causes a change in the protein composition of ribosomes during development and represents an alternative means of gene regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1575870218,"Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biopolymer of important commercial applications, is found in a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and cyanobacteria. The present study has resulted in the identification of PHB in the luminescent marine bacteria, Vibrio harveyi, in spite of it being previously classified as PHB-negative. PHB granules with distinct membranes were detected by electron microscopy after fixation and staining of V. harveyi cells with malachite green. Analyses by gas chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and ultraviolet spectroscopy clearly established the presence of PHB. The synthesis of PHB in V. harveyi was found to be under cell density regulation with the levels increasing from 0 (< 0.2) to 26 mg of PHB/g of dry cell weight during growth in a manner analogous to the induction of luminescence in this bacteria. Moreover, synthesis of PHB in V. harveyi was shown to be controlled by the lux autoinducer, N-(3-hydroxybutanoyl)homoserine lactone, providing not only a potential link between luminescence and PHB production but also showing that the lux autoinducer acts as a general signal transductant. These results have also extended the role of homoserine lactones in metabolic regulation to include the control of synthesis of potential energy reserves."
https://openalex.org/W1502544172,"N-Ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) was originally characterized as the protein that restores in vitro protein transport activity of the Golgi membranes inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide. This protein has two homologous regions, each containing the consensus sequence for nucleotide binding, and possesses ATPase activity. To investigate the role of the two nucleotide-binding regions in NSF, we have replaced two lysyl residues (Lys-274 and Lys-557) located in the consensus sequences with glutamine or methionine via site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant NSF proteins in which Lys-274 was replaced had no ability to restore protein transport between N-ethylmaleimide-treated Golgi membranes and, in addition, inhibited the protein transport assay using normal Golgi membranes. This inhibition, which was eliminated by N-ethylmaleimide treatment, was caused by the impairment of the function of donor Golgi membranes. Although wild-type NSF showed a protective effect against inhibition by the Lys-274 mutant NSF protein when added at the start of the protein transport assay, its protective effect diminished after the time for the formation of transport vesicles had passed. These results support the idea that NSF incorporated into transport vesicles is nonexchangeable for exogenously added NSF. On the other hand, the mutant proteins in which Lys-557 was replaced had slight but significant protein transport activity. They did not inhibit the protein transport assay using normal Golgi membranes. The mutant NSF proteins in which Lys-274 and Lys-557 were replaced had about 20 and 25% of the ATPase activities of wild-type NSF, respectively. Their ATPase activities were sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide and dependent on their protein concentrations, as observed in wild-type NSF."

In this report, the DNA-cleaving moiety copper:o-phenanthroline was attached to the sequence-specific DNA binding protein catabolite activator protein (CAP) at an amino acid that, because of a difference in DNA bending, is close to DNA in the specific CAP-DNA complex but is not close to DNA in the nonspecific CAP-DNA complex. The resulting CAP derivative, OP26CAP, cleaved kilobase and megabase DNA substrates at a 22-base pair consensus DNA site with high efficiency and exhibited no detectable nonspecific DNA-cleavage activity."
https://openalex.org/W1537431414,"A protease purified from the venom of the elapid snake Naja naja oxiana converts human blood coagulation factor Va into a molecule (factor VaNO) with greatly reduced cofactor activity. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed that the venom protease cleaved a small peptide from the heavy chain of factor Va and reduced the apparent M(r) from 105,000 to 101,000. This peptide was isolated by high performance liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column. Amino acid sequence analysis of the peptide indicated that the venom enzyme cleaved the peptide bond between His682 and Asp683, thus removing 27 amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal part of the heavy chain. The cofactor activities of factors Va and VaNO were compared by measuring their abilities to support factor Xa-catalyzed prothrombin activation in the presence of phospholipids and calcium ions. Both factor Va molecules stimulated the binding of factor Xa to negatively charged phospholipids. However, the amounts of factor Va required for half-maximal incorporation of factor Xa into the membrane-bound factor Xa-Va complex were much lower for native factor Va (0.25 nM) than for factor VaNO (2.01 nM). At saturating concentrations of factor Va or factor VaNO the kcat values for prothrombin activation were 114 s-1 for factor Va and 128 s-1 for factor VaNO. The Km values for prothrombin determined under these conditions were 0.24 and 0.83 microM for prothrombinase complexes with native factor Va and factor VaNO, respectively. Direct binding studies revealed that factors Va and VaNO bind with equal affinity to phospholipids. These data indicate that factor VaNO is impaired in its ability to interact with factor Xa and prothrombin. Together with the structural data this implies that the carboxyl-terminal Asp683-Arg709 domain of the heavy chain is required for optimal interaction of factor Va with factor Xa and prothrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1633938420,"Maturation of the acid-stimulating hormone gastrin involves precursor cleavage, tyrosine sulfation, serine phosphorylation, and COOH-terminal amidation. We have used brefeldin A and incubation at 22 degrees C to determine where and when these modifications occur. Immunogold studies of gastrin cells incubated at 22 degrees C revealed swollen Golgi cisternae, the terminal regions of which were associated with an accumulation of progastrin immunoreactivity. At 22 degrees C, [3H]tyrosine and [35S]sulfate were incorporated into progastrin, but Arg94-Arg95 cleavage, and Ser96 phosphorylation, were inhibited. When pulse labeling at 22 degrees C for 120 min was followed by a chase at 37 degrees C, [35S]progastrin was cleaved at Arg94-Arg95 with a t1/2 of about 10 min, compared with about 20 min for [3H]progastrin. Approximately 60% of the COOH-terminal cleavage fragment was phosphorylated, but there was little or no incorporation of [32P]phosphate into progastrin. Addition of brefeldin A during the chase substantially inhibited cleavage of [3H]progastrin, but not [35S]progastrin. However, when pulse labeling was limited to 20 min at 22 degrees C, the presence of brefeldin A in a subsequent chase at 37 degrees C completely inhibited cleavage of [35S]progastrin. The data indicate that progastrin sulfation occurs in the trans-Golgi network, exit from which involves passage through first a brefeldin A-sensitive and then a temperature-sensitive step. Cleavage at Arg94-Arg95 and Ser phosphorylation are closely linked, occur distal to the temperature-sensitive step, and are followed by amidation in secretory granules. It is known that mature secretory granules do not phosphorylate progastrin-derived peptides, and so phosphorylation appears to coincides with, and may provide a marker for, delivery of peptide from trans-Golgi work to immature secretory granules in gastrin cells."
https://openalex.org/W1496301642,"We have defined the bacterial and viral DNA targets (att sites) of P22 site-specific recombination and characterized their interaction with integrase (Int) protein. The bacterial DNA target, attB, is approximately 27 base pairs and consists of two core type Int binding sites as inverted repeats. The top and bottom Int cleavage sites fall within the core type Int binding sites and are separated by a 7-base pair overlap region. A similar core region is found in the viral DNA target, attP, which is approximately 260 base pairs long and contains two IHF binding sites and five arm type binding sites for Int. The results suggest that P22 Int, like lambda Int, is a heterobivalent DNA-binding protein that is capable of forming complex higher order structures with recombinogenic function. Although P22 and lambda recombination involve very similar multiprotein interactions and core region structures, there are significant differences in the arrangements of distal protein binding sites. These differences are discussed in terms of the possible flexibility of the Int protein and the specificity with which the higher order complexes assemble and/or function."
https://openalex.org/W1491659313,"We have isolated a full-length cDNA clone from Arabidopsis thaliana that has extensive homology to p40 proteins from other organisms. The cDNA predicts a protein (A-p40) of 298 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 32.5 kDa and a pI of 4.8. Antibodies raised against an A-p40 fusion protein detected a polypeptide of about 40 kDa in Arabidopsis and about 42 kDa in corn and soybean. In two-dimensional gel electrophoresis the antibodies detected several acidic isoforms. A-p40 appears to be located in the cytoplasm in two forms: soluble, or tightly associated with 40 S subunits and polysomes. Mixing experiments with soluble A-p40 and purified corn polysomes showed that the ribosome-associated form does not result from nonspecific binding during extraction. High concentrations of KCl (1.5 M) are needed to release A-p40 from ribosomes, which suggests that it may be a true ribosomal protein. Several pieces of evidence suggest that A-p40 belongs to the acidic class of ribosomal proteins; first, its acidic pI; second, the presence of amino acid repeats conserved in other acidic ribosomal proteins; and third, the fact that it exists in the cell in two pools (free and ribosome-associated)."
https://openalex.org/W1570397481,"The vaccinia virus-encoded protein VP39 is a poly(A) polymerase subunit that stimulates the formation of long poly(A) tails as well as a cap-specific mRNA (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase. We have carried out mutagenesis studies aimed at locating regions of VP39 which are important for these activities. The open reading frame encoding VP39 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The affinity-purified protein had both mRNA modification activities, before and after removal of the glutathione S-transferase domain. Truncation, charge cluster-->Ala scanning, and Cys-->Ser substitution mutations of VP39 were made, and the proteins were synthesized, purified, and analyzed. Deletion of the RNA binding domain, experimentally localized within the carboxyl-terminal 112 amino acids, resulted in the loss of both mRNA modification activities. Eleven of the 21 charge cluster-->Ala mutated proteins had low to nondetectable methyltransferase activity. Four of those 11 also lacked adenylyl-transferase stimulatory function, whereas the remainder had amino acid substitutions that selectively affected methyltransferase activity. However, no mutated proteins lacking adenylyltransferase stimulatory function but possessing methyltransferase activity were isolated by the procedures used. Neither of the 2 cysteine residues in VP39 was necessary for either mRNA modification activity."
https://openalex.org/W1503263917,"A previous study has suggested that the autoinhibitory domain of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) may contain an alpha-helical structure, which is important for the proper orientation of inhibitory residues to interact with the catalytic domain (Smith, M. K., Colbran, R. J., Brickey, D. A., and Soderling, T.R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1761-1768). The present study was designed to test the importance of the secondary structure in the autoinhibitory domain (residues 281-302) by site-specific mutagenesis of selected residues to prolines. Single mutants C289P, C289A, A295P, and the double mutant C289P/A295P were expressed using the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system and purified on CaM-Sepharose. The single mutants had specific activities (7-12 mumol/min/mg) and eluted from gel permeation chromatography (600-650 kDa) identical to wild-type kinase. Since the double mutant had a very low specific activity and eluted as a mixture of a large aggregate and proteolyzed monomer, it was not characterized further. Only the C289P mutant exhibited enhanced Ca(2+)-independent activity (5-12% of total activity) prior to autophosphorylation. When autophosphorylation was performed in the absence of Ca2+/CaM at 5 degrees C, only the C289P mutant showed a significant increase in Ca(2+)-independent activity. This autophosphorylation of Thr286 in the absence of Ca2+/CaM has not been observed with wild-type kinase or any other autoinhibitory domain mutant we have characterized. This result suggests that Thr286, the autophosphorylation site responsible for Ca(2+)-independent activity, may not be available for autophosphorylation in the wild-type kinase or the other mutants because of structural restrictions due to the secondary structure in this region. This structural restraint is presumably disrupted by the binding of Ca2+/CaM or by insertion of a proline residue."
https://openalex.org/W2145952681,"Phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II by general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is believed to control the activity of polymerase at some stage of messenger RNA synthesis. In a recent study, transcription factor IIE (TFIIE) was proposed to play a key role in regulating phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II CTD, on the basis of evidence indicating that preparations of recombinant TFIIE strongly stimulate CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH (Lu, H., Zawel, L., Fischer, L., Egly, J.-M., and Reinberg, D. (1992) Nature 358, 641-645). TFIIE is a heterodimer composed of 56-kDa (p56) and 34-kDa (p34) subunits and functions in concert with the TATA factor, TFIIB, TFIIF, and TFIIH to promote formation of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. In the process of investigating the role that TFIIE plays in controlling phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II CTD, we discovered that preparations of the recombinant TFIIE p56 subunit were sufficient to reconstitute stimulation of CTD phosphorylation by the TFIIH kinase. Further investigation revealed that CTD kinase stimulatory activity was chromatographically separable from the bulk of the transcriptionally active p56 subunit and was associated, instead, with a minor oligomeric form of p56. Taken together, these findings argue that the TFIIE p56 subunit is capable of interacting not only with the p34 subunit but also with itself to form either heterodimers or high molecular mass oligomers that play distinct roles in transcription initiation and regulation of the TFIIH kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1486965885,"We report the characterization of a genomic clone containing portions of two tandemly arranged genes that encode a spicule matrix protein, SM30, of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. The isolated 18.4-kilo-base genomic clone contains the complete genomic sequence of one SM30 gene, designated SM30-alpha, and a portion of another SM30 gene, designated SM30-beta. Southern blot analysis shows that SM30 protein is encoded by a small gene family of two to four members. RNase protection assays indicate that the SM30-alpha gene is expressed at the time of spicule formation in the sea urchin embryo. In addition, mapping of SM30-alpha shows that a large single intron interrupts the coding sequence. Comparison of the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the SM30-alpha genomic sequence and the previously isolated SM30 cDNA reveals them to be very similar, but not identical. We also demonstrate that 2.6 kilobases of upstream sequence of SM30-alpha are sufficient to direct primary mesenchyme cell-specific expression of a reporter gene construct."
https://openalex.org/W1602577631,"We have analyzed site occupancy in vivo with constructs containing one or more copies of the binding site for the yeast trans-activator, yIBF. The data indicate only a modest difference in site occupancy (at most 2-fold) even though multiple copies activate transcription several hundredfold more than one copy. Using studies in which we have mutated the IES2 sequence and slightly decreased its affinity for yIBF, we have also shown that synergistic activation of transcription is dependent on overall site occupancy. Finally, synergy declines as yIBF-binding sites are separated, and loss of synergy appears to be correlated with loss of a linking surface. These results are consistent with the simultaneous contact model of synergistic activation."
