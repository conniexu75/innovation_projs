https://openalex.org/W1508161280,"Abstract The cell factor that is involved in tumor-associated fibrinolysis has been partially purified from the supernatant fluid of transformed chicken embryo fibroblast cultures. It is an arginine-specific protease that acts as a plasminogen activator. The molecular weight is approximately 39,000, and the irreversible inhibitory effect of diisopropyl fluorophosphate suggests it is a serine enzyme. The cell factor that is detected in the supernatant culture fluid also occurs in a cell-associated form in transformed but not in normal cells. This form is tightly bound in a postnuclear cellular particulate fraction and can be solubilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate or Triton X-100. The cell factor activates plasminogen by proteolytic cleavage, and it acts preferentially on one of two electrophoretic classes of plasminogen molecules found in chicken plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1505846226,"Abstract A protein activator of cyclic 3' : 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase from bovine brain has been purified to homogeneity by the criteria of analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing, Sephadex G-100 column chromatography, and analytical ultracentrifugation. The over-all purification was about 1700-fold with a yield of 7%. The molecular weight of the activator is 15,000 as determined by several methods. Other physical properties are: sedimentation coefficient (s20,w), 1.85 S; diffusion coefficient (D20,w), 1.09 x 10-6 cm2 per s; partial specific volume (v), 0.72 cm3 per g; frictional ratio (f:f0), 1.20; and isoelectric point (pI), 4.3. Amino acid analysis of the acid hydrolyzate of the activator showed high content of aspartic and glutamic acids compared to basic amino acids, in agreement with a low pI of 4.3. Sulfhydryl groups, cystine, and tryptophan were not detected. The NH2-terminal residue was identified as valine. This, together with the fact that the molecular weight of 15,000 remained unchanged in 6 n guanidine hydrochloride, indicates that the activator is a single polypeptide. The activator binds Ca2+ specifically. A Scatchard plot of data obtained from equilibrium binding revealed four Ca2+ binding sites per mole of activator; their dissociation constants ranged from 4 to 18 µm. Stimulation of phosphodiesterase by the activator required a low concentration of Ca2+, and chelation of Ca2+ by ethylene glycol bis(β-amino-ethyl ether)-N ,N'-tetraacetic acid rendered the activator inactive. The concentration of Ca2+ needed to give half-maximum activation of phosphodiesterase was 3 µm. Ca2+ alone did not activate phosphodiestersae. These results suggest that the active form of the activator is a Ca2+-activator complex, in agreement with the findings of Teo and Wang (Teo, T. S., and Wang, J. H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5950). In contrast to the heart activator (Teo, T. S., Wang, T. H., and Wang, J. H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 588), the brain activator was stable in the presence of either 1 mm Mg2+ or 1 mm EDTA. Staining of the activator with periodate-Schiff reagent or pyronine Y after electrophoresis on acrylamide gel was negative. Bovine brain phosphodiesterase(s) hydrolyzes adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP). At millimolar substrate concentration the rate of hydrolysis of cyclic AMP was greater than that of cyclic GMP, whereas at micromolar concentration, the reverse was found. Although the activator stimulated the hydrolysis of both nucleotides, it stimulated cyclic AMP hydrolysis more, regardless of the concentration used. The stimulation of the hydrolysis of both substrates was greater at micromolar concentrations than at millimolar. Caffeine inhibited phosphodiesterase both in the presence and absence of the activator; this inhibition was not reversed by increased concentrations of the activator."
https://openalex.org/W1563049574,"Abstract The changes in optical and EPR spectra observed during the anaerobic titration of xanthine oxidase with dithionite can be accounted for by simple oxidation-reduction equilibria involving Mo(VI) ↔ Mo(V) ↔ Mo(IV); FAD ↔ FADH. ↔ FADH2, and the 1-electron reduction of each of the two iron-sulfur centers. The equilibrium constants so obtained permit the calculation of the relative probabilities of the 36 possible states that occur on addition of a given quantity of reductant. pH jump experiments with this enzyme (Edmondson, D., Ballou, D., Van Heuvelen, A., Palmer, G., and Massey, V. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6129–6135) show that internal electron transfer is much more than turnover and we therefore assume that the distributions described by these equilibrium constants are maintained during catalysis. By adopting a model in which 3 moles of xanthine each donate a pair of electrons in a consecutive irreversible process, and using the equilibrium distributions described above, it is possible to calculate accurately the time course of reduction of both the flavin and iron-sulfur centers and to account for the increase in the rate of bleaching of deflavoenzyme observed experimentally. By invoking the existence of enzyme-xanthine complexes we can account for (a) the participation and time dependence of very and rapid molybdenum and (b) the deuterium isotope effects observed during steady state and transient state kinetics (Edmondson et al.). The same equilibrium model accounts for the optical and EPR data obtained during the reaction of reduced enzyme with oxygen; the biphasic kinetics are readily explained by assuming that FADH2 is the species reacting rapidly with O2 in the fast phase. From these results we conclude that the iron-sulfur centers act as an electron reservoir functioning to maintain molybdenum as Mo(VI) (for efficient reduction) and flavin as FADH2 (for efficient oxidation)."
https://openalex.org/W1521291324,Abstract Beef heart cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase catalyzes the incorporation of 2 moles of phosphate from ATP into its cAMP-binding component. The protein-bound phosphate exhibits properties consistent with those of a phospho-ester of serine or threonine residues and is subject to hydrolysis by a phosphoprotein phosphatase. Phosphorylation of protein kinase facilitates the cAMP-dependent dissociation of protein kinase into catalytic and cAMP-binding components but does not appear to alter binding of cAMP to the enzyme. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases may be a mechanism for regulating protein kinase activity and for mediating the effects of cAMP.
https://openalex.org/W1584539705,"Coenzyme M is a recently discovered cofactor which is involved in methyl transfer reactions in Methanobacterium. Information derived from infrared, proton NMR, and ultraviolet spectroscopy as well as from chemical tests and quantitative elemental analysis reveals that the coenzyme is 2,2′-dithiodiethanesulfonic acid. Verification of this structure resides in the comparison of authentic with chemically synthesized 2,2′-dithiodiethanesulfonic acid. Evidence indicates that an active form of this cofactor is 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid which is methylated producing 2-(methylthio) ethanesulfonic acid; this derivative is subsequently reductively demethylated, yielding methane."
https://openalex.org/W1573656797,"Abstract Erythropoietin, a glycoprotein that induces normal erythrocyte development, has 16 to 18 sialic acid residues per mole. Desialation results in complete loss of biological activity when it is assayed in vivo. When the assay is done in vitro asialoerythropoietin has full activity, or when assayed at low levels of hormones is about three times more active than the native hormone. The loss of activity can be explained by the hepatic removal of asialoglycoproteins from the circulation (Morell, A. G., Irvine, R. A., Sternlieb, I., Scheinberg, I. H., and Ashwell, G. (1968) J. Biol. Chem. 243, 155). Asialoorosomucoid or stachyose injected into assay animals act as competitors and permit 25 to 35% of the original activity of erythropoietin to be seen in vivo after desialation. Treatment of asialoerythropoietin with galactose oxidase results in recovery of 45% of the original activity, confirming an earlier finding (Lukowsky, W. A., and Painter, R. H. (1972) Can. J. Biochem. 50, 909). Asialoerythropoietin is more sensitive to heat denaturation and trypsin action than the native hormone. Our data indicate that terminal sialic acid is required for chemical and biological stability but not for action on target cells of the bone marrow. The asialohormone has enhanced activity towards the target cells."

https://openalex.org/W1505201936,"Abstract The cytochrome b-c1 complex has been solubilized and purified to a stage containing 6.5 nmoles of cytochrome b per mg of protein. Seven bands are resolved on a polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic column in sodium dodecyl sulfateβ-mercaptoethanol medium. Five of these seven bands have been identified as cytochromes b and c1 and a non-heme iron protein. The remaining two bands might be associated with these components or, less likely, might be impurities but do not belong to the so-called structural proteins. The cytochrome b-c1 complex is enzymatically active and can reconstitute with soluble succinate dehydrogenase to form an integral entity of antimycin A-sensitive succinate-cytochrome c reductase. The reconstituted reductase shows the same structural and functional characteristics as the intact reductase. The total number of the p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (p-MB) titratable groups in the cytochrome b-c1 complex has been found to be 11 ± 1 moles per mole of cytochrome b. The p-MB-reacted complex is inactive in reconstitution but shows the same catalytic activity in the oxidation of reduced ubiquinone by cytochrome c."

https://openalex.org/W1585742295,"Abstract This paper describes some correlations between tumorassociated fibrinolysis and the morphological properties of normal and Simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed hamster embryo fibroblast cultures. The rate of fibrinolysis and morphological response are both influenced by the nature of the serum supplement; most sera show an excellent correlation between the rate of fibrinolysis and the development of characteristic morphological changes. Both processes require the presence of the serum factor, plasminogen, and its conversion to plasmin. When normal and transformed fibroblasts are co-cultivated under appropriate conditions, the normal cells develop morphological changes similar to those ordinarily expressed by transformed cells. The appearance of these changes in normal cells is also correlated with fibrinolytic activity and the activation of plasminogen. Fibrinolysis and morphological change can be dissociated in media supplemented with sera of bovine origin. When the macromolecular protease inhibitors are destroyed by acid treatment, bovine sera become active in fibrinolysis; however, they do not mediate morphological change, and they can be shown to contain a selective inhibitor of the morphological transformation. These results show that an active fibrinolytic system is a necessary but not a sufficient requirement for morphological changes accompanying transformation of hamster fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1987071889,"A polyneuropathy affecting a large number of workers was recently observed at a plant producing plastic-coated and color-printed fabrics. Epidemiological data suggested strongly that methyl N-butyl ketone (MBK) was responsible for the outbreak. This hypothesis is now supported by the development of a peripheral neuropathy in chickens, rats, and cats exposed to MBK at atmospheric concentrations of 200 to 600 parts per million, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Although the animals were exposed continuously and the affected workers were exposed intermittently, the averages of the total number of hours of exposure for development of the peripheral neutropathy in the animals and workers were remarkably close."
https://openalex.org/W1946920086,"Abstract Livers of tungsten-treated rats have been shown to contain inactive protein which cross-reacts with antibody prepared against native rat liver sulfite oxidase. The cross-reacting material (CRM) was shown to be immunologically identical to the native enzyme by Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion. Difference spectrophotometry, acrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunological analysis of the proteins of the mitochondrial intermembranous space from livers of control and tungsten-treated rats showed that, like native sulfite oxidase, the CRM was localized in this compartment. CRM was quantitated in terms of the amount of the b5-type heme of sulfite oxidase which was precipitable by the antibody and was shown to be present in amounts corresponding to almost 70% of control. Sulfite oxidase CRM was purified by the procedure established for native enzyme and shown to contain the b5 heme in stoichiometric amounts and no molybdenum. Tungsten was quantitated by a sensitive colorimetric technique and was found to be incorporated into 35% of the molybdenum-free molecules. Tungsten-containing sulfite oxidase was shown to have no detectable cytochrome c reductase activity. Tungsten in the enzyme could be visualized by EPR spectroscopy after reduction by dithionite. The signal at g = 1.87 was very similar in line shape to the g = 1.97 signal of molybdenum (V) in native sulfite oxidase. The native and inactive proteins were indistinguishable on acrylamide gels in the presence or absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The absorption spectra of the two proteins were quite similar in both the oxidized and reduced states, although the conditions required for reduction of the heme chromophore differed. The native enzyme was reduced by sulfite within 1 min; the inactive protein showed 30 to 40% reduction in the course of 30 min in the presence of sulfite, with full reduction achieved only upon the addition of dithionite. The difference spectrum of oxidized native sulfite oxidase minus inactive protein revealed subtle differences in the environments of the heme prosthetic group, hydrophobic aromatic residues, and possibly sulfhydrylmolybdenum linkages. Activity assays of the native enzyme complexed with antibody showed loss of ability to reduce O2 and cytochrome c but normal ferricyanide activity. EPR studies revealed that the molybdenum center of the enzyme in the complex was rapidly reducible by sulfite and maintained its sensitivity to anionic and pH effects. Sulfite oxidase in other rat tissues was shown to be antigenically similar to the liver enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1589220195,"Abstract Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase catalyzed the adenosylcobalamin-dependent deamination of 2-aminopropanol as well as that of ethanolamine. When the enzyme-coenzyme complex was frozen in liquid nitrogen while it was acting on 2-aminopropanol, a large, well defined EPR spectrum was demonstrated. The spectrum consisted of two components: a broad signal at g = 2.34, and an asymmetrical doublet with g values of 2.04 and 1.99. The over-all signal corresponded to about 1.3 spins per active site, the electron density being approximately equally divided between the species producing the g = 2.34 component and the one represented by the asymmetrical doublet. The configuration of the signal was the same regardless of whether the incubation was conducted aerobically or anaerobically. Both components of the signal were saturated by increasing power, the doublet being the more easily saturated component. EPR spectroscopy at two different microwave frequencies (X band and K band) showed that the doublet represented a single paramagnetic species whose signal was split by an interaction with another paramagnetic species in its vicinity. By its location, configuration, and the characteristics of the superimposed hyperfine structure, the g = 2.34 signal was assigned to the unpaired electron of cob(II)alamin. Experiments with isotopically labeled propanolamine permitted the doublet signal to be assigned to the 2-aminopropanol-1-yl radical. The major splitting of the doublet signal was attributed to a dipole-dipole interaction between the 2-amino-propanol-1-yl radical and the unpaired electron on cob(II)-alamin; assuming this explanation to be correct, the distance between the two spins was calculated to be ∼6 A. Rapid mixing, quick freeze experiments showed that the appearance of the paramagnetic species was a first order process with a rate constant of 7 s-1. Since the turnover number for propanolamine is 1 to 2 s-1, the process by which the paramagnetic species are generated is kinetically competent with respect to over-all catalysis. Once formed, the species disappeared with a half-time of about 1 to 2 min. Their disappearance is probably associated with the irreversible destruction of adenosylcobalamin by a side reaction not directly relevant to the catalytic mechanism. These results have been interpreted in terms of a mechanism whereby the early hydrogen transfer steps in the adenosylcobalamin-dependent rearrangement of propanolamine are as follows: [see PDF for equation]"

The enzyme has been purified 540-fold to apparent homogeneity from Chinese hamster brain. The native molecular weight is 78,000 to 85,000 determined by Sephadex G-100 column chromatography and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme appears to consist of three subunits of molecular weight 25,000 determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Electrofocusing and acrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrate the presence of at least three isozymes. The enzyme is remarkably stable at 85° if first incubated in 1 mm 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate. The enzyme is active from pH 5.5 to 11 with maximum activity at pH 10. The enzyme displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics with apparent Michaelis constants for hypoxanthine, guanine, and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate of 0.52, 1.1, and 5.3 µm, respectively."

X is a weakly basic residue which does not correspond to any amino acid commonly occurring in proteins but which is present in unmodified EF-2, possibly to the extent of only 1 residue per mole of EF-2."
https://openalex.org/W1491357637,"Normal and transformed mouse fibroblasts catalyze transfer of sialic acid, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, glucose, and mannose from nucleotide sugar donors to glycolipids and glycoproteins. The enzyme activity is associated with intact cells. Kinetic parameters and optimal ion concentrations have been determined for the glycosyltransferase activities detected when whole cells are incubated with nucleotide sugars. Homogenization of cells either decreased or did not change the activity observed. Adding unlabeled sugars did not affect incorporations. Trypsin caused a 50% inhibition of observable activity only when present in concentrations which also caused significant cell destruction. Swiss SV40 transformed cells showed decreased sialic acid-transferring ability compared to the parent cell line. Swiss Py3T3 and SV3T3 cells had reduced ability to catalyze transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to glycolipids compared with the normal cell line. Since these alterations have also been reported in homogenates of these cells, and in view of the large number of glycosyltransferase activities observed, the in vitro whole cell reactions probably detect the normal cellular systems which are in the process of synthesizing glycoproteins and glycolipids. Evidence supporting this conclusion was obtained from experiments in which glycolipid products synthesized in cells incubated in the presence of [3H]galactose and UDP-[14C]galactose are compared."
https://openalex.org/W1584222430,"Isolated fat cells from hypothyroid rats, in contrast with those from normal animals, lack ability to give a lipolytic response to epinephrine or glucagon. However, activation of triglyceride lipolysis was induced with (N6,O2′-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3′ : 5′-monophosphate), or a combination of epinephrine and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Adenylyl cyclase was activated by catecholamines or glucagon in membrane ghosts prepared from fat cells obtained from hypothyroid rats. The characteristics of the enzyme, and its activation by hormones and fluoride were similar to those observed in fat cell membrane ghosts from normal animals. Thus, adenylyl cyclase appears to be functional in the hypothyroid state, although lipolysis is blocked. Whole fat cells were incubated in the presence and absence of epinephrine or theophylline, and accumulation of cyclic AMP over 10 min was measured. Basal, unstimulated levels were found to be similar in cells from normal and hypothyroid animals. In the presence of theophylline alone, similar levels of cyclic AMP were again observed. An increase in cyclic AMP accumulation in response to epinephrine stimulation, however, was not obtained in cells from hypothyroid rats except in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities were fractionated by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. The soluble, low affinity form of phosphodiesterase activity did not differ in the normal and hypothyroid states. The particulate, high affinity forms of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity were elevated in fat cells from hypothyroid rats. Thyroid hormones may thus exert a modulating effect on cyclic AMP-mediated responses by regulating the activity of a membrane associated, high affinity, cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1564754615,"Abstract Cyclic guanosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) has been found in extracts of Escherichia coli K-12 and Bacillus licheniformis A-5. In E. coli, the intracellular concentrations of cyclic GMP, which range from 3 to 35 nm, are approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), and undergo alterations during experimentally altered physiological states that are generally in a direction opposite to those that occur in cyclic AMP. Highest levels of cyclic GMP are present during the early phase of logarithmic growth in glucose-containing media and significantly lower levels are found when cells approach the stationary phase of growth, when proliferation ceases, or when a slower rate of growth is maintained in the presence of succinate instead of glucose as the carbon source. In B. licheniformis extracts, cyclic AMP was not detected. Cyclic GMP concentrations in B. licheniformis, which are approximately 6 nm in exponentially proliferating cells grown with glucose, decrease progressively to minimal levels when growth ceases or when glucose is replaced by glutamate which supports a slower rate of growth. A high level of cyclic GMP reappears in sporulating cells."
https://openalex.org/W1592011518,"Abstract Glycerol added to a transcription system containing λgal DNA and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme stimulates total RNA synthesis and replaces the requirement for cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and cAMP receptor (CRP) for promotion of gal RNA synthesis. The stimulatory effect which is proportional to the concentration of glycerol up to 20% (v/v) occurs at the level of preinitiation complex formation. In stimulating gal transcription, glycerol appears to act at or close to the same site as cAMP and CRP because: (a) glycerol has little effect on gal transcription at saturating levels of cAMP and CRP; (b) although glycerol stimulates transcription from λgal DNA bearing revertible gal promoter mutations, transcription from DNA containing a gal promoter deletion is not stimulated; (c) glycerol stimulation of gal promoter mutants is inhibited by cAMP and CRP; and (d) with either glycerol or cAMP and CRP, transcription of the promoter-proximal galE region precedes transcription of the galKT region. The effect of glycerol on λ early transcription is to stimulate early r-strand RNA synthesis but not early l-strand RNA synthesis. However, if the DNA template contains a defective λsex promoter, the decreased levels of early l-strand RNA are restored to normal by glycerol. Ethylene glycol, dimethylsulfoxide, sucrose, and 1,3-propanediol, all of which lower the Tm of DNA, also stimulate both total RNA and gal RNA synthesis. Furthermore, the glycerol-promoted formation of the gal preinitiation complex is strongly dependent on the preincubation temperature. At lower temperatures, complex formation requires increased glycerol or decreased KCl concentrations. These findings suggest that glycerol may act by melting or changing the conformation of the DNA promoter regions."

However, when assayed by blood glucose lowering in the guinea pig, guinea pig insulin has a potency of 8.5 to 9.0 i.u. per mg. The low activity in vitro was not due to a more rapid degradation of guinea pig insulin by the rat tissues. The dose-response relationship in the isolated epididymal fat cell assay showed that guinea pig insulin had an intrinsic biological activity comparable to that of bovine insulin, but a reduced affinity for the tissue receptor sites."
https://openalex.org/W1555225139,"Abstract When freshly isolated chick embryo tendon fibroblasts were incubated at 37° with [14C]proline and 0.5 mm α,α'-dipyridyl, a ferrous iron chelator which inhibits prolyl hydroxylase, the labeled unhydroxylated procollagen molecules accumulated intracellularly. When pepsin digestion at 15° was used as an enzymatic probe of conformation, these molecules were shown to be non-triple helical, indicating that hydroxylation of proline is necessary for triple helix formation at normal body temperatures. When cells which had accumulated unhydroxylated procollagen at 37° were then incubated at 25°, large amounts of unhydroxylated procollagen were secreted into the medium. Although these secreted molecules were sensitive to pepsin they were shown to be largely triple helical when prolyl hydroxylase was used as another probe of collagen conformation. The retained molecules were shown to be largely non-triple helical by this same test. This result suggests that triple helix formation may be necessary for normal secretion of procollagen by these cells. When cells which had accumulated unhydroxylated procollagen at 37° were then incubated at different temperatures between 20° and 37° in the presence of excess ferrous iron to reverse the inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase, the accumulated molecules were secreted and the extent of hydroxyproline formation increased as the temperature during the reversal period increased. At 20° less than 1% of the [14C]proline in the secreted molecules was hydroxylated while at 37° this value increased to 33%. This result implies that under some conditions the body temperature of an organism may in part regulate the hydroxyproline content of the collagen molecules."

https://openalex.org/W16442175,"Abstract Initiator methionine tRNA (tRNA1Met) species from wheat embryo has been purified by fractionation on a benzoylated DEAE-cellulose column followed by chromatography on a DEAE-Sephadex column. Transfer RNA1Met can be aminoacylated by the homologous enzyme as well as by Escherichia coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Unlike other eukaryotic cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs, the wheat embryo initiator tRNA cannot be formylated by E. coli transformylase. Amino acid incorporation studies in vitro using a wheat embryo ribosomal system and poly[r(A-U-G)] as messenger show that at low Mg2+ concentration polymethionine synthesis from Met-tRNA2Met (chain propagator species) is dependent on the presence of Met-tRNA1Met. Met-tRNA1Met cannot insert methionine internally in the homologous system but in a heterologous E. coli or rabbit reticulocyte ribosomal system Met-tRNA1Met appears to donate methionine into internal positions of the polypeptide chain. Analysis of oligonucleotides produced by digestion of tRNA1Met with ribonuclease T1 shows that the 5'- and 3'-terminal nucleotide sequences are pA-U-C-A-G- and A-U-A-C-A-Aoh, respectively. As in other eukaryotic cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs the tetranucleotide sequence T-ψ-C-G(A)- always present in loop IV of other tRNAs is absent. The tentative sequence of loop IV in the case of wheat embryo tRNA1Met is A-U*-C-G-m1A-A-A. Except for the presence of U* instead of U, this sequence is identical with those found in yeast, mouse myeloma, rabbit liver, and sheep mammary gland initiator tRNAs and different from that of E. coli initiator tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1516323342,"Abstract Soluble preparations of the testicular gonadotropin receptor for luteinizing hormone (LH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) exhibit a spectrum of physical characteristics according to the conditions employed for extraction with detergents. Gonadotropin receptors in particulate testis binding fractions were solubilized before or after equilibration with 125I-hCG by detergents, including Triton X-100, Lubrol PX, Lubrol WX, and sodium deoxycholate, and were shown to remain in solution after centrifugation at 350,000 x g. Characterization of such soluble receptors and hormone-receptor complexes by gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed the presence of several physical forms. In addition to the 6.5 S form of the free receptor extracted by Triton X-100, and the 7.5 S hormone-receptor complex resulting from hCG binding to free receptors extracted with Triton X-100, dialysis of the 7.5 S complex against detergent-free solutions caused reversible conversion to an 8.8 S form of the complex. Extraction of prelabeled testis particles with Triton X-100 gave only the 8.8 S complex, which aggregated reversibly upon dialysis. Lubrol PX extracts of prelabeled particles contained a 7 S complex which also aggregated during dialysis and converted to the 8.8 S form in Triton X-100. The 7 S form of the complex was also observed after extraction of labeled particles with Lubrol WX. Exposure of the soluble receptors to trypsin and phospholipase A abolished subsequent hormone binding: neuraminidase, RNase, and DNase did not reduce the uptake of 125IhCG. Phospholipase A had no effect upon preformed 7.5 S and 8.8 S hormone-receptor complexes, while phospholipase C had no effect on the 7.5 S complex and caused aggregation of the 8.8 S form. The less pronounced effects of phospholipase A on preformed hormone-receptor complexes than on unoccupied particulate or soluble receptors suggest that binding activity is influenced by an essential phospholipid component. Interpretation of the several forms of the gonadotropin receptors extracted from testis particles is complicated by the differential effects of detergent binding and molecular conformation upon sedimentation velocity during density gradient centrifugation. Because the changes in density of the complexes extracted under various conditions are not sufficient to account for the observed sedimentation behavior of the hormone-receptor complexes, it is likely that changes in the symmetry or degree of association of the complexes are responsible for the multiplicity of forms detected under different conditions of detergent extraction."
https://openalex.org/W2124464021,"Abstract Chicken liver fructose diphosphatase has been prepared in a homogeneous form. The molecular weights of the enzyme and the dissociated enzyme were determined to be 142,000 and 38,000, respectively, by a high speed sedimentation equilibrium technique and by acrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The effect of fructose diphosphatase on phosphofructokinase was investigated using purified preparations of these enzymes from chicken liver and rabbit muscle. Fructose diphosphatase enhances ATP inhibition of phosphofructokinase. However, fructose diphosphatase which had been treated with homocystine, CoA, p-chloromercuribenzoate, or iodoacetamide loses this ability to enhance the ATP inhibition of phosphofructokinase. Among various proteins examined, only fructose diphosphatase showed this effect. Phosphofructokinase shows sigmoidal kinetics with respect to fructose-6-P, but in the presence of fructose diphosphatase the sigmoidicity is increased significantly and s0.5 for fructose-6-P is increased with increasing fructose diphosphatase concentration. ATP inhibition of phosphofructokinase is less at pH 8 than at pH 7.4; however, fructose diphosphatase enhances this inhibition at pH 8. Fructose diphosphatase also increases the inhibition of phosphofructokinase by 3-P-glycerate and citrate. The molar ratios of fructose diphosphatase to phosphofructokinase which give 50% inhibition varies from 100 to 400 depending upon the sources of the enzymes. These kinetic studies suggest that fructose diphosphatase may cause conformational changes in phosphofructokinase. In order to examine a possible interaction between these enzymes, the effect of fructose diphosphatase on the fluorescence of phosphofructokinase-anilinonaphthol sulfonate complex was investigated. Adenine nucleotides quench the fluorescence of the complex, and fructose diphosphatase enhances the quenching of the fluorescence further. Homocysteine or CoA derivatives of fructose diphosphatases, however, showed no effect on the fluorescence. These fluorescence data are consistent with the kinetic results and suggest that fructose diphosphatase enhances allosteric effects of phosphofructokinase. A possible significance of these observations in the regulation of the futile cycle and also coordinated control of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1507594708,Abstract Phosphoribosyladenosine triphosphate (PR-ATP) synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium was found to undergo a slow temperature- and ligand-dependent activation. The kinetics of activation appeared first order with half-lives up to 17 min depending on the conditions. Activation by the substrate ATP diminished the extent of subsequent temperature activation. The extent of activation appeared to be independent of pH and buffer concentration over limited ranges and was reversible. Two high temperature (25–37°) states of PR-ATP synthetase having different inhibition responses toward histidine exist depending upon prior ligand action. Apparent patterns of histidine binding determined from kinetic data are similar to those determined from equilibrium data obtained by dialysis and protein fluorescence enhancement. The possible metabolic importance of the high temperature hysteretic behavior is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1544027008,"Abstract Human interferon binds to albumin-agarose at low ionic strength (0.15 m NaCl) and is still retained on the column at high ionic strength (1.0 m NaCl). Apparently, the binding is quite selective as (a) most of the proteins resident in interferon preparations are not retained on the column at low ionic strength (0.15 m NaCl), and (b) several other interferons show only slight retention (mouse L cell interferon) or no retention (mouse and rabbit serum interferons) at low ionic strength (0.15 m NaCl). Human interferon, induced either by rIn·rCn or virus, can be displaced with the polarity-reducing agent, ethylene glycol. The varied strength of binding of several interferons to albumin-agarose may provide an insight into their relative hydrophobicity."

https://openalex.org/W1555944123,"Abstract Previous studies (Kalb, A. J., and Levitzki, A. (1968) Biochem. J. 109, 669; Shoham, M., Kalb, A.J., and Pecht, I. (1973) Biochemistry 12, 1914) were interpreted as showing that transition metal and calcium ions must be bound to concanavalin A before this lectin can bind sugars. In contrast, we find that the addition of calcium ions fails to affect the following properties of manganese concanavalin A if the metalloprotein is prepared in their presence: (a) ESR spectrum of the manganese ion in the protein; (b) spin-lattice relaxation time of solvent water protons measured in the presence of the protein; and (c) spin-lattice and transverse relaxation times of the 13C carbons of α-methyl-d-glucopyranoside (uniformly enriched with 14% 13C) in the presence of manganese concanavalin A. These results indicate that saccharide binding activity of the protein is independent of calcium ion binding if a transition metal ion (Mn2+) initially binds to the protein in the presence of calcium ions. The role of calcium ion binding to concanavalin A appears to be that of accelerating the rate of formation of the final transition metal-protein complex as observed by Barber and Carver (Barber, B. H., and Carver, J. P. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3353)."
https://openalex.org/W1530745340,"In order to investigate the protein conformation in the vicinity of the heme and the spin states of the heme-iron in dissolved hemoglobins, a nitroxide spin label was covalently attached to one of the propionic acid groups of the porphyrin ring. The optical spectra of the heme-spin labeled ferrihemoglobins were identical to those of native hemoglobins indicating that the spin labeling did not affect significantly the electronic structure of the prosthetic group. The EPR spectra of the nitroxide moiety in the fluoride, cyanide, and azide derivatives of the heme-spin-labeled hemoglobin and of the corresponding acid methemoglobin in solution were not identical, suggesting that the protein conformation in the vicinity of the label is different in each of these hemoglobin derivatives. The resonance amplitude of the nitroxide in heme-spinlabeled hemoglobin was sensitively influenced by the high spin heme-iron located in the center of the porphyrin ring due to the magnetic dipolar interactions between them. The degree of the dipolar interaction depended on the magnetic moment and electron-spin relaxation time of the heme-iron, as well as the distance between the nitroxide and heme-iron. From the strength of this interaction, the distance between the heme-iron and the nitroxide radical was estimated as 11.8 A. Since the spin label attached to heme is sensitive to changes in the magnetic moment of the iron, the heme-spinlabeled ferrihemoglobin can also be used for studying the thermal equilibrium between high and low spin electronic states of the heme-iron. By comparing the nitroxide resonance amplitudes of the hydroxide form with those of the high spin acid met form and the low spin cyanide form of hemoglobin, the ratio of high to low spin components of the hydroxide was calculated as 53:47 at 0°. This ratio was increased at higher temperatures due to the shift of the equilibrium composition in favor of the high spin form. Optical and EPR spectra of free spin-labeled protohemin were also investigated. EPR spectra of protohemin were sensitive to dimer formation of hematin in aqueous alkaline solution. Two empirical indices are presented for convenient numerical expression of the mobility of a nitroxide label from its EPR line shape."
https://openalex.org/W1588869927,"Abstract The association states of phosphoribosyladenosine triphosphate synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium were studied using ultracentrifugation, gel filtration, and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. The enzyme exists predominantly as a hexamer at 25 and 37° under mild solvent conditions. At 4–7.5° it aggregates to species smaller and larger than a hexamer depending on protein concentration. High ionic strength cesium chloride at 25° leads to a species larger than the hexamer. Low ionic strength, pH 10, or aging dissociate the enzyme to a dimer. The combination of low ionic strength and pH 10 can dissociate the enzyme further to a monomer. Either of the substrates or histidine stabilizes the hexamer form of the enzyme, but sodium ion is necessary for effective stabilization by histidine. Active enzyme was shown to be a hexamer under assay conditions, even when incubated under conditions leading to indefinite aggregation prior to ultracentrifugation in assay media."
https://openalex.org/W1483280451,"Epinephrine accelerated the carrier-mediated transport of 3-O-methylglucose and galactose into avian erythrocytes. The magnitude of the effect was dependent upon the period of exposure and the concentration of epinephrine. With 0.1 m m epinephrine, 45 min were required for a significant increase in rate. After 60 min of exposure, a maximal effect was obtained with 0.4 m m epinephrine. Catechol, dopamine, norepinephrine, dl -isoproterenol, and ephedrine also increased transport rate. The stimulatory effect of epinephrine was partially blocked by desmethylimipramine and omission of extracellular potassium, but was unaffected by iproniazid (10 m m ), β-thujaplicin (0.2 m m ), propranolol (0.1 m m ), or phentolamine (0.1 m m ). Addition of a higher concentration (1 m m ) of propranolol accelerated 3-O-methylglucose transport. Cyclic adenosine 3′ : 5′-monophosphate or its dibutyryl derivative did not increase transport rate when added to the incubation medium. Addition of 1 m m propranolol lowered levels of cyclic adenosine 3′ : 5′-monophosphate in control and epinephrine-treated cells, but stimulated the control rate of sugar entry. In contrast to the stimulatory effects on transport of nonmetabolized sugars, epinephrine was ineffective in accelerating glucose uptake. Incubation of avian erythrocytes in buffer containing epinephrine, but not glucose, led to more rapid consumption of ATP, while inclusion of glucose maintained ATP levels either in the presence or absence of the catecholamine. These studies indicate that the acceleration of sugar transport in avian erythrocytes by epinephrine may be related to depletion of cellular ATP."

https://openalex.org/W1521541475,"Abstract Altered peptides from chymotryptic digests of iso-1-cytochromes c that were obtained from two revertants of the cyc1–6 mutant, one revertant of cyc1–10 mutant, and one revertant of the cyc1–15 mutant have been isolated and their amino acid sequences established. The single amino acid replacements, serine and threonine at position 12 in two of the revertant iso-1-cytochromes c, indicated that cyc1–6 is a missense mutant which contains a residue of proline at position 12 instead of the normal residue of alanine. The RNA codons for proline differ from the RNA codons of alanine, serine, and threonine by one base, indicating that the cyc1–6 mutant arose by a G·C → C·G transversion and the serine and threonine revertants were formed, respectively, by a G·C → A·T transition and a G·C → T·A transversion. The revertant from cyc1–10 contained a residue of asparagine at position 13 in place of the normal residue of threonine, and the revertant from cyc1–15 contained a residue of isoleucine at position 17 in place of the normal residue of threonine. While it has not been possible to deduce the exact nature of the mutational changes in the cyc1–10 and cyc1–15 mutants since only one altered iso-1-cytochrome c was characterized from each of these cyc1 mutants, it is clear that these replacements are not compatible with mutations by way of any of the known nonsense codons. The complete deficiency of iso-1-cytochrome c in the cyc1–10 mutant and the amino acid replacement in the revertant could be explained either by frameshift mutations, if the forward and reverse mutations occurred within a single codon, or more likely by a missense mutation that gave rise to a lysine residue at this site which is incompatible for as yet undefined steps in the attachment of the heme group. We have no simple explanation for the cyc1–15 mutation since the site of the amino acid replacement in the revertant is not compatible with the site of the mutation that was determined by genetic fine structure mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2414245105,"Abstract DPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase from bovine heart contains 6 half-cystine residues per subunit of molecular weight of 42,000. All of these residues are present as cysteine since six sulfhydryl groups per subunit can be modified by 5',5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB). Spectrophotometric measurements indicate that the modification of three thiol groups which react preferentially with DTNB is directly proportional to loss of activity, up to 70% inactivation. 2-Mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol completely restored activity of enzyme preparations where less than two sulfhydryl groups per subunit had been modified by DTNB, but less than 10% reversal was obtained when more than four sulfhydryl groups had been modified. No reversal with Na2SO3 and only partial reversal with KCN is obtained, even though both reagents release 2-nitro-5-mercaptobenzoate in stoichiometric amounts from the modified enzyme. Manganous isocitrate and, to a lesser extent, DPN+ and DPNH protect the enzyme against inactivation by DTNB. In the presence of 0.8 m (NH4)2SO4, one sulfhydryl group per subunit can be modified by DTNB and in the presence of manganous isocitrate, one additional group can be modified with full retention of activity. These results suggest that only one of the three reactive sulfhydryl groups is required for activity. The pH inactivation profile with DTNB shows that the activity-related thiol group has a pKa of 7.6. Increasing electrolyte concentration does not affect the rate of enzyme inactivation by DTNB; however, it does increase the reactivity of a sulfhydryl group which is not required for activity and decreases the protection given by manganous isocitrate. These results suggest that high salt concentrations interfere with binding of manganous isocitrate to the enzyme, possibly at an active center amino group (Fan, C. C., and Plaut, G. W. E. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 45–59). Lowering the temperature of the preincubation mixture from 23 to 0° decreases the rate of inactivation by DTNB by about 50% and almost abolishes the protection given by manganous isocitrate. In addition to DTNB, the enzyme is inactivated by p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetate, and iodoacetamide. Manganous isocitrate partially protects against inactivation by these sulfhydryl group modifying agents."
https://openalex.org/W1512367542,"Abstract Divalent anions such as sulfate, oxalate, and malonate can inhibit porcine spleen deoxyribonuclease completely. At anion concentrations 10- to 100-fold below those which inhibit, a reproducible 20% increase in activity is observed in the hyperchromicity assay of DNase II. For sulfate, half-maximal activation occurs at 6 x 10-5 m and half of complete inhibition occurs at 10-2 m. Sulfate, oxalate, and malonate also protect DNase II completely from inactivation by iodoacetate, which alkylates an essential histidine residue. The concentration of anion needed to reduce by half the rate of inactivation with iodoacetate is approximately equal to the concentration of anion needed to achieve half maximal activation. Concentrations of sulfate which activate DNase II also change the mode of cleavage of the DNA. In the presence of 5 x 10-4 m sulfate the rate of decrease in molecular weight of single-stranded, alkali-denatured DNA is increased dramatically while the rate of decrease of double strand molecular weight is unaffected. The more rapid decrease in single-stranded molecular weight with sulfate corresponds to a 15-fold increase in total phosphodiester bond cleavages. The fraction of total breaks which result in a double strand break declines from 0.80 in the absence of sulfate to 0.04 in 5 mm Na2SO4."
