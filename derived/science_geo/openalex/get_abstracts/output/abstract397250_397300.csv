https://openalex.org/W2060801754,"Schizophrenia (SCZD) is a debilitating neurological disorder with a world-wide prevalence of 1%; there is a strong genetic component, with an estimated heritability of 80-85%. Although post-mortem studies have revealed reduced brain volume, cell size, spine density and abnormal neural distribution in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of SCZD brain tissue and neuropharmacological studies have implicated dopaminergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic activity in SCZD, the cell types affected in SCZD and the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease state remain unclear. To elucidate the cellular and molecular defects of SCZD, we directly reprogrammed fibroblasts from SCZD patients into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and subsequently differentiated these disorder-specific hiPSCs into neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1). SCZD hiPSC neurons showed diminished neuronal connectivity in conjunction with decreased neurite number, PSD95-protein levels and glutamate receptor expression. Gene expression profiles of SCZD hiPSC neurons identified altered expression of many components of the cyclic AMP and WNT signalling pathways. Key cellular and molecular elements of the SCZD phenotype were ameliorated following treatment of SCZD hiPSC neurons with the antipsychotic loxapine. To date, hiPSC neuronal pathology has only been demonstrated in diseases characterized by both the loss of function of a single gene product and rapid disease progression in early childhood. We now report hiPSC neuronal phenotypes and gene expression changes associated with SCZD, a complex genetic psychiatric disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2014623973,"Enzymes catalysing the methylation of the 5-position of cytosine (mC) have essential roles in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular identity. Recently, TET1 was found to hydroxylate the methyl group of mC, converting it to 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (hmC). Here we show that TET1 binds throughout the genome of embryonic stem cells, with the majority of binding sites located at transcription start sites (TSSs) of CpG-rich promoters and within genes. The hmC modification is found in gene bodies and in contrast to mC is also enriched at CpG-rich TSSs. We provide evidence further that TET1 has a role in transcriptional repression. TET1 binds a significant proportion of Polycomb group target genes. Furthermore, TET1 associates and colocalizes with the SIN3A co-repressor complex. We propose that TET1 fine-tunes transcription, opposes aberrant DNA methylation at CpG-rich sequences and thereby contributes to the regulation of DNA methylation fidelity. The modified DNA base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), sometimes called the sixth base, is present in the mammalian genome where it is generated by oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC; the fifth base) by enzymes of the Tet family. Four papers in this issue, from the Helin, Zhang, Rao and Reik laboratories, respectively, report on the genome-wide distribution of Tet1 and/or 5hmC in mouse embryonic stem cells using the ChIP-seq technique. Links between Tet1 and transcription regulation — both activation and repression — are revealed. Anjana Rao and colleagues also describe two alternative methods with increased sensitivity for mapping single 5hmC bases. In the associated News & Views, Nathalie Véron and Antoine H. F. M. Peters discuss what these and other recent papers reveal about the role of Tet proteins in regulating DNA methylation and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2136112092,"Understanding exotic forms of magnetism in quantum mechanical systems is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics, with implications from high temperature superconductors to spintronic devices. Simulating magnetic materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally intractable on classical computers due to the extreme complexity arising from quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we employ a degenerate Bose gas confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As we vary an applied field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field which aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase the interaction dominates and produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed through both in-situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements. By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold atoms, improving our understanding of real magnetic materials."

https://openalex.org/W1999389272,"The embryonic stem cell-specific cell cycle-regulating (ESCC) family of microRNAs (miRNAs) enhances reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells. Here we show that the human ESCC miRNA orthologs hsa-miR-302b and hsa-miR-372 promote human somatic cell reprogramming. Furthermore, these miRNAs repress multiple target genes, with downregulation of individual targets only partially recapitulating the total miRNA effects. These targets regulate various cellular processes, including cell cycle, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), epigenetic regulation and vesicular transport. ESCC miRNAs have a known role in regulating the unique embryonic stem cell cycle. We show that they also increase the kinetics of mesenchymal-epithelial transition during reprogramming and block TGFβ-induced EMT of human epithelial cells. These results demonstrate that the ESCC miRNAs promote dedifferentiation by acting on multiple downstream pathways. We propose that individual miRNAs generally act through numerous pathways that synergize to regulate and enforce cell fate decisions."

https://openalex.org/W2015932693,"The protein α-synuclein has a central role in Parkinson disease, but the mechanism by which it contributes to neural degeneration remains unknown. We now show that the expression of α-synuclein in mammalian cells, including neurons in vitro and in vivo, causes the fragmentation of mitochondria. The effect is specific for synuclein, with more fragmentation by α- than β- or γ-isoforms, and it is not accompanied by changes in the morphology of other organelles or in mitochondrial membrane potential. However, mitochondrial fragmentation is eventually followed by a decline in respiration and neuronal death. The fragmentation does not require the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 and involves a direct interaction of synuclein with mitochondrial membranes. In vitro, synuclein fragments artificial membranes containing the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin, and this effect is specific for the small oligomeric forms of synuclein. α-Synuclein thus exerts a primary and direct effect on the morphology of an organelle long implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease.

In addition, the neurotoxins MPTP and rotenone, which produce models of PD, both act by disrupting mitochondrial function. Genetic evidence further supports a primary role for mitochondria in the pathogenesis of PD. Mutations in parkin and the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 both cause autosomal recessive PD (3Valente E.M.

Furthermore, duplication and particularly triplication of the SNCA (α-synuclein) gene cause a severe, highly penetrant form of PD (9Singleton A.B. Farrer M. Johnson J. Singleton A. Hague S.

However, the mechanism by which α-synuclein causes PD remains poorly understood. Expressed in yeast and Drosophila, human α-synuclein produces severe toxicity (11Feany M.B. Bender W.W.

Although the mechanism by which α-synuclein causes PD remains poorly understood, circumstantial evidence has implicated mitochondria.

Does α-synuclein influence the behavior of mitochondria? We now find that in mammalian cells, including neurons, increased expression of synuclein produces mitochondrial fragmentation, and this effect precedes any loss of mitochondrial function. Surprisingly, the fragmentation does not require the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1. Rather, it involves a novel, direct effect of oligomeric synuclein on mitochondrial membranes. All constructs used for transient transfection (except mRFP) were subcloned into the pCAGGS vector downstream of the chicken actin promoter (28Voglmaier S.M. Kam K. Yang H. Fortin D.L. Hua Z. Nicoll R.A. Edwards R.H. Neuron. 2006; 51: 71-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). mRFP was subcloned into pGW1-CMV as described previously (29Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). A30P, A53T, and E46K mutations were introduced into the human α-synuclein cDNA by PCR. Azurite was subcloned from pCEP4-Azurite (Addgene), MitoDsRed2 from pDsRed2-mito, mitoGFP from pAcGFP1-Mito, and CFP from pECFP-N3 (Clontech) after introducing the L221K mutation to prevent dimerization (30Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). mCherry was fused to the N terminus of rat synaptophysin. Human HA-Drp1 and HA-K38A Drp1 were the generous gifts from A. van der Bliek (UCLA); Mfn1–10×Myc, Mfn1(K88T)-10×Myc, Mfn2–16×Myc, and Mfn2(K109A)-16×Myc were the generous gifts from D. Chan (California Institute of Technology), and huntingtin exon 1 fused to CFP was the generous gift from J. Shao and M. Diamond (University of California, San Francisco). Silencer select pre-designed RNAi s13204, s13205, s13206, and negative control 1 were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Spontaneously immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts were derived by serial passage (over 30 times) of mouse embryonic fibroblasts from E10.5 embryos as described previously (31Wakabayashi J. Zhang Z. Wakabayashi N. Tamura Y. Fukaya M. Kensler T.W. Iijima M. Sesaki H. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). HeLa cells and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transiently transfected by electroporation (Amaxa) and COS cells by FuGENE HD. In other studies, stable HeLa cell lines expressing mitoGFP were used to identify mitochondria. One to 2 days after transfection, healthy cells with similar levels of azurite fluorescence were imaged live in Tyrode's medium (in mm: 127 NaCl, 10 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 30 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2) with a 100× oil objective on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. The images were then randomized and the prevailing mitochondrial morphology in each transfected cell was classified blind to the DNA transfected as tubular, fragmented, or intermediate. Cells classified as having tubular mitochondria contain almost entirely mitochondria with length/width (axis) ratios >10, as fragmented those containing mitochondria with axis ratio <3, and as intermediate those containing both tubular and fragmented mitochondria. Midbrain neurons were prepared from E14 embryos as described previously (32Nakamura K. Bindokas V.P. Kowlessur D. Elas M. Milstien S. Marks J.D. Halpern H.J. Kang U.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34402-34407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), transfected by electroporation at the time of plating, and imaged at 14–17 days in vitro. Length, width, axis ratio, perimeter, area, and number of distinct mitochondrial fragments were calculated from live neurons using Metamorph (Universal Imaging). For survival studies using the automated microscope, primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic day 20–21 timed pregnant rats (Charles River Laboratories), cultured in Neurobasal-A with B27 (Invitrogen) for 5 days, and transfected with calcium phosphate as described previously (33Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Cell were fixed for 30 min in media containing 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.2% Triton X-100. α-Synuclein was detected using either a mouse antibody to human α-synuclein (15G7, Axxora) or rabbit antibody to all the synuclein isoforms (AB5464, Chemicon), endoplasmic reticulum with a monoclonal antibody to the KDEL receptor (SPA-827, StressGen), peroxisomes with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to PMP70 (P0497, Sigma), cytochrome c with a mouse antibody (556432, BD Biosciences), the Golgi complex with a mouse antibody to GM130 (610822, BD Biosciences), lysosomes with a mouse antibody to CD107a (Lamp-1, 555798, BD Biosciences), and the microtubule cytoskeleton with an antibody to α-tubulin (Oncogene Science). Cells were treated for 1 h with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) (1 nm) and imaged in Tyrode's medium containing TMRM. In selected experiments, cells were subsequently depolarized using 2.5 μm FCCP. For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), the cells were incubated 1 h with TMRM in the presence or absence of 5 μm FCCP, harvested in PBS containing 0.5% FBS, and sorted on an LSR-II (BD Biosciences), with GFP excited by a 20-milliwatt blue solid state 488 nm laser and TMRM by a 150-milliwatt green 532 nm laser. Live cells were exposed acutely to hydroethidium (3.2 μm), and the relative superoxide levels determined by the initial rate of increase in ethidium fluorescence, fit by linear regression as described previously (32Nakamura K. Bindokas V.P. Kowlessur D. Elas M. Milstien S. Marks J.D. Halpern H.J. Kang U.J. J. Biol.

At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 1 μm calcein green (to assess live cells) and either immediately with 5 μm ethidium (to assess dead cells) or after 30 min of incubation with 70% methanol (to assess total cells), and the fluorescence was quantified using a 96-well fluorescent plate reader. For the analysis of cell survival, images were taken at 24-h intervals using an automated microscope (29Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 34Arrasate M. Finkbeiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3840-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), with image acquisition and analysis using ImagePro Plus 6.2 and with custom-designed programs. Transfected neurons were selected for analysis based on fluorescence intensity and morphology, including the presence of extended processes at the start of the experiment. Survival time was determined as the last time point at which the neuron was seen alive (supplemental Fig. S8). For statistical analysis, StatView software was used to construct Kaplan-Meier curves from the survival data. Survival functions were fitted to these curves and used to derive cumulative hazard (or risk of death) curves. Differences in cumulative risk of death curves were analyzed for statistical significance with the log-rank test, and each of the experiments was performed independently 2–4 times. The expression of α-synuclein was estimated by mRFP fluorescence intensity in the cell body. Images of mitochondria (visualized using mitoGFP) 48 h after transfection were randomized and classified as fragmented, intermediate, or more tubular blind to the genotype of transfection. COS cells were cotransfected with azurite, the indicated combinations of α-synuclein, Drp1, or empty vector control and either mitoGFP or MitoDsRed to label mitochondria. One day later, the cells were trypsinized, and cells expressing the same plasmids and either mitoGFP or mitoDsRed were mixed and replated. On the 2nd day after transfection, the cells were preincubated with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) for 30 min and then treated with polyethylene glycol 1500 (Roche Applied Science, catalog no. 13396000) for 1 min before washing and further incubation in media with cycloheximide. Cells were fixed in media containing 4% paraformaldehyde at 4, 6.5, and 9 h after polyethylene glycol treatment. Heart cardiolipin and synthetic dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (Avanti) were mixed in the ratios indicated and the chloroform evaporated under nitrogen. The resulting lipid film was dried under vacuum for 10 min and re-hydrated to a final concentration of 5 mm in 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 150 mm potassium gluconate, and 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4 (cytosol buffer), for 30 min at room temperature. The resulting liposomes were subjected to five freeze/thaw cycles, passed 11 times through an extruder with a 1-μm pore (Avanti), stored in the dark at 4 °C under nitrogen, and used within 1 week. Recombinant human α-synuclein was expressed and purified as described (35Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Purified protein was lyophilized and stored at −80 °C. Synuclein was resuspended in cytosol buffer and incubated 15 min on ice. The solution was then centrifuged at 184,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was stored at 4 °C until use (typically within 5 days). Monomeric synuclein was isolated by size-exclusion chromatography through Sephadex G-100. To prepare intermediate oligomeric species, 140 mm protein was stirred at 600 rpm and 37 °C for 20 h and sedimented at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was separated by size-exclusion chromatography, with oligomer 1 fraction in the void volume. To prepare large oligomers and fibrils, agitation proceeded for 60 h, followed by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min to separate oligomer 2 fraction (in the supernatant, subsequently isolated by size-exclusion chromatography) from fibrils (pellet). GST-tagged monomeric mutant huntingtin (GST-Htt53Q) was a kind gift of Gregor Lotz and Paul Muchowski (Gladstone, University of California, San Francisco). Aggregation was initiated by cleavage of the GST tag with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences), and the mixture was shaken for 30 h at 700 rpm at 30 °C. Under these conditions, a mixture of oligomers and fibrils forms, as described previously (36Legleiter J. Lotz G.P. Miller J. Ko J. Ng C. Williams G.L. Finkbeiner S. Patterson P.H. Muchowski P.J. J.

Briefly 2 mg/ml purified synuclein was sedimented at three speeds (10,000, 14,000, and 20,000 rpm, AN-60 rotor) in a Beckman XL-1 ultracentrifuge for 16–20 h per speed at 20 °C, and protein concentration as a function of radius was determined by absorbance at 280 nm. Sedimentation curves were globally fit with Sedphit and Sedphat software (National Institutes of Health), using the monomer-dimer model with the dimer Kd value set to zero, and an extinction coefficient for synuclein of 5960 m−1 cm−1 (38De Franceschi G. Frare E. Bubacco L. Mammi S. Fontana A. de Laureto P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 94-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Dynamic light scattering of protein was measured with a DynaPro molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions, Lakewood, NJ) in micro quartz cuvettes with 1.5-mm path length and 12-ml volume. The samples were filtered (100 nm pore size) before use, and measurements were collected at 10-s intervals for 2–5 min. Dynamic light scattering of liposomes in “cytosol buffer” was measured in a 384-well microplate (Corning Glass) using a DynaPro plate reader (Wyatt Technology). Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using either an AKTA Prime chromatographic system equipped with a Sephadex G-100 column (0.7 × 15 cm) or a Shimadzu LC-10AD liquid chromatography system with a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). The columns were calibrated using a series of molecular weight standards: ribonuclease A (13.6 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (65 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa). The void volume was determined using blue dextran 2000 kDa. Thioflavin T fluorescence measurements were performed in semimicro quartz cuvettes (Hellma) with a 1-cm excitation light path using a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer. Spectra were recorded from 460 to 550 nm with excitation at 450 nm, increments of 1 nm, an integration time of 0.2 s, and 1-nm slits for both excitation and emission. The final concentration of thioflavin T was 20 mm, whereas protein concentrations were 100–200 nm. Data were collected on a Thermo-Nicolet Nexus 670 FTIR spectrometer equipped with MCT detector and out-of-compartment germanium trapezoidal internal reflectance element. The hydrated thin films were prepared by drying samples on the internal reflectance element under N2. Typically, 512 interferograms were co-added at 1 cm−1 resolution. Data analysis was performed using GRAMS32 (Galactic Industries). Secondary structure content was determined by curve-fitting deconvoluted spectra based on the second derivative and Fourier self-deconvolution to identify component band positions. Mice lacking α-, β-, and γ-synuclein (TKO mice) and littermate controls were produced by crossing α-β-double KO mice (The Jackson Laboratory) (39Chandra S. Fornai F. Kwon H.B. Yazdani U. Atasoy D. Liu X. Hammer R.E. Battaglia G. German D.C. Castillo P.E. Südhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were sorted for GFP expression by FACS, and cells in the top quartile for fluorescence were plated onto aclar discs, cultured for an additional 6 h, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and then processed for electron microscopy by staining in 0.2 m sodium cacodylate that contains 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferricyanide. After dehydration in EtOH and embedding in resin, 60-nm sections were examined using a FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope. Six-month-old control and transgenic mice overexpressing α-synuclein from the mThy-1 promoter (Line 61) (41Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Song D. Shults C.W. Lang I. Masliah E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 68: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and 5-month-old control and synuclein TKO mice were perfused, and the right hemibrain was postfixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 48 h, as described previously. The hemibrains were then sectioned with a vibratome at 40 μm, postfixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, treated with osmium tetraoxide, embedded in Epon araldite, and the ventral midbrain sectioned with an ultramicrotome (Leica, Germany). Grids were analyzed with a Zeiss OM 10 electron microscope (42Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Mante M. Sisk A. Masliaha E. J. Neurosci.

Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and serial electron micrographs obtained at ×5,000 and ×25,000. Approximately 100 mitochondria from the ventral midbrain were evaluated per animal to determine average diameter and distribution. For immunogold labeling, sections were mounted on nickel grids, etched, and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to α-synuclein (Millipore), followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to 10-nm Aurion ImmunoGold particles (1:50, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) with silver enhancement. A total of 125 cells were analyzed per condition. Cells were randomly acquired from three grids, and electron micrographs were obtained at a magnification of ×25,000. Liposomes were incubated in “cytosol” buffer, in the presence or absence of protein, for 5 min. A 2.5-μl sample was then applied to glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids and stained twice in freshly prepared 0.75% aqueous uranyl formate (44Ohi M. Li Y. Cheng Y. Walz T. Biol. Proced. Online. 2004; 6: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Samples were imaged using a Tecnai T12 (FEI, Netherlands) electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 filament and operated at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. UCSF Tomo (45Zheng Q.S. Braunfeld M.B. Sedat J.W. Agard D.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was used for automatic image acquisition. Liposomes were selected at random, and imaged at ×26,000 with a defocus value of −5 μm on a Gatan 4k × 4k (Gatan, Pleasanton, Ca) CCD camera. The area of individual liposomes was measured using Metamorph software. Samples were deposited on Formvar-coated 300 mesh copper grids and negatively stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate. Transmission electron micrographs were collected on a JEOL JEM-100B microscope operating with an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Typical nominal magnifications were ×75,000. Considering the specific interaction of α-synuclein with mitochondrial membranes (27Nakamura K. Nemani V.M. Wallender E.K. Kaehlcke K. Ott M. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12305-12317Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we first assessed the potential effect of synuclein on mitochondrial morphology. Using HeLa cells because of their flat shape, large size, and dispersed tubular mitochondria, we cotransfected wild type human α-synuclein with a mitochondrially targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein (mitoGFP) and the blue fluorescent protein azurite as an independent reporter for transfection. The fluorescence of azurite correlates well with the overexpression of α-synuclein detected by immunostaining fixed cells (supplemental Fig. S1A), enabling us to identify live cells expressing synuclein in an unbiased manner solely on the basis of azurite expression. The mitochondrial morphology of azurite+ cells, assessed by cotransfection with mitoGFP and analyzed blind to the genotype of transfection, was then classified as tubular, fragmented, or intermediate. Relative to empty vector as control, the expression of α-synuclein produ"
https://openalex.org/W1972436629,"Two prominent theories for how languages evolve suggest that certain grammatical structures should be widely conserved, either because they reflect the way the brain works (Chomsky) or because they are logically connected to other structures (Greenberg). Testing these theories conclusively has been difficult without reliable information on how languages are related. Applying phylogenetic methods to more than a third of the world's 7,000 extant languages, and focusing on word order, Dunn et al. show that most seemingly universal structures are shared only between languages within the same family. This suggests that cultural evolution, rather than either of the two previous theories, explains the majority of linguistic structure. Languages vary widely but not without limit. The central goal of linguistics is to describe the diversity of human languages and explain the constraints on that diversity. Generative linguists following Chomsky have claimed that linguistic diversity must be constrained by innate parameters that are set as a child learns a language1,2. In contrast, other linguists following Greenberg have claimed that there are statistical tendencies for co-occurrence of traits reflecting universal systems biases3,4,5, rather than absolute constraints or parametric variation. Here we use computational phylogenetic methods to address the nature of constraints on linguistic diversity in an evolutionary framework6. First, contrary to the generative account of parameter setting, we show that the evolution of only a few word-order features of languages are strongly correlated. Second, contrary to the Greenbergian generalizations, we show that most observed functional dependencies between traits are lineage-specific rather than universal tendencies. These findings support the view that—at least with respect to word order—cultural evolution is the primary factor that determines linguistic structure, with the current state of a linguistic system shaping and constraining future states."
https://openalex.org/W2092672051,"Multiple comparison or alignmentof protein sequences has become a fundamental tool in many different domains in modern molecular biology, from evolutionary studies to prediction of 2D/3D structure, molecular function and inter-molecular interactions etc. By placing the sequence in the framework of the overall family, multiple alignments can be used to identify conserved features and to highlight differences or specificities. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive evaluation of many of the most popular methods for multiple sequence alignment (MSA), based on a new benchmark test set. The benchmark is designed to represent typical problems encountered when aligning the large protein sequence sets that result from today's high throughput biotechnologies. We show that alignmentmethods have significantly progressed and can now identify most of the shared sequence features that determine the broad molecular function(s) of a protein family, even for divergent sequences. However,we have identified a number of important challenges. First, the locally conserved regions, that reflect functional specificities or that modulate a protein's function in a given cellular context,are less well aligned. Second, motifs in natively disordered regions are often misaligned. Third, the badly predicted or fragmentary protein sequences, which make up a large proportion of today's databases, lead to a significant number of alignment errors. Based on this study, we demonstrate that the existing MSA methods can be exploited in combination to improve alignment accuracy, although novel approaches will still be needed to fully explore the most difficult regions. We then propose knowledge-enabled, dynamic solutions that will hopefully pave the way to enhanced alignment construction and exploitation in future evolutionary systems biology studies."
https://openalex.org/W2027583609,"Histone modifications and DNA methylation represent two layers of heritable epigenetic information that regulate eukaryotic chromatin structure and gene activity. UHRF1 is a unique factor that bridges these two layers; it is required for maintenance DNA methylation at hemimethylated CpG sites, which are specifically recognized through its SRA domain and also interacts with histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) in an unspecified manner. Here we show that UHRF1 contains a tandem Tudor domain (TTD) that recognizes H3 tail peptides with the heterochromatin-associated modification state of trimethylated lysine 9 and unmodified lysine 4 (H3K4me0/K9me3). Solution NMR and crystallographic data reveal the TTD simultaneously recognizes H3K9me3 through a conserved aromatic cage in the first Tudor subdomain and unmodified H3K4 within a groove between the tandem subdomains. The subdomains undergo a conformational adjustment upon peptide binding, distinct from previously reported mechanisms for dual histone mark recognition. Mutant UHRF1 protein deficient for H3K4me0/K9me3 binding shows altered localization to heterochromatic chromocenters and fails to reduce expression of a target gene, p16INK4A, when overexpressed. Our results demonstrate a novel recognition mechanism for the combinatorial readout of histone modification states associated with gene silencing and add to the growing evidence for coordination of, and cross-talk between, the modification states of H3K4 and H3K9 in regulation of gene expression.

Histone modifications and DNA methylation represent two layers of heritable epigenetic information that regulate chromatin structure and gene activity in eukaryotic organisms. Methylated DNA sequences are generally associated with long term transcriptional silencing through the recruitment of repressor complexes, including methyl-binding proteins, histone deacetylases, and chromatin remodeling machinery (1Denslow S.A.

Likewise, specific histone methylation states can recruit multivalent adaptor proteins, which lead to chromatin condensation, further inhibiting gene expression. Accumulating evidence shows that these two methylation systems act cooperatively to establish the epigenetic state of the cell (3Bartke T. Vermeulen M. Xhemalce B. Robson S.C. Mann M. Kouzarides T.

In addition to the SRA domain, UHRF1 contains other conserved domains (see Fig. 1a), including a ubiquitin-like domain (ubl), a plant homeobox domain (PHD) that has been implicated in the UHRF1 binding to both DNA methyltransferase 1 (6Bostick M. Kim J.K. Estève P.O. Clark A. Pradhan S. Jacobsen S.E. Science. 2007; 317: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) and H3K9me3 (8Karagianni P. Amazit L. Qin J. Wong J. Mol. Cell.

Here, we provide biochemical and cell-based evidence for the mechanism of the UHRF1 binding to histone H3 in which Lys-9 is trimethylated and Lys-4 is unmodified or monomethylated. Furthermore, our structural analysis revealed a novel mode of interaction enabling combinatorial readout of a multivalent state within a single H3 tail. The cDNA-encoding residues 121–286 of the human UHRF1 protein was cloned into a modified pET28a bacterial expression vector encoding an N-terminal hexahistidine fusion protein with a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. Mutated cDNAs were made by using QuikChange II XL Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene); mutations were confirmed by sequencing complete cDNAs. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) grown in Terrific Broth in the presence of 50 μg/ml of kanamycin and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside. The protein was purified using affinity, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography, with details provided in the supplemental material. Note that the protein was not stable at low salt concentrations; thus, for binding assays and structure determination, buffers contained at least 250 mm NaCl. Details of sample preparations for crystallographic, solution NMR, and small angle x-ray scattering studies are provided in the Supplementary Information section. Peptides used for NMR, crystallization and small angle x-ray scattering were purchased in purified form from Tufts University Core Services (Boston, MA). Two peptides were used for these studies, the peptide TARK(me3)ST corresponding to the N-terminal histone H3 residues 6–11, hereby referred to as “short peptide” or H3K9me3, and the peptide ARTKQTARKme3ST corresponding to the histone H3 residues 1–11, also referred to as the long or H3K4me0/K9me3 peptide. Crystals of the selenomethionine derivative of UHRF1 tandem Tudor domain (TTD) were grown at 18 °C using the hanging drop method by mixing 1:1 (v/v) of 23 mg/ml protein solution with a well solution consisting of 10% PEG 8000, 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine. The crystals were cryoprotected by immersion in the well solution mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a water solution of 20% (w/v) sucrose, 4% (w/v) glucose, 18% (v/v) glycerol, and 18% (v/v) ethylene glycol, frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Data from crystals of the selenomethionine derivative of the UHRF1 TTD were collected at NSLS beamline X29 at the selenium peak wavelength (0.97942 Å) and processed using the HKL2000 program suite (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromolecular Crystallography, Pt A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Solve and Resolve were used to locate the selenium substructure and to build the initial model (18Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

A second data set collected on beamline GM/CA-CAT 23ID-B at the Advanced Photon Source at 1.0000 Å, which extended to higher resolution and with greater completeness, was used for the final refinement of the structure. Data from crystals of selenomethione labeled UHRF1 TTD that had been soaked with a six-residue peptide from H3 (TARKme3ST) were collected at SBC-CAT 19ID at the Advanced Photon Source at 0.99987 Å and processed using HKL2000. Data from all crystals was collected at 100 K. Manual model building was carried out using the graphics program Coot (20Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out for both the apo and complex structures using the CCP4 program REFMAC (21Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). In the later stages of refinement, translation libration screw motion (TLS) and restrained refinement was carried out, with the initial TLS parameters obtained from the TLS motion determination (TLSMD) web server (22Painter J. Merritt E.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 109-111Crossref Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The MolProbity Ramachandran plot showed that 97.58 and 93.23% of the residues were in the most favored region for apo and liganded structures, respectively, whereas the rest were in the allowed region. Peptides were synthesized directly on a modified cellulose membrane with a polyethylglycol linker using the peptide synthesizer MultiPep (Intavis). The binding reaction was initially performed using a library of 580 membrane-immobilized peptides corresponding to control peptides and 8–14-residue-long stretches of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 sequences with either nonmodified or variously modified arginine, lysine, serine, and threonine residues (one modified residue per peptide) as described previously (23Nady N. Min J. Kareta M.S. Chédin F. Arrowsmith C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 305-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The subsequent peptide libraries were designed specifically to test the binding preference of UHRF1 TTD domain to H3K4 and K9 marks. For fluorescence polarization (FP) studies, peptides indicated in the figures were synthesized, N-terminally labeled with fluorescein, and purified by Tufts University Core Services (Boston, MA). Binding assays were performed in a 10-μl volume at a constant labeled peptide concentration of 36 nm, and the protein was used at concentrations at saturation ranging between 800 and 1300 μm in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, 0.01% Tween 20. FP assays were performed in 384-well plates using Synergy 2 microplate reader (BioTek). The excitation wavelength of 485 nm and the emission wavelength of 528 nm were used. The data were corrected for background of the free labeled peptides. To determine Kd values, the data were fit to a hyperbolic function using Sigma Plot software (Systat Software, Inc.). The Kd values represent averages ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments. Chemical shift mapping on the UHRF1 TTD domain was done by monitoring the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the uniformly 15N-labeled TTD domain alone (0.45 mm) and with an excess of unlabeled interacting short or long H3 peptides. Aliquots of unlabeled peptides were titrated into the labeled TTD domain in molar ratio 1:35 for the short peptide and 1:5 for the long peptide until no further changes in chemical shifts were detected in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. The HSQC spectra were recorded at 25 °C in 20 mm NaPi, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm PMSF and supplemented with 10% (v/v) D2O on a Bruker Avance 800-MHz spectrometer. Composite chemical shift perturbation values shown were calculated using the equation Δcomp = (Δδ2HN + (ΔδN/6.5)2)½. The dissociation constant Kd was estimated by fitting the observed chemical shift changes for selected residues to the following equation, Δ = Δmax ([L]T + [P]T + Kd − (([L]T + [P]T + Kd)2 − 4[L]T [P]T)½)/(2[P]T), in which Δ is the observed chemical shift change at a given total ligand concentration ([L]T), Δmax is the change in chemical shift at saturation, and [P]T is the total protein concentration. Data were fitted using GraphPad Prism software. For structure determination, NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Varian INOVA 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with triple resonance probe and Bruker Avance 600- and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with cryoprobes. NMR data were collected at high resolution from nonlinearly sampled spectra and processed using multidimensional decomposition (24Gutmanas A. Jarvoll P. Orekhov V.Y. Billeter M. J. Biomol.

NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar). The data were analyzed with NMRView and Sparky software (27Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco2006Google Scholar). The details of structure calculation are indicated in the supplemental material. Dipolar couplings were measured on isotropic and anisotropic sample containing 0.6 mm 15N,13C-labeled TTD protein and 3 mm unlabeled H3K4me0/K9me3 peptide. 15N-1HN residual dipolar couplings were extracted from two-dimensional in-phase/anti-phase (IPAP) 15N-1HN HSQC spectra (28Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Pulse sequences that were used for measurement of 13C′-13Ca couplings have been described earlier (29Mittermaier A. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6892-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Pulse sequences for 15N-13C′ are courtesy of Lewis Kay. The aligned sample from which 15N-1HN, 15N-13C′, and 13C′-13Ca RDCs were extracted contained 3.3% final sample volume of C12E5 PEG/hexanol medium (deuterium splitting, 13.2 Hz; line width, 1.5 Hz) (30Rückert M. Otting G. JACS. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar), and 219 couplings were used. The aligned sample, from which 15N-1HN RDCs were extracted, contained total volume 6% C12E5 PEG/hexanol medium (deuterium splitting, 25 Hz; line width, 1.8 Hz) (30Rückert M. Otting G. JACS. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar), 102 couplings were used, and another sample was prepared by adding 10 mg/ml Pf1 bacteriophage (deuterium splitting, 12 Hz; line width, 1.7 Hz) (31Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), and 95 couplings were used. FuDA software was used to extract peak shape and intensity parameters from J-evolution 15N-13C′, and 13C′-13Ca RDCs. Another set of 15N-1HN residual dipolar couplings was measured on isotropic and anisotropic sample containing only 0.6 mm 15N,13C-labeled TTD protein. The aligned sample contained 3.2% final sample volume of C12E5 PEG/hexanol medium (deuterium splitting, 16 Hz; linewidth, 1.8 Hz) (30Rückert M. Otting G. JACS. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar); 73 couplings were used. To obtain goodness of fit (Q) values for experimental RDC values with theoretically back-calculated values for the apo crystal structure and complex (TTD/H3K4me0K9me3) NMR structures, the data were analyzed using PALES (33Zweckstetter M. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The plots were produced with MODULE (version 1.0) (34Dosset P. Hus J.C. Marion D. Blackledge M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Np95−/− ES cells and their wild-type counterpart (E14) were a kind gift from Drs. Haruhiko Koseki and Masahiro Muto. Cells were grown as described (6Bostick M. Kim J.K. Estève P.O. Clark A. Pradhan S. Jacobsen S.E. Science. 2007; 317: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) and passaged every other day. The overall growth characteristics of the stably expressing cells were not significantly different from the parent Np95−/− cells or from the wild-type E14 cells. Expression vectors carried the mUhrf1 cDNA under a cytomegalovirus early enhancer element and chicken β-actin promoter (CAG) promoter. The mUhrf1 cDNA was preceded immediately by an in-frame hemagglutinin (HA)-encoding sequence, thus leading to the expression of an N-terminal HA-tagged UHRF1 protein. An internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-puromycin cassette was inserted immediately downstream of the Uhrf1 coding sequence and allowed selection of UHRF1-expressing clones through puromycin selection. Cells were transfected using TurboFect (Fermentas) and selected with 1 μg/ml of puromycin starting 36–48 h post-transfection. Clones were picked after 14 days under selection and expanded. Expression levels were determined by Western blots. Transfection of the cells with mUHRF1F148A mutant was similarly performed. The relative expression levels of the wild-type and mutated mUHRF1 proteins were similar to each other and comparable with the expression levels of the endogenous UHRF1 protein in E14 cells as assayed by quantitative Western blots using a direct anti-UHRF1 monoclonal antibody (1RC1C-10). Close examination of the Np95−/− cell line revealed that an unexpected splicing event from exons 1 to 8, which immediately flank the region that was targeted for gene replacement, drives the production of a truncated UHRF1 protein lacking coding exons 2 to 7 (supplemental Fig. S9). This truncated UHRF1 remnant, referred to as UHRF1Δ(2–7), lacks the ubiquitin-like domain, TTD, and PHD domains, but still carries intact SRA and RING domains. Due to the presence of the SRA domain, it is likely that UHRF1Δ(2–7) can bind to hemimethylated DNA. Thus, the Np95−/− cell line is not well suited for analyzing the role of UHRF1 in maintenance DNA methylation. The reintroduced UHRF1 proteins carried an N-terminal HA epitope tag allowing for discrimination between the transgene and endogenous UHRF1Δ(2–7). For immunocytochemistry, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips coated with 0.1% gelatin. After 24 h of growth, the cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were then incubated in blocking buffer (3% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20, 4× SSC) for 20 min and immunostained with a rabbit anti-H3K9me3 antibody (Millipore catalog no. 07-523) at a 1:1000 dilution and with a mouse anti-HA antibody (Covance, MMS-101P) at a 1:750 dilution, and both were diluted in blocking buffer. The cells were further washed in blocking buffer and immunostained with Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, A21430) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, A11017) secondary antibodies. The cells were again washed in blocking buffer and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, H-1200). The slides were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope, and the images were processed using NIH ImageJ software (35Abramoff M.D. Magalhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics International. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). For the co-localization analysis, background was subtracted using Wright Cell Imaging Facility (WCIF) ImageJ, nuclei with adequate HA staining were identified using the Nucleus Counter plug-in and were then processed with the Intensity Correlation Analysis plug-in (36Li Q. Lau A. Morris T.J. Guo L. Fordyce C.B. Stanley E.F. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4070-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Immortalized human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVTs-SM1) were generated as described elsewhere (37Achour M. Jacq X. Rondé P. Alhosin M. Charlot C. Chataigneau T. Jeanblanc M. Macaluso M. Giordano A. Hughes A.D. Schini-Kerth V.B. Bronner C. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2187-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and subcultured in DMEM containing 15% FCS supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and 80,000 cells/well in 24-well plates according to the manufacturer's protocols. All experiments described were carried out on cells 24 h after cell transfections with the vector (12 μg/ml). Mutant full-length human UHRF1 cDNAs, cloned into the pCR-BluntIITOPO, were amplified by PCR using high fidelity Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) and oligonucleotides flanked with the EcoRI (5′) and XhoI (3′) sites. The PCR products were digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes and further cloned into the pCMV2c vector (Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain FLAG-tagged UHRF1 wild-type and mutants. All of the constructs were verified by sequencing (Proteogenix, Oberhausbergen, France). Whole-cell extract preparations were described elsewhere (37Achour M. Jacq X. Rondé P. Alhosin M. Charlot C. Chataigneau T. Jeanblanc M. Macaluso M. Giordano A. Hughes A.D. Schini-Kerth V.B. Bronner C. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2187-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Proteins (4 μg) from cell lysates were loaded on one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, 8% for the detection of UHRF1 and 15% for p16INK4A. Blots were probed with monoclonal anti-UHRF1 (0.2 μg/ml) or polyclonal anti-p16INK4A (1:200) antibodies. The anti-UHRF1 antibody was engineered as described elsewhere (38Hopfner R. Mousli M. Jeltsch J.M. Voulgaris A. Lutz Y. Marin C. Bellocq J.P. Oudet P. Bronner C. Cancer. Res. 2000; 60: 121-128PubMed Google Scholar), whereas anti-p16INK4A antibody was obtained from DeltaBiolabs (Gilroy, CA). Secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilution. Signals were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). To understand the mechanism by which UHRF1 recognizes H3K9me3, we screened SPOT-blot histone peptide arrays (23Nady N. Min J. Kareta M.S. Chédin F. Arrowsmith C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 305-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with recombinant UHRF1 and its domains (Fig. 1, a and b). In agreement with previous studies (8Karagianni P. Amazit L. Qin J. Wong J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 705-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 13Citterio E. Papait R. Nicassio F. Vecchi M. Gomiero P. Mantovani R. Di Fiore P.P. Bonapace I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), full-length UHRF1 bound to H3K9me3-containing peptides. However, in contrast to earlier reports (8Karagianni P. Amazit L. Qin J. Wong J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 705-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), the PHD, SRA, or tandem PHD-SRA domains did not interact. Recombinant protein encompassing the region between residues 121 and 286 showed robust binding to methylated H3K9me peptides in SPOT-blot screens, but not to other methyl histone marks, consistent with a recent report (39Rottach A. Frauer C. Pichler G. Bonapace I.M. Spada F. Leonhardt H. Nucleic. Acids. Res. 2010; 38: 1796-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). FP studies using labeled H3K9me3 peptides (residues 1–12 of H3) confirmed the SPOT-blot results, showing no interaction with either SRA, PHD, or tandem PHD-SRA domains, whereas the conserved, and until recently uncharacterized region corresponding to residues 121–286 showed reproducible and robust binding (Fig. 1c). Further FP experiments confirmed that this domain favored binding to trimethylated Lys-9 H3 peptide compared with peptides corresponding to lower Lys-9 methylation states (Fig. 1d). We determined the 2.4 Å crystal structure of residues 126–285 of human UHRF1 (PDB code 3DB4, Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1) revealing a tightly packed pair of Tudor domains (40Hashimoto H. Horton J.R. Zhang X. Cheng X. Epigenetics. 2009; 4: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), each with the signature five-stranded β-barrel fold seen in “Royal” family domains, many of which are involved in the recognition of methylated lysine histone marks (41Maurer-Stroh S.

The closest structural match is that between the N-terminal subdomain (residues 126–206) and the N-terminal Tudor domain of 53BP1 (PDB code 2"

Gefitinib and erlotinib, two EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been approved for non-small cell lung cancer. However, durable clinical efficacy of these EGFR inhibitors is severely limited by the emergence of acquired resistance. For example, the expression of breast cancer-resistant protein (BCRP/ABCG2) has been shown to confer acquired resistance of wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR)-expressing cancer cells to gefitinib. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. Here, we show that wtEGFR expression is elevated in the nucleus of acquired gefitinib-resistant cancer cells. Moreover, nuclear translocation of EGFR requires phosphorylation at Ser-229 by Akt. In the nucleus, EGFR then targets the proximal promoter of BCRP/ABCG2 and thereby enhances its gene transcription. The nuclear EGFR-mediated BCRP/ABCG2 expression may contribute at least in part to the acquired resistance of wtEGFR-expressing cancer cells to gefitinib. Our findings shed light on the role of nuclear EGFR in the sensitivity of wtEGFR-expressing cancer cells to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and also deciphered a putative molecular mechanism contributing to gefitinib resistance through BCRP/ABCG2 expression.

(also known as ErbB1 or HER1) of the ErbB (HER) family, plays pivotal roles in the etiology of cancer and is frequently overexpressed or aberrantly activated in many cancers and has been as an attractive target for cancer therapy (1Hynes N.E. Lane H.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2642) Google Scholar). Two small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa) and erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva), specifically and reversibly bind to the ATP binding pocket of EGFR and thereby inhibit tyrosine kinase activity and downstream survival signals of EGFR. Although EGFR is overexpressed in many cancer types, these two agents showed more dramatic efficacy and clinical benefits for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, particularly those characterized as East Asian, non-smoker, adenocarcinoma histological type, and female gender. The encouraging responses in these selected NSCLC patients to EGFR inhibitors show strong association with specific activating mutations within the EGFR-tyrosine kinase domain (2Lynch T.J. Bell D.W.

These observations indicate that EGFR mutations may not be the only determinant for the sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and that using these mutations as single criteria for receiving EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy may exclude a significant population of patients who may otherwise receive clinical benefit.

Aside for these studies, the underlying mechanisms of the sensitivity to gefitinib in wtEGFR-expressing cancer cells are still largely unknown.In addition to its downstream signaling, EGFR has been identified in the nucleus and associates with specific functions, including gene transcription (19Xie Y.

A study recently showed that increased nuclear expression of EGFR conferred acquired resistance to EGFR antibody cetuximab in NSCLC cancer cells (27Li C. Iida M. Dunn E.F. Ghia A.J. Wheeler D.L. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), bolstering the nuclear functions of EGFR in drug resistance. Importantly, EGFR was reported to be internalized and located in the perinuclear region of gefitinib-resistant cancer cells (13Nishimura Y. Yoshioka K. Bereczky B. Itoh K. Mol. Cancer. 2008; 7: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Kwak E.L. Sordella R. Bell D.W. Godin-Heymann N. Okimoto R.A. Brannigan B.W. Harris P.L. Driscoll D.R. Fidias P. Lynch T.J.

However, it still remains unclear whether nuclear localization of EGFR plays a role in the development of acquired gefitinib resistance.In this study, using wtEGFR-expressing and gefitinib-sensitive A431 and its derived gefitinib-resistant (A431/GR) cell lines as the assay model (16Guix M. Faber A.C. Wang S.E. Olivares M.G. Song Y. Qu S. Rinehart C. Seidel B. Yee D. Arteaga C.L. Engelman J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2609-2619PubMed Google Scholar), we observed an increased accumulation of EGFR in the nucleus of A431/GR and other gefitinib-treated cell lines, and this required Akt-mediated EGFR phosphorylation at Ser-229. Moreover, nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) in A431/GR cells targeted the BCRP/ABCG2 promoter and enhanced its transcriptional expression. As expression of BCRP/ABCG2 has been implicated in gefitinib resistance in breast cancer cells harboring wtEGFR, our findings here suggest that nEGFR-mediated activation of BCRP/ABCG2 gene expression is one of the mechanisms through which cells acquire gefitinib resistance.DISCUSSIONEGFR nuclear localization is induced rapidly and transiently within 2 h of EGF stimulation (48Hsu S.C. Hung M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10432-10440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The coat protein complex I (COPI)-mediated retrograde trafficking from the Golgi to the ER has been shown to regulate EGF-induced EGFR nuclear transport (50Wang Y.N. Wang H. Yamaguchi H. Lee H.J. Lee H.H. Hung M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 399: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Unlike the transient nuclear localization by EGF stimulation, EGFR is steadily present in the nucleus under conditions such as chemoresistance (51Hsu S.C. Miller S.A. Wang Y. Hung M.C. Am. J. Transl. Res. 2009; 1: 249-258PubMed Google Scholar), radioresistance (26Dittmann K. Mayer C. Fehrenbacher B. Schaller M. Raju U. Milas L. Chen D.J. Kehlbach R. Rodemann H.P. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3944-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), which all share a common mechanism of resistance that is mediated by elevated or continuous activation of Akt survival signaling (53Huang W.C. Hung M.C. J. Formos. Med. Assoc. 2009; 108: 180-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although EGFR is suppressed by gefitinib, the compensatory and continuous activation of PI3K/Akt by enhancing insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling has also been shown to contribute to the acquired gefitinib resistance in wtEGFR-expressing cancer cells (16Guix M. Faber A.C. Wang S.E. Olivares M.G. Song Y. Qu S. Rinehart C. Seidel B. Yee D. Arteaga C.L. Engelman J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2609-2619PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, increased activity of insulin-like growth factor receptor through down-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins maintains PI3K/Akt-mediated survival signaling in response to acquired gefitinib resistance in gefitinib-sensitive and wtEGFR-expressing cancer cells (16Guix M. Faber A.C. Wang S.E. Olivares M.G. Song Y. Qu S. Rinehart C. Seidel B. Yee D. Arteaga C.L. Engelman J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2609-2619PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cappuzzo F. Toschi L. Tallini G.

These findings suggest that Ser-229 phosphorylation by continuously activated Akt may function as a common mechanism to regulate EGFR nuclear transport and likely contribute to resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cetuximab, and gefitinib. Interestingly, whereas nuclear accumulation of EGFR in response to both cetuximab (27Li C. Iida M. Dunn E.F. Ghia A.J. Wheeler D.L. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and gefitinib resistance is observed in the wtEGFR-expressing cell lines, changes in the level of nEGFR was not observed in EGFR mutant-expressing cell lines in response to acquired gefitinib resistance and irradiation (supplemental Fig. S4) (26Dittmann K.

An increased level of nEGFR has been proposed to provide survival signals through induction of cyclin D1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and B-myb expressions in cetuximab-resistant cells (27Li C. Iida M. Dunn E.F. Ghia A.J. Wheeler D.L. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that nEGFR targets BCRP/ABCG2 promoter, enhances its expression transcriptionally, and contributes to gefitinib resistance (a proposed model shown in Fig. 6H). Although nEGFR can function as a transcription regulator by targeting ATRSs (49Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), it does not contain a DNA binding domain, and thus, it likely targets BCRP/ABCG2 promoter indirectly by interacting with transcription factors. Nuclear EGFR has been demonstrated to interact with STAT3, STAT5, E2F1, and RHA to regulate gene expressions (21Lo H.W. Hsu S.C. Ali-Seyed M. Gunduz M. Xia W. Wei Y. Bartholomeusz G. Shih J.Y.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16125-16130Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The human BCRP/ABCG2 promoter contains several potential binding sites for STAT5 and E2F1 that overlap with the ATRSs within the AT1 regions, suggesting that nEGFR might be recruited to BCRP/ABCG2 promoter through interaction with STAT5 or E2F1.In response to EGF stimulation, we also found that activated Akt is able to induce the EGFR phosphorylation at Ser-229 and subsequently promotes EGFR nuclear translocation to activate BCRP/ABCG2 expression in A431/GR but not in A431 cells. In addition, transient transfection of A431 cells with wtEGFR or its phosphorylation-mimicking S229D mutant did not induce BCRP/ABCG2 promoter activity (data not shown). Overexpression of EGFR S229D mutant only slightly increased the BCRP/ABCG2 level in HEK293 cells (Fig. 6G). These data suggest that transient Akt and nuclear EGFR activities may not be sufficient to induce BCRP/ABCG2 gene expression and that other mechanisms elicited by chronic gefitinib treatment remain to be explored. It is worthwhile to note that Akt has been reported to regulate BCRP/ABCG2 activity via enhancing its cell-surface display (61Takada T. Suzuki H. Gotoh Y. Sugiyama Y. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 62Bleau A.M. Hambardzumyan D. Ozawa T. Fomchenko E.I. Huse J.T. Brennan C.W. Holland E.C. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 226-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), which could indicate that continuously activated Akt in A431/GR cells likely increases BCRP/ABCG2 activity through up-regulation of its transport to the plasma membrane in addition to the nEGFR-mediated gene expression.BCRP/ABCG2 is a well recognized determinant for various types of chemoresistance (22Kuo M.T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 608: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 43Takara K. Sakaeda T. Okumura K. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that gefitinib is also a substrate of BCRP/ABCG2 at low concentrations (44Shi Z. Peng X.X. Kim I.W. Shukla S. Si Q.S. Robey R.W. Bates S.E. Shen T. Ashby Jr., C.R.

Tsukahara S. Ishikawa E. Mitsuhashi J. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). BCRP/ABCG2 expression by immunohistochemical staining was detected in 46% of treatment-naive NSCLC patients (59Yoh K. Ishii G. Yokose T. Minegishi Y. Tsuta K. Goto K. Nishiwaki Y. Kodama T. Suga M. Ochiai A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our current study further indicated that chronic treatment with gefitinib induced BCRP/ABCG2 expression through the Akt/nEGFR pathway, leading to the acquired gefitinib resistance. Consistent with our findings, Usuda et al. (18Usuda J. Ohira T. Suga Y. Oikawa T. Ichinose S. Inoue T. Ohtani K. Maehara S. Imai K. Kubota M. Tsunoda Y. Tsutsui H. Furukawa K. Okunaka T. Sugimoto Y.

Lung Cancer. 2007; 58: 296-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) observed an elevated BCRP/ABCG2 expression level in a NSCLC patient with wtEGFR expression who received gefitinib therapy. Moreover, our unpublished results also indicated that blockage of BCRP/ABCG2 activity can re-sensitize A431/GR cells to gefitinib in vitro and potentiate the therapeutic effects of gefitinib in the A431/GR xenograft mice. It would be of interest to determine the clinical implication of BCRP/ABCG2 expression in tumor tissue samples from patients with wtEGFR expressing NSCLC.In summary, our findings demonstrate that continuously activated Akt, in addition to delivering the survival signals in gefitinib-resistant cancer cells with wtEGFR expression, also phosphorylates EGFR and facilitates its nuclear transport to mediate BCRP/ABCG2 expression. Although further investigations would be required to demonstrate the clinical relevance, the link between BCRP/ABCG2 expression and nEGFR could serve as a predictor for gefitinib sensitivity, and targeting BCRP/ABCG2 may have important implications for the treatment of wtEGFR-expressing cancer types with gefitinib.

Two small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa) and erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva), specifically and reversibly bind to the ATP binding pocket of EGFR and thereby inhibit tyrosine kinase activity and downstream survival signals of EGFR. Although EGFR is overexpressed in many cancer types, these two agents showed more dramatic efficacy and clinical benefits for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, particularly those characterized as East Asian, non-smoker, adenocarcinoma histological type, and female gender. The encouraging responses in these selected NSCLC patients to EGFR inhibitors show strong association with specific activating mutations within the EGFR-tyrosine kinase domain (2Lynch T.J. Bell D.W.

Current therapy is based on a combination of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin but is not fully satisfying because numerous patients are not responding or suffer from serious side effects caused by this treatment. The development of new drugs to treat HCV infections requires a better understanding of the structural and functional features of the viral proteins and their relationships with host cell factors. The HCV genome (∼9.6 kb) encodes for a single polyprotein precursor (∼3,000 aa) that is co- and post-translationally processed by cellular and viral proteases to yield 10 mature proteins (2Appel N.

In vivo, they have been assigned numerous cellular functions, including protein folding, immune response, lipid and protein trafficking, or regulation of transcription. Initially, cyclophilins were identified as immune response modulators through their binding to cyclosporin A (CsA) (6Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar) that creates a novel molecular surface leading to inhibition of the calcineurin phosphatase. Recently, the same interaction of CsA with cyclophilins was shown to disrupt an essential role of cyclophilins in the HCV life cycle (7Nakagawa M. Sakamoto N. Tanabe Y. Koyama T. Itsui Y. Takeda Y.

The identification of mutations in NS3, a serine protease, NS5B, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and NS5A that all confer in vitro resistance to CsA or non-immunosuppressive CsA analogs, suggested that these proteins are potential cyclophilin binding partners (21Fernandes F.

Recent studies also suggested that NS2, a cysteine protease, is an additional cyclophilin target (19Kaul A. Stauffer S. Berger C. Pertel T. Schmitt J. Kallis S. Zayas M. Lopez M.Z. Lohmann V. Luban J. Bartenschlager R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000546Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 25Ciesek S. Steinmann E. Wedemeyer H. Manns M.P. Neyts J. Tautz N. Madan V. Bartenschlager R. von Hahn T. Pietschmann T. Hepatology. 2009; 50: 1638-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). NS5A mutations, mostly located in the C-terminal half of the protein, were shown to confer the highest resistance against cyclophilin inhibitors (21Fernandes F. Poole D.S. Hoover S. Middleton R. Andrei A.C. Gerstner J. Striker R. Hepatology. 2007; 46: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Puyang X. Poulin D.L. Mathy J.E. Anderson L.J. Ma S. Fang Z. Zhu S. Lin K. Fujimoto R. Compton T. Wiedmann B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 1981-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). NS5A is a 49-kDa phosphoprotein essential for RNA replication and production of HCV particles (26Appel N. Zayas M. Miller S. Krijnse-Locker J. Schaller T. Friebe P. Kallis S. Engel U. Bartenschlager R. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000035Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 27Tellinghuisen T.L. Foss K.L. Treadaway J.C. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although it has been demonstrated that NS5A has RNA-binding properties (28Huang L. Hwang J. Sharma S.D. Hargittai M.R. Chen Y.

The protein is anchored to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane via an amphipathic N-terminal α-helix (30Penin F. Brass V. Appel N. Ramboarina S. Montserret R. Ficheux D. Blum H.E. Bartenschlager R. Moradpour D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40835-40843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition, NS5A is composed of three cytoplasmic domains: NS5A-D1, -D2, and -D3, which are connected by short low complexity sequences. The structure of D1 (residues 27–213) reveals a zinc-binding domain that could adopt at least two kinds of homodimeric structures: a claw-shaped dimer that has been proposed to be properly suited for RNA binding (31Tellinghuisen T.L. Marcotrigiano J. Rice C.M. Nature. 2005; 435: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and an alternative structure (32Love R.A. Brodsky O. Hickey M.J. Wells P.A. Cronin C.N. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 4395-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) that may be required for another function of NS5A in viral RNA replication or particle formation. Despite the lack of knowledge of its precise molecular role, D1 appears to be a very promising drug target, as demonstrated by the recent development of the picomolar BMS 790052 inhibitor (33Gao M. Nettles R.E. Belema M. Snyder L.B. Nguyen V.N. Fridell R.A. Serrano-Wu M.H. Langley D.R. Sun J.H. O'Boyle 2nd, D.R. Lemm J.A. Wang C. Knipe J.O. Chien C. Colonno R.J. Grasela D.M. Meanwell N.A. Hamann L.G. Nature. 2010; 465: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). D2 of NS5A (residues 250–342) is essential for viral RNA replication (27Tellinghuisen T.L. Foss K.L. Treadaway J.C. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 34Yang F. Robotham J.M. Grise H. Frausto S. Madan V. Zayas M. Bartenschlager R. Robinson M. Greenstein A.E. Nag A. Logan T.M. Bienkiewicz E. Tang H. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001118Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), although a large segment of this domain can be deleted without detectable effects on replication and assembly (26Appel N. Zayas M. Miller S. Krijnse-Locker J. Schaller T. Friebe P. Kallis S. Engel U. Bartenschlager R. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000035Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be natively unfolded (35Hanoulle X. Badillo A. Wieruszeski J.M. Verdegem D. Landrieu I.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11550-11558Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, we showed in a recent study that NS5A-D2 from the JFH-1 strain (genotype 2a) interacts with, and is a substrate for, the PPIase of human cyclophilin A (35Hanoulle X. Badillo A.

In addition, we could correlate the CypA interaction sites with mutations in D2 that significantly influence viral RNA replication (27Tellinghuisen T.L. Foss K.L. Treadaway J.C. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and that confer resistance to cyclophilin inhibitors (14Goto K. Watashi K. Inoue D. Hijikata M. Shimotohno K. Cancer Sci. 2009; 100: 1943-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Puyang X. Poulin D.L. Mathy J.E. Anderson L.J. Ma S. Fang Z. Zhu S. Lin K. Fujimoto R. Compton T. Wiedmann B. Antimicrob.

Finally, D3 (residues 356–447) has been shown, at least in the context of the JFH-1 strain (2a), to be involved in the production and assembly of viral particles (26Appel N. Zayas M. Miller S. Krijnse-Locker J. Schaller T. Friebe P. Kallis S. Engel U. Bartenschlager R. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000035Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 38Tellinghuisen T.L. Foss K.L. Treadaway J. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000032Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Mutations that confer resistance to cyclophilin inhibitors have equally been mapped to NS5A-D3 (19Kaul A. Stauffer S. Berger C. Pertel T. Schmitt J. Kallis S. Zayas M. Lopez M.Z. Lohmann V. Luban J. Bartenschlager R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000546Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Fernandes F. Poole D.S. Hoover S. Middleton R. Andrei A.C. Gerstner J. Striker R. Hepatology. 2007; 46: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), suggesting that a cyclophilin might (directly) interact with this domain as well. We recently reported a preliminary molecular characterization of NS5A-D3 of the Con1 (1b) HCV strain and showed that this domain is globally unfolded (39Hanoulle X. Verdegem D. Badillo A. Wieruszeski J.M. Penin F. Lippens G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 381: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report a comparative biochemical and molecular characterization of NS5A-D3 from the HCV JFH-1 strain (genotype 2a) and the Con1 (1b) strain. NS5A-D3 from JFH-1 has a 20-residue insertion specific to the genotype 2, raising questions about the structural implications of this insertion. We show that although NS5A-D3 is globally unfolded, the D3 domains from both JFH-1 and Con1 HCV strains have an intrinsic propensity to adopt an α-helical fold. In addition, we investigate the functional relationships between D3 and CypA and show that CypA has in vitro PPIase activity toward some, but not all, of the peptidyl-prolyl bonds in NS5A-D3. These data provide novel insights into the structure of NS5A-D3 and suggest that the interaction with CypA might involve more than one specific NS5A domain. Sequence analyses were performed using the web site tools of Network Protein Sequence Analysis (NPSA) (40Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deléage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar) and of the European HCV Data base available at the Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Protéines. Multiple-sequence alignments and amino acid conservations were carried out with the ClustalW program using default parameters. The repertoire of residues at each amino acid position and their frequencies were computed by using the tool “Extract” in the euHCVdb (41Combet C. Garnier N. Charavay C. Grando D. Crisan D. Lopez J. Dehne-Garcia A. Geourjon C. Bettler E. Hulo C. Le Mercier P. Bartenschlager R. Diepolder H. Moradpour D. Pawlotsky J.M. Rice C.M. Trépo C. Penin F. Deléage G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D363-D366Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The synthetic sequence coding for domain 3 of NS5A from HCV JFH-1 strain (euHCVdb; GenBankTM accession number AB047639, genotype 2a) was inserted in the pT7.7 plasmid. The recombinant domain 3 (NS5A-D3 (JFH-1)) comprises residues 355–464 of HCV NS5A protein and has extra M- and -LQHHHHHH sequences at N and C termini. Expression of recombinant NS5A-D3 (JFH-1) was done in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)Star. Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium for non-labeled protein or in M9-based semirich medium (M9 medium supplemented with [15N]NH4Cl (1 g/liter), d-[13C6]glucose (2 g/liter) (when 13C labeling was required), Isogro 15N (or 13C,15N) powder growth medium (0.7 g/liter; Sigma-Aldrich), and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). When A600 nm reached ∼0.8, induction was carried out at 37 °C with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Harvested cells were lysed using lysozyme and sonication. NS5A-D3 (JFH-1) was first purified on a HisTrap column (1 ml; GE Healthcare). Selected fractions were then pooled, dialyzed again with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA overnight, and loaded on an anion exchange column (ResourceQ (1 ml), GE Healthcare). NS5A-D3 (JFH-1)-containing fractions were selected, using SDS-PAGE analysis, pooled, and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.3, 30 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine. NS5A-D3 (JFH-1) was then concentrated up to 500 μm with a Vivaspin 15 concentrator (cut-off 5 kDa) (Satorius Stedim Biotech). Following filtration at 0.2 μm, NS5A-D3 aliquots were frozen at −80 °C with a few Chelex beads (Sigma-Aldrich). Expression and purification of domain 3 of NS5A from the HCV Con1 strain (euHCVdb; GenBankTM accession number AJ238799, genotype 1b) were performed as described previously (39Hanoulle X. Verdegem D. Badillo A. Wieruszeski J.M. Penin F. Lippens G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 381: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The recombinant domain 3 (NS5A-D3 (Con1)) comprises residues 359–445 of HCV NS5A protein and has extra M- and -LQHHHHHH sequences at the N and C termini. CD spectra were recorded on a Chirascan dichrograph (Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK) calibrated with (1S)-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. Measurements were carried out at room temperature in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette, with protein concentrations ranging from 8 to 10 μm. Spectra were recorded in the 185–260-nm wavelength range with a 0.5-nm increment and a 2-s integration time. Spectra were processed, base line-corrected, and smoothed using Chirascan software. Spectral units were expressed as the molar ellipticity per residue by using protein concentrations determined from measurements of UV light absorbance of tyrosine and tryptophan at 280 nm (molar extinction coefficients of 1,536 and 5,600 m−1·cm−1, respectively). The α-helix content was estimated using the method of Chen et al. (42Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar), assuming that the residue molar ellipticity at 222 nm is exclusively due to α-helix. All of the NMR spectra used for the backbone assignment were acquired on a Bruker Avance 800-MHz spectrometer with a standard triple resonance probe (Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany). The proton chemical shifts were referenced using the methyl signal of sodium 3-trimethyl-sill-[2,2′,3,3′-d4]propionate at 0 ppm. Spectra were processed with the Bruker TopSpin software package 1.3 and analyzed using the product plane approach developed in our laboratory (43Verdegem D. Dijkstra K. Hanoulle X. Lippens G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2008; 42: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Backbone assignments were achieved using two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC and triple resonance three-dimensional 1H,15N,13C HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, and HN(CA)NNH spectra. For assignment of NS5A-D3 (JFH-1) resonances without and in the presence of 50% TFE, NMR experiments were, respectively, acquired with 500 μm 15N,13C-labeled NS5A-D3 (JFH-1) samples in 20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2PO4, pH 6.3, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine, 0.02% NaN3 with or without 50% TFE-d3 at 298 K (Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank accession numbers 16798 and 16799). Assignments of NS5A-D3 (Con1) in aqueous buffer were described in a previous study from our laboratory (39Hanoulle X. Verdegem D. Badillo A. Wieruszeski J.M. Penin F. Lippens G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 381: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank accession number 16166). Assignment of NS5A-D3 (Con1) resonances in the presence of 50% TFE were acquired on a 440 μm 15N,13C-labeled NS5A-D3 (Con1) sample in 20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2PO4 pH 6.3, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine, 0.02% NaN3, 50% TFE-d3 at 298K (Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank accession number 16800). Additional three-dimensional 1H,15N,1H NOESY-HSQC and 1H,15N,1H HNHA spectra were acquired on the NS5A-D3 samples in the presence of 50% TFE-d3, using a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic triple resonance probe head (Bruker). These experiments were used to measure distance-based (NOE) and backbone dihedral angle-based (3JHN-Hα (Hz) coupling constants) experimental restraints, respectively, on NS5A-D3 samples. Due to partial overlap in the proton dimension maximum, peak intensities rather than peak integrals were measured for NOE cross-peaks. The 3JHN-Hα coupling constants (Hz) are related to the backbone dihedral angle Φ via the Karplus equation, 3JHN-Hα = A·cos2(Φ-60) + B·cos(Φ-60) + C (where A = 6.51, B = −1.76, and C = 1.60) (44Wang A.C. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 1810-1813Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Experimental 3JHN-Hα constants were extracted from the HNHA spectra using Equation 1,IcrossIdiag=-tan2(2πJHNHαζ)Eq. 1 where Icross and Idiag represent the intensity of the cross-peak (HNHα) and of the corresponding diagonal peak (HNHN), respectively (45Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The 2ζ parameter corresponds to the total evolution time for the 3JHN-Hα coupling and was set to 26.1 ms. The PyMOL software (available on the World Wide Web) was used for molecular graphics. Three-dimensional structure calculations of NS5A-D3 (JFH-1 and Con1) in 50% TFE were done using the CNS software (46Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16991) Google Scholar). 13C chemical shift values, 3JHN-Hα coupling constant values, and a list of NOE cross-peaks (see supplemental Table 2) were used as experimental restraints using the CNS dynamical annealing protocol; about 500 structures were calculated for NS5A-D3 (JFH-1) and for NS5A-D3 (Con1). In each case, on the initial set of accepted structures that fulfill the experimental restraints, an additional round of selection was made with acceptance criteria being no distance restraint violations >0.5 Å and no 3JHN-Hα coupling constant violations of >1 Hz for the values that were <5 Hz. This stricter selection step led to 111 accepted structures for NS5A-D3 (JFH-1) and 65 accepted structures for NS5A-D3 (Con1). Finally, from these accepted ensembles, only the 20 lowest energy structures were retained for NS5A-D3 (JFH-1) and for NS5A-D3 (Con1) in 50% TFE (see statistics in supplemental Table 2). Recombinant expression and purification of human cyclophilin A were performed as described previously. Unlabeled CypA was mixed with [15N]NS5A-D3, from the JFH-1 or Con1 strain, at equimolar concentration (100 μm each), and 1H,15N HSQC spectra were acquired. Interaction was assessed by comparing the 1H,15N HSQC spectra of NS5A-D3 recorded without and in the presence of CypA and in the latter case without or with cyclosporin A. The PPIase activity of CypA toward NS5A-D3 from the JFH-1 and Con1 strains was assessed using heteronuclear 1H,15N z-exchange spectra (47Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 48Kern D. Eisenmesser E.Z. Wolf-Watz M. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 394: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 15N z-exchange spectra, with 25-, 50-, 100-, 200-, 300-, and 400-ms mixing times, were recorded in triplicate for both NS5A-D3 using a 900-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Experiments were recorded on a sample of 220 μm [15N]NS5A-D3 and 23 μm CypA and on a sample of 300 μm [15N]NS5A-D3 and 30 μm CypA. The exchange rates (kexch), as a function of mixing time (MT), were determined as described previously (35Hanoulle X. Badillo A. Wieruszeski J.M. Verdegem D. Landrieu I. Bartenschlager R. Penin F. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13589-13601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the NS5A-D3 domains shows that the sequence of JFH-1 (genotype 2a) differs by a small 3-amino acid residue insertion (positions 378–380) and a long 20-residue insertion (positions 431–450) when compared with the Con1 strain (genotype 1b) (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). The latter is located near the C terminus of the protein and is only observed in genotype 2 sequences (see supplemental Fig. 1C). Moreover, it is located within a region of high conservation in all genotypes (see supplemental Fig. 1C), arguing for an important function for the viral replication cycle. Amino acid sequence comparison also highlights additional intergenotypic conservation in the N-terminal region of NS5A-D3 (positions 363–380 in genotype 1b, supplemental Fig. 1C). Except for the conserved C-terminal residues of NS5A-D3, which are already part of the NS5A-N"
https://openalex.org/W2147891834,"Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) is a cause of food poisoning and is considered a pore-forming toxin, which damages target cells by disrupting the selective permeability of the plasma membrane. However, the pore-forming mechanism and the structural characteristics of the pores are not well documented. Here, we present the structure of CPE determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.0 Å. The overall structure of CPE displays an elongated shape, composed of three distinct domains, I, II, and III. Domain I corresponds to the region that was formerly referred to as C-CPE, which is responsible for binding to the specific receptor claudin. Domains II and III comprise a characteristic module, which resembles those of β-pore-forming toxins such as aerolysin, C. perfringens ϵ-toxin, and Laetiporus sulfureus hemolytic pore-forming lectin. The module is mainly made up of β-strands, two of which span its entire length. Domain II and domain III have three short β-strands each, by which they are distinguished. In addition, domain II has an α-helix lying on the β-strands. The sequence of amino acids composing the α-helix and preceding β-strand demonstrates an alternating pattern of hydrophobic residues that is characteristic of transmembrane domains forming β-barrel-made pores. These structural features imply that CPE is a β-pore-forming toxin. We also hypothesize that the transmembrane domain is inserted into the membrane upon the buckling of the two long β-strands spanning the module, a mechanism analogous to that of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.

The toxin consists of a single chain polypeptide of 319 amino acids. The C-terminal domain of CPE (C-CPE, residues 184–319) recognizes and binds to certain members of the claudin family, components of tight junctions, as a receptor on target cells (1Sonoda N.

It was also reported that the physiological pores are composed of a large complex comprising CPE and cellular components such as claudins (2Katahira J. Inoue N. Horiguchi Y. Matsuda M. Sugimoto N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 8Robertson S.L. Smedley 3rd, J.G. Singh U. Chakrabarti G. Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M.

The 16–17 C-terminal amino acids of C-CPE were reportedly important for the interaction (9Takahashi A. Kondoh M. Masuyama A. Fujii M. Mizuguchi H. Horiguchi Y. Watanabe Y. J. Control.

According to the crystal structure of C-CPE (14Van Itallie C.M. Betts L. Smedley 3rd, J.G. McClane B.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 268-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), these residues organize a cleft space that is considered to interact directly with claudins. Claudins are tetratransmembrane proteins. The region of claudins responsible for binding to CPE was located on the C-terminal side of the second extracellular loop and recently designated CPE-SR for CPE sensitivity-related region (15Kimura J. Abe H. Kamitani S. Toshima H. Fukui A. Miyake M. Kamata Y. Sugita-Konishi Y. Yamamoto S. Horiguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 401-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The bottom of the cleft space of CPE is negatively charged, whereas the CPE-SRs of CPE-sensitive claudins are positively charged. Therefore, it was proposed that electrostatic attraction at least partly contributes to the mutual interaction. In fact, some members of the claudin family, the CPE-SR of which did not show an apparent negative charge, are insensitive to CPE (15Kimura J. Abe H. Kamitani S. Toshima H. Fukui A. Miyake M.

In contrast to the binding of CPE to claudins, the complex that makes the physiological pores remains little understood. Some electron microscopic techniques and/or analyses of crystal structures have provided insight into construction of the physiological pores made of aerolysin (16Iacovache I. Paumard P. Scheib H.

In contrast, there is no report regarding microscopic observations of the CPE complex on the plasma membrane and molecular structure of the full-length CPE. Here, we describe the structure of CPE solved by x-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.0 Å. Our results show that CPE shares features in common with aerolysin, C. perfringens ϵ-toxin, and Laetiporus sulfureus hemolytic pore-forming lectin, implying that CPE organizes transmembrane pores via the similar mechanism adopted by these toxins. The CPE gene was amplified by PCR with the following primer pair: NcoCPE 5′-aaaaccatggcgATGCTTAGTAACAATTTAAATC-3′ (including a NcoI site (underlined)) and CPEXho 5′-aaactcgagAAATTTTTGAAATAATATTGAATAA-3′ (including a XhoI site (underlined)) using pET16b-CPE (15Kimura J. Abe H. Kamitani S. Toshima H. Fukui A. Miyake M. Kamata Y. Sugita-Konishi Y. Yamamoto S. Horiguchi Y. J. Biol.

The CPE gene with the correct sequence was excised with NcoI and XhoI and inserted into the NcoI-XhoI site of pET28a(+) (Merck), so that the gene was fused to a His6 tag sequence on the 3′ side. The resultant plasmid was named pET28a-CPEwt. Ten milliliters of an overnight culture of Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) transformed with pET28a-CPEwt was inoculated into 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The culture was grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) to give a final concentration of 1 mm. Six hours later, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold water, suspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, including 0.3 m NaCl and 1 mm imidazole, and disrupted by sonication using Sonifier S-350 (Branson, Danbury, CT) at 4 °C. The suspension of the disrupted cells was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity gel (HIS-Select Nickel Affinity Gel; Sigma-Aldrich) chromatography, and the soluble recombinant protein was eluted with an imidazole concentration gradient (1–500 mm). The fraction containing CPE was collected and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The homogeneity of the purified preparation was confirmed by 12.5% PAGE without SDS. An 8 mg/ml solution of the recombinant C-terminally His-tagged CPE in 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was employed for crystallization. Crystallization trials were set up at room temperature as sitting-drop vapor-diffusion experiments on Linbro crystallization plates. Initial screening was performed using the sparse-matrix method with commercial crystal screening kits (Hampton Research). The crystallization droplets were made of 1 μl of the CPE solution and 1 μl of a reservoir solution containing 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m sodium chloride, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 293 K, and equilibrated with 500 μl of the reservoir solution. Triangle-shaped tabular crystals appeared in a few weeks and grew to maximum dimensions of about 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm. X-ray diffraction data on CPE crystals were collected at 100 K in a nitrogen stream, after the crystals were soaked with the reservoir solution containing 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Native data at 1.98 Å were collected from a single crystal with a Rayonix MX225HE CCD detector on the beamline BL44XU at SPring-8 (Table 1). The x-ray wavelength was 0.9 Å, the angle oscillation range was 0.5°, and the crystal-to-detector distance was 230 mm.TABLE 1Data collection, structural solution, and refinement statistics for CPEsDiffraction dataCPENative1SmCl2X-ray sourceSPring-8/BL44XUCuKαWavelength (Å)0.9001.54178Resolution (Å)1.983.1Space groupP213P213Unique reflections22,1926,058Rmerge (%)aRmerge = Σ|Ii − <Ii>|/Σ<Ii>, where Ii is the observed intensity and <Ii> is the average intensity over symmetry equivalent measurements.

Open table in a new tab More than 10 heavy-atom compounds were tested to collect diffraction data. Suitable derivatives were used such as SmCl2 (soaking concentration, 5 mm), which yielded an overall figure of merit of 0.66 at 3.1 Å by a combination of single anomalous dispersion and molecular replacement phasing (Table 1). Crystallographic phases were calculated and refined by Phaser (24McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14771) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density maps modified by Parrot (25Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) automatically allowed the tracing of about 80% of one independent molecule by Buccaneer (26Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2008; 64: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Model building and inspection were based on COOT (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates and structural factors for CPE have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with accession code 3AM2. All images of the molecular structure were prepared with PyMOL. The crystal data are shown in Table 1. Analysis of the diffraction pattern and systematic absences led to the CPE crystals being assigned to the cubic space group P213, with unit-cell parameters a = b = c = 98.5 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. A total of 22,192 unique reflections were obtained using the program packages of HKL2000 (28Otsinoski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The intensity data in the resolution range of 69.6–1.98 Å were processed with an Rmerge value of 6.9%. Assuming a molecular mass of 35 kDa for the expressed CPE, packing density calculations indicate the most probable value for VM to be 2.27 Å3 Da−1, with one CPE chain per asymmetric unit. This corresponds to a solvent fraction of about 45.9%, a typical value for protein crystals. The crystal structure of the full-length CPE was solved by a combination of single anomalous dispersion methods using samarium derivatives and molecular replacement techniques with the Lys197 to Phe319 region of C-CPE (PDB accession code 2QUO). The experimental maps calculated by the Phaser and Parrot/Bucaneer procedures were of excellent quality and allowed unequivocal tracing of the chain (residues 36–319) and subsequent refinement at a resolution of 1.98 Å. The structure was refined using REFMAC (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar); 5% of the unique reflections were used to monitor the free R-factor. The final values for the general R-factor and free R-factor were 19.3% and 25.2%, respectively (all reflections in the 69.6–1.98 Å range). The refined model consists of 286 amino acids with 136 solvent molecules and two unknown ions. Stereochemistry checks indicated that the refined model was in quite good agreement with expectations for models within this resolution range (Table 1). For N-terminal residues 1–35, electron density was not observed, implying a disordered structure. The asymmetric unit contained one CPE molecule (Fig. 1), and its trimers were generated by crystallographic symmetry (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Trimeric structure of CPE.

These results are consistent with previous data from circular dichroism spectra showing that CPE contains about 80% β-sheet (30Granum P.E. Harbitz O. J. Food Biochem. 1985; 9: 137-146Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Three distinct domains could be distinguished in the molecule and were designated domain I, domain II, and domain III as shown in Fig. 1. Domain I almost corresponds to the region referred to as C-CPE, which binds to the specific receptor claudin (2Katahira J. Inoue N. Horiguchi Y. Matsuda M. Sugimoto N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 4Horiguchi Y. Akai T. Sakaguchi G. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 2912-2915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This domain forms a nine-strand β-sandwich with a short helical element between strands β9 and β10, the fold of which is almost the same as that reported previously (14Van Itallie C.M. Betts L. Smedley 3rd, J.G. McClane B.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 268-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), except for some loop regions (residues 217–223 and 265–272). The crystal packing is, however, completely different. The major interactions in the previously determined structure mainly involve Arg227 and Ser304, whereas in the structure determined here, marked hydrophobic interactions occur between Val282 in the C-terminal region, and Phe319 in the C-terminal region of a neighboring molecule (14Van Itallie C.M. Betts L. Smedley 3rd, J.G. McClane B.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 268-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Domains II and III organize a module that shows an elongated caterpillar shape, 60 Å long and 24–28 Å thick (Fig. 1). The module is composed of 8 β-sheets, β1–β8, two α-helices, and two short 310 helical segments. Two long β-strands, β6 and β7, organize a stem that spans the entire length of the module with a slight distortion between the domains. In addition, domain II contains the largest α-helix and three β-strands that form an antiparallel sheet together with β6 and β7. Domain III contains three β-strands and three small helices in addition to β6 and β7. Although the monomer of CPE is found in the asymmetric unit in this crystal, it does form a crystallographic trimer (Fig. 2, A and B). The trimeric fold is stabilized by a number of specific interactions between each monomer. Analyses with PISA revealed major interactions between domain III and domain I of two symmetry-related molecules. The helical regions at the edges of domain III interact with the β-barrel region of domain I of an adjacent molecule. Arg208 of domain I is inserted into α2, which has negatively charged interfaces (Fig. 2C). On the other side, Phe268 of the loop connecting β13 and β14 of domain I is hydrophobically inserted into helix 310b at the edge of domain III (Fig. 2D). These two specific interactions determine the position of domain I relative to domain III. The trimeric assembly shows an apparent conduit structure in its center. Glu94 and Glu110 face the respective counterpart of each monomer and organize the narrow regions (diameter = 4.4–4.6 Å) of the conduit (Fig. 2E). Although the α1 helices of each monomer are close to each other, directed toward the conduit, there are neither α-helices nor β-sheets forming the conduit walls. Analysis of samarium-derivative datasets shows that three symmetrical side chains of Glu94 and Glu110 keep a samarium ion in each narrow region. To know whether the conduit structure is involved in the toxicity of CPE, we examined CPE mutants, in which Glu94 or Glu110 was independently replaced with Asp, Gly, Gln, Tyr, or Leu, for cytotoxicity in Vero cells. All CPE mutants were found to retain the cytotoxicity (data not shown). A DALI search for structural homologues of the full-length CPE uncovered a hemagglutinin component, HA3, of Clostridium botulinum toxin, and C. perfringens ϵ-toxin. C. botulinum HA3 is expressed as a single chain and proteolytically cleaved into HA3a and HA3b chains, both of which share homology with the N-terminal module of CPE composed of domains II and III (2ZOE-A chain, Z = 14.0; 2ZOE-B chain, Z = 10.9). BLAST also revealed the amino acid sequences of HA3a (residues 17–173, GenBank accession number D38562) and HA3b (residues 211–423, GenBank accession number D38562) to show 24 and 27% identity with CPE, residues 33–188 and 39–240, respectively. In contrast to HA3, the structural similarity of C. perfringens ϵ-toxin with CPE is low (PDB code 1UYJ, Z = 5.2). When domains II and III of CPE were subjected to the DALI search, aerolysin and L. sulfureus hemolytic pore-forming lectin (LSL) also emerged in addition to C. perfringens ϵ-toxin (Fig. 3A). The pore-forming toxins exert their toxic effects by elaborating physiological pores on the plasma membrane of target cells, resulting in changes to the membrane permeability and eventually cell lysis. These toxins are divided into two groups, α-pore-forming toxins (α-PFTs) and β-pore-forming toxins (β-PFTs), based on structural properties of transmembrane pores. The former group employs α-helices to insert into the lipid membrane, and the latter uses β-strands to fold amphipathic β-barrels in the membrane (32Geny B. Popoff M.R. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 33Gouaux E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Salmonella cytolysin A and staphylococcal δ-toxin exemplify the former (23Mueller M. Grauschopf U. Maier T. Glockshuber R. Ban N. Nature. 2009; 459: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 32Geny B. Popoff M.R. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and many other PFTs belong to the latter. Although CPE has long been believed to be a PFT, the architecture of the pore it creates has been unknown. Briggs et al. reported the preliminary crystallographic data of CPE but did not described the details (31Briggs D.C. Smedley 3rd, J.G. McClane B.A. Basak A.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In this study, we first determined the overall structure of CPE, information that then enabled us to speculate on the mechanism by which it forms pores. The structure of CPE provided several points of note. First, CPE shows a trimeric form with an apparent conduit/channel in crystal packing, which may suggest a physiological channel made by CPE as a PFT. However, it is unlikely that this conduit functions as actual transmembrane pores for the following reasons. (i) Unlike in the case of other PFTs, the conduit is not surrounded by a rigid structure such as an α-helix or β-barrel. (ii) The vertical size of the trimer containing the conduit is estimated at 52 Å at most, which is not enough to span the lipid bilayer membrane. (iii) In gel permeation chromatography, CPE eluted at a position estimated at 35 kDa, indicating the toxin to be in a monomeric state in solution (data not shown). In addition, there have been no reports to show that CPE is oligomerized in solution. (iv) Glu94 and Glu110 face the respective counterpart of each monomer and organize the narrow points in the conduit (Fig. 2E). This structure implies that these residues are critical in the function of any pores organized by the trimer. However, substitutions of these residues with Asp, Gln, Gly, Tyr, or Leu did not affect the toxicity (data not shown). (v) The conduit is organized above the receptor binding site, which is located at the bottom of domain I in the trimeric state shown in Fig. 2B. Therefore, the conduit should be positioned above the plasma membrane surface and is not able to make a transmembrane pore. (vi) Asp48, which was reported to be important in the oligomerization of the toxin (7Smedley 3rd, J.G. Uzal F.A. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 2381-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), is located outside of the interface of the trimer (Fig. 2A). These findings indicate that the trimeric assembly with the conduit-like structure emerges only in the crystal. Second, the CPE monomer shares structural homology with C. botulinum HA3 and C. perfringens ϵ-toxin, which also show structural homology to each other. HA3 is a component of a hemagglutinin and known to bind to sialyloligosaccharides (34Nakamura T. Kotani M. Tonozuka T. Ide A. Oguma K. Nishikawa A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 385: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, because the sugar binding ability is attributable to a region of HA3 that is not homologous to CPE, it is difficult to predict the structure-function relation of CPE, based on the homology with HA3. Instead, we focus on characteristic features of CPE that are common among the PFTs such as C. perfringens ϵ-toxin, aerolysin, and LSL. These toxins have an elongated architecture with β-sheets and an arrangement of three (or four) domains (17Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Postma J.P. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 35Cole A.R. Gibert M. Popoff M. Moss D.S. Titball R.W. Basak A.K. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 17251-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). In this study, the domains of CPE were numbered after those of the other toxins: domains I, II, and III (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Domain I is composed of the C-terminal region of CPE, whereas domains II and III are formed by the N-terminal region. As a result, the amino acid sequence and the domain arrangement of CPE were in the opposite order, whereas C. perfringens ϵ-toxin, aerolysin, and LSL consist of domains I, II, III (and IV for aerolysin) from the N to C terminus. As shown in Fig. 3A, these domains are aligned along the long axis of the toxins, except domain I of aerolysin. Domain I (or domains I and II of aerolysin) is responsible for binding to respective receptors. Aerolysin is known to bind a certain set of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. Domain I of LSL is defined as a lectin binding to carbohydrates. The receptor for ϵ-toxin is not known. Although these toxins similarly have the receptor binding site/residues at the top (Fig. 3A, red sticks), they show less structural similarity in domain I than other domains. It is plausible that the distinct structure of domain I (and domain II for aerolysin) reflects the different receptors recognized by these domains. In contrast to domain I, the module composed of domains II and III shares several structural features in common with these toxins, notably in terms of the stem of two β-strands and a flanking element laying on the major β-sheet in domain II (or domain III for aerolysin) (Fig. 3A, yellow ribbons). The flanking element of CPE shows alternating patterns of polar and hydrophobic residues, which imply amphipathic characteristics. Amphipathic strands have been found in similar flanking elements of aerolysin (16Iacovache I. Paumard P. Scheib H. Lesieur C. Sakai N. Matile S. Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G.

Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar) and leukocidin (37Miles G. Movileanu L. Bayley H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B), all of which are known as β-PFTs. Biochemical analyses of Clostridium septicum α-toxin, which shows clear homology with aerolysin, identified the membrane-spanning domain as an amphipathic region corresponding to the flanking region of aerolysin (38Melton J.A. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. Buckley J.T. Tweten R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14315-14322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These strands are believed to be inserted into the lipid bilayer and form the transmembrane β-barrel, the hydrophobic residues of which face the lipid bilayer and the polar residues of which constitute the hydrophilic lumen of pores (Fig. 3C). The amphipathic strand of CPE stretches from Val81 to Ile106 and comprises β4, α1, and the intervening loop (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). A previous report demonstrated that this region participates in the formation of pores after organizing a prepore oligomeric complex (7Smedley 3rd, J.G. Uzal F.A. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 2381-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is likely that CPE belongs to the β-PFT family, and the Val81-Ile106 region forms the β-hairpin to organize the β-barrel structure spanning the lipid membrane (Fig. 3C). The amphipathic flanking strands reside in the middle of the toxin molecule. Therefore, if this strand takes part in the formation of the transmembrane pore, a certain structural alteration of the toxin must occur. Previous reports demonstrate that cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, a group of β-PFTs including perfringolysin O and pneumolysin, undergo vertical collapse that brings the amphipathic strand to the membrane surface and forms the membrane pore composed of the β-barrel (19Czajkowsky D.M. Hotze E.M. Shao Z. Tweten R.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3206-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 39Tilley S.J. Orlova E.V. Gilbert R.J. Andrew P.W. Saibil H.R. Cell. 2005; 121: 247-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We consider that similar structural changes occur for CPE to accomplish the β-barrel insertion into the membrane. The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins consist of four domains, of which domain 2 is considered to be folded over, bringing the amphipathic strand close enough to the membrane to span the bilayer. Domain 2 of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins and domains II and III of CPE possess at least two long antiparallel β-strands (Fig. 4A, orange strands). Thus, we presume that CPE, like the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, inserts the amphipathic strand from β4 to α1 into the membrane upon the buckling of domains II and III, which may be conducted by the long antiparallel β-strands as a “hinge module” (Fig. 4B). This mechanism might be applicable to aerolysin, C. perfringens ϵ-toxin, and LSL because they also have similar long antiparallel β-strands. Here, we presented an explanation of how CPE forms a transmembrane pore, based on observations of the structural features of the full-length toxin. CPE is considered to be a β-PFT. The amphipathic region from Val81 to Ile106 is inserted into the plasma membrane upon the buckling of the stem module, a mechanism that may be common among some β-PFTs. To test our hypothesis, we are now trying to determine the structure of a CPE-claudin complex or an oligomerized form of CPE, which would enable us to understand better the pore-forming mechanism.

Using real-time PCR, we determined that ApoE–/– mice fed a normal diet express more aortic CD88 mRNA compared with controls, and this increase coincides with atherosclerotic lesion development (P< 0.001 for 3- vs. 25-wk-old animals). Conversely, mRNA expression of the alternative C5a receptor, C5L2, in aortas of ApoE–/– mice, was lower than controls at all time points. Using immunohistochemistry, we confirmed the presence of CD88 on macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and activated endothelial cells in plaques from brachiocephalic arteries. Treatment of ApoE–/– mice with a CD88 antagonist (PMX53; 3 mg/kg s.c. 3×/wk plus 1 mg/kg/d p.o.) for 25 wk reduced lesion size and lipid content in the plaque by ~40% (P<0.05). Our study provides evidence for a proatherogenic role for C5a and identifies the CD88 antagonist PMX53 as a potential antiatherosclerotic drug.—Manthey, H. D., Thomas, A. C., Shiels, I.

https://openalex.org/W1976404176,"Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) disease is a fatal lysosomal lipid storage disorder for which no effective therapy exists. A genome-wide, conditional synthetic lethality screen was performed using the yeast model of NP-C disease during anaerobiosis, an auxotrophic condition that requires yeast to utilize exogenous sterol. We identified 12 pathways and 13 genes as modifiers of the absence of the yeast NPC1 ortholog (NCR1) and quantified the impact of loss of these genes on sterol metabolism in ncr1Δ strains grown under viable aerobic conditions. Deletion of components of the yeast NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex in ncr1Δ strains conferred anaerobic inviability and accumulation of multiple sterol intermediates. Thus, we hypothesize an imbalance in histone acetylation in human NP-C disease. Accordingly, we show that the majority of the 11 histone deacetylase (HDAC) genes are transcriptionally up-regulated in three genetically distinct fibroblast lines derived from patients with NP-C disease. A clinically approved HDAC inhibitor (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) reverses the dysregulation of the majority of the HDAC genes. Consequently, three key cellular diagnostic criteria of NP-C disease are dramatically ameliorated as follows: lysosomal accumulation of both cholesterol and sphingolipids and defective esterification of LDL-derived cholesterol. These data suggest HDAC inhibition as a candidate therapy for NP-C disease. We conclude that pathways that exacerbate lethality in a model organism can be reversed in human cells as a novel therapeutic strategy. This ""exacerbate-reverse"" approach can potentially be utilized in any model organism for any disease."
https://openalex.org/W2011075236,"ASC/PYCARD is a common adaptor for a diverse set of inflammasomes that activate caspase-1, most prominently the NLR-based inflammasome. Mounting evidence indicates that ASC and these NLRs also elicit non-overlapping functions, but the molecular basis for this difference is unclear. To address this, we performed microarray and network analysis of ASC shRNA knockdown cells. In pathogen-infected cells, an ASC-dependent interactome is centered on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK and on multiple chemokines. ASC did not affect the expression of MAPK but affected its phosphorylation by pathogens and Toll-like receptor agonists via suppression of the dual-specificity phosphatase, DUSP10/MKP5. Chemokine induction, DUSP function, and MAPK phosphorylation were independent of caspase-1 and IL-1β. MAPK activation by pathogen was abrogated in Asc(-/-) but not Nlrp3(-/-), Nlrc4(-/-), or Casp1(-/-) macrophages. These results demonstrate a function for ASC that is distinct from the inflammasome in modulating MAPK activity and chemokine expression and further identify DUSP10 as a novel ASC target."

The machine-learning algorithm random forests classified urine samples as either from normal or T2DM monkeys. The metabolites important for developing the classifier were further examined for their biological significance. Random forests models had a misclassification error of less than 5%. Metabolites were identified based on accurate masses (<10 ppm) and confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry of authentic compounds. Urinary compounds significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the T2DM when compared with the normal group included glycine betaine (9-fold), citric acid (2.8-fold), kynurenic acid (1.8-fold), glucose (68-fold), and pipecolic acid (6.5-fold). When compared with the conventional definition of T2DM, the metabolites were also useful in defining the T2DM condition, and the urinary elevations in glycine betaine and pipecolic acid (as well as proline) indicated defective re-absorption in the kidney proximal tubules by SLC6A20, a Na+-dependent transporter. The mRNA levels of SLC6A20 were significantly reduced in the kidneys of monkeys with T2DM. These observations were validated in the db/db mouse model of T2DM.

T2DM is associated with microvascular (nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy) and macrovascular (coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease) pathologies resulting in a complex, multifactorial metabolic phenotype. Therefore, understanding the molecular pathogenesis and progression of T2DM, its associated and varied complications, and its effects on numerous organ systems is not trivial. The emerging field of small molecule profiling, or metabolomics, has already provided new perspectives on T2DM (1Lanza I.R. Zhang S. Ward L.E. Karakelides H. Raftery D. Nair K.S.

Science. 2007; 316: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Pennisi E. Science. 2007; 316: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the rhesus macaque is an exceptional model with which to understand T2DM pathogenesis and progression at the metabolic and metabolomic levels. In the present metabolomic study, urine samples from a cohort of spontaneously T2DM rhesus macaques were compared with samples from normal counterparts. An analytical platform having superior resolution and high mass accuracy, ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-QTOF-MS), was combined with contemporary machine learning algorithms to identify urinary metabolites capable of discriminating normal from T2DM monkeys. The kidney proximal tubule transporter, SLC6A20 (a Na+-dependent transporter), was implicated in the increased excretion of the urinary metabolites. Similar results were replicated in the db/db mouse model of T2DM. The combination of a unique nonhuman primate colony (rhesus macaque), genetically modified mice, and the latest in metabolomic technology provides a new perspective on the multifactorial T2DM phenotype. Betaine hydrochloride was purchased from MP Biomedicals, LLC (Aurora, Ohio). N-Methylnipecotic acid was purchased from Oakwood Products Inc. (West Columbia, SC). Chlorpropamide, citrate, creatinine, debrisoquine hemisulfate, glucose, isocitrate, kynurenic acid, α-methyl-l-proline, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, d- and l-pipecolic acid, d- and l-proline, and theophylline were purchased from Sigma. All reagents and solvents were HPLC grade. Rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) were individually housed and cared for according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council Institute for Laboratory Animal Resources). All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of South Florida. Each subject was placed on the same diet lot (17% protein, 13% fat, and 70% carbohydrate, 5038, Purina Mills, St. Louis, MO) provided ad libitum together with ad libitum fresh water. Standard 12-h light/dark cycles were used. Spot urines (except for the first urine of the morning) were collected in clean autoclaved steel pans. Urine samples were discarded if found to be contaminated with feces, food, or water. Monkey blood samples used for clinical chemistry were obtained under light anesthesia (ketamine hydrochloride, 10 mg/kg body weight) after a consistent 16-h overnight fast. C57Bl/6J and db/db (B6.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J) male mice 12 weeks of age were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Food (NIH31 standard chow) and water was provided ad libitum. Standard 12-h light/dark cycles were used. Mice were placed in metabolic cages to collect 24-h urine samples (Tecniplast USA, Exton, PA) every month for 3 months. Mice were euthanized at 12 (n = 3), 16 (n = 4), 20 (n = 4), and 24 weeks (n = 4) of age and tissue was harvested and immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The db/db diabetic phenotype was confirmed in all mice by blood chemistry analysis. All animal studies were approved by the National Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. Urine samples were diluted with HPLC grade water containing 1 μm chlorpropamide as the internal standard. The samples were centrifuged to remove insoluble debris and the supernatant was transferred to an autosampler vial. Monkey spot urines were diluted with an equal volume of solvent comprised of water and acetonitrile (1:1). The samples were centrifuged to remove insoluble debris and the supernatant was transferred to an autosampler vial. Five μl was chromatographed on a 50 × 2.1-mm Acquity 1.7-μm C18 column (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) using an Acquity UPLC system (Waters). To avoid artifacts based on sample injection order, the order was randomized. The gradient mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (B). A typical 10-min sample run consisted of 0.5 min of 100% solvent A followed by an incremental increase of solvent B up to 100% for the remaining 9.5 min. The flow rate was set to 0.5 ml/min. The eluent was introduced by electrospray ionization into the mass spectrometer (Waters QTOF Premier) operating in positive (ESI+) or negative (ESI−) ionization modes. The capillary and sampling cone voltages were set to 3,000 and 30 V, respectively. Source and desolvation temperatures were set to 120 and 350 °C, respectively, and the cone and desolvation gas flows were set to 50.0 and 650.0 liter/h, respectively. To maintain mass accuracy, sulfadimethoxine at a concentration of 300 pg/μl in 50% acetonitrile was used as a lock mass and injected at a rate of 50 μl/min. For MS scanning, data were acquired in centroid mode from 50 to 850 m/z and for tandem MS the collision energy was ramped from 5 to 35 V. The mass chromatographic data were aligned using MarkerLynx software (Waters) to generate a data matrix consisting of peak areas corresponding to a unique m/z and retention time. The peak area corresponding to protonated creatinine (m/z = 114.0671+, retention time = 0.31 min) was used to normalize the peak areas in a sample. This procedure minimized differences in analyte concentration that were due to variations in renal physiology. Data from ESI+ and ESI− were combined to generate a data matrix suitable for downstream analysis. The conventionally noted clinical parameters of age, weight, fasting plasma glucose, serum triglycerides, HbA1c, and plasma insulin were added to some of the analyses to serve as pre-existing clinically important characterization and biomarkers of T2DM. The random forests machine learning algorithm (33Breiman L. Mach. Learning. 2001; 45: 5-32Crossref Scopus (66418) Google Scholar) was used to classify monkey urine samples as normal or T2DM. The random forests method uses an ensemble of simple decision trees, each trained on a bootstrapped subset of the samples and a random set of variables. The algorithm provides two particularly useful features: 1) internal cross-validation that assesses model accuracy without a priori specifying independent testing and training sets; and 2) a permutation analysis that estimates the relative “importance score” of each variable in the models. Random forests run-to-run variability can reduce the reproducibility of importance scores, so more robust importance scores were computed using a panel of 25 independent random forests models, each with 10,000 trees, trained on the set of all ions (ESI+ and ESI−). Next, the importance score rank for each variable in each model was computed. The ranks were then averaged over the set of models. Bootstrapping the results from the 25 independent random forests was used to determine the 95% confidence intervals of the variable importance ranks. The minimal number of variables necessary to build an optimal random forests model for classifying each group was determined with a greedy (i.e. locally optimal but potentially globally suboptimal) approach. The average performance of sets of 25 random forests models were compared, each trained using a subset of the top ranked variables. The set of 25 random forests models were trained using the previously determined top 10, 20, 50, 75, 150, 250, 350, 500, 750, or 1000 most important model variables. The set of models that achieved the best average classification performance was concluded to contain the most meaningful set of variables. Bootstrapping of the 25 forests was used to determine the variation in model performance within each of the sets of 25 models. In the case that more than one set of top performing variables was non-statistically significantly better than another set, the best model was the one that used the fewest variables. Elemental compositions of ions were determined using Seven Golden Rules (34Kind T. Fiehn O. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 105Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) and the Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (35Markley J.L. Anderson M.E. Cui Q. Eghbalnia H.R. Lewis I.A.

Putative ion identities were validated using tandem MS by comparison with authentic compounds. Urine samples were diluted in 10 mm ammonium formate buffer (pH 3.5) and separated on a Phenomenex Synergi Polar-RP column (Torrance, CA). Samples for measurement of glycine betaine, creatinine, and glucose were diluted 1:500 and kynurenic acid samples were diluted 1:10. LC analysis was carried out using a high-performance LC system consisting of a PerkinElmer Series 200 quaternary pump, vacuum degasser, and autosampler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a 100-μl loop interfaced to an API2000 SCIEX triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Foster City, CA). Ions were monitored by either single ion monitoring or multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) modes. Single ion monitoring was used to monitor the negatively charged ion, m/z = 214.9, corresponding to the chloride adduct of glucose with 4-nitrobenzoic acid used as the internal standard (m/z = 165.9). The following MRM transitions were monitored in positive mode: glycine betaine (118.0 → 58.1 m/z), creatinine (114.0 → 86.1 m/z), debrisoquine hemisulfate (176.1 → 134.2 m/z), and kynurenic acid (190.0 → 144.0 m/z). Citrate and its isomer, isocitrate, were separated by UPLC and detected by QTOF-MS by monitoring their sodium adducts in ESI+ mode (m/z = 215.0168). Citrate and isocitrate were quantitated using QuanLynx (Waters). Mouse serum samples were diluted 20-fold in 66% acetonitrile containing 200 nm chlorpropamide as an internal standard and separated on a 50 × 2.1-mm Acquity 1.7-μm C18 column and introduced via electrospray into a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (XEVO TQ-MS). MRM transitions for glycine betaine, pipecolic acid, and proline were as described above and below. The MRM transition for chlorpropamide was 275.0 → 189.96 m/z. Results were analyzed and quantitated using TargetLynx (Waters). Chiral chromatography for pipecolic acid and proline was performed as described (36Rashed M.S. Al-Ahaidib L.Y. Aboul-Enein H.Y. Al-Amoudi M. Jacob M. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 2124-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to distinguish the l- from the d-stereoisomer. Briefly, urine samples were diluted 1:1 in 50% aqueous methanol and spiked with internal standards N-methylnipecotic acid (for pipecolic acid measurements) or α-methyl-l-proline (for proline measurements). Samples were chromatographed on an Astec Chirobiotic T (Sigma) HPLC column and introduced via electrospray into an API2000 SCIEX triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer. The following MRM transitions were monitored in positive mode: N-methylnipecotic acid (144.1 → 98.2 m/z), pipecolic acid (130.0 → 84.1 m/z), α-methyl-l-proline (130.1 → 84.1 m/z), and proline (116.2 → 70.1 m/z). α-Methyl-l-proline was clearly distinguished from pipecolic acid based on differences in retention time. RNA was extracted from representative portions of flash-frozen kidney using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCR (QPCR) was performed with cDNA generated from 1 μg of total RNA with a SuperScript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) using random hexamers. Primers were designed using Primer 3 software (37Misener S. Krawetz S.A. Bioinformatics Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000Google Scholar) based on the following NCBI rhesus macaque reference sequences: SLC6A20 (XM_001114465), SLC36A1 XM_001109989), HNF1a (XM_001089567), COLLECTRIN/TMEM27 (NM_001194195), and β-ACTIN (NM_001033084). Mouse primers were designed using qPrimerDepot (mouseprimerdepot.nci.nih.gov). All primers were further validated using NCBI Primer-BLAST. Primer sequences can be found under supplemental Table S1. QPCR was carried out using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) using an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Values were quantified using the comparative threshold cycle method and samples were normalized to β-actin. Monkey QPCR products were sequenced to confirm proper target amplification. Flash-frozen necropsied kidney was homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was retained each time and then centrifuged at 36,000 × g (Optima Max Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter) for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of resuspension buffer (75 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). 20 μg of total protein was separated on a 4–15% Tris-HCl gel and transferred to PVDF. Membranes were incubated with antibodies against SLC6A20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or used as control for loading ferroportin (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX) or actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Statistical analysis of differences in ion concentration was performed using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). The significance of metabolite concentration differences was determined using an unpaired t test or the Mann-Whitney test (for data of non-normal distribution). Outliers were detected using Grubb's test (QuickCalcs, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Monkeys were classified into two groups according to the definition recommended by the American Diabetes Association for humans, but with slight modifications to account for a lower upper limit-of-normal fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in rhesus monkeys (3.6 mmol/liter) compared with that for humans (4.7 mmol/l) (38Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Clasification of Diabetes Mellitus Diabetes Care. 2003; 26: S5-20PubMed Google Scholar). Monkeys that had two consecutive FPG values of 7 mmol/liter or above were considered T2DM. Normal monkeys had FPG values consistently below 4.4 mmol/liter. Normal monkeys used in the metabolomic studies had the following average values: age, 14.3 ± 6.1 years; body weight, 12.1 ± 4.0 kg; FPG, 3.3 ± 0.5 mmol/liter; serum triglycerides, 0.7 ± 0.3 mmol/liter; HbA1c, 4.2 ± 0.3%; and plasma insulin, 239.4 ± 125.5 pmol/liter. In comparison, monkeys with T2DM used in the metabolomic studies had the following average values: age, 21.1 ± 3.9 years (p < 0.01); body weight, 15.8 ± 3.0 kg (p < 0.05); FPG, 10.2 ± 2.3 mmol/liter (p < 0.001); triglyceride, 9.7 ± 7.1 mmol/liter (p < 0.001); HbA1c, 9.7 ± 0.9% (p < 0.001); and plasma insulin, 815.1 ± 865.4 pmol/liter (p < 0.01). Normal monkeys used in the gene expression and biochemistry studies had the following average values: age, 23.5 ± 6.4 years; body weight, 11.2 ± 6.2 kg; FPG, 3.9 ± 0.6 mmol/liter; triglyceride, 1.2 ± 0.8 mmol/liter; HbA1c, 4.3 ± 0.3%; and plasma insulin, 282 ± 92.3 pmol/liter. Monkeys with T2DM used in the gene expression and biochemistry studies had the following average values: age, 22.9 ± 4.0 (p > 0.05); body weight, 13.8 ± 2.4 kg (p > 0.05); FPG, 14.8 ± 3.8 (p < 0.01); triglyceride, 7.5 ± 8.1 mmol/liter (p < 0.01); HbA1c, 9.7 ± 1.4% (p < 0.01); and plasma insulin, 241.8 ± 139.9 pmol/liter (p < 0.05). Individual values are shown in supplemental Table S2 (monkeys used for metabolomics studies) and supplemental Table S3 (deceased monkeys used for gene expression and biochemistry studies). Random forests was used to classify urine as either from normal or T2DM rhesus macaques. A single data matrix consisting of ESI+ and ESI− urine metabolomics data were generated such that each m/z and retention time was represented by a unique variable. Because of the inherent chromatographic noise and spectral artifacts present in LC-MS-based analyses, multiple random forests models were employed to identify the minimal set of variables necessary to build a classifier of normal versus T2DM monkeys. The top 150 ordered variables generated the most accurate random forests model, with an average random forests misclassification error of 5% (Fig. 1A). Non-significant differences in performance were observed between training models based on 150 and 250 variables. The five most important variables (and other notable ones) are described under Table 1.TABLE 1Summary of biomarker candidates identified by random forests analysisIdentitym/zRetention timeEmpirical formulaMass errorMean rank (95% CI)minppmTop biomarker candidates (and adducts)Kynurenic acid190.0510+2.78C10H7NO33.22.0 (1.56–2.52)Pipecolic acid130.0873+0.37C6H11NO23.82.3 (1.96–2.72)Glycine betaineaWhere a = [Na+] adduct; b = [H+] protonated molecular ion; c = [K+] adduct, and d = [Cl−] adduct.a140"
https://openalex.org/W2093897309,"High cholesterol levels are associated with prostate cancer development. Androgens promote cholesterol accumulation by activating the sterol-regulatory element-binding protein isoform 2 (SREBP-2) transcription factor. However, SREBP-2 is in balance with the liver X receptor (LXR; NR1H2/NR1H3), a transcription factor that prevents cholesterol accumulation. Here, we show that LXR activity is down-regulated by the androgen receptor (AR; NR3C4). In turn, this reduces LXR target gene expression. This antagonism on LXR is also exerted by other steroid hormone receptors, including the estrogen, glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptors. This suggests a generalizable mechanism, but the AR does not affect LXR mRNA levels, protein degradation, or DNA binding. We also found that the AR does not require protein synthesis to influence LXR, suggesting a direct antagonism. However, the AR does not directly bind LXR. The AR N-terminal domain (involved in transactivation), but not its DNA-binding domain, is required to suppress LXR activity, suggesting coactivator competition. Overall, this androgen-mediated antagonism of LXR complements SREBP-2 activation, providing a more complete picture as to how androgens increase cellular cholesterol levels in a prostate cancer setting. Given the cross-talk between other steroid hormone receptors and LXR, hormonal regulation of cholesterol via LXR may occur in a variety of cellular contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2080928191,"Queuosine is a modified pyrrolopyrimidine nucleoside found in the anticodon loop of transfer RNA acceptors for the amino acids tyrosine, asparagine, aspartic acid, and histidine. Because it is exclusively synthesized by bacteria, higher eukaryotes must salvage queuosine or its nucleobase queuine from food and the gut microflora. Previously, animals made deficient in queuine died within 18 days of withdrawing tyrosine, a nonessential amino acid, from the diet (Marks, T., and Farkas, W. R. (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 230, 233-237). Here, we show that human HepG2 cells deficient in queuine and mice made deficient in queuosine-modified transfer RNA, by disruption of the tRNA guanine transglycosylase enzyme, are compromised in their ability to produce tyrosine from phenylalanine. This has similarities to the disease phenylketonuria, which arises from mutation in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase or from a decrease in the supply of its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Immunoblot and kinetic analysis of liver from tRNA guanine transglycosylase-deficient animals indicates normal expression and activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase. By contrast, BH4 levels are significantly decreased in the plasma, and both plasma and urine show a clear elevation in dihydrobiopterin, an oxidation product of BH4, despite normal activity of the salvage enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. Our data suggest that queuosine modification limits BH4 oxidation in vivo and thereby potentially impacts on numerous physiological processes in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2069301778,"cAMP is an important second messenger that executes diverse physiological function in living cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of cAMP on canonical TRPC6 (transient receptor potential channel 6) channels in TRPC6-expressing HEK293 cells and glomerular mesangial cells. The results showed that 500 μm 8-Br-cAMP, a cell-permeable analog of cAMP, elicited [Ca2+]i increases and stimulated a cation current at the whole-cell level in TRPC6-expressing HEK293 cells. The effect of cAMP diminished in the presence of the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 or the MEK inhibitors PD98059, U0126, and MEK inhibitor I. 8-Br-cAMP also induced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2. Conversion of serine to glycine at an ERK1/2 phosphorylation site (S281G) abolished the cAMP activation of TRPC6 as determined by whole-cell and cell-attached single-channel patch recordings. Experiments based on a panel of pharmacological inhibitors or activators suggested that the cAMP action on TRPC6 was not mediated by PKA, PKG, or EPAC (exchange protein activated by cAMP). Total internal fluorescence reflection microscopy showed that 8-Br-cAMP did not alter the trafficking of TRPC6 to the plasma membrane. We also found that, in glomerular mesangial cells, glucagon-induced [Ca2+]i increases were mediated through the cAMP-PI3K-PKB-MEK-ERK1/2-TRPC6 signaling pathway.

Canonical TRPC6 (transient receptor potential channel 6) channels are Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channels. The channels are ubiquitously expressed and play diverse functional roles, including vascular smooth muscle contraction, cell proliferation, and kidney glomerular filtration (1Dietrich A.

In general, the mechanisms of TRPC6 activation and regulation are still not well understood. cAMP is an important second messenger (12Rall T.W. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 1065-1076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous physiological factors, including hormone, cytokine, autocrine, and paracrine agents, can activate membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases, resulting in cytosolic cAMP elevation. The elevated cAMP then acts on multiple downstream targets to regulate cellular responses (13Defer N. Best-Belpomme M. Hanoune J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F400-F416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some well known downstream targets of cAMP include PKA (14Bos J.L. Trends Biochem.

An accumulating amount of evidence shows that cAMP can also initiate another signaling cascade by activating PI3K-PKB, which subsequently stimulates MEK and ERK1/2 (17Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Exp.

Glucagon is a major hormone that can bind to specific Gs protein-coupled receptors to activate glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic pathways, causing blood glucose levels to increase. Elevated fasting glucagon levels (hyperglucagonemia) may contribute to the development of diabetes (23Shah P. Vella A. Basu A. Basu R. Schwenk W.F. Rizza R.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol Metab. 2000; 85: 4053-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). High glucagon may also stimulate the growth and proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells, resulting in subsequent mesangial expansion, glomerulosclerosis, and glomerular injury (22Li X.C. Carretero O.A. Shao Y. Zhuo J.L. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Hostetter T.H. Semin.

Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Li X.C. Carretero O.A. Shao Y. Zhuo J.L. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported that glucagon-induced proliferation of mesangial cells is mediated by a signaling cascade involving cAMP, ERK1/2, and [Ca2+]i increases. However, it is not clear whether the [Ca2+]i increases are related to extracellular Ca2+ influx and, if so, which Ca2+-permeable channels mediate the Ca2+ influx. In this study, we investigated the effect of cAMP on TRPC6-mediated Ca2+ influx and cation current in TRPC6-expressing HEK293 cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that cAMP activates TRPC6-mediated Ca2+ influx and cation current and that the action is mediated through the PI3K-PKΒ-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, we show that this mechanism plays a key role in glucagon-induced [Ca2+]i increases in renal glomerular mesangial cells. HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All cDNA constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were used for experiments 48–72 h post-transfection. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Glomerular mesangial cells were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (260–280 g) using the graded sieving technique based on the protocol described previously (25Zhang X. Chen X. Wu D. Liu W. Wang J. Feng Z. Cai G. Fu B. Hong Q. Du J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 1532-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Ferdows M. Golchini K. Adler S.G. Kurtz I. Kidney Int. 1989; 35: 783-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated glomeruli were digested by collagenase (2 mg/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C. After several washes, cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 17% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. In this study, glomerular mesangial cells from passages 3–5 were used. For siRNA studies, TRPC6-specific siRNA or its scrambled control was transfected into glomerular mesangial cells using electroporation with Nucleofector II (Lonza Group, Ltd.) following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The cells were used for Ca2+ measurement and immunoblot experiments 40 h after electroporation. The nucleotide sequence of TRPC6-specific siRNA is GCAGCAUCAUUCAUUGCAAGAUUUA (27Soboloff J. Spassova M. Xu W. He L.P. Cuesta N. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39786-39794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). See supplemental “Materials and Methods” for additional information. Mouse TRPC6 was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. 8-Br-cAMP (500 μm), a cell-permeable analog of cAMP, elicited oscillatory [Ca2+]i increases in TRPC6-expressing cells but not in wild-type HEK293 cells or in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1, A, C, and D). Although 8-Br-cAMP is membrane-permeable, its membrane permeability is poor (15Schwede F. Maronde E. Genieser H. Jastorff B. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar); therefore, a relatively high concentration of 500 μm was employed. If TRPC6-expressing cells were placed in a Ca2+-free bath solution (0Ca2+-PSS), 8-Br-cAMP failed to elicit such [Ca2+]i increases (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting an obligated requirement for Ca2+ entry in the [Ca2+]i oscillations. Because [Ca2+]i oscillations are also known to be related to Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores (28De Young G.W. Keizer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 29Li Y.X. Rinzel J. Keizer J. Stojilković S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the role of intracellular Ca2+ release was explored. It was found that, after depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores using thapsigargin (4 μm) for 10 min, 8-Br-cAMP (500 μm) was able to induce only a single [Ca2+]i transient without further [Ca2+]i oscillations (Fig. 1B). However, thapsigargin treatment had no effect on the percentage of cells that could respond to cAMP and the peak magnitude of the first [Ca2+]i transient (Fig. 1, B–D). These data suggest that, although the first [Ca2+]i transient is due to Ca2+ influx but not intracellular Ca2+ store release, the subsequent [Ca2+]i oscillations may be related to Ca2+ store release. Because we were interested in TRPC6-mediated Ca2+ influx, we examined only the cAMP effect on the first [Ca2+]i transient. Note that the [Ca2+]i transient is affected not only by Ca2+ movement across the plasma membrane but also by Ca2+ movement across the membrane of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Thus, the [Ca2+]i transient could not faithfully reflect the Ca2+ influx. Next, we used whole-cell patch clamp to examine the effect of cAMP on TRPC6 activity on the plasma membrane. Application of 500 μm 8-Br-cAMP caused a marked increase in whole-cell cation current density in both inward and outward directions in TRPC6-expressing cells but not in the vector-transfected group (Fig. 2, A–C). The time course of cAMP activation was recorded at ±80 mV, and the results showed that cAMP activation of TRPC6 followed a relatively slow time course. It peaked at ∼10 min after 8-Br-cAMP application (Fig. 2D). We reasoned that two factors might have contributed to the difference in the time kinetics between the cAMP-induced [Ca2+]i transient (Fig. 1A) and the cation current (Fig. 2D): 1) the opening of a small percentage of TRPC6 might be enough for global [Ca2+]i increases, and 2) the falling phase of the [Ca2+]i transient was not related to the inactivation of TRPC6. In this aspect, it has been well documented that the falling phase of the [Ca2+]i transient reflects mainly Ca2+ sequestration into intracellular stores, as well as Ca2+ extrusion into the extracellular medium (30Wang X. Reznick S. Li P. Liang W. van Breemen C. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Mountian I. Manolopoulos V.G. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Wuytack F. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One downstream target of cAMP is PI3K (17Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 19Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar), the activity of which stimulates the PKB-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway. In [Ca2+]i measurement studies with TRPC6-expressing cells, two PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin (100 nm) and LY294002 (30 μm), both markedly reduced the percentage of cells responding to 8-Br-cAMP (500 μm), dibutyryl cAMP (300 μm), and forskolin (10 μm) (Fig. 3, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). These two inhibitors also reduced the peak amplitude of the first [Ca2+]i transient among the [Ca2+]i-responding cells (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S1B). Three MEK inhibitors, PD98059 (20 μm), U0126 (10 μm), and MEK inhibitor Ι (1 μm), had a similar inhibitory effect on 8-Br-cAMP-, dibutyryl cAMP-, and forskolin-induced Ca2+ influx in TRPC6-expressing cells (Fig. 3, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). The effect of PI3K and MEK inhibitors on TRPC6-mediated cation currents was also examined. As shown in Fig. 3C, 8-Br-cAMP (500 μm)-stimulated whole-cell cation currents, which were recorded at ±80 mV, were significantly inhibited by the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (100 nm) and LY294002 (30 μm). The MEK inhibitors PD98059 (20 μm), U0126 (10 μm), and MEK inhibitor Ι (1 μm) had a similar inhibitory effect (Fig. 3C). We tested whether 8-Br-cAMP can enhance MEK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Fig. 4 shows that 8-Br-cAMP (500 μm) induced a rapid phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2 within 2 min and lasting for 10 min (Fig. 4, A and B). The total MEK and ERK1/2 protein levels were not affected by 8-Br-cAMP. PI3K is an upstream signaling molecule of MEK and ERK1/2. As expected, in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (30 μm), cAMP was unable to stimulate MEK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, C and D). Likewise, inhibition of MEK (by 10 μm U0126), which is an upstream signal molecule of ERK1/2, prevented the cAMP-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 4D). There are four ERK1/2 consensus sites (Pro-X-Ser or Thr-Pro) in TRPC6 proteins. A point mutation was made at each of these four sites. These constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells. One mutant, S281G, abolished the cAMP activation of TRPC6 in whole-cell patch recording (Fig. 5, A and B). Other mutants of TRPC6, including S194G, T220A, and S768G, did not alter the cAMP response (data not shown). A cell-attached single-channel patch recorded a cAMP-activated channel in TRPC6-expressing cells (Fig. 5C), whereas cAMP failed to activate this channel in S281G-expressing cells (Fig. 5, C and D). These results suggest that ERK1/2 may directly activate TRPC6 by phosphorylation at Ser-281. In [Ca2+]i measurement experiments, the PKG inhibitor KT5823 (1 μm) and the PKA inhibitors KT5720 (1 μm) and H89 (10 μm) had no effect either on the percentage of cells responding to 8-Br-cAMP (supplemental Fig. S2A) or on the peak amplitude of the first [Ca2+]i transient among the responding cells (supplemental Fig. S2B). We also utilized the TRPC6 mutant T69A/S321A, in which effective PKG phosphorylation sites were mutated (10Takahashi S. Lin H. Geshi N. Mori Y. Kawarabayashi Y. Takami N. Mori M.X. Honda A. Inoue R. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 4209-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This mutant displayed cAMP-induced [Ca2+]i responses similar to those of wild-type TRPC6 (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). EPAC is another possible downstream target of cAMP. However, the selective EPAC agonist 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-Me-cAMP had only a very small stimulating action on the [Ca2+]i increase (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B), suggesting that the involvement of EPAC, if any, is small. Whole-cell patch clamp studies were used to verify the above findings. The results showed that KT5720 and KT5823 treatments had no effect on the 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated whole-cell cation current in TRPC6-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. S2D). Furthermore, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-Me-cAMP failed to stimulate the whole-cell cation current in TRPC6-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. S2C). Taken together, these data suggest that the stimulating action of cAMP on TRPC6 does not involve PKA, PKG, and EPAC. One report has suggested that cAMP may be a key signal that facilitates TRPC6 trafficking to the plasma membrane (32Fleming I. Rueben A. Popp R. Fisslthaler B. Schrodt S. Sander A. Haendeler J. Falck J.R. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Busse R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 2612-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We used total internal fluorescence reflection microscopy, a powerful technique for studying protein movements within the periplasmic space, to monitor the movement of GFP-tagged TRPC6 toward the plasma membrane (33Ma X. Cao J. Luo J. Nilius B. Huang Y. Ambudkar I.S. Yao X. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 2249-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). GFP-tagged TRPC6 was transfected into HEK293 cells, and the cells were treated with 8-Br-cAMP (500 μm) for 5–10 min. 8-Br-cAMP had no effect on the TRPC6 fluorescence change in the plasma membrane region (supplemental Fig. S3, A and D). pMEM-YFP, which is a fluorescent marker of the plasma membrane, was used as a time control. pMEM-YFP fluorescence did not change in 10 min (supplemental Fig. S3, B and D). This control excluded the possibility of plasma membrane movement in the axial direction during the experiments. A positive control was also included, in which thapsigargin (4 μm) was shown to stimulate the translocation of heteromeric TRPV4-C1 channels to the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D) as reported previously (33Ma X. Cao J. Luo J. Nilius B. Huang Y. Ambudkar I.S. Yao X. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 2249-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Used as another control, GFP-tagged TRPC6 could also be activated by 8-Br-cAMP in whole-cell recordings (supplemental Fig. S4). Taken together, these data demonstrate that cAMP does not alter the translocation of TRPC6 to the plasma membrane. Recent studies have shown that glucagon binds specific receptors to increase cAMP production and to cause [Ca2+]i increases in glomerular mesangial cells and that the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway is involved in the processes (21Li X.C. Carretero O.A. Zhuo J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Li X.C. Carretero O.A. Shao Y. Zhuo J.L. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TRPC6 is known to be abundantly expressed in glomerular mesangial cells (3Graham S. Ding M. Sours-Brothers S. Yorio T. Ma J.X. Ma R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F1381-F1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, we explored the functional role of the PI3K-PKB-MEK-ERK1/2-TRPC6 signaling cascade in glucagon-induced Ca2+ influx in renal glomerular mesangial cells. The results showed that glucagon (10 nm) and 8-Br-cAMP (500 μm) induced [Ca2+]i increases in glomerular mesangial cells (Fig. 6, A and B). The [Ca2+]i increases were abolished by the omission of extracellular Ca2+ but were not affected by thapsigargin pretreatment (Fig. 6, A–D), suggesting an involvement of Ca2+ influx but not intracellular Ca2+ store release. The [Ca2+]i increases were inhibited by LY294002 and U0126 treatments (Fig. 6, C and D). In immunoblot studies, glucagon (10 nm) and 8-Br-cAMP (500 μm) were both able to induce phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2 in a time-dependent manner in mesangial cells (supplemental Fig. S5). To verifying the involvement of TRPC6, an siRNA strategy was employed. In immunoblotting, TRPC6-specific siRNA effectively reduced the expression level of TRPC6 proteins in mesangial cells (Fig. 6E). In functional studies, TRPC6-specific siRNA abolished the glucagon- and cAMP-induced [Ca2+]i increases in these cells (Fig. 6F). These data suggest that the glucagon-induced Ca2+ influx in glomerular mesangial cells is mediated through the cAMP-PI3K-PKB-MEK-ERK1/2-TRPC6 pathway. The major findings of this study are as follows. 1) cAMP and forskolin evoked Ca2+ influx and elicited a whole-cell cation current in TRPC6-expressing HEK293 cells. 2) The effect of cAMP on TRPC6 was inhibited by pharmacological antagonists of PI3K and MEK. Furthermore, cAMP could induce the phosphorylation of MEK and its downstream target ERK1/2. Importantly, point mutations at ERK1/2 phosphorylation sites on TRPC6 proteins (S281G) abolished the cAMP activation of the TRPC6-mediated cation current in whole-cell and single-channel recordings. 3) Both glucagon and cAMP could induce [Ca2+]i increases in primary cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells, the effect of which was abolished by TRPC6-specific siRNA and inhibitors of PI3K and MEK. These data provide strong evidence that cAMP acts through PI3K-PKB-MEK-ERK1/2 to activate TRPC6 in both TRPC6-expressing HEK293 cells and native glomerular mesangial cells (Fig. 7). It is likely that ERK1/2 directly phosphorylates Ser-281 of TRPC6 to activate the channels. These results add ERK1/2 to the list of protein kinases that can directly regulate TRPC6 via phosphorylation. This list includes Fyn, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, PKC, and PKG (7Hisatsune C. Kuroda Y. Nakamura K. Inoue T. Nakamura T. Michikawa T. Mizutani A. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18887-18894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Shi J. Mori E. Mori Y. Mori M. Li J. Ito Y. Inoue R. J. Physiol. 2004; 561: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and now ERK1/2. Two other studies have investigated the effect of cAMP and PKA on TRPC6 (11Hassock S.R. Zhu M.X. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Authi K.S. Blood. 2002; 100: 2801-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 32Fleming I. Rueben A. Popp R. Fisslthaler B. Schrodt S. Sander A. Haendeler J. Falck J.R. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Busse R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 2612-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). One report showed that PKA had no effect on TRPC6 activity (11Hassock S.R. Zhu M.X. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Authi K.S. Blood. 2002; 100: 2801-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which is in agreement with our study. The second report suggested an involvement of cAMP in agonist-induced translocation of TRPC6 proteins to the plasma membrane in vascular endothelial cells (32Fleming I. Rueben A. Popp R. Fisslthaler B. Schrodt S. Sander A. Haendeler J. Falck J.R. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Busse R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 2612-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the results of this study, in which we showed that cAMP did not stimulate TRPC6 translocation to the plasma membrane by total internal fluorescence reflection microscopy. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but it could be due to difference in cell types and/or methods used for monitoring translocation. We used total internal fluorescence reflection microscopy, whereas the other investigators used conventional confocal imaging (32Fleming I. Rueben A. Popp R. Fisslthaler B. Schrodt S. Sander A. Haendeler J. Falck J.R. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Busse R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 2612-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It is relatively easier to quantify the protein trafficking by total internal fluorescence reflection microscopy than by conventional confocal imaging. The finding that the cAMP-PI3K-PKB-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway activates TRPC6 may have important physiological or pathological implications. It is well documented that the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway and TRPC6 each play important roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation (34Roberts P.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3291-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar, 35El Boustany C. Bidaux G. Enfissi A. Delcourt P. Prevarskaya N. Capiod T.

Targets. 2010; 14: 513-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between MEK-ERK1/2 and TRPC6 has never been established. In kidney, it was reported that the major hormone glucagon, through a signaling cascade involving cAMP, ERK1/2, and [Ca2+]i increases (21Li X.C. Carretero O.A. Zhuo J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Li X.C. Carretero O.A. Shao Y. Zhuo J.L. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), can stimulate the growth and proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells, resulting in glomerular injury (22Li X.C. Carretero O.A. Shao Y. Zhuo J.L. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Hostetter T.H. Semin. Nephrol. 2003; 23: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the role of TRPC6 in the process is unclear. In this study, we confirmed that glucagon and cAMP can elicit [Ca2+]i increases in the primary cultured glomerular mesangial cells via the PI3K-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway. More importantly, we found that suppressing TRPC6 expression levels using TRPC6-specific siRNA abolished the [Ca2+]i increases in response to glucagon and cAMP. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the glucagon-induced [Ca2+]i increases in glomerular mesangial cells are mediated by TRPC6 through the cAMP-PI3K-MEK-ERK1/2 axis. This Ca2+ influx is expected to stimulate the growth and proliferation of renal mesangial cells. We used the compounds LY294002 and wortmannin to demonstrate the role of the PI3K pathway in the cAMP activation of TRPC6. It has been shown that LY294002, in addition to its action on PI3K, can directly inhibit the activity of Ca2+ channels (Cav1.2) (37Welling A. Hofmann F. Wegener J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether also LY294002 has a direct inhibitory effect on TRPC6. However, in our study, another PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin) and multiple MEK inhibitors also exerted a similar effect on the cAMP activation of TRPC6. Furthermore, a point mutation at the ERK site prevented the cAMP activation of TRPC6. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the PI3K-PKB-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway is involved. In conclusion, we have identified the cAMP-PI3K-MEK-ERK1/2 axis as a novel signaling pathway for TRPC6 activation. ERK1/2 phosphorylates at Ser-281 to activate TRPC6. We also found that the cAMP-PI3K-PKB-MEK-ERK1/2-TRPC6 signaling pathway plays a key role in glucagon-induced Ca2+ influx in renal glomerular mesangial cells.

In Alzheimer disease (AD), tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated, leading to neurofibrillary tangle formation and microtubule disruption, suggesting a loss of regulatory mechanisms controlling tau phosphorylation. Early growth response 1 (Egr-1) is a transcription factor that is significantly up-regulated in AD brain. The pathological significance of this up-regulation is not known. In this study, we found that lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Egr-1 in rat brain hippocampus and primary neurons in culture activates proline-directed kinase Cdk5, inactivates PP1, promotes tau phosphorylation at both proline-directed Ser396/404 and non-proline-directed Ser262 sites, and destabilizes microtubules. Furthermore, in Egr-1−/− mouse brain, Cdk5 activity was decreased, PP1 activity was increased, and tau phosphorylation was reduced at both proline-directed and non-proline-directed sites. By using nerve growth factor-exposed PC12 cells, we determined that Egr-1 activates Cdk5 to promote phosphorylation of tau and inactivates PP1 via phosphorylation. When Cdk5 was inhibited, tau phosphorylation at both proline- and non-proline directed sites and PP1 phosphorylation were blocked, indicating that Egr-1 acts through Cdk5. By using an in vitro kinase assay and HEK-293 cells transfected with tau, PP1, and Cdk5, we found that Cdk5 phosphorylates Ser396/404 directly. In addition, by phosphorylating and inactivating PP1, Cdk5 promotes tau phosphorylation at Ser262 indirectly. Our results indicate that Egr-1 is an in vivo regulator of tau phosphorylation and suggest that in AD brain increased levels of Egr-1 aberrantly activate an Egr-1/Cdk5/PP1 pathway, leading to accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, thus destabilizing the microtubule cytoskeleton.

https://openalex.org/W2090583156,"Eukaryotic cells utilize complex signaling systems to detect their environments, responding and adapting as new conditions arise during evolution. The basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is a leading cause of AIDS-related death worldwide and utilizes the calcineurin and protein kinase C-1 (Pkc1) signaling pathways for host adaptation and expression of virulence. In the present studies, a C-terminal zinc finger transcription factor, homologous both to the calcineurin-responsive zinc fingers (Crz1) of ascomycetes and to the Pkc1-dependent specificity protein-1 (Sp1) transcription factors of metazoans, was identified and named SP1 because of its greater similarity to the metazoan factors. Structurally, the Cryptococcus neoformans Sp1 (Cn Sp1) protein was found to have acquired an additional zinc finger motif from that of Crz1 and showed Pkc1-dependent phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and whole genome epistatic associations under starvation conditions. Transcriptional targets of Cn Sp1 shared functional similarities with Crz1 factors, such as cell wall synthesis, but gained the regulation of processes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including trehalose metabolism, and lost others, such as the induction of autophagy. In addition, overexpression of Cn Sp1 in a pkc1Δ mutant showed restoration of altered phenotypes involved in virulence, including cell wall stability, nitrosative stress, and extracellular capsule production. Cn Sp1 was also found to be important for virulence of the fungus using a mouse model. In summary, these data suggest an evolutionary shift in C-terminal zinc finger proteins during fungal evolution, transforming them from calcineurin-dependent to PKC1-dependent transcription factors, helping to shape the role of fungal pathogenesis of C. neoformans."
https://openalex.org/W2092995073,"Menaquinone (vitamin K2) serves as an electron carrier in the electron transport chain required for respiration in many pathogenic bacteria. Most bacteria utilize a common menaquinone biosynthetic pathway as exemplified by Escherichia coli. Recently, a novel biosynthetic pathway, the futalosine pathway, was discovered in Streptomyces. Bioinformatic analysis strongly suggests that this pathway is also operative in the human pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and Helicobacter pylori. Here, we provide compelling evidence that a modified futalosine pathway is operative in C. jejuni and that it utilizes 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine instead of futalosine. A key step in the Streptomyces pathway involves a nucleosidase called futalosine hydrolase. The closest homolog in C. jejuni has been annotated as a 5′-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (MTAN). We have shown that this C. jejuni enzyme has MTAN activity but negligible futalosine hydrolase activity. However, the C. jejuni MTAN is able to hydrolyze 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine at a rate comparable with that of its known substrates. This suggests that the adenine-containing version of futalosine is the true biosynthetic intermediate in this organism. To demonstrate this in vivo, we constructed a C. jejuni mutant strain deleted for mqnA2, which is predicted to encode for the enzyme required to synthesize 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine. Growth of this mutant was readily rescued by the addition of 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine, but not futalosine. This provides the first direct evidence that a modified futalosine pathway is operative in C. jejuni. It also highlights the tremendous versatility of the C. jejuni MTAN, which plays key roles in S-adenosylmethionine recycling, the biosynthesis of autoinducer molecules, and the biosynthesis of menaquinone.

Menaquinone (vitamin K2) is a lipid-soluble prenylated 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that plays a variety of roles in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (see Fig. 1). In humans, it serves as a cofactor that is required for the post-translational generation of γ-carboxyglutamate residues in proteins involved in blood coagulation, bone metabolism, and vascular physiology (1Furie B. Bouchard B.A. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria, it plays a key role as an electron carrier in the electron transport chain required for respiration (2Kurosu M. Begari E. Molecules. 2010; 15: 1531-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although most Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli use menaquinone under anaerobic conditions and ubiquinone under aerobic conditions, Gram-positive bacteria and many other Gram-negative bacteria rely on menaquinone as their sole electron carrier (3Unden G. Bongaerts J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 4Collins M.D. Jones D. Microbiol. Rev. 1981; 45: 316-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These include many pathogenic organisms such as Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (5Dhiman R.K. Mahapatra S. Slayden R.A. Boyne M.E. Lenaerts A. Hinshaw J.C. Angala S.K. Chatterjee D. Biswas K. Narayanasamy P. Kurosu M. Crick D.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6Marcelli S.W. Chang H.T.

Microbiol. 1990; 28: 395-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these organisms, menaquinone is required for survival. Because humans are unable to synthesize menaquinone, the bacterial enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of this vitamin serve as viable targets for the development of antibacterial compounds (2Kurosu M. Begari E. Molecules. 2010; 15: 1531-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Dairi T. J. Antibiot. 2009; 62: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of menaquinone in E. coli has been extensively studied (10Meganathan R. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 173-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bentley R. Meganathan R. Microbiol. Rev. 1982; 46: 241-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It begins with the compound chorismate, which is an intermediate in the shikimate pathway for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds (see Fig. 1). Five enzymes, MenB–MenF, generate the 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate core, and then MenA and MenG install the prenyl and methyl substituents to give menaquinone. In 2005, it was reported that various Streptomyces species lack orthologs of the menB–menF genes (12Borodina I. Krabben P. Nielsen J. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 820-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), suggesting that an entirely unique biosynthetic pathway is operative in these organisms. Interestingly, these genes are also absent in the pathogenic bacteria C. jejuni and H. pylori, even though these organisms are known to biosynthesize menaquinone (9Dairi T. J. Antibiot. 2009; 62: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Isotopic feeding studies confirmed that a unique pathway is employed in Streptomyces, and 1,4-dihydroxy-6-naphthoate (DHN) was implicated as an intermediate (see Fig. 1) (13Seto H. Jinnai Y. Hiratsuka T. Fukawa M. Furihata K. Itoh N. Dairi T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 5614-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This compound was demonstrated to recover the growth of a menaquinone auxotroph of Streptomyces coelicolor, providing strong evidence for this hypothesis. In 2008, Dairi and co-workers (14Hiratsuka T. Furihata K. Ishikawa J. Yamashita H. Itoh N. Seto H. Dairi T. Science. 2008; 321: 1670-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) reported the discovery of the alternate menaquinone biosynthetic pathway, or the futalosine pathway, and identified several of the genes in either S. coelicolor or Thermus thermophilus. They found that MqnA is involved in the early steps of futalosine biosynthesis, presumably utilizing chorismate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and inosine as precursors (Fig. 1). The enzyme futalosine hydrolase (MqnB or futalosine nucleosidase) then cleaves the hypoxanthine ring from futalosine to generate dehypoxanthinylfutalosine (DHFL). 4The abbreviations used are: DHFL, dehypoxanthinylfutalosine; MTAN, 5′-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase; MTA, 5′-methylthioadenosine. Finally, the enzymes MqnC and MqnD convert DHFL into 1,4-dihydroxy-6-naphthoate. Although the pathway was largely elucidated by generating S. coelicolor knock-out strains and isolating the intermediates that accumulated, in the case of futalosine hydrolase and MqnD, in vitro enzyme activity was demonstrated using recombinant T. thermophilus enzymes (15Hiratsuka T. Itoh N. Seto H. Dairi T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2009; 73: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Arai R. Murayama K. Uchikubo-Kamo T. Nishimoto M. Toyama M. Kuramitsu S. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. J. Struct. Biol. 2009; 168: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic analysis strongly implied that the futalosine pathway is also operative in the pathogenic organisms C. jejuni and H. pylori (9Dairi T. J. Antibiot. 2009; 62: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Hiratsuka T. Furihata K. Ishikawa J. Yamashita H. Itoh N. Seto H. Dairi T. Science. 2008; 321: 1670-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These bacteria lack homologs to the men genes of E. coli and possess homologs to the mqn genes of S. coelicolor. C. jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the developed world and has been implicated as a causative agent of the debilitating paralysis associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome (17Butzler J.P. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2004; 10: 868-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). H. pylori causes gastritis that can lead to peptic ulceration and gastric cancer (18van Amsterdam K. van Vliet A.H. Kusters J.G. van der Ende A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 131-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because these bacteria require menaquinone biosynthesis for survival and because they use a biosynthetic pathway that differs from that employed by other beneficial intestinal microbiota such as lactobacilli, these enzymes represent attractive targets for the development of specific antibacterial compounds that may exhibit minimal adverse side effects (2Kurosu M. Begari E. Molecules. 2010; 15: 1531-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Dairi T. J. Antibiot. 2009; 62: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe our efforts in establishing that a modified futalosine pathway is operative in C. jejuni and in identifying the hydrolase/nucleosidase that is used by this organism. We have found that, unlike S. coelicolor, C. jejuni utilizes the adenine-containing version of futalosine, or 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine, as an intermediate in menaquinone biosynthesis. Furthermore, the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond in this organism is the 5′-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (MTAN), which also plays roles in recycling by-products of S-adenosylmethionine-utilizing enzymes and in the biosynthesis of autoinducer molecules. Finally, we show that a C. jejuni deletion strain lacking an mqnA homolog (herein designated mqnA2) is auxotrophic for growth on 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine. This strongly supports the notion that the futalosine pathway for menaquinone biosynthesis is operative in C. jejuni and that the adenine-containing intermediate is utilized instead of the hypoxanthine-containing intermediate. 5′-Methylthioadenosine (MTA) and xanthine oxidase (Grade III, from bovine milk) were purchased from Sigma. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. 1H NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AV300 NMR spectrometer. Details regarding the synthetic procedures used to make 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine and the corresponding 1H NMR spectra are provided under supplemental “Materials and General Methods.” The cj0117 gene was amplified from C. jejuni (strain NCTC 11168) genomic DNA by PCR. The oligonucleotide primers, including overhangs for ligation-independent cloning, were 5′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCATGATGAAAATAGCAAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCTCATAATTTCTCGCACAT-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was cloned into a pET-30Xa/LIC vector (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting recombinant plasmid, which encodes an N-terminal His6 tag on the target C. jejuni MTAN protein, was amplified in NovaBlue GigaSingles competent E. coli cells (Novagen). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen), and these cells were grown on LB agar plates containing 30 mg/liter kanamycin at 37 °C. An individual colony was used to inoculate 10 ml of LB medium containing 30 mg/liter kanamycin, and this culture was incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 225 rpm for 12 h. The overnight culture was poured into 500 ml of LB medium containing 30 mg/liter kanamycin and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 225 rpm until an A600 of 0.6–0.8 was reached. The culture was allowed to continue growing for 4 h after 70 mg/liter isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce MTAN overexpression. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 30 min, and the pellets were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. To purify MTAN, a frozen cell pellet was thawed and resuspended in 10 ml of potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.0). The cells were lysed twice at 20,000 p.s.i. using a French pressure cell. The cell lysate was subsequently centrifuged at 6500 rpm for 30 min and passed through a 0.22-μm filter before affinity chromatography. A column containing 10 ml of chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare) was charged with 20 ml of 100 mm NiSO4 and then washed with 20 ml of distilled H2O and 30 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 5 mm imidazole. The filtered lysate was loaded onto the column and eluted with the same buffer containing increasing amounts of imidazole in a stepwise fashion (5, 125, and 500 mm). Fractions that eluted with 500 mm imidazole and showed absorbance at 280 nm were collected. These fractions were concentrated and buffer-exchanged into an appropriate reaction buffer using an Amicon Ultra-4 membrane filtration device (Mr 10,000 cutoff, Millipore) at 5000 rpm. Enzyme samples were stored at 5 °C and used within 24 h of purification. Samples of freshly purified C. jejuni MTAN (250 μg each) that had been subjected to buffer exchange into 50 mm NaH2PO4/D2O buffer (pD 7.0, 200 μl each) were added to solutions of MTA, futalosine, and 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine (3.4 mm each) in 800 μl of D2O (1-ml final volume). These samples were incubated at room temperature, and 1H NMR spectra were acquired at timed intervals to monitor the progress of the enzymatic reaction. Spectra taken of control reactions lacking enzyme showed no change over the course of several days at room temperature. The activity of C. jejuni MTAN was quantified by measuring the amount of adenine or hypoxanthine produced during the enzymatic reactions using a coupled spectrophotometric assay that employs xanthine oxidase (20Singh V. Evans G.B. Lenz D.H. Mason J.M. Clinch K. Mee S. Painter G.F. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Lee J.E. Howell P.L. Schramm V.L. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 429-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All kinetic assays were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (final volume of 1.0 ml, pH 7.0) containing 0.28 units of xanthine oxidase and a variable concentration of MTA (0.5–5 μm), 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine (0.5–5 and 150 μm), or futalosine (150 μm). Assay mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min before enzymatic reactions were initiated by the addition of a fixed amount of C. jejuni MTAN (50 ng for MTA and 200 ng for 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine or futalosine). Rates were measured by monitoring the increased absorbance at 305 nm (MTA and 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine) or at 290 nm (futalosine). Changes in absorbance were converted to changes in concentration using molar absorption coefficients of 15,400 m−1 cm−1 for the adenine assay and 12,200 m−1 cm−1 for the hypoxanthine assay. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting initial velocities to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraFit 7.0. cjj81176_1302, encoding a mqnA homolog we have designated mqnA2, was PCR-amplified from strain 81-176 genomic DNA using primers mqnA2KO-1 (5′-TCA TTG TAT CAA TCA TCC ATT GAT CG-3′) and mqnA2KO-2 (5′-TTG GCT CAG TTG TAG CAG ATG AAC-3′) and cloning the PCR product into the commercial vector pGEM-T (Promega). Inverse PCR was performed on the generated plasmid construct using primers mqnA2KO-3 (5′-AAA GAA TTC TTA AGA TAT ATA TGT AAA GG-3′) and mqnA2KO-4 (5′-AAA GGA TCC TTA AAG CGT TTT GTA AAG-3′). The resulting amplicon and plasmid pUC18K-2, carrying a non-polar kanamycin resistance cassette (aphA-3), were each digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. (Restriction site locations are underlined in the corresponding primers.) aphA-3 was ligated to the PCR amplicon to form plasmid pGEM-mqnA2::aphA-3. The E. coli-derived plasmid was delivered to strain 81-176 by natural transformation. Colonies were isolated on Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid, Hampshire, England) containing 5 μg/ml trimethoprim and 10 μg/ml vancomycin (MH-TV) and supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine. C. jejuni isolates harboring mqnA2 disrupted by the kanamycin resistance cassette were confirmed via PCR and sequencing analysis. Growth analyses were performed on plates with MH-TV containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin or supplemented with 100 μg/ml 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine, 100 μg/ml futalosine, or 100 μg/ml menaquinone-4 (Sigma). Our first approach toward identifying the futalosine pathway in C. jejuni involved cloning the putative futalosine hydrolase and determining whether it shows activity for synthetic futalosine. BLAST searches against the established futalosine hydrolases from S. coelicolor (KEGG entry SCO4327) and T. thermophilus (entry TTHA0556) showed only one reasonable candidate: a C. jejuni protein that was encoded by the cj0117 gene in C. jejuni strain 11168 (31 and 26% amino acid sequence identities, respectively). This protein had been annotated as a 5′-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (MTAN). MTAN is a nucleosidase that hydrolyzes the N-glycosidic bond in either MTA or S-adenosylhomocysteine and releases free adenine and 5′-methylthioribose or S-ribosylhomocysteine, respectively (Fig. 2) (23Duerre J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3737-3741Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 24Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Cornell K.A. Swarts W.E. Barry R.D. Riscoe M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). MTA is a by-product in the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent biosynthesis of polyamines such as spermidine, and MTAN serves to recycle it back into basic metabolic pathways. S-Adenosylhomocysteine is a by-product of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases and is converted into S-ribosylhomocysteine by MTAN. S-Ribosylhomocysteine then serves as a precursor to the quorum-sensing molecule autoinducer-2 (26Schauder S. Shokat K. Surette M.G. Bassler B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Because the cj0117 gene product shares sequence homology with this known nucleosidase, it seemed reasonable that it may function as a futalosine hydrolase, an MTAN, or both. The latter possibility seemed reasonable because MTAN is known to show substrate promiscuity and accept either MTA or S-adenosylhomocysteine, and the carboxylate of futalosine could occupy a position in the active site of MTAN that is analogous to that occupied by the carboxylate of S-adenosylhomocysteine. Furthermore, very potent inhibitors of MTAN are known that contain a phenyl ring positioned in a very similar manner to that of futalosine (e.g. inhibitor 1), indicating that the active site can accommodate a substrate with this functionality (20Singh V. Evans G.B. Lenz D.H. Mason J.M. Clinch K. Mee S. Painter G.F. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Lee J.E. Howell P.L. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18265-18273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We therefore cloned cj0117, expressed its gene product as a His-tagged protein, and purified the protein via ion affinity chromatography. We prepared futalosine using our previously described synthetic route from inosine (27Li X. Tanner M.E. Tetrahedron Lett. 2010; 51: 6463-6465Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using 1H NMR spectral analysis, we found that Cj0117 was active in catalyzing the hydrolysis of MTA but showed negligible activity (<5%) with futalosine under identical conditions. Thus, it appears that Cj0117 is a functional MTAN, but not a futalosine hydrolase. The absence of an alternate candidate to serve as a futalosine hydrolase in C. jejuni led us to suspect that futalosine is not an actual intermediate in menaquinone biosynthesis in this organism. Despite this uncertainty, it still appeared that the latter steps of the futalosine pathway are operative in C. jejuni, as homologs to MqnC and MqnD are present in the C. jejuni proteome. Notably, the putative MqnC (encoded by cj0462 in C. jejuni strain 11168) shares 44 and 41% amino acid sequence identities with the S. coelicolor and T. thermophilus enzymes, respectively. Therefore, we began to suspect that only the first steps in the futalosine pathway in C. jejuni involve an alternate intermediate. A clue to the nature of the true intermediate was found from previous mechanistic and structural studies on the E. coli MTAN. A kinetic isotope effect analysis showed that the enzyme utilizes a highly dissociative mechanism with a transition state that has considerable oxocarbenium ion character (Fig. 3) (28Singh V. Lee J.E. Núñez S. Howell P.L. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11647-11659Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis and structural studies have shown that there are three conserved residues that are absolutely essential for the activity of this enzyme: Glu-12, Glu-174, and Asp-197 (29Lee J.E. Luong W. Huang D.J. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11049-11057Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Lee J.E. Singh V. Evans G.B. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Cornell K.A.

Structure. 2001; 9: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Glu-12 is thought to serve as a general base and to deprotonate the water that ultimately attacks the oxocarbenium ion. Glu-174 forms key H-bonds with the ribose C-2′ and C-3′ hydroxyl groups and likely plays important roles in controlling electron density in the ribose ring and substrate positioning. Finally, Asp-197 forms two H-bonds with the departing adenine and likely plays the role of a general acid catalyst. To analyze the potential role of these residues in futalosine hydrolysis, we performed a sequence alignment between the E. coli and C. jejuni MTANs and the S. coelicolor and T. thermophilus futalosine hydrolases (Fig. 4) (33Papadopoulos J.S. Agarwala R. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). All three of the conserved E. coli MTAN residues aligned with their counterparts in the C. jejuni MTAN, consistent with its observed catalytic activity on MTA. In the case of the futalosine hydrolases, the residues corresponding to Glu-174 were present as anticipated, and it was not clear which residues played the role of Glu-12 as the N-terminal sequences differed significantly. Most interestingly, however, was the observation that an asparagine residue was present in place of Asp-197 in both of the futalosine hydrolases. This is significant because this residue interacts with the purine leaving group, and a key difference between futalosine and MTA is that the former possesses a hypoxanthine base and the latter possesses an adenine base. It is even more compelling when one considers that hypoxanthine exists primarily as the keto tautomer, whereas adenine exists as the enamine tautomer (34Medeiros G.C. Thomas Jr., G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 238: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This affects the H-bonding properties of the exocyclic heteroatom in the purine of futalosine so that it can function only as an H-bond acceptor. Thus, the interaction with an aspartate residue could not form the same bifunctional acceptor/donor H-bonding pattern described for MTAN catalysis. It therefore seems likely that MTAN-related nucleosidases that act on adenine-containing substrates retain the key aspartate; however, those that act on hypoxanthine-containing substrates replace it with an asparagine. An analysis of all MTAN homologs present in all sequenced genomes of Helicobacter or Campylobacter species indicated that the residue corresponding to Asp-197 is always conserved. This suggests that a modified futalosine pathway is operative in C. jejuni and H. pylori in which 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine is used in place of futalosine.FIGURE 4Alignment of the E. coli MTAN (EcMTAN), the C. jejuni MTAN (CjMTAN), the T. thermophilus futalosine hydrolase (TtMqnB), and the S. coelicolor futalosine hydrolase (ScMqnB).

Boldface residues with a gray background correspond to key active site residues identified in the E. coli MTAN and their corresponding conserved homologs. White residues with a black background indicate the replacement of the E. coli MTAN Glu-197 with Gln. Asterisks identify residues conserved in all four sequences. The alignment was performed using COBALT (33Papadopoulos J.S. Agarwala R. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test this hypothesis, it was necessary to synthesize authentic 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine. This was done using a procedure similar to that described for the synthesis of futalosine with the exception that the adenosine was used as the starting material (27Li X. Tanner M.E. Tetrahedron Lett. 2010; 51: 6463-6465Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The 6-amino group was protected as a bis-t-butoxycarbonyl derivative, and the 2′,3′-hydroxyl groups were protected with an acetonide moiety to give the known compound 2 (Fig. 5). A one-pot oxidation/Wittig procedure was then used to produce alkene 3 as the trans-isomer (35Ikejiri M. Ohshima T. Fukushima A. Shimotohno K. Maruyama T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008; 18: 4638-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Hydrogenation then provided a single isomer of compound 4. Removal of the acetonide and t-butoxycarbonyl protecting groups was achieved by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid, and hydrolysis of the methyl ester using LiOH generated 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine. With 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine in hand, it was possible to test whether it serves as a substrate for the C. jejuni MTAN. Monitoring an enzymatic incubation by 1H NMR spectroscopy (see supplemental “Materials and General Methods”) confirmed that 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine was converted into adenine and DHFL by MTAN. This suggests that the DHFL required for menaquinone biosynthesis in C. jejuni could be provided by the action of MTAN on 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine. To assess the catalytic efficiency of this process, we employed a coupled kinetic assay for adenine release that had previously been used in monitoring MTAN kinetics with MTA (20Singh V. Evans G.B. Lenz D.H. Mason J.M. Clinch K. Mee S. Painter G.F. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Lee J.E. Howell P.L. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18265-18273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The nucleosidase activity with 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine was found to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the kinetic constants obtained were kcat = 0.53 ± 0.03 s−1 and Km = 1.03 ± 0.12 μm (see supplemental “Materials and General Methods”). We also determined the activity of the C. jejuni MTAN against MTA and obtained kinetic constants of kcat = 2.7 ± 0.1 s−1 and Km = 0.93 ± 0.10 μm. The similarity of these values indicates that 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine is a good substrate for the C. jejuni MTAN and supports the notion that this activity may be biologically relevant. The same assay can be used to analyze for hypoxanthine release, so we reinvestigated the ability of MTAN to catalyze the hydrolysis of futalosine. Using 150 μm concentrations of substrates, we found that a low level of activity could be observed with futalosine; however, it was only 2% of that observed with 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine. We next wished to provide in vivo evidence that the modified futalosine pathway for menaquinone biosynthesis is operative in C. jejuni and that 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine is used in place of futalosine in this organism. We anticipated that a MqnA-like enzyme in C. jejuni would be involved in the biosynthesis of 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine, and therefore, a mutant lacking the gene encoding for this protein would grow only when supplemented with 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine, but not with futalosine. A search for homologs in the C. jejuni genome indicated that the gene products of cj1285c and cjj81176_1302, in C. jejuni strains 11168 and 81-176, respectively, are 99.6% identical to each other and share 26% sequence identity with MqnA from S. coelicolor. On the basis of our prediction that the C. jejuni MqnA-like enzyme would synthesize 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine instead of futalosine, we designated this gene mqnA2 and constructed a deletion mutant in C. jejuni 81-176 by replacing most of the mqnA2 open reading frame with a non-polar kanamycin resistance cassette (aphA-3) using double crossover homologous recombination (Fig. 6A). Mutant clones were selected on standard rich medium (Mueller-Hinton) plates supplemented with kanamycin and 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine. Mueller-Hinton plates containing either futalosine (Fig. 6B, upper) or 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine (Fig. 6B, lower) were streaked with both wild-type C. jejuni 81-176 and 81-176 ΔmqnA2. After 24 and 48 h, the wild type grew well on either plate, whereas growth of the ΔmqnA2 mutant was observed only in the presence of 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine. No growth was observed on unsupplemented plates (data not shown). This supports the hypothesis that cj1285c/cjj81176_1302 encodes MqnA2, which is required for the biosynthesis of 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine, and that an essential modified futalosine pathway is operative in C. jejuni. Very weak growth of the mutant strain on the futalosine plates was observed after 72 h of incubation. This is likely due to the slow hydrolysis of futalosine catalyzed by the C. jejuni MTAN (2% of the activity observed with either MTA or 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine). In contrast to the work with S. coelicolor, we could not restore growth of the mutant strain with commercially available menaquinone-4 (bearing a C20 prenyl side chain) (data not shown). This may be due to the insolubility of the compound and the resulting limited penetration of a very non-polar molecule across the outer membrane of the Gram-negative organism. It could also be due to a more stringent requirement for menaquinone bearing a C30 prenyl side chain, menaquinone-6, which is normally utilized by C. jejuni (36Carlone G.M. Anet F.A.L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 3385-3393PubMed Google Scholar). This study provides the first direct evidence that a modified futalosine pathway is operative in C. jejuni. A search for the gene encoding the putative futalosine hydrolase indicated that the C. jejuni MTAN was the most reasonable candidate to play this role. After finding that the C. jejuni MTAN catalyzed the hydrolysis of MTA, but not of futalosine, we began to suspect that the pathway in C. jejuni differed from that in S. coelicolor. An analysis of the active site architecture of the E. coli MTAN showed that a key aspartate residue, Asp-197, is required to act as an acid catalyst in promoting the departure of the adenine leaving group. This residue is present in all gene products annotated as MTANs in Helicobacter and Campylobacter species but was found to be an asparagine in the two identified futalosine hydrolases from S. coelicolor and T. thermophilus (14Hiratsuka T. Furihata K. Ishikawa J. Yamashita H. Itoh N. Seto H. Dairi T. Science. 2008; 321: 1670-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15Hiratsuka T. Itoh N. Seto H. Dairi T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2009; 73: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This suggested that an adenine-containing version of futalosine is the true intermediate in Helicobacter and Campylobacter species. Ultimately, we found that the C. jejuni MTAN could hydrolyze 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine, implying that this is the source of the DHFL used in menaquinone biosynthesis in this organism. The amino acid change implies that there are key differences in the mechanisms employed by the MTANs and the futalosine hydrolases. Because hypoxanthine is a better leaving group than adenine due to the more electronegative oxygen, it may not require an acid catalyst to depart; the H-bonding with an asparagine residue may be sufficient to promote catalysis. Alternatively, an as yet unidentified residue may serve as an acid catalyst in the futalosine hydrolases. A very recent report has also demonstrated that the H. pylori MTAN catalyzes the hydrolysis of 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine, but not of futalosine (37Arakawa C. Kuratsu M. Furihata K. Hiratsuka T. Itoh N. Seto H. Dairi T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2011; 55: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although in vivo studies and kinetics were not reported, the authors proposed that this is the true biosynthetic intermediate in that organism. Our in vivo studies in C. jejuni have demonstrated that the mqnA2 gene is required for the biosynthesis of 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine and that this activity is essential for growth of the organism. Together with the studies on S. coelicolor, this strongly suggests that menaquinone is biosynthesized in C. jejuni and H. pylori via a modified futalosine pathway. This also implicates menaquinone biosynthetic enzymes as viable targets for the development of antibacterials directed against C. jejuni and H. pylori. This work points out the truly remarkable number of roles that MTAN plays in these pathogenic bacteria. The enzyme displays a great deal of flexibility in regard to the nature of the group attached to the 5′-position of the substrate ribose moiety yet appears to be quite specific in regard to the nature of the nucleoside base. It hydrolyzes MTA in its role in recycling the by-products of the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent biosynthesis of spermidine (38Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Schramm V.L. Singh V. Tyler P.C. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 3275-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It also hydrolyzes S-adenosylhomocysteine in its role in the biosynthesis of the quorum-sensing molecule autoinducer-2, which is generated in both C. jejuni and H. pylori (39Quiñones B. Miller W.G. Bates A.H. Mandrell R.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Rader B.A. Campagna S.R. Semmelhack M.F. Bassler B.L. Guillemin K. J.

Finally, as we have shown in this work, MTAN plays an essential role in the hydrolysis of 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine, an activity that has been implicated as a requirement for menaquinone biosynthesis. Thus, this multifunctional enzyme may serve as the Achilles' heel of these pathogens, and the very potent MTAN inhibitors that are already available from work with the E. coli enzyme may serve as effective antibacterial agents. Given the multiple important biological roles of MTAN, it may be difficult for resistance mechanisms to develop. Download .pdf (.63 MB) Help with pdf files"

To describe factors involved in muscle mass regulation, we investigated the phosphorylation and expression of key factors in these protein synthesis and breakdown signaling pathways in thigh skeletal muscle of critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients compared with healthy controls. Methodology/Principal Findings ICU patients were systemically inflamed, moderately hyperglycemic, received insulin therapy, and showed a tendency to lower plasma branched chain amino acids compared with controls. Using Western blotting we measured Akt, GSK3β, mTOR, ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6k), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), and muscle ring finger protein 1 (MuRF1); and by RT-PCR we determined mRNA expression of, among others, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), FoxO 1, 3 and 4, atrogin1, MuRF1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and myostatin. Unexpectedly, in critically ill ICU patients Akt-mTOR-S6k signaling was substantially higher compared with controls. FoxO1 mRNA was higher in patients, whereas FoxO3, atrogin1 and myostatin mRNAs and MuRF1 protein were lower compared with controls. A moderate correlation (r2 = 0.36, p<0.05) between insulin infusion dose and phosphorylated Akt was demonstrated. Conclusions/Significance We present for the first time muscle protein turnover signaling in critically ill ICU patients, and we show signaling pathway activity towards a stimulation of muscle protein synthesis and a somewhat inhibited proteolysis."

We used ChIP-chip analysis in mouse primary T cells and a T cell hybridoma to define the regulatory enhancers responsible for this up-regulation and to characterize their properties. Elevated H3/H4 acetylation and increased RNA polymerase II density were evident at mRL-D5, a known enhancer located 76 kb upstream of the TSS, as well as at a cluster of regulatory sites located even further upstream between −123 to −156 kb, termed the T cell control region (TCCR). Based upon the ability of calcium signaling and MAPK inhibitors to block Rankl expression, we conducted further ChIP-chip analysis of the transcriptional mediators c-Fos, NF-κB, and Nfat. T cell activation induced c-Fos binding at the mRL-D5 enhancer and within the TCCR. The interaction of NF-κB was observed at the transcriptional start site and at mRL-D5. Both mRL-D5 and segments of the TCCR exhibited robust transcriptional activity in reporter assays, and site-specific mutagenesis of c-Fos and Nfat elements abrogated reporter activity, suggesting a role for both factors in the control of enhancer-mediated Rankl transcription. Finally, chromosome conformation capture analysis confirmed that mRL-D5 and segments of the TCCR were located in proximity to the Rankl gene promoter and thus potentially able to influence directly Rankl gene promoter activity.

https://openalex.org/W2040504060,"The RASSF1A tumor suppressor binds and activates proapoptotic MST kinases. The Salvador adaptor protein couples MST kinases to the LATS kinases to form the hippo pathway. Upon activation by RASSF1A, LATS1 phosphorylates the transcriptional regulator YAP, which binds to p73 and activates its proapoptotic effects. However, although serving as an adaptor for MST and LATS, Salvador can also bind RASSF1A. The functional role of the RASSF1A/Salvador interaction is unclear. Although Salvador is a novel tumor suppressor in Drosophila and mice, its role in human systems remains largely unknown. Here we show that Salvador promotes apoptosis in human cells and that Salvador inactivation deregulates the cell cycle and enhances the transformed phenotype. Moreover, we show that although the salvador gene is seldom mutated or epigenetically inactivated in human cancers, it is frequently down-regulated posttranscriptionally. Surprisingly, we also find that although RASSF1A requires the presence of Salvador for full apoptotic activity and to activate p73, this effect does not require a direct interaction of RASSF1A with MST kinases or the activation of the hippo pathway. Thus, we confirm a role for Salvador as a human tumor suppressor and RASSF1A effector and show that Salvador allows RASSF1A to modulate p73 independently of the hippo pathway."

Cisplatin-mediated induction of STK17A in the EC cell line NT2/D1 was prevented with p53 siRNA. Furthermore, STK17A was induced with cisplatin in HCT116 and MCF10A cells but to a much lesser extent in isogenic p53-suppressed cells. A functional p53 response element that binds endogenous p53 in a cisplatin-dependent manner was identified 5 kb upstream of the first coding exon of STK17A. STK17A is not present in the mouse genome, but the closely related gene STK17B is induced with cisplatin in mouse NIH3T3 cells, although this induction is p53-independent. Interestingly, in human cells containing both STK17A and STK17B, only STK17A is induced with cisplatin.

The p53 tumor suppressor plays a pivotal role in preventing tumor formation and is induced in response to a variety of cellular stresses, including DNA damage leading mainly to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest (1Zilfou J.T. Lowe S.W. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1: a001883Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Other recognized actions of p53 involve regulation of genomic stability, DNA repair, senescence, autophagy, reactive oxygen generation, and metabolism (1Zilfou J.T. Lowe S.W. Cold Spring Harb.

The actions of p53 are mainly mediated by its potent transcriptional regulation of specific target genes. Because p53 is highly induced during the DNA damage response, it has a major, yet still not completely understood, role in determining whether cancer cells live or die with cytotoxic therapies. Furthermore, p53 regulation and downstream target gene activation may be cell type- and context-dependent, making it difficult to unravel the complete p53 transcriptional network (3Beckerman R. Prives C. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a000935Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar).

Using microarray analysis, we previously discovered that the transcriptional response to cisplatin in embryonal carcinoma cells is dominated by the induction of p53 target genes (9Kerley-Hamilton J.S. Pike A.M. Li N. DiRenzo J. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6090-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition to many well known direct p53 target genes, there were several cisplatin-induced genes previously unassociated with p53, including the serine/threonine kinase 17A (STK17A). STK17A is a member of the death-associated protein (DAP) family of serine/threonine protein kinases that includes the prototypic family member DAPK1 along with DAPK2 and DAPK3 (zipper-interacting protein kinase) (10Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 11Lin Y. Hupp T.R. Stevens C.

STK17A (DRAK1) and STK17B (DRAK2) are more distantly related and less characterized members of the DAPK family (13Sanjo H. Kawai T. Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29066-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). DAPK1 has been linked to several cell death-related signaling pathways, including those resulting in autophagic and apoptotic cell death, and DAPK1 expression is repressed in a variety of cancers (10Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 11Lin Y. Hupp T.R. Stevens C.

Despite many proposed pathways and substrates, the precise mechanism(s) by which DAP family kinases induce cell death, including the key substrates that are phosphorylated, requires further elucidation. In contrast to DAPK1, there is substantially less evidence to associate STK17A and STK17B with apoptosis or cell death. Although possessing moderate homology in the catalytic kinase domain, STK17A and STK17B both lack the death domain and the Ca2+/calmodulin regulatory domain of DAPK1 (10Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 11Lin Y. Hupp T.R. Stevens C. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Michie A.M. McCaig A.M.

One prior report demonstrated that overexpression of STK17A in NIH3T3 cells negatively impacted colony formation, implying that STK17A may also possess prodeath activity (13Sanjo H. Kawai T. Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29066-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Interestingly, STK17A is present near a chromosomal breakpoint region between human and rodents and is not present in the mouse or rat genome (14Fitzgerald J. Bateman J.F. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Knock-out of STK17B in the mouse suggests that this protein negatively regulates T cell activation but appears not to directly regulate apoptosis in this setting (15McGargill M.A. Wen B.G. Walsh C.M. Hedrick S.M. Immunity. 2004; 21: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Gatzka M. Newton R.H. Walsh C.M. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that STK17A is a novel, direct target gene of p53. STK17A was up-regulated by the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin in various cell lines in a p53-dependent manner, and p53 directly bound to an upstream element in the STK17A gene. Knockdown of STK17A in human embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells resulted in cisplatin resistance associated with increased expression of detoxifying and antioxidant genes and decreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), demonstrating that STK17A plays a role in mediating cisplatin toxicity in TGCTs. NT2/D1, U2OS, 293T, and NIH3T3 (American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC)) were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with glutamine and antibiotics. The derivation of the NT2/D1 resistant cell line NT2/D1-R1 was described previously (17Curtin J.C. Dragnev K.H. Sekula D. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. Spinella M.J.

The glioblastoma cell line A172 was cultured in DMEM and 5% serum and was a kind gift from Dr. M. Israel (Dartmouth Medical School). Cisplatin (Bristol Laboratories Ltd.) treatments were performed at the concentrations and time points indicated. Reverse transcription was performed on 1 μg of RNA using the TaqMan RT kit (Applied Biosystems). The cDNA (20 ng) was used with SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) for quantitative real time PCR assays using the ΔΔCt method normalized to GAPDH and the ABI Prism Sequence Detection System 7700. Primers are provided in supplemental Table S1. For Western analysis, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (9Kerley-Hamilton J.S. Pike A.M. Li N. DiRenzo J. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6090-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Antibodies to STK17A (IMG-157-1, Imgenex), p53 (DO-1, sc0126, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and actin (C-11, sc01615, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used. Briefly, 1 × 107 cells/15-cm dish were treated for 6 h with 2.0 μm cisplatin and 10 h later fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in ChIP lysis buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors and sonicated on ice for 11 × 15-s pulses with 20% amplitude on a Vibra Cell sonicator (Danbury, CT). Diluted samples were incubated overnight with p53 DO-1 or mouse IgG control antibodies (sc2025, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) prebound to G protein-coupled Dynabeads (Invitrogen). Following wash steps, antibody complexes were eluted and incubated for 65 °C overnight, and DNA was then purified using the QIAquick PCR amplification kit (Qiagen). Enrichment for target sequences was performed using real time PCR normalized to 10% input. Primers are provided in supplemental Table S1. A 350-bp fragment containing STK17Ap53RE1 and located 5.0 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of human STK17A was generated by PCR using genomic DNA from NT2/D1 cells and primers 5′-TTGCTCCTTATCTAGGCTCCTTA and 5′-GATGGAGTCTACTCCTGTTGAGA. The product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and then inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of TK-Luc (kindly provided by Dr. J. DiRenzo, Dartmouth Medical School) to generate STK-TK-Luc. A version of STK-TK-Luc in which p53RE1 was mutated from GGGCATGCTCAGGCAAGTCC to GGGaATaCTCAGGaAAaTCC (where lowercase letters indicate the mutations) was constructed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). All constructs were sequence-confirmed. Cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate. FuGENE transfections were performed with 0.6 μg of reporter, 0.2 μg of Renilla TK and 0.5 μg of either p53 expression plasmid, dominant-negative p53 (DN-p53) (17Curtin J.C. Dragnev K.H. Sekula D. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2559-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), or empty vector control. Cells were harvested 24 h following transfection, and Dual-Luciferase reporter analyses were performed (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized against Renilla activity. Lentiviral silencing shRNAs targeting human STK17A (TRCN0976, STK17Ash1 and TRCN0975, STK17Ash2) were purchased from Open Biosystems along with pLKO.1 control. Lentiviral stocks were generated from 293T cells as described previously (20Beyrouthy M.J. Garner K.M. Hever M.P. Freemantle S.J. Eastman A. Dmitrovsky E. Spinella M.J. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 9360-9366Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). NT2/D1 cells were cultured with lentiviral stocks for 24 h, and stable pools were selected with 1.0 μg/ml puromycin. Two independent siRNAs were designed that target sequences AAGACUCCAGUGGUAAUCUAC and CGGCAUGAACCGGAGGCCCAU of human p53 in NT2/D1 cells and GAAUGAGGCCUUAGAGUUAUU and UAACUCUAAGGCCUCAUUCUU of mouse p53 in NIH3T3 cells (Dharmacon). A final concentration of 120 nm siRNA was transfected using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (21Kerley-Hamilton J.S. Pike A.M. Hutchinson J.A. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1769: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The siRNA duplex control used was the Scramble II sequence (Dharmacon). Cell proliferation and survival were assessed with Cell-Titer Glo (Promega). Cells were plated at 5 × 104/well of a 6-well plate and the next day treated with the indicated dosages of cisplatin for 3 days. For acute treatments, cells were treated with cisplatin for 6 h and then assayed 3 days later. For cell cycle analysis, 7 × 105 cells/10-cm dish were treated the next day with cisplatin for 6 h and assayed 24 h later. For continuous treatment, 5 × 105 cells were treated with cisplatin for 3 days. Adherent and floating cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained for 4 h with propidium iodide prior to analysis on a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer. The percentage of cells with sub-G1 DNA was determined using CellQuest software. For ROS detection, cells were incubated with 10 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% serum. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in PBS; fluorescence was measured using a BD Biosciences FACScan; and data were analyzed with CellQuest software. The human STK17A cDNA was purchased from Origene (SC323411) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1. 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 24 h later assayed for ROS generation as described above. Total RNA was isolated with TRI Reagent. Hybridization was performed according to Illumina guidelines using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip array, which provides coverage for more than 47,000 transcripts and known splice variants across the human transcriptome. NT2-PLK and NT2-STK17Ash2 cells were hybridized in biological duplicate. Raw data were normalized using the quantile method utilizing GenomeStudio software. Comparing the average of duplicate normalized intensity values yielded 126 transcripts up-regulated 1.5-fold or greater (range, 1.5–3.7-fold) and 209 transcripts down-regulated 1.5 or greater (range, 1.5–3.4-fold). The genes in Table 1 were selected from the 126 up-regulated genes. The lists of genes can be provided upon request.TABLE 1Genes induced with STK17A knockdown in NT2/D1 cells Open table in a new tab When a value for statistical significance is provided, a two-sample, two-tailed t test assuming unequal variance was performed. Testicular cancer patients can be cured with cisplatin-based chemotherapy even when the disease is highly metastatic (4Einhorn L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4592-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In prior studies, it was shown that acute treatment of the testicular cancer-derived human EC cell line NT2/D1 with cisplatin mediates a transcriptional response dominated by the up-regulation of known p53 target genes (9Kerley-Hamilton J.S. Pike A.M. Li N. DiRenzo J. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6090-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One gene up-regulated in the screen but not previously known to be a p53 target gene was the poorly characterized DAP family kinase STK17A. Because it has been suggested that p53 may be an important mediator of chemotherapeutic toxicity in testicular cancer and other tumor types and because DAPK family members have previously been associate with apoptosis, it was investigated whether STK17A is a direct target of p53 in EC and other tumor cells. Cisplatin induced STK17A in a dose-dependent manner in NT2/D1 cells but not in a cisplatin-resistant derivative, NT2/D1-R1, previously shown to have a defect in p53 signaling (Fig. 1A) (17Curtin J.C. Dragnev K.H. Sekula D. Christie A.J. Dmitrovsky E. Spinella M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2559-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the STK17A homolog STK17B was not induced with cisplatin in NT2/D1 cells (Fig. 1A). Importantly, STK17A but not STK17B was also induced in human osteosarcoma U20S and human glioblastoma A172 cells (Fig. 1, B and 1C). STK17A is missing from the mouse and rat genomes likely due to a consequence of it residing at an evolutionary chromosome rearrangement (14Fitzgerald J. Bateman J.F. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in mouse NIH3T3 and mouse ED1 cells, STK17B was significantly induced with cisplatin (Fig. 1, D and E). Importantly, cisplatin induction of STK17A protein also occurred in NT2/D1 and A172 cells (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, STK17A was also induced with the DNA-damaging agents vinblastine, doxorubicin, and etoposide (supplemental Fig. S1). These data indicate that STK17A is inducible upon genotoxic stress in multiple cell contexts and suggests that DNA damage-mediated induction of STK17B may compensate for the absence of STK17A in mouse cells. To investigate the p53 dependence of cisplatin-mediated STK17A and STK17B induction, several isogenic systems of p53 repression were used. Cisplatin induction of STK17A was substantially repressed in NT2/D1 cells treated with two independent p53 siRNAs to a degree similar to that of the known p53 target gene p21 (Fig. 2A). STK17A was induced with cisplatin in HCT116p53+/+ cells; however, induction was greatly diminished in the p53-deleted cell line HCT116p53−/−, again similar to the pattern of p21 expression (Fig. 2B). Similar results suggesting that STK17A induction is p53-dependent were obtained in MCF10A cells either expressing wild-type p53 or stably expressing shRNA to p53 (MCF10A/Δp53) (supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast to the situation with STK17A, STK17B expression was unaffected by cisplatin in both HCT116p53+/+ and HCT116p53−/− cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the cisplatin induction of mouse STK17B in NIH3T3 cells was unaffected by p53 siRNA treatment that efficiently repressed p21 induction (Fig. 2C). Thus, cisplatin induction of STK17A is p53-dependent in a variety of cell contexts in contrast to the induction of mouse STK17B in NIH3T3 cells. The p53MH algorithm was used to search for p53 binding sites within the human STK17A gene (22Hoh J. Jin S. Parrado T. Edington J. Levine A.J. Ott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In total, 62 kb of sequence was interrogated, including all STK17A exons and introns and 12 and 5 kb of 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequence, respectively. A 100% consensus matching p53-responsive element (STK17A-p53RE1) was found 5.0 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of STK17A (Figs. 3A and 4B). Importantly, this site has no gap between the two p53 binding half-sites, which is the situation for the vast majority of p53 sites found with genome-wide p53 ChIP sequencing analysis (23Wei C.L. Wu Q. Vega V.B. Chiu K.P. Ng P. Zhang T. Shahab A. Yong H.C. Fu Y. Weng Z. Liu J. Zhao X.D. Chew J.L. Lee Y.L. Kuznetsov V.A. Sung W.K. Miller L.D. Lim B. Liu E.T. Yu Q. Ng H.H. Ruan Y. Cell. 2006; 124: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). In addition, four weaker intronic consensus sites were found (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S2). Interestingly STK17A-p53RE1 is within a region predicted to be an enhancer based on the presence of the H3K4Me1 histone mark (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, STK17A-p53RE1 was within a site identified by Wei et al. (23Wei C.L. Wu Q. Vega V.B. Chiu K.P. Ng P. Zhang T. Shahab A. Yong H.C. Fu Y. Weng Z. Liu J. Zhao X.D. Chew J.L. Lee Y.L.

We could not find a p53 consensus binding sequence within the only other predicted p53 ChIP-PET from that study, although this ChIP-PET is ∼2 kb from STK17A-p53RE2 (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 4STK17A contains a functional p53-responsive element.

This -fold enrichment in binding increased to up to 45-fold in the presence of cisplatin (Fig. 3B). No enrichment of the STK17A-p53RE1 fragment was obtained with a control IgG antibody, and there was no binding of p53 detected in a region 30 kb upstream of the STK17A gene (Fig. 3B). The known p53 target gene p21 was used as a positive control and showed considerably more p53 binding compared with STK17A-p53RE1. However, this difference in ChIP signal is also seen with many other p53 target genes as a result of the very tight binding of p53 to the p21 enhancer (23Wei C.L. Wu Q. Vega V.B. Chiu K.P. Ng P. Zhang T. Shahab A. Yong H.C. Fu Y. Weng Z. Liu J. Zhao X.D. Chew J.L. Lee Y.L. Kuznetsov V.A. Sung W.K. Miller L.D. Lim B. Liu E.T. Yu Q. Ng H.H. Ruan Y. Cell. 2006; 124: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). In a direct comparison of STK17A-p53REs, p53 bound only to STK17A-p53RE1, and this binding was similar in extent to the binding of p53 to the previously characterized p53RE of the direct p53 target gene PLK2 (Fig. 3C) (23Wei C.L. Wu Q. Vega V.B. Chiu K.P. Ng P. Zhang T. Shahab A. Yong H.C. Fu Y. Weng Z. Liu J. Zhao X.D. Chew J.L. Lee Y.L. Kuznetsov V.A. Sung W.K. Miller L.D. Lim B. Liu E.T. Yu Q. Ng H.H. Ruan Y. Cell. 2006; 124: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Two gene desert regions were used as additional negative controls. We cloned a 350-bp region containing STK17A-p53RE1 in front of the basal thymidine kinase promoter driving luciferase expression. HCT116p53+/+ and HCT116p53−/− cells were transfected with either control reporter (TK-Luc) or the STK17A reporter construct (STK-TK-Luc). Only in HCT116p53+/+ cells did STK-TK-Luc have appreciable activity above that of the control reporter, and the activity was substantially repressed with addition of DN-p53 (Fig. 4A). STK17A-TK-Luc also had activity in p53 wild type-containing NT2/D1 cells that was again inhibited by DN-p53. Mutating four bases in the p53 binding motif of STK17A-RE1 abolished this activity (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, STK17A-Luc demonstrated activity similar to that of the TK-Luc control and STK17A-Luc-Mut reporters in human glioblastoma cells harboring mutant p53, and transfection of wild-type p53 increased activity only in cells transfected with the intact STK17-p53RE1 reporter. The reporter data, together with the above ChIP results, establish that STK17A-p53RE1 is a functional p53-responsive element in the STK17A gene, thereby strongly indicating that STK17A is a novel and direct p53 target gene. EC cells are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents that are associated with curability of testicular cancer (24Spierings D.C. de Vries E.G. Vellenga E. de Jong S. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To assess the importance of STK17A in the response of EC cells to cisplatin, NT2/D1 cells with stable shRNA knockdown of STK17A were generated. STK17Ash2 efficiently knocked down both basal and cisplatin-induced expression of STK17A, whereas STK17Ash1 gave an intermediate effect that was more pronounced at the level of protein expression (Fig. 5, A and B). STK17A knockdown resulted in decreased sensitivity to cisplatin in NT2/D1 cells as demonstrated by increased proliferation and survival of STK17Ash2 cells compared with control cells with STK17Ash1 cells demonstrating an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 5C). The increase in cell number in STK17Ash2 cells was seen with both continuous (3-day) (Fig. 5C) and acute (6-h) cisplatin treatments (data not shown) and was reproducibly demonstrated utilizing three separately derived selections of STK17Ash lentiviral cells. It was apparent that the increase in cell number with cisplatin in STK17Ash2 cells was in large part due to a decrease in cell death by the observation of fewer floating cells in the medium. There was a substantial decrease in apoptosis in STK17Ash2 cells after cisplatin treatment compared with controls as assessed by the level of cells with sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 6, A and B). The decrease in apoptosis in STK17Ash2 cells was seen under both continuous (3-day) and acute (6-h) cisplatin treatments (Fig. 6, A and B). Furthermore, the G2 arrest seen with cisplatin treatment was similar in STK17Ash2 and control cells, indicating that STK17A knockdown does not greatly alter DNA damage-activa"
https://openalex.org/W2030825644,"TRPM7, a divalent cation channel, plays an important role in neurons damaged from cerebral ischemia due to permitting intracellular calcium overload. This study aimed to explore whether magnesium was transported via a TRPM7 channel into the intracellular space of rat hippocampal neurons after 1 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and acute chemical ischemia (CI) by using methods of the Mg(2+) fluorescent probe Mag-Fura-2 to detect intracellular magnesium concentration ([Mg(2+)](i)) and flame atomic absorption spectrometry to measure extracellular magnesium concentration ([Mg(2+)](o)). The results showed that the neuronal [Mg(2+)](i) was 1.51-fold higher after 1 h of OGD at a basal level, and the increase of neuronal [Mg(2+)](i) reached a peak after 1 h of OGD and was kept for 60 min with re-oxygenation. Meanwhile, the [Mg(2+)](o) decreased after 1 h of OGD and recovered to the pre-ischemic level within 15 min after re-oxygenation. In the case of CI, the [Mg(2+)](i) peak immediately appeared in hippocampal neurons. This increase of [Mg(2+)](i) declined by removing extracellular magnesium in OGD or CI. Furthermore, by using Gd(3+) or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate to inhibit TRPM7 channels, the [Mg(2+)](i) increase, which was induced by OGD or CI, was attenuated without altering the basal level of [Mg(2+)](i). By silencing TRPM7 with shRNA in hippocampal neurons, it was found that not only was the increase of [Mg(2+)](i) induced by OGD or CI but also the basal levels of [Mg(2+)](i) were attenuated. In contrast, overexpression of TRPM7 in HEK293 cells exaggerated both the basal levels and increased [Mg(2+)](i) after 1 h of OGD/CI. These results suggest that anoxia induced the increase of [Mg(2+)](i) via TRPM7 channels in rat hippocampal neurons."

Here we designed a recombinant antigen, designated NCM, which comprises the N- and C-terminal heptad repeats that can form a six-helix bundle (6HB) core and the MPER domain of gp41. Two mutations (T569A and I675V) previously reported to expose the neutralization epitopes were introduced into NCM to generate mutants named NCM(TA), NCM(IV), and NCM(TAIV). Our results showed that NCM and its mutants could react with antibodies specific for 6HB and MPER of gp41, suggesting that these antigens are in the form of a trimer of heterodimer (i.e., 6HB) with three exposed MPER tails. Antigen with double mutations, NCM(TAIV), elicited much stronger antibody response in rabbits than immunogens with single mutation, NCM(TA) and NCM(IV), or no mutation, NCM. The purified MPER-specific antibodies induced by NCM(TAIV) exhibited broad neutralizing activity, while the purified 6HB-specific antibodies showed no detectable neutralizing activity. Our recombinant antigen design supported by an investigation of its underlying molecular mechanisms provides a strong scientific platform for the discovery of a gp41 MPER-based AIDS vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2037193756,"A variety of environmental, carcinogenic, and chemotherapeutic agents form bulky lesions on DNA that activate DNA damage checkpoint signaling pathways in human cells. To identify the mechanisms by which bulky DNA adducts induce damage signaling, we developed an in vitro assay using mammalian cell nuclear extract and plasmid DNA containing bulky adducts formed by N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene or benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide. Using this cell-free system together with a variety of pharmacological, genetic, and biochemical approaches, we identified the DNA damage response kinases DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) as bulky DNA damage-stimulated kinases that phosphorylate physiologically important residues on the checkpoint proteins p53, Chk1, and RPA. Consistent with these results, purified DNA-PK and ATM were directly stimulated by bulky adduct-containing DNA and preferentially associated with damaged DNA in vitro. Because the DNA damage response kinase ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) is also stimulated by bulky DNA adducts, we conclude that a common biochemical mechanism exists for activation of DNA-PK, ATM, and ATR by bulky adduct-containing DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2080798229,"PTP1B is a protein tyrosine-phosphatase located on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum that plays an important role in the regulation of the insulin receptor (IR). Replacement of the conserved Asp-181 by alanine is known to convert PTP1B into a substrate-trapping protein that binds to but cannot dephosphorylate its substrates. In this work, we have studied the effect of an additional mutation (Y46F) on the substrate-trapping efficiency of PTP1B-D181A. We observed that this mutation converts PTP1B-D181A into a highly efficient substrate-trapping mutant, resulting in much higher recovery of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins coimmunoprecipitated with PTP1B. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments were also performed to compare the dynamics of interaction of the IR with these mutants. Basal BRET, which mainly reflects the interaction of PTP1B with the IR precursor during its biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, was markedly increased with the PTP1B-D181A-Y46F mutant. In contrast, insulin-induced BRET was markedly reduced with PTP1B-D181A-Y46F. I125 insulin binding experiments indicated that PTP1B-D181-Y46F reduced the expression of IR at the plasma membrane. Reduced expression at the cell surface was associated with higher amounts of the uncleaved IR precursor in the cell. Moreover, we observed that substantial amounts of the uncleaved IR precursor reached the Tris-phosphorylated, fully activated form in an insulin independent fashion. These results support the notion that PTP1B plays a crucial role in the control of the activity of the IR precursor during its biosynthesis.

Insulin exerts its biological effects through a plasma membrane receptor that possesses a tyrosine kinase activity. Binding of insulin to its receptor induces autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) on tyrosine residues (1Combettes-Souverain M. Issad T. Diabetes. Metab. 1998; 24: 477-489PubMed Google Scholar). This stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity of the IR toward intracellular substrates involved in the transmission of the signal (1Combettes-Souverain M. Issad T. Diabetes. Metab. 1998; 24: 477-489PubMed Google Scholar, 2Virkamäki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tyrosines 1158, 1162, and 1163, located in the kinase domain of the IR, is known to play a crucial role in the regulation of the activity of the receptor (3Ellis L. Clauser E.

Termination of the signal involves inactivation of the IR kinase by dephosphorylation of these tyrosines by protein tyrosine phosphatases (6King M.J. Sharma R.P. Sale G.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several PTPases 2The abbreviations used are: PTPase, protein tyrosine phosphatase; IR, insulin receptor; PTP1B, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Rluc, Renilla luciferase; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. , including PTP1B, PTPα, PTPϵ, leukocyte common antigen-related, and T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase, have been implicated in the regulation of the IR activity (7Goldstein B.J.

Among them, PTP1B appears to play a major role in the control of insulin action. PTP1B is localized predominantly on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by means of a hydrophobic C-terminal targeting sequence (11Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Involvement of PTP1B in insulin signaling was initially suggested by experiments in Xenopus oocytes (12Cicirelli M.F. Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Weiel J.E. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5514-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and in cultured cells (13Ahmad F. Li P.M. Meyerovitch J. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol.

Definitive evidence of the implication of PTP1B in insulin signaling was obtained with PTP1B knockout in mice, which resulted in a marked increase in insulin sensitivity associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR and insulin receptor substrate-1 in liver and skeletal muscle (15Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Therefore, PTP1B clearly appears as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of insulin resistance (17Issad T. Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Pernet K. Diabetes Metab. 2003; 29: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, although PTP1B has been shown to directly interact with the IR, the regulation of this interaction in living cells remains poorly studied. We previously developed a procedure (18Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) based on the BRET methodology that allows the study in real time, in living cells, of the interaction of the IR with a substrate-trapping version of PTP1B (PTP1B-D181A). We demonstrated that insulin induced a rapid and dose-dependent increase of the interaction between the IR and PTP1B. We also observed, in the absence of insulin, the presence of a substantial interaction between the IR and PTP1B (basal BRET signal). Cell fractionation experiments indicated that this basal BRET signal could be attributed to the interaction of PTP1B with the IR precursor during its biosynthesis in the ER (18Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This result was thereafter confirmed in experiments using FRET instead of BRET (19Romsicki Y. Reece M. Gauthier J.Y. Asante-Appiah E. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12868-12875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1B may regulate its activity (20Bandyopadhyay D. Kusari A. Kenner K.A. Liu F. Chernoff J. Gustafson T.A. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1639-1645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 21Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22Tao J. Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29520-29525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Indeed, PTP1B was shown to be phosphorylated on tyrosines 66, 152, and/or 153 in an insulin-dependent manner, and replacement of these tyrosines by phenylalanine appears to affect its interaction with the IR (20Bandyopadhyay D. Kusari A. Kenner K.A. Liu F. Chernoff J. Gustafson T.A. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1639-1645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Tyr-46, located in the catalytic cleft of PTP1B, is highly conserved among protein tyrosine phosphatases. This tyrosine is believed to be important to define the specificity of the enzyme toward tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates (23Tonks N.K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In this work, to further evaluate the role of tyrosine 46, we replaced this residue by a phenylalanine in the PTP1B-D181A trapping mutant and we studied, in living cells, the interaction of the IR with this double mutant (PTP1B-D181A-Y46F). We found that this additional mutation converts PTP1B-D181A into a highly efficient substrate-trapping mutant that precipitates a much larger number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins compared with the classical, widely used D181A single mutant. Moreover, we show that this new PTP1B double mutant traps the IR precursor in an intracellular compartment and markedly reduces the expression of the mature receptor at the cell surface. All chemicals have been described previously (18Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Nouaille S. Blanquart C.

Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (clones 7.1 and 13.1) antibody was from Roche. The anti-IRβ antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The antibody directed against the Tris-phosphorylated form of the activation loop of the IR (anti-3YP1158/62/63) was from BioSource. Unless otherwise stated (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4), the IRB isoform of the IR (+ exon 11) was used throughout this study. cDNAs encoding IR, IR-Rluc, IR-YFP, and YFP-PTP1B-D181A have been described previously (18Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Blanquart C. Achi J. Issad T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2008; 76: 873-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The YFP-PTP1B-D181A-Y46F mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). Cell culture was performed as described (26Blanquart C. Boute N. Lacasa D. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Blanquart C. Gonzalez-Yanes C. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1802-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish. One day later, cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids as indicated in the figure legends. For BRET experiments, 1 day after transfection, cells were transferred into 96-well microplates (CulturPlate-96, white, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a density of 3 × 104 cells per well. BRET measurements were carried out in these microplates on the following day. BRET experiments were performed as described previously (18Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were preincubated for 15 min in PBS in the presence of 2.5 μm coelenterazine. Insulin was added, and light emission acquisition at 485 and 530 nm was started immediately. The dynamics of the interaction between the IR-Rluc and YFP-PTP1B mutants could be monitored for more than 30 min after insulin addition. The BRET signal was expressed in milliBRET units. The BRET unit has been defined previously as the ratio 530/485 nm, obtained when the two partners are present, corrected by the ratio 530/485 nm, obtained under the same experimental conditions when only the partner fused to Renilla luciferase is present in the assay (28Angers S.

Each measurement corresponded to the signal emitted by the whole population of cells present in a well (i.e. approximately 40,000 cells). Precipitation of the IR on wheat germ lectin-agarose beads were performed as described previously (5Issad T. Combettes M. Ferre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). YFP-PTP1B mutants and IR-YFP were immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP antibody and detected by Western blotting as described previously (31Liu J.F. Issad T. Chevet E. Ledoux D. Courty J. Caruelle J.P. Barritault D. Crépin M. Bertin B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mono-iodinated I125 insulin (32Issad T. Ferré P. Pastor-Anglada M. Baudon M.A. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. HEK-293 cells transfected with the IR-Rluc and YFP-PTP1B-WT, YFP-PTP1B-D181A, or YFP-PTP1B-D181A-Y46F mutants were plated in 24-well culture dishes. A fraction of these cells was plated separately for determination of luciferase and fluorescence levels in parallel to insulin binding. For binding experiments, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h in binding buffer (33Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern-Buell C.L. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) containing I125 insulin (0.1 μCi/well). Unbound ligand was removed by washing with ice-cold binding buffer. Cells were then lysed with 1 N NaOH, and the radioactivity was counted using a Berthold LB2111 counter. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between experimental groups were made using the t test unless otherwise specified in the figure legends. We previously observed that, when expressed in HEK 293 cells, YFP-PTP1B-D181A has an intracellular perinuclear distribution that corresponded to an endoplasmic reticulum localization (18Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, a similar distribution of the fluorescence was observed with YFP-PTP1B-D181A-Y46F, suggesting that the Y46F mutation did not affected the localization of the protein. It has been shown previously that when transfected in cells, substrate-trapping mutants of PTPases bind to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and protect them from dephosphorylation by endogenous PTPases. To evaluate whether mutation of tyrosine 46 affected the efficiency of the PTP1B-D181 trapping mutant, HEK-293 cells transfected with either the YFP-PTP1B-D181A or YFP-PTP1B-D181A-Y46F mutant were incubated for 5 min in the absence or presence of insulin. Cells were then extracted, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the tyrosine phosphorylation profile was evaluated by Western blotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. We observed that the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was much higher in PTP1B-D181A-Y46F- than in PTP1B-D181A-transfected cells, both in absence or presence of insulin (Fig. 1B). This result suggested that the double mutant was much more efficient than the classical D181A mutant in protecting tyrosine-phosphorylated residues from the activity of endogenous PTPases. Similar results were obtained with the untagged versions of these PTP1B substrate-trapping mutants (data not shown). The ability of this new double mutant to coprecipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was then evaluated. HEK-293 cells cotransfected with IR-Rluc and either the YFP-PTP1B-D181A or YFP-PTP1B-D181A-Y46F mutant were incubated for 5 min in absence or presence of insulin. Cells were extracted, and equivalent amounts of the PTP1B-D181A and D181A-Y46F mutants were immunoprecipitated using an anti-GFP antibody. We observed that the amount of coimmunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was much higher with YFP-PTP1B-D181A-Y46F than with YFP-PTP1B-D181A (Fig. 1C). This suggested that replacement of tyrosine 46 by a phenylalanine converts PTP1B-D181A into a much more efficient substrate-trapping mutant for coimmunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 1D). Previous studies have shown that PTP1B can be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the IR. As shown in Fig. 2A, immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody showed that a modest tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1B-D181A could be detected in HEK-293 cells cotransfected with IR-Rluc and YFP-PTP1B-D181A. In contrast, a much stronger tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1B-D181A-Y46F mutant could be detected under similar conditions. To determine whether this hyperphosphorylation of the PTP1B-D181A-Y46 mutant was achieved by the insulin receptor kinase, HEK-293 cells cotransfected with IR-Rluc and YFP-PTP1B-D181A-Y46 were preincubated for 1 h with the tyrphostin AG1024, which selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the IR (18Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, autophosphorylation of the IR was indeed markedly inhibited by AG1024. Under these conditions, tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1B-D181A-Y46F was also markedly inhibited (Fig. 2B), indicating that this phosphorylation was indeed achieved by the IR kinase. To evaluate the effect of the Y46F mutation on the dynamics of interaction between the IR and PTP1B, we compared basal and insulin-stimulated BRET signals in cells expressing IR-Rluc and either YFP-PTP1B-D181A or YFP-PTP1B-D181A-Y46F. As shown in our previous study, in cells expressing YFP-PTP1B-D181A, a robust basal BRET signal was observed (Fig. 3A). In agreement with our previous work, insulin (100 nm) markedly stimulated this signal (about 180–200 milliBRET units above basal at 20 min). Interestingly, in cells expressing the YFP-PTP1B-D181A-Y46F mutant, the basal BRET signal was much higher. Moreover, insulin had only a modest effect on this signal (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows the mean ± S.E. of the basal and the insulin-induced BRET signal at 20 min in five independent experiments. We observed that the basal BRET signal was much higher with YFP-D181A-Y46F than with YFP-PTP1B-D181A, despite similar levels of expression of the two tyrosine phosphatases (determined by measuring YFP fluorescence). In contrast, the insulin-induced BRET signal (increase in BRET signal above basal at 20 min) was markedly lower with the Y46F mutant. To determine whether this high basal BRET signal was dependent on the tyrosine kinase activity of the IR, we investigated the effect of the tyrphostin AG1024 on BRET between IR and PTP1B-D181-Y46F. Cells cotransfected with IR-Rluc and YFP-PTP1B-D181A-Y46F were preincubated for 1 h in the absence or presence of AG1024. BRET experiments were then performed as described previously. We observed that the basal and the insulin-stimulated BRET signals were markedly decreased by AG1024 (Fig. 4). This indicates that the high-constitutive BRET signal observed with this mutant is at least in part dependent on the kinase activity of the IR. Our previous work (18Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Issad T. Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Biochimie. 2005; 87: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) had indicated that an important part of the basal BRET signal could be attributed to an interaction between PTP1B and the insulin receptor precursor during its biosynthesis. In this study, mutation of PTP1B-D181A on Tyr-46 resulted in a further increase in the basal BRET signal, associated with a marked decrease in insulin effect above basal (insulin-induced BRET, Fig. 3B). This suggested that the double mutant may have trapped the IR precursor and reduced the expression of the mature receptor at the cell surface. In agreement with this notion, decreasing the amount of PTP-1B-D181A-Y46F transfected in cells (from 600 ng to 150 ng of cDNA/well) partially restored insulin-induced BRET signal (supplemental Fig. S2). To determine whether the expression of the Y46F mutant indeed impaired the expression of the mature receptor at the plasma membrane, cell surface I125 insulin binding experiments were performed (Fig. 5A). In cells expressing the PTPB-D181A mutant, cell surface insulin binding was decreased by about 25% when compared with cells expressing PTP1B-WT, suggesting that the interaction of the IR precursor with PTP1B-D181A resulted in a significant reduction of the expression of the mature receptor at the cell surface. In cells expressing PTP1B-D181A-Y46F, insulin binding was markedly reduced compared with cells expressing WT or PTP1B-D181A, despite a similar level of total IR expression, as evaluated by measuring luciferase activity (Fig. 5A). This result strongly suggested that in PTP1B-D181A-Y46F-transfected cells, substantial amounts of insulin receptors remained trapped in an intracellular compartment. Wheat germ lectin purification of the insulin receptor from HEK-293 cells cotransfected with IR-Rluc and either the wild-type or mutant versions of PTP1B was then performed (Fig. 5, B and C). Blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed a band of about 260 kDa in PTP1B-D181A-Y46F-transfected cells. This band was hardly detectable in PTP1B-D181-transfected cells and was absent in WT-PTP1B-transfected cells. Reprobing the membrane with an anti-IRβ antibody revealed that this band indeed corresponded to the uncleaved αβ-Rluc precursor. Together with insulin binding experiments, these results indicated that the double mutant version of PTP1B trapped the IR precursor and reduced the expression of the mature IR at the cell surface. The insulin receptor possesses a number of tyrosines that are phosphorylated upon insulin stimulation. Tyrosines 1158, 1162, and 1163, located in the activation loop of the β subunit, appear to be crucial for the activation of the receptor, the fully active form being the Tris-phosphorylated form, whereas the mono- and bis-phosphorylated forms are much less active (4White M.F. Shoelson S.E. Keutmann H. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2969-2980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Issad T. Combettes M. Ferre P. Eur. J.

To determine whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR precursor observed with the PTP1B-D181A-Y46F mutant occurred in the activation loop, YFP-tagged insulin receptors were cotransfected with untagged versions of WT-PTP1B, PTP1B-D181A, or PTP1B-D181A-Y46F (Fig. 6). 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with insulin for 5 min. After cell lysis, insulin receptors were immunoprecipitated using an anti-GFP antibody and submitted to Western blotting. Hybridization with an antibody that specifically recognizes the Tris-phosphorylated form of the activation loop of the IR (Fig. 6) indicated that a substantial amount of the IR precursor had indeed reached the maximally activated Tris-phosphorylated form when trapped by PTP1B-D181A-Y46. No tyrosine phosphorylation signal could be detected at the level of the IR precursor in cells transfected with the WT-PTP1B or PTP1B-D181A mutant. Reprobing the membrane with an anti-GFP antibody confirmed that the amount of uncleaved precursor was higher in cell expressing the PTP1B-D181A-Y46F mutant than in cells expressing wild-type or PTP1B-D181A mutant. In insulin target cells, the insulin receptor is expressed as two isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing of exon 11, that code for 12 amino acids localized at the C-terminal end of the α-chain. Previous studies have suggested that the tyrosine kinase activity of the IR precursor may be different depending on the presence or absence of exon 11 (36Pashmforoush M. Yoshimasa Y. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32639-32648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these isoforms differ for their interaction with PTP1B, we have evaluated the basal and the insulin-stimulated BRET signals in cells transfected with either IRA or IRB (supplemental Fig. S3). We observed that upon insulin stimulation, the dynamics of interaction of IRA with PTP1B mutants closely resemble that of IRB. Moreover, the basal BRET signals were also very similar for both IR isoforms. These results suggested that there are no major differences between the two IR isoforms in their interaction with PTP1B, neither during their biosynthesis nor after insulin stimulation (supplemental Fig. S3). This result was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments, which indicated that similar amounts of fully activated uncleaved precursor were recovered with both IR isoforms in cells expressing the D181A-Y46F mutant (supplemental Fig. S4). All members of the PTPase family are characterized by the presence of a signature motif containing a cysteinyl residue (Cys-215 in PTP1B) that is involved in the catalysis of the dephosphorylation reaction. The signature motif, which forms the phosphate recognition site, is located at the base of a cleft. The sides of the cleft are formed by three motifs: the Q loop, which contains Gln-262, the WDP loop, which contains the invariant Asp residue (Asp-181), and the pTyr loop, which contains the conserved Tyr-46. Tyr-46 is believed to define the depth of the catalytic cleft and to contribute to the absolute specificity of PTP1B for phosphotyrosine-containing substrates because the smaller phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues would not reach down to the phosphate binding site (23Tonks N.K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that upon insulin or growth factor treatment, the production of reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 induces transient inactivation of PTPases by reversible oxidation of the active site cysteine (37Goldstein B.J. Mahadev K. Kalyankar M. Wu X. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that following PTP1B oxidation by H2O2, a covalent bound is formed between the sulfur atom of Cys-215 and the main chain nitrogen of the adjacent residue, Ser-216, resulting in the formation of a new sulfenyl-amide species. This is accompanied by a profound modification of the architecture of the active site, involving displacement of Tyr-46 to a solvent-exposed position, and results in inhibition of substrate binding. This mechanism is believed to protect PTP1B from the formation of irreversibly oxidized sulfenic acid and to facilitate reactivation of PTP1B by biological thiols (38van Montfort R.L. Congreve M. Tisi D. Carr R. Jhoti H. Nature. 2003; 423: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 39Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Meng T.C. Hinks J.A. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Nature. 2003; 423: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of Tyr-46 on the interaction between the IR and PTP1B in living cells, we have mutated this tyrosine into phenylalanine. We observed that this mutation converts PTP1B-D181A into a much more efficient substrate-trapping mutant, as demonstrated by the marked increase in the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that could be coprecipitated with PTP1B-D181A-Y46F, both in the absence and presence of insulin (Fig. 1C). The IR is biosynthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as an uncleaved αβ-precursor, with the kinase domain of the β-chain located on the cytosolic side of the ER, i.e. in the vicinity of the catalytic domain of PTP1B. In a previous study (18Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that PTP1B-D181A interacted with the insulin receptor precursor during its biosynthesis in the ER, resulting in a high basal, insulin-independent BRET signal. In this study, we show that the mutation Y46F on PTP1B-D181A markedly increases the efficiency of the interaction of PTP1B with the IR precursor and thereby reduces the expression of the mature receptor at the plasma membrane. This view is supported by results obtained with cells expressing the PTP1B-D181A-Y46F mutant which displays 1) an increased basal BRET signal, 2) a decreased insulin-induced BRET signal, 3) decreased cell surface I125 insulin binding, and 4) an increased amount of uncleaved IR precursor. In addition, our results demonstrate that the IR precursor can reach the fully active, Tris-phosphorylated form in the absence of insulin. This strongly supports the notion that PTP1B may play a crucial role in the regulation of the activity of the immature IR precursor by precluding uncontrolled autoactivation of the precursor and subsequent activation of intracellular insulin signaling pathways in an autonomous way (18Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Issad T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Issad T. Boute N. Boubekeur S. Lacasa D. Biochimie. 2005; 87: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It may at first sight appear surprising that in cells transfected with PTP1B-D181A-Y46F, a substantial effect of insulin on tyrosine phosphorylation of the mature IR-β was observed (Figs. 5B and 6), whereas the insulin effect on BRET was markedly reduced in these conditions (Figs. 3, A and B). However, it must be kept in mind that the BRET technique only detects receptors that interact with PTP1B, both in the basal state and upon insulin stimulation. In contrast, in wheat germ lectin (Fig. 5B) or immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6) experiments, all receptors, including those that are not engaged in an interaction with PTP1B, will be detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Therefore, although significant amounts of IR precursor interact with the PTP1B-D181A-Y46F mutant (thereby reducing the expression of the mature receptor at the plasma membrane, Fig. 5A), Fig. 5B and Fig. 6 demonstrate that substantial amounts of mature receptors are still present at the cell surface and are capable of undergoing insulin-induced autophosphorylation. Interestingly, PTP1B-D181A-Y46F appeared to be hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. This hyperphosphorylation is largely due to the kinase of the IR, as demonstrated by its inhibition by AG1024 (Fig. 2B). Several publications have indicated that PTP1B is phosphorylated on tyrosines 66, 152, and 153 by the IR and other tyrosine kinases (20Bandyopadhyay D. Kusari A. Kenner K.A. Liu F. Chernoff J. Gustafson T.A. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1639-1645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 21Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29520-29525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation of PTP1B on tyrosine 66 appeared to increase its catalytic activity (21Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 40Dadke S. Kusari A. Kusari J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 221: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1B by stimulating its catalytic activity may be part of a negative feedback loop in insulin signaling (40Dadke S. Kusari A. Kusari J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 221: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41Byon J.C. Kusari A.B. Kusari J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Because mutation Y46F increases the substrate-trapping efficiency of PTP1B-D181A, it is conceivable that the resulting prolonged interaction of PTP1B with the IR leads to hyperphosphorylation of the D181A-Y46F double mutant. Moreover, it has been shown previously both in vitro and in intact cells that PTP1B catalyzes its own dephosphorylation through an intermolecular reaction (40Dadke S. Kusari A. Kusari J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 221: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and dimerization of PTP1B was more recently demonstrated using a fluorescent complementation assay (42Anderie I. Schulz I. Schmid A. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3189-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, a highly efficient substrate-trapping mutant may also protect PTP1B from autodephosphorylation. PTP1B has recently emerged as a major therapeutic target. Indeed, a large number of data now indicate that PTP1B not only plays a negative role in the regulation of insulin and leptin signaling (15Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S.

Identification of PTP1B substrates constitutes an important challenge for the treatment of these pathologies. Several substrate-trapping mutants have been developed to identify and study PTP1B substrates by modifying invariant residues in the catalytic domain. Among them, cysteine 215 in PTP1B is positioned to act as a nucleophile to attack the phosphorus atom of the phosphotyrosyl residue of the substrate (23Tonks N.K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A first generation of substrate-trapping mutants in which the catalytic cysteine was replaced by an alanine has been largely used for the study of PTP1B and other PTPases substrates (48Bliska J.B. Clemens J.C. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 49Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

Decker S.J. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23634-23639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the invariant aspartic acid 181, also involved in the catalysis, was then developed by the group of Tonks (51Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) as a more efficient substrate-trapping mutant of PTP1B. This observation was then extended to other PTPases in which mutation of the equivalent aspartic residue in the catalytic site also resulted in substrate-trapping enzymes (26Blanquart C. Boute N. Lacasa D. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Additional efforts to develop an improved substrate-trapping mutant have been performed by Xie et al. (52Xie L. Zhang Y.L. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4032-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It was shown that mutation of glutamine 262 into an alanine resulted in some improvement of the efficiency of the PTP1B-D181A-Q262A double mutant compared with the conventional D181A single mutant for trapping of the EGF receptor (52Xie L. Zhang Y.L. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4032-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, trapping of other additional phosphotyrosine-containing proteins was hardly detectable by Western blotting in these experiments (52Xie L. Zhang Y.L. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4032-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, in a quantitative proteomics approach using the D181A and D181A-Q262A mutants to pull down PTP1B substrates, Mertins et al. (53Mertins P. Eberl H.C. Renkawitz J. Olsen J.V. Tremblay M.L. Mann M. Ullrich A. Daub H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1763-1777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) found that these mutants interacted with a similar number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. In contrast, our new double mutant turned out to be much more efficient than PTP1B-D181A, as demonstrated by the much larger number and higher intensity of the bands of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins precipitated by the D181A-Y46F mutant (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the D181A-Y46F mutant will constitute a valuable tool for the identification of new PTP1B substrates using proteomic approaches. In addition, because both Asp-181 and Tyr-46 are highly conserved throughout the PTPase family, our work should permit the development of new, highly efficient trapping mutants for most PTPases. In summary, our work strongly supports the view that PTP1B not only regulates the activation state of the mature IR but also plays an important role in controlling the autonomous activity of the IR precursor during its biosynthesis. Moreover, we provide a highly efficient tool to isolate new PTP1B substrates. Download .pdf (4.94 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W1968027570,"The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/Met receptor signaling pathway is deregulated in diverse human malignancies and plays a central role in oncogenesis, tumor progression, and invasive cancer growth. Similarly, altered expression and splicing (i.e. inclusion of variant exon 5, ""v5"") of the cell adhesion marker, CD44, is associated with advanced cancer phenotypes. We sought to further understand how HGF regulates CD44v5 expression. Immortalized nontumorigenic keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells abundantly express both Met receptors and CD44v5 transmembrane glycoproteins. HGF stimulated CD44v5 protein expression and HaCaT cell migration; these events required activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK module and Sam68, a protein involved in RNA processing, splicing, and v5 inclusion. Similar to HaCaT cells, highly migratory MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells also required Sam68 expression for HGF-induced migration. However, MDA-MB-231 cell migration occurred independently of ERK1/2 and CD44v5 expression and instead required ERK5 signaling to Sam68. Phospho-mutant, but not WT-Sam68, blocked HGF-induced cell migration in both cell types; MDA-MB-435 cells behaved similarly. These results suggest that Sam68 acts as a convergence point for ERK signaling to cell migration; blockade of phospho-Sam68 may provide a new avenue for therapeutic inhibition of metastatic cancers."

In this study, we analyzed TM expression in biopsies of MM patients and compared them with normal mesothelial tissue. The role of DNA methylation-associated gene silencing in TM expression was investigated. To evaluate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) as responsible for gene promoter epigenetic modifications, nonmalignant mesothelial cells (Met-5A) and MM cells (H28) were silenced for PARP1 and the DNA methylation/acetylation-associated TM expression evaluated. A correlation between low TM expression and high level of TM promoter methylation was found in MM biopsies. Low expression of TM was restored in MM cells by their treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine and, to a lesser extent, with trichostatin, whereas the epigenetic agents did not affect TM expression in Met-5A cells. Silencing of PARP1 resulted in a strong down-regulation of TM expression in Met-5A cells, while restoring TM expression in H28 cells. PARP1 silencing induced TM promoter methylation in Met-5A cells and demethylation in MM cells, and this was paralleled by corresponding changes in the DNA methyltransferase activity.

An increased susceptibility to thrombosis of solid malignant diseases develops as a result of the activating effect of malignant cells on the hemostatic system (6Noble S. Pasi J. Br. J. Cancer. 2010; 102: S2-S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The development of this activating effect is a consequence of interactions between malignant cells and the various components of the coagulation system, including coagulation factors, platelets, endothelial cells, and the fibrinolytic system, which promotes progression from a prothrombotic state to clinically manifested disorders of the hemostatic system (7Siero E. Wojtukiewicz M. Zawadzki R. Zimnoch L. Kisiel W. Thromb. Res. 2010; 125: 71-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Among natural anticoagulants, thrombomodulin (TM) plays a critical role due to its anticoagulant activity, and it is also involved in pathological processes, including thrombosis, inflammation, and cancer (8Weiler H. Isermann B.H. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1515-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). TM is a glycosylated transmembrane protein with high affinity for thrombin to form a complex that inhibits thrombin activity and accelerates protein C activation (9Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is mainly expressed by endothelial cells, it is found in a wide range of other cells (10Maruyama I. Bell C.E.

TM is transcriptionally up-regulated by thrombin, the vascular endothelial growth factor, histamine, retinoic acid, cAMP, or heat shock (17Calnek D.S. Grinnell B.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Niforas P. Chu M.D. Bird P. Gene. 1996; 176: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Its transcription is down-regulated by shear stress, hypoxia, and the transforming growth factor-β (19Sperry J.L. Deming C.B. Bian C. Walinsky P.L. Kass D.A. Kolodgie F.D. Virmani R. Kim A.Y. Rade J.J. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The ability of the TM gene promoter to bind relevant transcription factors appears to reflect a summation of events that define competence, including nucleosome position, histone modifications, nuclear localization, and the DNA methylation status. DNA demethylation is typically required for active transcription and is frequently developmentally regulated (20Wang Y. Yu Q. Cho A.H. Rondeau G. Welsh J. Adamson E. Mercola D. McClelland M. Neoplasia. 2005; 7: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of various genes is modulated via modification of histones. Silencing of the TM gene promoter has been implicated in the down-regulation of TM synthesis, and it was found that methylation of the promoter CpG islands (CGI) is one of the mechanisms causing its low expression (21Furuta J. Kaneda A. Umebayashi Y. Otsuka F. Sugimura T. Ushijima T. Melanoma Res. 2005; 15: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Kaneda A. Kaminishi M. Yanagihara K. Sugimura T. Ushijima T. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6645-6650PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which CGIs are protected from methylation in nonmalignant cells and become susceptible to methylation in tumor cells is unknown. Accumulating evidence indicates a role for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) in the regulation of methylation patterns. Besides being an enzyme involved in DNA repair, PARP1 also participates in the transcription regulation of various genes. More specifically, the protein promotes decondensation of the chromatin structure through poly(ADP-ribosyl)lation of histones as well as acting as an enhancer-promoter regulatory complex (23Krishnakumar R.

It has been found that the nuclear balance between unmodified and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP1, which depends on the dynamics of the PARP and poly(ADP-ribose)glycohydrolase activity, is a key to the maintenance of the genomic methylation pattern (24Caiafa P. Guastafierro T. Zampieri M. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed TM expression in biopsies of MM and investigated the involvement of DNA methylation-associated gene silencing in TM expression. To evaluate the role of PARP1 in epigenetic modifications of the TM gene promoter, nonmalignant mesothelial cells (Met-5A) and MM cells (H28) were silenced for PARP1, and DNA methylation and acetylation-associated gene expression were evaluated. We show here, for the first time, that PARP1 regulates TM expression on the epigenetic level and that this regulation is involved in MM. Biopsy specimens were obtained from 22 subjects (aged 69.8 ± 10.1 years; 20 males, 2 females) who underwent thoracoscopy or thoracotomy for suspected MM. The collected tissue was divided into two parts; one was suspended immediately in the RNALater solution (Ambion) and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The other part of the tissue was used for histological examination by the Pathological Anatomy Unit of the Hospital University (Ancona, Italy). According to the diagnosis, the individuals were classified as subjects with MM (the MM group) and as healthy subjects with normal mesothelium (the NM group). The MM group (n = 10) included tissue with clear signs of the pathology, whereas the NM group (n = 5) included nonmalignant tissue. The clinical data were obtained retrospectively and include information on the gender, age, histology, neoadjuvant chemoradiation and therapy administration (before surgery), smoking status, and the pathologic staging. The exclusion criteria were the presence or suspicion of any infectious disease and other malignancies. The patients were not treated with any adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy. All subjects filled in a questionnaire that included their informed consent and provided a blood sample. The study was carried out according to the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Ethical Committee of the University Hospital of Marche, Italy. The demographic and pathological characteristics of the subjects are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Demographic and pathological characteristicsBiopsiesAge (years)SexSmoking (yes/ex/no)Histotype (EP/BI/SA)StageMM-168MExEPS-IbMM-263MNoEPS-IaMM-366MNoEPS-IaMM-475MYesEPS-IVMM-581FYesEPS-IIIMM-670MExEPS-IaMM-775MExEPS-IIIMM-866MNoEPS-IIIMM-983MNoSAN.D.MM-1077MNoEPN.D.NM-180FYesn.s.n.s.NM-258MYesn.s.n.s.NM-383MNon.s.n.s.NM-460MNon.s.n.s.NM-561MNon.s.n.s. Open table in a new tab Nonmalignant immortalized mesothelial cells (Met-5A) and MM cells (H28) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in humidified atmosphere. To establish sub-lines with stably silenced PARP1, 0.2 × 106 exponentially growing Met-5A and H28 cells were transfected with 1 μg of the PARP1 shRNA pRS plasmid, with the PARP1 targeting sequence of TAC CAT CCA GGC TGC TTT GTC AAG AAC AG or 1 μg of empty pRS plasmid (OriGene) using the TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus). Selection was carried out with puromycin added to the cells at 1 μg/ml 48 h post-transfection. Puromycin-resistant clones were isolated, expanded, and analyzed for PARP1 protein and mRNA levels as well as PARP activity. Selected clones were maintained in 1 μg/ml puromycin. PARP activity was assessed using the universal colorimetric PARP kit (Trevigen) based on the incorporation of biotinylated ADP-ribose into histone proteins. Cell and tissue lysates containing 50 μg of protein were loaded into 96-well plates coated with histones and biotinylated poly(ADP-ribose), allowed to incubate for 1 h, treated with streptavidin-HRP, and read at 450 nm in an ELISA plate reader (Sunrise). The PARP activity was expressed as units per mg protein. The activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) was evaluated in nuclear extracts of Met-5A and MM H28 cell lines and their PARP1-silenced counterparts (Met-5A1947 and H281949 cells) with or without 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC; Sigma) treatment. The cells were seeded in T25 cell culture flasks and treated with 5 μm 5-aza-dC for 96 h. The cells were then harvested, and nuclear extraction was performed (EpiQuik nuclear extraction kit, Epigentek). The DNMT activity was assayed in 5 μg of nuclear extract proteins using the EpiQuik DNA methyltransferase activity kit (Epigentek). The results were expressed as the increase in the OD per hour per mg of protein. Cells and tissue were lysed in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin) and stored at −80 C until analysis. The protein level was quantified using the Bradford assay (Sigma). 50 μg of protein were separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran). After blocking for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk in PBS-Tween, the membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-PARP1 IgG (C2–10; Trevigen), monoclonal anti-TM IgG (PBS-01; Abcam), and polyclonal anti-β-actin (Bethyl) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS-T, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, and the protein bands were visualized using the ECL detection system (Pierce). Band intensities were evaluated by ChemiDoc using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Met-5A and H28 cell lines and their PARP1-silenced counterparts (Met-5A1947 and H281949 cells) were seeded in a six-well plate at a density of 0.1 × 106. After an overnight incubation, cells were treated with freshly prepared 5 μm 5-aza-dC for 96 h or 200 ng/ml trichostatin (TSA, Sigma) for 24 h. For the combination treatment, cells were first treated with 5 μm 5-aza-dC for 72 h, then 200 ng/ml of TSA was added, and the cells were incubated for further 24 h. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of the subjects affected by MM (n = 10) was collected from the Pathological Anatomy Unit of the Hospital University of Ancona, Italy. The normal mesothelium tissue from NM subjects (n = 6) was used as the control. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were cut at 5-μm thickness, deparaffinized, and heated in 1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) for 15 min. After blocking, the sections were incubated with anti-TM IgG (PBS-01; Abcam) at 4 °C overnight and then with the FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce). The sections were inspected in a fluorescence microscope (Axiocam MRc5, Zeiss). Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used for histological evaluation. Met-5A and H28 cells as well as their PARP1-silenced counterparts were placed in 35-mm dishes on glass coverslips. After an overnight incubation, the cells were treated with 5-aza-dC (5 μm) and TSA (200 ng/ml), washed with PBS, fixed with fresh 4% formaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized with saponine (0.05% saponine in PBS, with 2% FCS). Cells were then incubated with mouse anti-human TM IgG at 4 °C overnight followed by FITC-conjugated secondary IgG. The cells were inspected in a fluorescence microscope. Total RNA was extracted from biopsies (2–3 mg) and cultured cells (106 cells) using the SV total RNA Isolation System (Promega Italia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the MMLV Kit (Promega Italia). The qRT-PCR analyses were performed in the final volume of 25 μl using the specific primer sequences: TM, 5′-TAA CGA AGA CAC AGA CTG CGA TT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTA GCC CAC GAG GTC AAG GT-3′ (reverse); PARP1, 5′-AAG CCC TAA AGG CTC AGA AC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGA AGG CAC TTG CTG CTT GT-3′ (reverse); and GAPDH, 5′-TCC ACT GGC GTC TTC ACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGC AGA GAT GAT GAC CCT TTT-3′ (reverse). The housekeeping GAPDH gene was used as the loading control. The expression of the genes was assessed by the IQ5 qPCR instrument (Bio-Rad) using the RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Invitrogen). The results were expressed as ΔCT, and fold changes in relative mRNA expression were calculated using the equation 2−Δ(ΔCt). Genomic DNA was isolated from five noncancerous and 10 cancerous biopsy specimens and from cultured cell lines treated with 5-aza-dC and TSA alone or in combination, using the Methylamp isolation and modification coupled DNA kit (Epigentek) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The extraction of genomic DNA from cultured cells was performed using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The isolated DNA was stored at −20 °C before use. The genomic DNA (3 μg) was digested by EcoRI (Promega Italia) and purified using the Wizard DNA Clean-up system (Promega Italia). 500 ng of the digested and purified DNA were subjected to bisulfite modification using the Imprint DNA Modification Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 ng of modified DNA isolated from biopsies and cell lines were used in PCR analysis for bisulfite sequencing. To study the methylation of TM genes, a CpG island in the promoter, 5′-UTR, and a first exon region containing 44 CpG dinucleotides, respectively, was analyzed and amplified by PCR using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). For the TM gene, the primer sequences were as follows: 5′-GAT TAA GAG ATG AAA GAG GGT TGT A-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAA CCA AAA CCC CAA ACA TAT TA-3′ (reverse), and the annealing temperature was fixed at 58 °C. In the PCR reactions, the forward primer was added after the first eight cycles followed by 35 more cycles. The PCR product was purified using the Silice Bead DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Fermentas), cloned into p-GEM-T-easy (Promega Italia), and transfected into JM109 competent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones containing the plasmid with the insert were selected using isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside/X-Gal plates and verified by PCR using the M13 primers. The plasmid DNA was subsequently extracted using the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA purification System (Promega Italia), according to the manufacturer's instructions; 10 clones for each biopsy and cell line were sequenced. The results were expressed as methylation percentage of the 44 CpG dinucleotides. Imunoprecipitation (IP) was performed using the Cross-link immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). Briefly, Met-5A and H28 cell lines (3 × 106) were lysed in the IP buffer. Aliquots normalized for total protein (1 mg) were incubated overnight with anti-DNMT1 (Epigentek) previously cross-linked to protein A/G plus agarose. The resin was washed with the IP buffer, and the bound protein was eluted. Western blots were performed according to standard procedures. Antibodies against PARP1, DNMT1, and normal mouse IgG (Epigentek) were used to detect the individual proteins. The ChIP assay was performed using the EpiQuik chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Epigentek). Met-5A and H28 cells as well as their PARP1-silenced counterparts (0.5 × 106) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in the RPMI medium. The reaction was stopped with 1.25 m glycine. The cells were harvested and incubated in the lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, followed by DNA sonication. After centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min), an aliquot of the supernatant was incubated (2 h) with anti-DNMT1 IgG previously cross-linked to the 96-well strips. An aliquot of each supernatant was used as the input control. Positive and negative controls were processed using anti-RNA polymerase II IgG and anti-normal IgG, respectively. The immunocomplexes and input controls were incubated with proteinase K at 65 °C, and the samples were transferred to the column and washed with 70 and 90% ethanol, and the purified DNA was eluted. To verify the binding of DNMT1 to the TM promoter, PCR was carried out according to standard procedures. TM primers were designed for the promoter region (−352 to −287). The sequences were as follows: 5′-AGG GCA GGG TTT ACT CAT CC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAC TCG GAT TGC TGG GTT CT-3′ (reverse). The annealing temperature was fixed at 55 °C. GAPDH primers were used as a positive control. The band intensities were evaluated by ChemiDoc using Quantity One software. Results were expressed as mean values ± S.D. Comparisons between groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples and the Kruskal-Wallis analysis for multiple comparisons. A probability value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS statistical software (version 15). The expression of TM mRNA was ∼12-fold lower in MM tissue when compared with NM tissue with high statistical significance (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A). Although all MM surgical specimens lacked TM immunoreactivity, strong cell membrane TM staining was documented for NM tissue (Fig. 1B). Low TM protein expression in MM tissue was further corroborated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). Bisulfite sequencing was performed in MM and NM biopsies to define the status of DNA methylation. A CpG-rich section of the TM gene spanning the region from the promoter at −298 to the first exon at +149 was analyzed for its methylation status. Hypermethylated TM was found in the pathological tissue (>80%), whereas <20% of methylation was observed in NM tissue (Fig. 2), suggestive of epigenetic regulation of TM expression of normal and malignant mesothelial tissue. The gene and protein expression levels of TM were analyzed in the nonmalignant Met-5A and the MM H28 cells by qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 3). Expression of TM was markedly lower in the MM cells when compared with nonmalignant cells (>200-fold difference, Fig. 3A). To investigate the role of the methylation and/or acetylation, the cells were treated with 5-aza-dC and TSA, respectively. The DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-dC, and partially the deacetylation inhibitor TSA, increased the TM expression in the MM cells. On the other hand, treatment with the individual epigenetic inhibitors separately did not affect the TM expression in Met-5A cells, whereas its level decreased upon combined treatment of the cells with the two agents (Fig. 3B). The methylation involvement was confirmed by assessing the DNMT activity. As shown in Fig. 3C, the activity of DNMT was significantly higher in the MM cells relative to Met-5A cells, and the 5-aza-dC treatment markedly inhibited the DNMT activity in both cell lines. The level of the TM protein expression in Met-5A and H28 cells and the effect of the epigenetic modulators 5-aza-dC and TSA was confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 3D). To examine the role of PARP1 in the methylation- and/or acetylation-mediated silencing of TM, the nonmalignant mesothelial cells Met-5A and the MM cells H28 were stably silenced for PARP1 protein expression to generate the Met-5A1947 and H281949 sub-lines. Silencing of PARP1 in Met-5A cells (Fig. 4A) resulted in a lower PARP activity (Fig. 4B). We then tested these cells for the level of expression of TM mRNA. Fig. 4C documents that silencing of the PARP1 protein expression caused a massive down-regulation in the TM transcript. The lower level of TM mRNA in the Met-5A1947 cells was restored to the level in Met-5A cells transfected with the empty vector (Met-5ApRS cells) when they were treated with the epigenetic modulators, in particular 5-aza-dC (Fig. 4D). The PARP1-silenced Met-5A1947 cells also exhibited enhanced DNMT activity, which was completely inhibited by 5-aza-dC treatment (Fig. 4E). The level of the TM protein expression is shown in Fig. 4F. Finally, we found a much higher level of methylation within the −298 to +149 region of the TM gene in the Met-5A1947 cells compared with their counterparts transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5TM promoter methylation status of Met-5ApRS and Met-5A1947 cells. Methylation analysis of the individual CpG sites in the promoter region was performed using the bisulphite sequencing method. For each sample, 10 colonies were sequenced, and the results were expressed as methylation percentage of the 44 CpG dinucleotides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the next set of experiments, we investigated the effect of PARP1 silencing on the regulation of TM expression in the MM H28 cells. The H281949 cells with down-regulated PARP1 gene (Fig. 6A) and with low PARP1 activity (Fig. 6B) exerted considerable up-regulation of the TM mRNA and protein with no additional effect of the epigenetic modulators 5-aza-dC and TSA (Fig. 6, C, D, and F). Silencing of PARP1 in H28 cells significantly reduced the DNMT activity (Fig. 6E). The MM cells with silenced PARP1 also showed massive loss of CpG methylation in the TM locus when compared with their counterparts transfected with the empty plasmid (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7TM promoter methylation status of H28pRS and H281949 cells.

For each sample, 10 colonies were sequenced, and the results were expressed as methylation percentage of the 44 CpG dinucleotides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Coimmunoprecipitation was performed to evaluate whether DNMT1 is associate with PARP1. Met-5A and H28 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-DNMT1 IgG, and the presence of PARP1 was evaluated. PARP1 was found to be associated with DNMT1 in Met-5A cells (Fig. 8A), whereas no association was found in H28 cells. Next, the co-localization of DNMT1 on the TM promoter and the effect of PARP1 silencing on DNMT1/TM promoter interaction were investigated in Met-5A and H28 cells as well as their PARP1-silenced counterparts using ChIP assay. Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-DNMT1 IgG, and the region of DNA within the TM promoter was evaluated by PCR. Fig. 8B shows that DNMT1 did not localize in the TM promoter in Met-5A cells, whereas PARP1 silencing markedly increased the DNMT1-TM promoter complex formation. Conversely, DNMT1 specifically localized within the region of the TM promoter in H28 cells, and PARP1 silencing reduced the DNMT1/TM promoter interaction. Tumor cells lacking TM feature low anti-coagulant activity, facilitating adhesion to the endothelium of target tissue and, as a consequence, metastatic spread and thrombus formation (6Noble S.

Thrombosis, a well recognized complication of cancer, is an early manifestation of malignancy and is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality (26Lee A.Y. Levine M.N. Circulation. 2003; 107: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Prandoni P. Piccioli A. Girolami A. Haematologica. 1999; 84: 437-445PubMed Google Scholar). Clinical observations have documented that malignant mesothelioma patients are highly susceptible to thromboembolic events, including arterial thrombosis (3Nguyen D. Lee S.J. Libby E. Verschraegen C. Ann. Thorac. Surg. 2008; 85: 1032-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). MM patients may show increased production of procoagulant factors associated with a reduced secretion of molecules with anticoagulant activity. To this effect, this study documents that TM expression is silenced in surgical MM specimens (cf. Fig. 1). To evaluate possible involvement of epigenetic modification in this process, we first analyzed the methylation status of CGIs in the TM promoter region and its proximity in the MM and NM tissues, more specifically within the locus spanning the promoter region (from position −298) and the first exon (position +149). We show here that CGIs are methylated in the “TM-silent” MM tissue and demethylated in the TM-expressing NM tissue (cf. Fig. 2). The involvement of epigenetic modifications in the TM silencing was then confirmed by treating immortalized mesothelial cells and MM cells with epigenetic agents. Of the epigenetic modulators tested, only the demethylating agent 5-aza-dC substantially restored TM expression in MM cells, while not affecting mesothelial cells (cf. Fig. 3, A and B). Conversely to what we observed in MM cells, the TM promoter of the nonmalignant mesothelial cells was found to be in a demethylated state (cf. FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). Thus, inhibition of DNMT1 by the epigenetic agent 5-aza-dC did not induce any further demethylation with, as anticipated, no additional effect on TM expression. It is well established that epigenetic events are controlled by a specific sub-group of proteins, which include DNMTs, histone acetylases, histone lysine methyltransferases, or histone deacetylases. These enzymes modulate the methylation or acetylation patterns of the promoter regions of a variety of genes, whereby controlling their expression (29Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar, 30Zhang Y. Reinberg D.

Recently, components of chromatin, including histones, have been documented as targets for poly(ADP-ribosyl)lation (34Faraone-Mennella M.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a post-transcriptional modification of specific proteins mediated by PARPs. Accumulating evidence links poly(ADP-ribosyl)lation with DNA methylation (24Caiafa P. Guastafierro T. Zampieri M. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 35de Capoa A.

Caiafa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21873-21880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This then epigenetically regulates expression of different genes. Consistent with this notion, we found that PARP1 associated with DNMT1 (cf. Fig. 8A) in the nonmalignant mesothelial cells Met-5A. Silencing of PARP1 thus liberates DNMT1 to methylate DNA. In fact, DNMT1 was found to localize in the TM promoter (cf. Fig. 8B), which induces its methylation, resulting in the inhibition of the TM gene and protein expression associated with enhanced DNMT activity (cf. FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). This mechanism of the regulation of TM expression was further confirmed by treatment of the cells with the epigenetic modulatory agent 5-aza-dC, an inhibitor of DNMT. It was found earlier that normal cells with active PARP1 and, consequently, increased level of poly(ADP-ribosyl)lation, are characterized by widespread DNA hypomethylation (37Guastafierro T. Cecchinelli B. Zampieri M. Reale A. Riggio G. Sthandier O. Zupi G. Calabrese L. Caiafa P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21873-21880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of the PARP activity introduces an abnormal hypermethylated pattern in the genomic DNA (35de Capoa A. Febbo F.R. Giovannelli F. Niveleau A. Zardo G. Marenzi S. Caiafa P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as well as in the CGI regions (36Zardo G. Caiafa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16517-16520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This suggests that in the absence of polymers of ADP-ribose, certain DNA regions are no longer protected from methylation. The reason is that PARP1 in its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated form makes DNMT1 catalytically inactive and thus inefficient in DNA methylation (38Reale A. Matteis G.D. Galleazzi G. Zampieri M. Caiafa P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this model, the poly(ADP-ribose) groups present on PARP1 interact monocovalently with DNMT1, suppressing its enzymatic activity. A completely different behavior was observed in MM cells. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that DNMT1 and PARP1 are not associated in H28 cells (cf. Fig. 8A), allowing DNMT1 to methylate DNA; DNMT1 localizes within the TM promoter in these cells. The methylated status of H28 cells was reversed by silencing PARP1, resulting in enhanced TM expression and reduction in the DNMT1-TM promoter complex and DNMT activity (cf. FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8). Involvement of DNA methylation was confirmed using the epigenetic agent 5-aza-dC. This can be reconciled with the notion that cancer cells undergo dramatic changes upon alterations in the DNA methylation pattern. Certain gene promoters become hypermethylated, whereas the genomic DNA is subject to significant hypomethylation. The detailed mechanisms by which CGIs are protected from methylation in normal cells and the mechanisms whereby these DNA regions become susceptible to methylation in tumor cells are still unknown. A mechanism has been proposed, such that CGIs in the promoter region of DNMT are protected from methylation by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP1 (39Zampieri M. Passananti C. Calabrese R. Perilli M. Corbi N. De Cave F. Guastafierro T. Bacalini M.G. Reale A. Amicosante G. Calabrese L. Zlatanova J. Caiafa P. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is possible that under the condition of poly(ADP-ribose) levels too low to inhibit the DNMT1 activity, new methyl groups were added onto the DNMT1 promoter, which resulted in the down-regulation of the gene. However, this hypothesis was not confirmed by our results. We did not find a reduction in DNMT1 gene expression in PARP1-silenced H28 cells with respect to the wild-type counterparts (data not shown). Therefore, an indirect role of PARP1 could be involved. In conclusion, a dual role of PARP1 has been established in TM gene regulation in the context of mesothelioma. Under physiological conditions, PARP1 is involved in the maintenance of a demethylated status leading to TM expression. In tumors, PARP1 induces TM promoter methylation, thus resulting in TM silencing. We believe that this report shows, for the first time, that PARP1 regulates TM expression on the epigenetic level and that this regulation is involved in MM. These findings suggest a possible benefit of using PARP inhibitors to improve the outcome of MM patients that appears rather grim at this stage (40Robinson B.W. Musk A.W. Lake R.A.

https://openalex.org/W2038673095,"CD4 binding on gp120 leads to the exposure of highly conserved regions recognized by the HIV co-receptor CCR5 and by CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies. A covalent gp120-CD4 complex was shown to elicit CD4i antibody responses in monkeys, which was correlated with control of the HIV virus infection (DeVico, A., Fouts, T., Lewis, G. K., Gallo, R. C., Godfrey, K., Charurat, M., Harris, I., Galmin, L., and Pal, R. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 17477-17482). Because the inclusion of CD4 in a vaccine formulation should be avoided, due to potential autoimmune reactions, we engineered small sized CD4 mimetics (miniCD4s) that are poorly immunogenic and do not induce anti-CD4 antibodies. We made covalent complexes between such an engineered miniCD4 and gp120 or gp140, through a site-directed coupling reaction.

In addition, they elicit CD4i antibody responses in rabbits and therefore represent potential vaccine candidates that mimic an important HIV fusion intermediate, without autoimmune hazard."
https://openalex.org/W2091118005,"Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine/threonine kinases that play isoform-specific inhibitory and stimulatory roles in platelet activation. We show here that the pan-PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 can be used to dissect these events following platelet activation by ADP. Submaximal concentrations of Ro31-8220 potentiated aggregation and dense granule secretion to ADP in plasma anticoagulated with citrate, in D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone-anticoagulated plasma, which has physiological levels of Ca(2+), and in washed platelets. Potentiation was retained on inhibition of cyclooxygenase and was associated with an increase in intracellular Ca(2+). Potentiation of aggregation and secretion was abolished by a maximally effective concentration of Ro31-8220, consistent with a critical role of PKC in secretion. ADP-induced secretion was potentiated in the presence of an inhibitor of PKCβ but not in the presence of available inhibitors of other PKC isoforms in human and mouse platelets. ADP-induced secretion was also potentiated in mouse platelets deficient in PKCε but not PKC. These results demonstrate that partial blockade of PKC potentiates aggregation and dense granule secretion by ADP in association with increased Ca(2+). This provides a molecular explanation for the inability of ADP to induce secretion in plasma in the presence of physiological Ca(2+) concentrations, and it reveals a novel role for PKC in inhibiting platelet activation by ADP in vivo. These results also demonstrate isoform-specific inhibitory effects of PKC in platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1980573553,"Virulent enteric pathogens have developed several systems that maintain intracellular pH to survive extreme acidic conditions. One such mechanism is the exchange of arginine (Arg+) from the extracellular region with its intracellular decarboxylated form, agmatine (Agm2+). The net result of this process is the export of a virtual proton from the cytoplasm per antiport cycle. Crystal structures of the arginine/agmatine antiporter from Escherichia coli, AdiC, have been recently resolved in both the apo and Arg+-bound outward-facing conformations, which permit us to assess for the first time the time-resolved mechanisms of interactions that enable the specific antiporter functionality of AdiC. Using data from ∼1 μs of molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the protonation of Glu-208 selectively causes the dissociation and release of Agm2+, but not Arg+, to the cell exterior. The impact of Glu-208 protonation is transmitted to the substrate binding pocket via the reorientation of Ile-205 carbonyl group at the irregular portion of transmembrane (TM) helix 6. This effect, which takes place only in the subunits where Agm2+ is released, invites attention to the functional role of the unwound portion of TM helices (TM6 Trp-202–Glu-208 in AdiC) in facilitating substrate translocation, reminiscent of the behavior observed in structurally similar Na+-coupled transporters.

Transport proteins are usually classified based on the energy used for transport: primary active transporters rely on light, ATP hydrolysis, or redox reactions; secondary active transporters, or symporters, require the electrochemical gradient of ions across the membrane to power the “uphill” translocation of their substrate; and precursor/product antiporters exchange one molecule with its metabolic product independent of another source of energy (1Law C.J.

Backbone carbonyl and amine groups unable to form hydrogen bonds at these broken α-helical regions exhibit an enhanced disposition/avidity for interacting with the substrate and co-transported sodium ions.

Science. 2009; 324: 1565-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Fang Y. Jayaram H. Shane T. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Wu F. Williams C. Xiong Y. Miller C. Nature. 2009; 460: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and Arg+-bound (occluded) (21Gao X. Zhou L. Jiao X. Lu F. Yan C. Zeng X. Wang J. Shi Y. Nature. 2010; 463: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) states. We report here our findings based on molecular dynamics simulations of both AdiC structures (9Gao X. Lu F. Zhou L. Dang S. Sun L. Li X. Wang J. Shi Y. Science. 2009; 324: 1565-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 21Gao X. Zhou L. Jiao X. Lu F. Yan C. Zeng X. Wang J. Shi Y. Nature. 2010; 463: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the apo- and Arg+-bound AdiC structures are highly superposable. The main differences reside in the reorientation of the EC half of TM6 (TM6a); the slight displacements in the EC parts of TM1, TM2, and TM10; and the side chain rotameric states of substrate-coordinating residues near the center of each monomer. The substrate-binding pocket is lined by TM1, TM3, TM6, TM8, and TM10. Trp-202 (on TM6) forms an external layer (EC gate) together with Ser-26; Trp-293 (TM8) forms a middle one; and access to the IC region is blocked by three hydrogen-bonded residues, Tyr-93 (TM3), Glu-208 (TM6), and Tyr-365 (TM10), which presumably serve as the IC gate. Purified AdiC reconstituted into liposomes has been shown previously to have increased function at pH 4 compared with pH 6, indicating a direct effect of pH on AdiC activity (22Fang Y. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 176-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On the EC periphery of AdiC, there are six acidic residues whereas within the TM domain there is only one such residue, Glu-208. Because any impact of the acidity of the external medium on the function of AdiC is more likely to be via modification of the protonation state of residues within the TM domain than on the peripheral loops, we decided to focus on the functional effect of protonation in Glu-208, the only amino acid within this domain that may possibly be affected by external decrease in pH. The pKa of Glu-208 is predicted by PropKa (23Li H. Robertson A.D. Jensen J.H. Proteins. 2005; 61: 704-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 24Bas D.C. Rogers D.M. Jensen J.H. Proteins. 2008; 73: 765-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) to be 6.4 and 6.1 in the respective open and occluded conformations, whereas the H++ server (Virginia Tech) yields respective pKa values of 3.0 and 2.9. In addition to this inconsistency in the computational estimation of the pKa of Glu-208, it is problematic to investigate experimentally the effect of lowering pH below 4 on AdiC mechanisms. However, molecular dynamics simulations may provide a direct means of looking into the effect of different protonation states of Glu-208 on substrate binding properties and AdiC dynamics. In this study, we present the first molecular dynamics insight into the time-resolved interactions at the binding pocket of AdiC and show that protonation of Glu-208 located ∼8 Å away from the substrate toward the cytoplasm prompts the release of Agm2+, but not Arg+, into the EC region. This step is facilitated by backbone rearrangement in the unwound part of TM6 at Ile-205, the carbonyl group of which participates in binding the substrate amino group. The crystal structures of the apo- and Arg+-bound AdiC (Protein Data Bank codes 3LRB and 3L1L, respectively) were used in our molecular dynamics studies. Dimeric forms were simulated because of their physiological relevance (22Fang Y. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 176-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and to achieve better statistical sampling of functional events at the binding sites. Residues 1–5 (N terminus), 253–272 (fourth EC loop, EL4), and 436–445 (C terminus) were missing in the apo form; whereas residues 1–6, 181–191, and 441–445 were missing in the Arg+-bound form. Residues 181–191 of the latter structure were reconstructed as a loop using the Sybyl software (version 8.0, Tripos International, St. Louis, MO), given that this segment overlapped with the mainly disordered portion of the long EC-exposed loop EL3 (residues 173–187; connecting TM5 and TM6), resolved in the apo form. The EL4 in the apo form was reconstructed upon superposition onto the Arg+-bound form using UCSF Chimera (25Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28971) Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates for the residues that had crystallographically resolved Cα coordinates but one or more missing atoms were completed, along with all hydrogen atoms, using the AutoPSF plugin of VMD (version 1.8.7) (26Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39830) Google Scholar). To achieve optimal comparison between the dynamics of the apo/open and substrate-bound/occluded forms of the outward-facing AdiC, we adopted a series of similar simulation setups and identical equilibration and production run protocols with different starting conformers, summing up to a total duration of 0.92 μs. The properties of these conformers, which apply to both subunits in every setup, are listed in Table 1. Simulations were repeated for the protonated and deprotonated states of Glu-208, in the presence or absence of Arg+, Agm2+, or Arg2+. Arg2+, the dominant state of arginine at pH < 2, is identical to Arg+ except for the protonation of the backbone carboxylate group.TABLE 1List of runs, system properties, and simulation durations Open table in a new tab Each complete AdiC dimer was initially placed in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine membrane bilayer of dimensions 140 × 100 × 50Å3 and fully solvated. Lipid molecules within 2 Å from the protein were removed, and 0.5-ns simulations were performed, during which all protein and substrate atoms were fixed to ensure that the lipid molecules were optimally packed around the protein. The protein and lipid membrane were then re-solvated in 150 mm NaCl, and the system, composed of ∼ 105 atoms (supplemental Table S1A), was energy-minimized and equilibrated for a total of 2.5 ns at 310 K (0.5 ns with the AdiC backbone constrained, followed by 2 ns of constraint-free simulation). At the end of the equilibration phase, changes specific to various setups (Table 1) were made. These changes were as follows: 1) the conversion of N22A (occluded structure) to WT and 2) protonation of Glu-208 and/or replacement of Arg+ by Arg2+/Agm2+. Each system was then minimized for another 20,000 steps before initiating the production runs. All simulations were performed using the NAMD software (version 2.7b2) (27Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13342) Google Scholar), with time steps of 1 fs and 2 fs in the respective equilibration and production run phases. To provide a more accurate measure for the stability of the TM domains that include the functional core of AdiC, we report the root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d. values) in atomic coordinates for both the “full” transporter, and the core composed of TM helices and the stable structural elements in the EC and IC regions, called the extended TM domain (eTMD). The eTMD excludes the amino acids 1–12 and 429–445 at the N and C termini, and the residues 173–189 and 251–272 in the two longest EC loops, EL3 and EL4, which have been reconstructed in Arg+-bound and apo forms, respectively. The r.m.s.d. of the eTMD provides a better metric for assessing the stability of the antiporter structure. The crystallized apo conformation, where the EC aqueous cavity is more open, differs from the Arg+-bound form mainly by a rotation of ∼40° in TM6a, along with a slight displacement in the EC parts of TM2 and TM10 away from the core region (Fig. 1). The two structures align with an r.m.s.d. of 2.54 Å upon exclusion of the relatively mobile N- and C-terminal segments and the EC loops EL3 and EL4. The superposed eTMDs are highly stable: the r.m.s.d. of the equilibrated structures remains less than 2.5 Å in all runs (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1B and Fig. S1). This is despite the fact that many EC water molecules penetrated deep enough into the binding pocket to interact directly with eTMD core residues, including Glu-208 (setups 1a and 1b) (Fig. 2B). In the Arg+-bound form, Trp-202 forms the main gate, shielding the substrate from the EC medium. This external gate is open in the apo form (Fig. 1). Yet, in each of the two independent runs performed for the apo dimer, without and with protonation of Glu-208 (setups 1a and 1b, respectively), one of the subunits exhibited a conformational switch to assume a relatively closed state geometrically similar to that observed in the Arg+-bound form (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2); this switch occurred as early as the equilibration step in each case and was maintained throughout the two 60-ns runs. Essentially, the backbone dihedral angle ψ and the side chain dihedrals χ1 and χ2 of Trp-202 in subunit B underwent rotameric jumps from their respective original values of ∼8°, 93°, and 131° to around −30°, ± 180°, and 68° at the onset of both runs, and practically maintained these new angles within ± 20° fluctuations, approximately, throughout the entire duration of the simulations (Fig. 3, A and B). These three values are typical of the isomeric state of Trp-202 in the closed (substrate-bound) conformer (see supplemental Table S2A). Comparison of the fluctuation profiles for the Trp-202 φ, ψ, χ1, and χ2 angles in subunit B of the apo antiporter (Fig. 3, A and B) with their counterparts in the ligand-bound forms (Fig. 3, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S3) shows that subunit B essentially assumes the same isomeric state (corresponding to the closed form of the EC gate) as that observed in the ligand-bound structures; and this property is repeated in both runs 1a and 1b. Trp-202 in subunit A, on the other hand, exhibits an alternative rotameric state, distinguished by a χ2 dihedral angle that departs from that assumed in the original apo state and that stabilized in the occluded state. Notably, both rotamers of Trp-202 were stable, and no interconversions were observed throughout the entire duration of simulations. The isomerization of Trp-202 is accompanied by changes in interatomic distances near the substrate-binding pocket. In particular, Ser-26 Oγ and Trp-202 Nϵ, separated by ∼10Å in the apo/open structure, come into close proximity similar to their separation in the substrate-bound occluded form (Fig. 2A). Likewise, Ile-205 and Trp-202, originally located at the disordered region on TM6, restore their broken hydrogen bonds, consistent with their interaction in the substrate-bound form (supplemental Table S3). Finally, the distance between the Trp-202 and Met-104 (TM3) Cα atoms is decreased by ∼3.0 Å, to approximate that in the substrate-bound structure (supplemental Fig. S2). Overall, there is an approach between the EC ends of TM1-TM6 and TM6-TM3 pairs, which is irrespective of the protonation state of Glu-208. The microscopic motions observed in the molecular dynamics runs of the open/apo state thus tend to bring the three-dimensional rearrangements of the residues that line the binding site closer to those seen in the occluded, substrate-bound form. These observations support the predisposition of the apo form to accommodate the bound substrate. In contrast to Trp-202, which mediates the EC gate, the residues whose side chains potentially serve as the intermediate (Trp-293) and IC (Tyr-93, Glu-208, and Tyr-365) gates undergo more restricted fluctuations (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2, right panels). An exception is Glu-208, the side chain rotations of which tend to destabilize the hydrogen bond network formed between Tyr-93, Glu-208, and Tyr-365. Tyr-365 hydroxyl can form instead a stable hydrogen bond with Ile-205 carbonyl oxygen if Glu-208 is protonated (supplemental Table S3). Ile-205 will indeed be shown below to be distinguished by its key role in allosteric signaling. Notably, in the Arg+-or Agm2+-bound structures, the Trp-202 dihedral angles do not undergo any rotameric jumps but fluctuate about the average values of (ϕ, ψ, χ1, χ2)holo = (−60°, 35°, 175°, 75°), close to those observed in the crystallographically resolved occluded structure (supplemental Table S2B and Fig. 3, C and D, for runs 2b and 3b, respectively). This behavior was consistently reproduced in the equivalent independent runs 2a and 3a (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B, respectively). Also, no change was seen upon protonation of Glu-208 in runs 6a and 6b where Agm2+ was bound (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). Therefore, over the time scale examined in this study the substrate-bound conformers exclusively assumed the “closed” state. Binding of Arg+ and Agm2+ to AdiC have been reported to be enthalpy-driven under physiological pH, with Kd values of ∼100 and ∼30 μm, respectively (22Fang Y. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 176-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Casagrande F. Ratera M. Schenk A.D. Chami M. Valencia E. Lopez J.M. Torrents D. Engel A. Palacin M. Fotiadis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33240-33248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Arg+-bound crystal of AdiC was obtained for the N22A mutant, which showed uptake levels similar to the WT but higher affinity for binding Arg+ (by ∼6-fold) compared with WT AdiC (21Gao X. Zhou L. Jiao X. Lu F. Yan C. Zeng X. Wang J. Shi Y. Nature. 2010; 463: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We mutated AdiC-N22A back to WT in silico as the lower affinity for Arg+, and perhaps Agm2+, might help us observe unbinding events within the time frame of our simulations. Simulations performed for Arg+-bound occluded AdiC in the absence of Glu-208 protonation (setups 2a and 2b), under the conditions where AdiC was crystallized (21Gao X. Zhou L. Jiao X. Lu F. Yan C. Zeng X. Wang J. Shi Y. Nature. 2010; 463: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), show that the geometry of the binding pocket is conserved over the entire durations of simulations: Arg+ remains positioned between the outer and middle layers formed by the Trp-202 (TM6) and Trp-293 (TM8) side chains, respectively (Fig. 4A); its guanidinium group is coordinated by the carbonyl groups of Ala-96 and Cys-97 and the side chain of Asn-101; its amino end by the carbonyls of Ile-23 (TM1) and Trp-202 and Ile-205 (TM6); and its carboxyl end by the Ser-26 hydroxyl group and the Ser-26 and Gly-27 amines at the disordered segment on TM1. Also, the interactions of Glu-208 with Tyr-93 and Tyr-365 (IC gate) are maintained throughout the entire production runs in both subunits (supplemental Table S4 and Movie M1). The same overall position of the substrate in the binding site, i.e. the confinement between the Trp-202 and Trp-293 side chains that lie parallel to each other, and coordination of terminal charged groups by mostly backbone polar groups on the surrounding helices TM1, TM6, and TM8, was also seen when Arg+ was replaced by Agm2+ (runs 3a and 3b; Fig. 4B). In the latter case, stronger interactions were seen between Agm2+ and Glu-208 due to the lack of a negatively charged carboxylic group and the greater mobility of Agm2+ to optimize its interactions. In one case, Agm2+ was able to shift and directly interact with Glu-208 via its guanidinium group (subunit B, run 3b, shown in Fig. 5). This type of close interaction with Glu-208 accessible to Agm2+, but not Arg+, already signals that the protonation of Glu-208 may have significant consequences on the positioning of Agm2+ within its binding pocket and on dislodging Agm2+ to trigger its release to the EC medium, as described next. Similarly to the open apo state, we repeated simulations for the substrate-bound occluded form with protonated Glu-208. These were performed with Arg+, Arg2+, and Agm2+ (respective runs 4–6). The most prominent consequence of the protonation of Glu-208 was the abolishment of the attractive interaction between Glu-208 and the substrate, Arg+, Arg2+, or Agm2+ (supplemental Table S5, last 2 columns). Despite this destabilizing effect, the Arg+- and Arg2+-bound forms exhibited dynamic trends closely reproducing those observed for Arg+- and Agm2+-bound AdiC in the absence of protonation: Arg+ practically maintained its crystal structure binding geometry over the entire trajectories; its amino end remained coordinated by the carbonyl groups of Trp-202 and Ile-205, its carboxylic end by Ser-26 (OH) and Gly-27 (NH), and its guanidinium group by the carbonyls of Ala-96, Cys-97, and the side chain of Asn-101 (supplemental Fig. S4A). Similar properties hold for Arg2+-bound Glu-208(H)-AdiC in setups 5a and 5b (supplemental Fig. S4B). The simulations of the Agm2+-bound AdiC with protonated Glu-208, on the other hand, displayed a strikingly different picture. The destabilization of the hydrogen bond pattern at the IC gate induced in this case a rotation, within the first 10 ns, in the Ile-205 carbonyl group by up to ∼180° toward the internal gate residues Tyr-93, Glu-208, and Tyr-365. This rotational transition was observed in two out of the four simulated subunits (subunits A and B in the respective runs 6a and 6b (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S5). Ile-205 lies on the unwound part of TM6 below Trp-202. Upon rotation, the Ile-205 carbonyl, which had initially formed a hydrogen bond with the Agm2+ amine group, interacted instead with the protonated Glu-208 (COOH) and/or Tyr-365 (OH). Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. S5 illustrate the results, consistently reproduced in two pairs of independent runs (3a, 3b, 6a, and 6b). One effect of this step was the abolishment of the attraction between Agm2+ and Ile-205. Another was the complete dissociation of Agm2+ from the binding pocket in these two subunits into the EC medium, as described below. It is important to note that the Ile-205 backbone conformational switch together with the release of the substrate (Agm+2) was not observed in any of the trajectories generated for deprotonated Glu-208, AdiC (runs 2 and 3). Among the simulations performed in the presence of Glu-208 protonation, one subunit with Arg2+-bound AdiC also exhibited such a conformational switch (subunit A in setup 5a). However, Arg2+ was not released in this case. In all production runs of the “occluded” conformation (runs 2–6), the substrate-binding site was not completely inaccessible to the EC medium at all times: up to five water molecules could enter the confines of the binding pocket and interact with the substrate; and the magnitude of these interactions was greatest in the two cases where Agm2+ was released (supplemental Table S5), inviting attention to the role of solvation in facilitating substrate release. In subunits where the substrate interaction with Glu-208 was lost and the Ile-205 conformational switch took place, complete dissociation of the substrate (Agm2+) from the binding pocket and into the EC medium took place. This was seen in two cases, which had similar pattern and pathway of unbinding: subunit A in setup 6a, starting at ∼80 ns (Fig. 7), and subunit B in setup 6b, at ∼23 ns (supplemental Fig. S6). The corresponding animations may be found in supplemental Movie M2, A and B. The sequence of events leading to the release of Agm2+ exhibited close similarities between the two independent runs: first, the amino end of Agm2+ dissociated from the binding site passing between Trp-202 and Ser-26 and leading the translocation toward the EC region. In contrast to expectation, this step was not accompanied by noticeable change in the geometry of the backbone or side chain of Trp-202 (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S6). However, a greater tendency for Ser-26 and Trp-202 to move farther from each was seen in subunits where Agm2+ was bound to AdiC with Glu-208 protonated (supplemental Table S4). The Agm2+ amino group translocation across Trp-202 and Ser-26 varied in duration from ∼5 ns in setup 6a to ∼25 ns in setup 6b. This step was followed by the movement of Agm2+ along Ser-203 and Val-199 on TM6, Gly-27 and Leu-30 on TM1, and subsequently Ile-107 on TM3. Afterward, the Agm2+ molecule in both cases reached and resided for at least 10–15 ns at the external face of AdiC within a space confined by the side chains of Glu-349 on TM10, Glu-409 on TM12, and Ser-195 and Asn-198 on TM6 (Fig. 7 and supplemental Fig. S6). No detectable changes in structure were seen within the 10–15 ns that succeeded the complete dissociation of Agm2+. In the initial structure of the open apo conformation, both carbonyl groups of Ile-205 face the binding site as in the substrate-bound occluded"

To investigate the role of the <i>N</i>-linked glycan further, HEK293E protein expression was used to produce recombinant pSP-D (RpSP-D) that has similar structural and antiviral properties as NpSP-D. We introduced an additional <i>N</i>-linked glycan in the CRD of RpSP-D but this modification did not alter the antiviral activity. Human SP-D is unglycosylated in its CRD and less active against IAV compared with pSP-D. In an attempt to modify its antiviral properties, several recombinant human SP-D (RhSP-D) mutants were constructed with <i>N</i>-linked glycans introduced at various locations within its CRD. To retain lectin activity, necessary for the primary interactions between SP-D and IAV, <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation of RhSP-D was shown to be restricted to the corresponding position in the CRD of either pSP-D or surfactant protein A (SP-A). These <i>N</i>-glycosylated RhSP-D mutants, however, did not show increased neutralization activity against IAV. By developing RhSP-D mutants that also have the pSP-D-specific Ser-Gly-Ala loop inserted in the CRD, we could demonstrate that the <i>N</i>-linked glycan-mediated interactions between pSP-D and IAV involves additional structural prerequisites of the pSP-D CRD. Ultimately, these studies will help to develop highly effective SP-D-based therapeutic and prophylactic drugs against IAV."
https://openalex.org/W1991596965,"Scapinin is an actin- and PP1-binding protein that is exclusively expressed in the brain; however, its function in neurons has not been investigated. Here we show that expression of scapinin in primary rat cortical neurons inhibits axon elongation without affecting axon branching, dendritic outgrowth, or polarity. This inhibitory effect was dependent on its ability to bind actin because a mutant form that does not bind actin had no effect on axon elongation. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that scapinin is predominantly located in the distal axon shaft, cell body, and nucleus of neurons and displays a reciprocal staining pattern to phalloidin, consistent with previous reports that it binds actin monomers to inhibit polymerization. We show that scapinin is phosphorylated at a highly conserved site in the central region of the protein (Ser-277) by Cdk5 in vitro. Expression of a scapinin phospho-mimetic mutant (S277D) restored normal axon elongation without affecting actin binding. Instead, phosphorylated scapinin was sequestered in the cytoplasm of neurons and away from the axon. Because its expression is highest in relatively plastic regions of the adult brain (cortex, hippocampus), scapinin is a new regulator of neurite outgrowth and neuroplasticity in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2042683107,"Gram-negative porcine pathogens from the Pasteurellaceae family possess a surface receptor complex capable of acquiring iron from porcine transferrin (pTf). This receptor consists of transferrin-binding protein A (TbpA), a transmembrane iron transporter, and TbpB, a surface-exposed lipoprotein. Questions remain as to how the receptor complex engages pTf in such a way that iron is positioned for release, and whether divergent strains present distinct recognition sites on Tf. In this study, the TbpB-pTf interface was mapped using a combination of mass shift analysis and molecular docking simulations, localizing binding uniquely to the pTf C lobe for multiple divergent strains of Actinobacillus plueropneumoniae and suis. The interface was further characterized and validated with site-directed mutagenesis. Although targeting a common lobe, variants differ in preference for the two sublobes comprising the iron coordination site. Sublobes C1 and C2 participate in high affinity binding, but sublobe C1 contributes in a minor fashion to the overall affinity. Further, the TbpB-pTf complex does not release iron independent of other mediators, based on competitive iron binding studies. Together, our findings support a model whereby TbpB efficiently captures and presents iron-loaded pTf to other elements of the uptake pathway, even under low iron conditions.

Each lobe contains two domains, connected by two antiparallel β-strands in a clamshell-like fold, producing a cleft that coordinates Fe3+ in the binding pocket, along with a synergistic anion (CO32− or C2O42−) (16Bobst C.E.

For the Actinobacillus spp., in vitro studies have shown that a TbpB-deficient strain could utilize Tf-bound iron, but was avirulent (26Baltes N. Hennig-Pauka I. Gerlach G.F. FEMS Micro. Lett. 2002; 209: 283-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This potential for diverse receptor-Tf recognition mechanisms provides a rationale for characterizing Tf-TbpB interactions across multiple variants. The sequence heterogeneity for TbpB proteins in particular is considerable, with 47–82% sequence identity observed in variants from a cross-section of pathogenic strains (25DeRocco A.J.

A survey of existing binding studies suggests that TbpB interacts with Tf through the receptor N lobe (28Renauld-Mongénie G. Poncet D. Mignon M. Fraysse S. Chabanel C. Danve B. Krell T.

Together with a companion study by Calmettes et al. (31Calmettes C. Yu R.H. Silva L.P. Curran D. Schriemer D.C. Schryvers A.B. Moraes T.F. J. Biol.

Recently available protein structures provide an opportunity to map interactions with pTf at high resolution, using a hybridized strategy based on mass shift mapping that involves hydrogen/deuterium exchange (H/DX) methods and structural modeling (32Mandell J.G.

Microbiol. 2010; 77: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); however, the absence of a reliable human pathogenic TbpB structure prevented a detailed characterization of the transferrin binding site. In the current study, shift mapping was used to locate interfaces and altered dynamics upon the binding of pTf to four TbpB variants. These mapping data were used to test heterodimer models arising from computational docking of pTf to available TbpB structures (5Moraes T.F. Yu R.H. Strynadka N.C. Schryvers A.B. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Calmettes C. Yu R.H. Silva L.P. Curran D. Schriemer D.C. Schryvers A.B. Moraes T.F. J. Biol.

The models were further tested through mutations and surface plasmon resonance binding studies, as guided by hot spot analysis. Our findings reveal that all four receptor variants interact at a partially conserved interface on the C lobe of Tf and highlight how iron loading renders the C lobe uniquely capable of binding to TpbB. The mature coding region of TbpB from Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strain ApH49 (serotype7), ApH87 (serotype 5), ApH89 (serotype 1) and Actinobacillus suis AsH57 were PCR-amplified and cloned in to the in-frame BamHI restriction site of a customized expression vector preceded by a polyhistidine region, a maltose-binding protein (Mbp) and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. E. coli strain C43 cells transformed with the recombinant plasmids were grown in 1 liter of Luria base (LB) broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μl/ml) for 20 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 30 ml of resuspension buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and lysed with a Emulsiflex cell homogenizer (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column to isolate the Mbp-TbpB fusion protein. After elution from the column and dialysis in buffer, the Mbp tag was cleaved from the TbpBs by tobacco etch virus protease digestion overnight, at room temperature. The digestion mixture was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column to remove the Mbp and His-tagged recombinant tobacco etch virus. The purified TbpBs were dialyzed against 50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Recombinant pTfs were produced from a Pichia pastoris expression system, followed by iron loading. Briefly, recombinant pTf expressed from a modified pPICαA vector (Invitrogen) in P. pastoris was precipitated from the culture supernatant by ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, the pellet was then resuspended in water, and the solution was dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, overnight at 4 °C. The dialyzed solution was applied to a Q-Sepharose column and eluted via an NaCl gradient. The purified solution was dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Site-directed mutagenesis of pTf to generate R509A, D360A, and S625K mutations was performed using the Invitrogen Geneart® Site-directed Mutagenesis System, as initially described by Weiner et al. (34Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene. 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Expression of the mutants followed the same procedure as wild type. Wild-type Haemophilus influenzae FbpA was expressed and iron loaded as described by Shouldice et al. (35Shouldice S.R. Dougan D.R. Skene R.J. Tari L.W. McRee D.E. Yu R.H. Schryvers A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11513-11519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To generate apo-FbpA, holo-FbpA was extensively dialyzed against 100 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm sodium phosphate monobasic, 10 mm EDTA, pH 5.5, at 4 °C overnight, to release the iron. The sample was then dialyzed extensively against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE was used to confirm the purity of the protein preparation. A 1.5:1 ratio of purified TbpB was added to holo-pTf in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the samples were applied to a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column. Only the TbpB-Tf complex bound to the column and was eluted by the addition of 200 mm NaCl in the buffer. The pooled fractions were dialyzed extensively against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. Each H/DX experiment involved a measurement of deuteration levels for pTf in the presence and absence of each of the four TbpB receptors. In this fashion, changes in deuteration arising from complexation could be used to identify the binding interface. These measurements were made using mass spectrometry of pTf peptides, generated by digesting deuterated protein under conditions preventing back-exchange of deuterium. Thus, these experiments provided a “peptide-level” resolution of binding interfaces and changes in protein dynamics resulting from binding. Quadruplicate experiments were performed for each state (free or receptor-bound pTf). In each experiment, protein stock solution was labeled at pH 7.0 in D2O (25% v/v) at 20 °C for 2 min. The solution was then quenched and reduced on ice for 1.5 min (in 250 mm TCEP, 0.08% TFA (v/v), pH 2.3). This quenched and reduced protein solution was digested with immobilized pepsin (Applied Biosystems) in a cartridge format (5 cm x 200 μm inner diameter, assembled in-house). The digest was captured on a small C18 reversed-phase column and separated using a 5–90% steep linear gradient of acidified acetonitrile (0.03% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 0.02% FA, both v/v), Effluent was directly infused into a QSTAR Pulsar i quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF) mass spectrometer. Digestion and chromatography were carried out in an ice bath. To identify the pTf peptides arising from the digests, unlabeled peptides were prepared under similar conditions and sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The MS/MS spectra were searched against the pTf sequence with a local installation of Mascot 2.1, using conventional identification criteria. 87 peptides were confirmed suitable for subsequent mass shift experiments. Mass spectral data from each replicate H/DX-MS experiment were analyzed using Hydra v1.5 (36Slysz G.W. Percy A.J. Schriemer D.C. Anal.

Briefly, significantly shifted peptides must meet the following criteria: a two-tailed t test (p < 0.05) using pooled standard deviations from quadruplicate analysis of each state and receptor, and exceeding a threshold shift value (±2 S.D.) based on a measurement of the shift noise and assuming a normal distribution. Deuteration data were then color-coded blue and red for positive and negative shifts, respectively, and mapped to pTf structure (Protein Data Bank code 1H76). The Rosetta models used in this paper were generated as described by Moraes et al. (5Moraes T.F. Yu R.H. Strynadka N.C. Schryvers A.B. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and Calmettes et al. (31Calmettes C. Yu R.H. Silva L.P. Curran D. Schriemer D.C. Schryvers A.B. Moraes T.F.

Briefly, the RosettaDock program was run in full atom mode using standard Monte Carlo movements, allowing for spin around the axis connecting the two proteins. Experimentally determined important residues on the receptor side only were taken into account during docking. Briefly, a program modification checked the RosettaDock-generated decoys for whether the residues designated were within 10 Å of pTf. Decoys that failed on any important residue were deleted. The program was then run continuously until all decoys met each of the designated TbpB distance constraints (31Calmettes C. Yu R.H. Silva L.P. Curran D. Schriemer D.C. Schryvers A.B. Moraes T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 12683-12692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Rosetta-docked models were submitted to the Mitchell laboratory KFC Hot Spot Prediction server, as described by Darnell et al. (37Darnell S.J. Page D. Mitchell J.C. Proteins. 2007; 68: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The software combines two algorithms, K-FADE (Fast Atomic Density Evaluation) which measures shape specificity features, with K-CON, which uses biochemical contact features (37Darnell S.J. Page D. Mitchell J.C. Proteins. 2007; 68: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a BiacoreX instrument (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C, similar to those described by Calmettes et al. (31Calmettes C. Yu R.H. Silva L.P. Curran D.

Briefly, four pTf constructs (wild-type and pTf mutants D360A, R509A, and S625K) were coupled to the sensor chip (research-grade CM5) via standard N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide activation. TbpB orthologs (ApH49, AsH57, ApH87, and ApH89) were diluted at various concentrations in the mobile phase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20). Samples were injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min, and bound receptor was subsequently removed by washing with mobile phase for 90 or 240 s after the injection. Regeneration buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 m NaCl) was injected prior to each analyte injection. Kinetic constants were calculated from the sensorgrams using the simulated BiacoreX evaluation software, version 4.0.1 (GE Healthcare). Apo-FbpA was mixed 1:1 with the pTf-TbpB complex and incubated at room temperature with gentle rotation for 1 h. A Microcon filtration device (Millipore) with a molecular weight cutoff of 50,000 g/mol was used to separate FbpA from the complex, followed by concentration with an Amicon 0.5-ml 10,000 g/mol molecular weight cutoff Ultracel 10K membrane centrifugal concentrator (Millipore) (final concentration of 1 mg/ml). Apo-FbpA, apo-FbpA with complex, and holo-FbpA were treated with increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl), from 0 to 4 m, to generate a SUPREX denaturation curve in a manner similar to the method described by Parker-Siburt et al. (13Parker Siburt C.J. Roulhac P.L. Weaver K.D. Noto J.M. Mietzner T.A. Cornelissen C.N. Fitzgerald M.C. Crumbliss A.L. Metallomics. 2009; 1: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mass spectrometer used for detection is the same as described for the HD/X experiments. The Bayesian Protein Reconstruct application from BioAnalyst QSTM version 1.4 (Applied Biosystems) was used to deconvolute the acquired spectra, to generate average centroid masses for each of the labeled FbpA samples. A denaturation curve for each sample was then generated and fit using OriginPro version 8. Apo-FbpA was incubated with pTf-TbpB complex as described in the SUPREX experiment. A 50,000 g/mol molecular weight cutoff Microcon filter was used to separate FbpA from the pTf-TbpB complex. FbpA was then analyzed by spectrophotometry at 480 nm. Samples were prepared in triplicate and related to controls (holo-FbpA, apo-FbpA, and pTf-TbpB complex). As an additional control, apo-FbpA was incubated with FeCl3 in 100 mm sodium bicarbonate, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 8.6. The remaining free iron was removed via gel filtration chromatography, and the iron-loaded FbpA (apo-FbpA + FeCl3) was concentrated using an Amicon concentrator as described.

D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) makes this an ideal system for investigating the receptor-protein interaction. In this study, mass shift perturbation experiments (33Bennett M.J. Barakat K. Huzil J.T. Tuszynski J. Schriemer D.C. Chem. Biol. 2010; 17: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) were carried out using TbpBs from four strains of the porcine pathogens A. pleuropneumoniae and A. suis to gauge intrapathogen variability with respect to the pTf-TbpB interaction and to extend the previous analyses of human pathogenic receptor interactions (11Ling J.M. Shima C.H. Schriemer D.C. Schryvers A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Sequencing of peptides derived from pTf was performed as described by Ling et al. (11Ling J.M. Shima C.H. Schriemer D.C. Schryvers A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A sequence coverage map for pTf can be found in supplemental Fig. 1. To determine whether a shift analysis of peptides from one large protein in the presence of another would be feasible, pTf and TbpB were processed simultaneously, and the ability to detect pTf peptides in this mixture was determined with Hydra v1.5 and manual verification (36Slysz G.W. Percy A.J. Schriemer D.C. Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 7004-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the complexity of the spectra increased significantly, there were few instances of peptide overlap and a minimal impact of increased ion suppression on peptide detection. Collectively, the impact on pTf sequence coverage used in our mass shift studies was a reduction from 68% (98 peptides) in the absence of TbpB to 63% (87 peptides) in its presence. Surface and schematic representations demonstrating the degree of sequence coverage are displayed in Fig. 1, mapped onto the holo-pTf structure. Of the 18 disulfide bonds present in pTf (39Shen Z.M. Yang J.T. Feng Y.M. Wu C.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1477-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), 15 peptides representing 8 disulfides were detected. This incomplete coverage is likely due to a combination of incomplete reduction under the conditions required to prevent deuterium back-exchange (most notably temperature and pH) and issues related to peptide detection. To ensure that the disulfide reduction was optimized for this application, extending the reduction time up to 10 min did not significantly increase the representation of cysteine-containing peptides (data not shown). The extent of pTf peptide mass shifts, induced by binding each of the four TbpB variants was determined (Fig. 2). The four receptor variants generated similar patterns of altered deuteration, with peptides showing significant changes relative to free pTf colored in red. All significant perturbations map to the C lobe of pTf. None of the four receptor variants caused an increase in solvent accessibility upon pTf binding because there were no significantly increased mass shifts. The significant changes were mapped to the C lobe of pTf for each receptor (Fig. 3). These changes upon complexation can be attributed to newly formed interfacial regions or localized stabilization of structure.FIGURE 3Superposition of the receptor-induced mass shifts on pTf structure. The figure maps the significant changes induced by ApH49 TbpB (A), ApH87 TbpB (B), AsH57 TbpB (C), and ApH89 TbpB (D). Changes are mapped in red, and as they cluster in the C lobe exclusively, only this region of pTf is shown. Boxed region in D represents the C terminus of loop 23, not protected from exchange in the interaction with ApH89 TbpB. The orientation of pTf used in Fig. 1 is preserved.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"

In this work, by analyzing the interactions of these domains with six biologically relevant peptides containing the consensus sequence, they are shown to possess finely tuned and distinct binding specificities. We also identify a residue in the Bem1p SH3b domain that inhibits binding, yet is highly conserved for the purpose of preventing nonspecific interactions. Substitution of this residue results in a marked reduction of in vivo function that is caused by titration of the domain away from its proper targets through nonspecific interactions with other proteins.

This work provides a clear illustration of the importance of intrinsic binding specificity for the function of protein-protein interaction modules, and the key role of “negative” interactions in determining the specificity of a domain. Signals are transmitted through cellular pathways by relays of protein-protein interactions resulting in specific outputs, such as cell growth, differentiation, or apoptosis. To generate appropriate responses from signaling pathways, the protein-protein interactions involved must be specific and not lead to misactivation of other pathways. This requisite precision can be readily achieved by proteins that possess “high intrinsic specificity,” directly binding their intended targets much more tightly than any other protein. For protein-DNA interactions, this can involve differences of greater than 3 orders of magnitude or more in the Kd value between target and non-target binding (1Jen-Jacobson L. Biopolymers. 1997; 44: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, protein-protein interactions are often mediated by small conserved modular domains that recognize short sequence motifs in their target proteins and may not possess intrinsically high specificity (2Bhattacharyya R.P. Remenyi A. Yeh B.J. Lim W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar, 3Castagnoli L. Costantini A. Dall'Armi C. Gonfloni S. Montecchi-Palazzi L. Panni S. Paoluzi S. Santonico E. Cesareni G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because members of the same domain family often bind to similar peptide sequences and individual domains have been found to bind many different peptides with similar affinities, many protein-protein interaction modules have been described as “promiscuous,” meaning that they are unable on their own to distinguish correct from incorrect binding sites. In these cases, the interactions of proteins containing these modules may still achieve high specificity through alternative mechanisms, such as coordinated temporal and spatial localization within the cell or participation in cooperative multi-protein complexes. Currently, the mechanisms by which protein interaction specificity within signaling pathways is achieved are not well understood (2Bhattacharyya R.P. Remenyi A. Yeh B.J. Lim W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pawson T. Curr. Opin Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In this work, we address three key questions on this topic: How much intrinsic binding specificity is encoded in small protein-protein interaction modules? What are the mechanisms for encoding this specificity? Are there biological consequences to the alteration of the intrinsic specificity of a domain? Our studies on binding specificity focus on SH3 domains, which are among the most widespread and best characterized protein interaction domains (5Dalgarno D.C. Botfield M.C. Rickles R.J. Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 383-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE8PubMed Google Scholar). SH3 domains generally recognize peptides with a core PXXP motif that can be either class I (+XXPXXP) or class II (PXXPX+), where X may be any amino acid and + is Arg or Lys. Many SH3 domains bind diverse PXXP-containing peptides with similar low affinities ranging from 10 to 50 μm and thus appear to be promiscuous binders (7Viguera A.R. Arrondo J.L. Musacchio A.

It was concluded by some investigators that factors apart from intrinsic binding specificity must contribute significantly to directing SH3 domains to their biologically relevant binding partners (3Castagnoli L. Costantini A. Dall'Armi C. Gonfloni S. Montecchi-Palazzi L. Panni S. Paoluzi S. Santonico E. Cesareni G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Ladbury J.E. Arold S.

However, a biologically relevant target peptide of the yeast Sho1p SH3 domain has been shown to possess a high intrinsic binding specificity for this SH3 domain relative to other yeast SH3 domains, and decreasing this level of specificity was detrimental to the fitness of the cell (15Zarrinpar A. Park S.H. Lim W.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Other studies have also described higher affinity SH3 domain-mediated interactions (0.05–1 μm Kd values) requiring extended peptide sequences that can range from 12 to 30 residues in length (16Ghose R. Shekhtman A. Goger M.J. Ji H. Cowburn D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Kami K. Takeya R. Sumimoto H. Kohda D.

Biol. 2006; 358: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The recognition of extended peptide sequences by these domains suggests that their level of intrinsic specificity is higher than those recognizing shorter sequences, but the importance of high intrinsic specificity for the in vivo function of these domains has not been investigated. To address the role of binding specificity in SH3 domain function, we have examined an unusual pair of yeast SH3 domains from the yeast adaptor proteins Nbp2p and Bem1p. In previous studies, these domains appeared to possess identical binding specificity despite their distinct biological roles and relatively low amino acid sequence identity of 36% (randomly chosen pairs of SH3 domains display 27% sequence identity on average (21Larson S.M. Davidson A.R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2170-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)). Nbp2p is an adaptor protein involved in down-regulating the high osmolarity glycerol and cell wall integrity MAPK pathways. It binds to components in these pathways via its SH3 domain and recruits Ptc1p phosphatase (22Du Y. Walker L. Novick P. Ferro-Novick S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4413-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Mapes J. Ota I.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Hruby A. Zapatka M. Heucke S.

Bem1p contains two SH3 domains, a PX domain and a PB1 domain, and acts as a scaffold for multiple proteins involved in establishing cell polarity, including Cdc42p and its guanine exchange factor Cdc24p (25Bender L.

Although it has been hypothesized that the SH3 domains in yeast have evolved to resist binding cross-reactivity (15Zarrinpar A. Park S.H. Lim W.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), the Nbp2p SH3 domain (NbpSH3) 2The abbreviations used are: NbpSH3, Nbp2p SH3 domain; BemSH3b, Bem1p SH3b domain; PX, phox homology; TAP, tandem affinity purification. and the second SH3 domain of Bem1p (BemSH3b) were both found to interact with a highly conserved 11-residue site in the Ste20p kinase (30Winters M.J. Pryciak P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2177-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, several biologically relevant binding sites of NbpSH3 and BemSH3b (supplemental Table S1) display the same consensus sequence (Fig. 1A), one that also matches a consensus derived from a phage display experiment performed on the NbpSH3 (supplemental Fig. S1A and Ref. 31Tong A.H. Drees B. Nardelli G. Bader G.D. Brannetti B. Castagnoli L. Evangelista M. Ferracuti S. Nelson B. Paoluzi S. Quondam M. Zucconi A. Hogue C.W. Fields S. Boone C. Cesareni G. Science. 2002; 295: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The structure of a complex of BemSH3b bound to its target peptide from Ste20p shows that all of the residues at conserved positions in the consensus sequence contribute to the binding interface (32Takaku T. Ogura K. Kumeta H. Yoshida N. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19346-19353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To investigate the specificity determinants of NbpSH3 and BemSH3b, we measured the binding affinities of these two domains for six different target sequences. Although both domains were able to bind all six sequences, several sequences were bound with surprisingly different affinities by each of the two domains, demonstrating a finely tuned level of specificity. Further studies on this unique pair of cross-reactive SH3 domains have allowed us to identify residues that are responsible for determining specificity, address the in vivo consequences of altering specificity, and establish a mechanism by which specificity is maintained. NbpSH3 (residues 110–172) and BemSH3b (residues 155–252) were expressed with a C-terminal His6 tag from the pET21d (Novagen) vector. Target peptides were expressed as C-terminal fusions to the bacteriophage λ cI repressor carrying a C-terminal His6 tag, as described previously (33Maxwell K.L. Davidson A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16172-16182Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified using nickel-affinity chromatography and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl buffer. All subsequent assays were carried out in this buffer. The degree of binding of the SH3 domain to target peptides was assessed by monitoring the increase in SH3 domain tryptophan fluorescence at 326 nm using an Aviv ATF105 spectrofluorometer. To calculate binding affinities, SH3 domains (0.5 μm or 1 μm) were titrated with cI-peptide fusion proteins using a Microlab 500 series automated titrator. After mixing, the samples were equilibrated for 1 min and excited at 295 nm with a 5-s averaging time. The dissociation constant (Kd) values were calculated as described previously (33Maxwell K.L. Davidson A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16172-16182Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The Kd values calculated are not affected by changes to the fluorescence difference between the bound and unbound states that could be caused by some amino acid substitutions. The thermal stability of the wild-type and mutant SH3 domains were measured using an Aviv circular dichroism model 202 spectrometer. Proteins were heated from 20 to 90°C, and protein unfolding was assessed by monitoring the change in ellipticity at 212 nm for the BemSH3b domain and at 230 nm for the NbpSH3 domain, respectively. Yeast BY4741 and BY4741 strains encoding TAP-tagged proteins were grown in yeast peptone dextrose medium to an A600 nm of ∼1.0, and cells from 150 ml of culture were collected by centrifugation. Protein extracts were prepared by resuspending the cell pellet in 1.8 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) and lysing the cells with glass beads. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (50 μl) was preloaded with 100 nmol of purified BemSH3b or NbpSH3 (1 ml of protein at a concentration of 100 μm) and then incubated with 200 μl of the prepared protein extract. The resin was washed three times with 300 μl of lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by resuspending the resin in 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. 20 μl of eluates was loaded onto 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Coomassie staining or immunoblotting with α-TAP antibody (Open Biosystems, CAB1001). Each experiment was performed at least three times, and one representative gel was chosen for the figures shown. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S4. All gene modifications were introduced at chromosomal loci using PCR-based homologous recombination, following standard procedures (34Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). To construct strains carrying Nbp2/BemSH3b hybrid proteins, the chromosomal region encoding the NbpSH3 domain was first replaced with a URA3 cassette. This cassette was subsequently replaced by homologous recombination with a DNA fragment encoding the BemSH3b flanked by DNA homologous to the NBP2 gene. The desired recombinants lacking URA3 were selected using 5-fluoroorotic acid. The same method was applied to obtain strains encoding single amino acid substitutions in NbpSH3 and BemSH3b. All double mutants were constructed through mating, sporulation of the diploids, and tetrad dissection, where the resulting double mutants were identified by the associated markers. To construct a plasmid expressing wild-type Bem1p, a DNA fragment including the 900-base pair BEM1 promoter region and encoding Bem1p fused to a C-terminal 3HA tag was amplified from genomic DNA of strain MG40 constructed in this study (supplemental Table S4). The amplified DNA was inserted into a centromeric URA3-marked pRS316 plasmid. Standard rich medium (yeast peptone dextrose) or minimal medium (synthetic defined) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids were used for growth assays. The cells were grown overnight to saturation, normalized by A600 nm, and spotted in 5-fold serial dilutions. Growth was monitored for 2 days at standard growing temperature (30 °C) or high temperatures (36–39 °C). It should be noted that changes to the incubation temperature as small as 0.5 °C had a significant effect on cell fitness. To determine the binding specificities of BemSH3b and Nbp2SH3, we tested the binding of these SH3 domains to six peptides derived from yeast proteins implicated in the function of either Bem1p or Nbp2p (supplemental Table S1). The BemSH3b construct (155–252) used in the binding assays included a C-terminal extension that is required for folding of the domain and contributes to peptide binding by extending the peptide binding surface (32Takaku T. Ogura K. Kumeta H. Yoshida N. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19346-19353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The interaction of the SH3 domains to target peptides was monitored by measuring the increase in intrinsic Trp fluorescence resulting from peptide binding (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Although both SH3 domains bound all of the tested peptides, the affinities of each domain for the set of peptides spanned a broad range of values. NbpSH3 bound with Kd values ranging from 0.2 to 11 μm, whereas BemSH3b bound with an even greater range of affinities varying from 0.05 to 26 μm (Fig. 1B). Whereas some target peptides, including Ste20, Cla4, and Pbs2, were bound with relatively similar affinities by the two domains (< 4-fold difference), the Boi2, Bck1, and Skm1 sites showed a much greater difference in their affinities for the two domains, ranging from 20- to 30-fold. In the case of the Boi2 site, the BemSH3 bound more tightly, whereas the Nbp2SH3 bound the Bck1 and Skm1 sites with a higher affinity. It is also notable that each domain bound to most sites with a relatively high affinity compared with typical SH3 domain target peptide interactions. For example, the Kd value of the BemSH3b-Ste20 interaction (0.05 μm) is among the lowest observed for SH3 domains. In summary, although these domains recognize the same consensus sequence, their specificities are seen to be finely tuned when assayed against a panel of yeast peptides, some of which are proven biological targets of NbpSH3 or BemSH3b domains (supplemental Table S1). To identify key residues that determine the distinct specificities of BemSH3b and NbpSH3, we exchanged residues 14–16 in the RT loops of these domains (Fig. 1C). We chose these positions because they were occupied by residues with different properties in the two domains (KAD in BemSH3b versus NDN in NbpSH3) and this region of SH3 domains had been implicated in determining specificity in several different systems (35Hiipakka M. Saksela K. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1735-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36Panni S. Dente L. Cesareni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21666-21674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the BemSH3bKAD → NDN mutant bound most sites more tightly than the wild-type domain (Fig. 1B). In particular, it bound the Bck1 and Skm1 sites 50- and 20-fold more tightly, respectively. Overall, the specificity of profile of the BemSH3bKAD → NDN mutant more closely resembles the specificity of the wild-type NbpSH3 except that it is still able to bind the Boi2 site with a much higher affinity than the Nbp2SH3. In contrast to the BemSH3bKAD → INDN mutant, the NbpSH3NDN → KAD mutant displayed significantly reduced binding affinity to all the peptides. To investigate the mechanism of the changes in specificity induced by the RT loop substitutions of BemSH3b, we tested the effects of substitutions with Ala in this region. Strikingly, the K14A substitution caused large increases in affinity for the Cla4, Skm1, and Bck1 sites, similar to the KAD → NDN substitution, and also bound more tightly to the Ste20 and Boi2 sites (Fig. 1B). A K14A/D16A double mutant showed no increase in affinity for any sites beyond that observed for the K14A mutant (supplemental Table S2). Thus, the altered binding properties of the BemSH3bKAD → NDN mutant can be mostly attributed to the elimination of the Lys-14 side chain, suggesting that this residue interferes with the binding mediated by Bem1SH3b. This result is surprising because the alignment of BemSH3b from widely diverse fungal species (Fig. 1C) shows that a positively charged residue has been conserved at this position over at least 500 million years of evolution. Substitutions at such conserved positions in protein-protein interaction interfaces usually cause large decreases in binding affinity. To determine whether the differences in binding specificity between Nbp2SH3 and BemSH3b observed in vitro have an effect on in vivo function, we replaced the chromosomally encoded NBP2 gene with one encoding a hybrid protein in which NbpSH3 was replaced with BemSH3b. As shown in Fig. 2, substitution of Nbp2SH3 with BemSH3b resulted in growth defects at 39 °C comparable with those seen with an nbp2Δ mutant (37Ohkuni K. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Genetics. 2003; 165: 517-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the defect in NbpSH3 function conferred by replacing it with BemSH3b, we compared the growth of cells expressing the Nbp2/BemSH3b hybrid protein to cells expressing Nbp2p bearing Y8A and F54A SH3 domain substitutions, which cause large reductions in peptide-binding but are not expected to affect specificity because they interact with the PXXP region (21Larson S.M. Davidson A.R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2170-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The level of growth mediated by the Nbp2/BemSH3b hybrid protein was intermediate between the NbpSH3 Y8A and F54A mutants which display 45- and 280-fold reductions, respectively, in binding affinity to the Ste20 peptide (supplemental Table S2). This suggested that in the Nbp2/BemSH3b hybrid protein, SH3 domain function is significantly affected but not completely lost. In contrast to cells expressing the Nbp2/BemSH3b hybrid protein, those expressing the Nbp2/BemSH3bKAD → NDN mutant grew as well as cells expressing wild-type Nbp2p (Fig. 2). All of these mutant proteins were expressed at levels similar to the wild type (supplemental Fig. S2). These data show that the specificity differences between NbpSH3 and BemSH3b observed in vitro result in an inability of BemSH3b to replace NbpSH3 in vivo. However, the BemSH3bKAD → NDN mutant was able to replace NbpSH3 because its specificity much more closely resembles that of NbpSH3. To investigate the effects of altered binding specificity on the in vivo function of the Bem1p protein, we constructed yeast strains in which the BEM1 gene was replaced by genes encoding the BemSH3b KAD → NDN or K14A mutants. Although strains bearing these mutations displayed no reduction in viability in a wild-type strain background (supplemental Fig. S3A), they displayed marked reductions in cell growth at high temperature (Fig. 3) when combined with smi1Δ, bni1Δ, or bem2Δ gene deletions, which are synthetically lethal with bem1Δ (supplemental Fig. S3B and Ref. 38Tong A.H. Lesage G. Bader G.D. Ding H. Xu H. Xin X. Young J. Berriz G.F. Brost R.L. Chang M. Chen Y. Cheng X. Chua G. Friesen H. Goldberg D.S. Haynes J. Humphries C. He G. Hussein S. Ke L. Krogan N. Li Z.

The in vivo effects of the altered specificity mutants were not the result of altered Bem1p expression levels or BemSH3b instability (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 3E). To gauge the importance of BemSH3b function in these backgrounds, we also tested the effect of the BemSH3b F54A substitution, which causes a large reduction in binding affinity (supplemental Table S2). Introduction of this substitution resulted in complete lack of growth at high temperature (Fig. 3) or synthetic lethality in the case of bem2Δ (supplemental Fig. S3C), emphasizing a critical role of SH3 domain activity in these backgrounds. The phenotypes caused by the BemSH3b KAD → NDN and K14A mutations could have been the result of a gain of function whereby the altered binding specificity led to deleterious misactivation of a pathway. To explore this possibility, we tested the effect of plasmid-mediated expression of wild-type Bem1p within these mutant cells. As shown in Fig. 3, expression of wild-type Bem1p at endogenous levels (supplemental Fig. S3D) led to normal levels of growth for the BemSH3b mutants in all three backgrounds. This recessive-like behavior indicated that altering the binding specificity of BemSH3b caused a loss of Bem1p function that could be overcome by expressing wild-type Bem1p. If these mutations had caused a gain of function, we would have expected their effect to be dominant. Because the BemSH3bKAD → NDN mutant displayed specificity that was similar to that of NbpSH3, we postulated that Bem1p carrying this substitution might interfere with Nbp2p function by competing for NbpSH3 binding sites within the cell. However, in strains carrying this mutation, we failed to observe any phenotypes indicative of a defect in the function of Nbp2p. These might have included hyperactivation of the cell wall integrity pathway (22Du Y. Walker L. Novick P. Ferro-Novick S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4413-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and growth defects in strains sensitized to Nbp2p SH3 function by deletion of additional genes (supplemental Fig. S4). The recessive behavior of BemSH3b altered specificity mutants led us to hypothesize that the impairment of Bem1p function caused by these mutations might be due to increased nonspecific binding, which might divert Bem1p from its proper target proteins. To investigate this idea, we compared the abilities of the wild-type domain and mutant BemSH3b coupled to nickel affinity resin to bind proteins from yeast extracts. These assays were performed with high concentrations of SH3 domains so that nonspecific binding could be detected. Although both the wild-type and mutant domains bound to a number of different proteins, the K14A mutant clearly bound more tightly to these proteins, as indicated by the greater intensity of many bands in the lane of the gel showing the eluate from the K14A column (Fig. 4A). The large number of proteins bound in these assays and their high concentration (i.e. they were easily visualized in a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel) suggested that these interactions were nonspecific. Most of the bound proteins were absent in the eluate of BemSH3b containing the F54A substitution, which abrogates PXXP binding interface. These indicated that these nonspecific interactions still required Pro-rich sequences. With this in mind, we used the same assay to test binding of BemSH3b to six different TAP-tagged proteins containing RXXPXXP motifs, which have no functional connection to Bem1p (supplemental Table S3). Among these proteins, Tif32p, Cdc48p, and Las17p showed increased binding to the K14A mutant when compared with the wild-type domain but absence of binding to the F54A mutant (Fig. 4B). These results mirrored those seen in the binding assay to total yeast lysates. To confirm increased nonspecific peptide binding activity of the K14A mutant, we assessed its binding to an RXXPXXP-containing peptide that possessed none of the other conserved features of peptides bound tightly by BemSH3b (Fig. 4C). Wild-type BemSH3b displayed little detectable binding to this peptide, as detected by examination of Trp fluorescence spectra, even when the peptide was present in 100-fold excess. By contrast, addition of this peptide to the K14A mutant caused an approximately 5-fold increase in Trp fluorescence intensity at 330 nm compared with the wild-type domain and a blue shift in the peak wavelength of emission, indicating that the mutant bound significantly more strongly to the nonspecific target. In summary, these results demonstrate an increased level of nonspecific binding by the BemSH3bK14A mutant, which could reduce its ability to bind sufficiently to its required partners in vivo. Our findings regarding the Lys-14 position of BemSH3b led us to seek similar specificity-regulating residues within NbpSH3. Through investigation of several conserved positions within the putative peptide interaction interface of this domain, we discovered that the H32A substitution led to an approximately 10-fold increase in affinity for most of the tested target peptides (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, BemSH3b also possesses a His residue at this position, but substitution of this residue had little effect on binding affinity (supplemental Table S2). Like the BemSH3bK14A mutant, the NbpSH3H32A mutant showed an increased level of nonspecific binding to proteins in a yeast cell extract as compared with the wild-type domain (Fig. 4A). This increased nonspecific binding was still observable even though the wild-type"
https://openalex.org/W2030554946,"The production of cAMP from Bacillus anthracis edema toxin (ET) activates gene expression in macrophages through a complex array of signaling pathways, most of which remain poorly defined. In this study, the tumor suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) was found to be important for the up-regulation of previously defined ET-stimulated genes (Vegfa, Ptgs2, Arg2, Cxcl2, Sdc1, and Cebpb). A reduction in the expression of these genes after ET exposure was observed when APC was disrupted in macrophages using siRNA or in bone marrow-derived macrophages obtained from C57BL/6J-Apc(Min) mice, which are heterozygous for a truncated form of APC. In line with this observation, ET increased the expression of APC at the transcriptional level, leading to increased amounts of APC in the nucleus. The mechanism utilized by APC to increase ET-induced gene expression was determined to depend on the ability of APC to interact with C/EBP β, which is a transcription factor activated by cAMP. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments found that APC associated with C/EBP β and that levels of this complex increase after ET exposure. A further connection was uncovered when silencing APC was determined to reduce the ET-induced phosphorylation of C/EBP β at Thr-188. This ET-mediated phosphorylation of C/EBP β was blocked by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibitors, suggesting that GSK-3 is involved in the activation of C/EBP β and supporting the idea of APC helping direct interactions between GSK-3 and C/EBP β. These results indicate that ET stimulates gene expression by promoting the formation of an inducible protein complex consisting of APC and C/EBP β."

https://openalex.org/W1992936229,"The use of DNA based methods for assessing biodiversity has become increasingly common during the last years. Especially in speciose biomes as tropical rain forests and/or in hyperdiverse or understudied taxa they may efficiently complement morphological approaches. The most successful molecular approach in this field is DNA barcoding based on cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) marker, but other markers are used as well. Whereas most studies aim at identifying or describing species, there are only few attempts to use DNA markers for inventorying all animal species found in environmental samples to describe variations of biodiversity patterns.In this study, an analysis of the nuclear D3 region of the 28S rRNA gene to delimit species-like units is compared to results based on distinction of morphospecies. Data derived from both approaches are used to assess diversity and composition of staphylinid beetle communities of a Guineo-Congolian rain forest in Kenya. Beetles were collected with a standardized sampling design across six transects in primary and secondary forests using pitfall traps. Sequences could be obtained of 99% of all individuals. In total, 76 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) were found in contrast to 70 discernible morphospecies. Despite this difference both approaches revealed highly similar biodiversity patterns, with species richness being equal in primary and secondary forests, but with divergent species communities in different habitats. The D3-MOTU approach proved to be an efficient tool for biodiversity analyses.Our data illustrate that the use of MOTUs as a proxy for species can provide an alternative to morphospecies identification for the analysis of changes in community structure of hyperdiverse insect taxa. The efficient amplification of the D3-marker and the ability of the D3-MOTUs to reveal similar biodiversity patterns as analyses of morphospecies recommend its use in future molecular studies on biodiversity."
