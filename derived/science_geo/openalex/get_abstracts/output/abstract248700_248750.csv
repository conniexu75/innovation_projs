https://openalex.org/W2139362435,"Carbon sequestration strategies highlight tree plantations without considering their full environmental consequences. We combined field research, synthesis of more than 600 observations, and climate and economic modeling to document substantial losses in stream flow, and increased soil salinization and acidification, with afforestation. Plantations decreased stream flow by 227 millimeters per year globally (52%), with 13% of streams drying completely for at least 1 year. Regional modeling of U.S. plantation scenarios suggests that climate feedbacks are unlikely to offset such water losses and could exacerbate them. Plantations can help control groundwater recharge and upwelling but reduce stream flow and salinize and acidify some soils."
https://openalex.org/W2026222098,"In higher eukaryotes, miRNAs and siRNAs guide translational inhibition, mRNA cleavage, or chromatin regulation. We found that the antisense overlapping gene pair of Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH), a stress-related gene, and SRO5, a gene of unknown function, generates two types of siRNAs. When both transcripts are present, a 24-nt siRNA is formed by a biogenesis pathway dependent on DCL2, RDR6, SGS3, and NRPD1A. Initial cleavage of the P5CDH transcript guided by the 24-nt siRNA establishes a phase for the subsequent generation of 21-nt siRNAs by DCL1 and further cleavage of P5CDH transcripts. The expression of SRO5 is induced by salt, and this induction is required to initiate siRNA formation. Our data suggest that the P5CDH and SRO5 proteins are also functionally related, and that the P5CDH-SRO5 gene pair defines a mode of siRNA function and biogenesis that may be applied to other natural cis-antisense gene pairs in eukaryotic genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2039143648,"Histone variant H2AX phosphorylation in response to DNA damage is the major signal for recruitment of DNA-damage-response proteins to regions of damaged chromatin. Loss of H2AX causes radiosensitivity, genome instability, and DNA double-strand-break repair defects, yet the mechanisms underlying these phenotypes remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that mammalian MDC1/NFBD1 directly binds to phospho-H2AX (gammaH2AX) by specifically interacting with the phosphoepitope at the gammaH2AX carboxyl terminus. Moreover, through a combination of biochemical, cell-biological, and X-ray crystallographic approaches, we reveal the molecular details of the MDC1/NFBD1-gammaH2AX complex. These data provide compelling evidence that the MDC1/NFBD1 BRCT repeat domain is the major mediator of gammaH2AX recognition following DNA damage. We further show that MDC1/NFBD1-gammaH2AX complex formation regulates H2AX phosphorylation and is required for normal radioresistance and efficient accumulation of DNA-damage-response proteins on damaged chromatin. Thus, binding of MDC1/NFBD1 to gammaH2AX plays a central role in the mammalian response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2002542393,"We report the observation of pairing in a gas of atomic fermions with unequal numbers of two components. Beyond a critical polarization, the gas separates into a phase that is consistent with a superfluid paired core surrounded by a shell of normal unpaired fermions. The critical polarization diminishes with decreasing attractive interaction. For near-zero polarization, we measured the parameter β = –0.54 ± 0.05, describing the universal energy of a strongly interacting paired Fermi gas, and found good agreement with recent theory. These results are relevant to predictions of exotic new phases of quark matter and of strongly magnetized superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2011256460,"We established superfluidity in a two-state mixture of ultracold fermionic atoms with imbalanced state populations. This study relates to the long-standing debate about the nature of the superfluid state in Fermi systems. Indicators for superfluidity were condensates of fermion pairs and vortices in rotating clouds. For strong interactions, near a Feshbach resonance, superfluidity was observed for a broad range of population imbalances. We mapped out the superfluid regime as a function of interaction strength and population imbalance and characterized the quantum phase transition to the normal state, known as the Pauli limit of superfluidity."
https://openalex.org/W1968635050,"Here we describe a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of humans engaged in memory search during a free recall task. Patterns of cortical activity associated with the study of three categories of pictures (faces, locations, and objects) were identified by a pattern-classification algorithm. The algorithm was used to track the reappearance of these activity patterns during the recall period. The reappearance of a given category's activity pattern correlates with verbal recalls made from that category and precedes the recall event by several seconds. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that category-specific activity is cueing the memory system to retrieve studied items."
https://openalex.org/W2081320341,"Magnetosomes are membranous bacterial organelles sharing many features of eukaryotic organelles. Using electron cryotomography, we found that magnetosomes are invaginations of the cell membrane flanked by a network of cytoskeletal filaments. The filaments appeared to be composed of MamK, a homolog of the bacterial actin-like protein MreB, which formed filaments in vivo. In a mamK deletion strain, the magnetosome-associated cytoskeleton was absent and individual magnetosomes were no longer organized into chains. Thus, it seems that prokaryotes can use cytoskeletal filaments to position organelles within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2152863656,"The lipocalin mouse 24p3 has been implicated in diverse physiological processes, including apoptosis due to interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation and iron transport. Here we report cloning of the 24p3 cell-surface receptor (24p3R). Ectopic 24p3R expression confers on cells the ability to undergo either iron uptake or apoptosis, dependent upon the iron content of the ligand: Iron-loaded 24p3 increases intracellular iron concentration without promoting apoptosis; iron-lacking 24p3 decreases intracellular iron levels, which induces expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim, resulting in apoptosis. Intracellular iron delivery blocks Bim induction and suppresses apoptosis due to 24p3 addition or IL-3 deprivation. We find, unexpectedly, that the BCR-ABL oncoprotein activates expression of 24p3 and represses 24p3R expression, rendering BCR-ABL(+) cells refractory to secreted 24p3. By inhibiting BCR-ABL, imatinib induces 24p3R expression and, consequently, apoptosis. Our results reveal an unanticipated role for intracellular iron regulation in an apoptotic pathway relevant to BCR-ABL-induced myeloproliferative disease and its treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1978107331,"Linker histone H1 plays an important role in chromatin folding in vitro. To study the role of H1 in vivo, mouse embryonic stem cells null for three H1 genes were derived and were found to have 50% of the normal level of H1. H1 depletion caused dramatic chromatin structure changes, including decreased global nucleosome spacing, reduced local chromatin compaction, and decreases in certain core histone modifications. Surprisingly, however, microarray analysis revealed that expression of only a small number of genes is affected. Many of the affected genes are imprinted or are on the X chromosome and are therefore normally regulated by DNA methylation. Although global DNA methylation is not changed, methylation of specific CpGs within the regulatory regions of some of the H1 regulated genes is reduced. These results indicate that linker histones can participate in epigenetic regulation of gene expression by contributing to the maintenance or establishment of specific DNA methylation patterns."
https://openalex.org/W4240619060,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are two major inflammatory mediators. Here we show that iNOS specifically binds to COX-2 and S-nitrosylates it, enhancing COX-2 catalytic activity. Selectively disrupting iNOS–COX-2 binding prevented NO-mediated activation of COX-2. This synergistic molecular interaction between two inflammatory systems may inform the development of anti-inflammatory drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2074904925,"The microRNA lin-4 and its target, the putative transcription factor lin-14 , control the timing of larval development in Caenorhabditis elegans . Here, we report that lin-4 and lin-14 also regulate life span in the adult. Reducing the activity of lin-4 shortened life span and accelerated tissue aging, whereas overexpressing lin-4 or reducing the activity of lin-14 extended life span. Lifespan extension conferred by a reduction in lin-14 was dependent on the DAF-16 and HSF-1 transcription factors, suggesting that the lin-4 – lin-14 pair affects life span through the insulin/insulin-like growth factor–1 pathway. This work reveals a role for microRNAs and developmental timing genes in life-span regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2165433466,"Periodontitis is a well-appreciated example of leukocyte-mediated bone loss and inflammation that has pathogenic features similar to those observed in other inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. Resolvins are a new family of bioactive products of omega-3 fatty acid transformation circuits initiated by aspirin treatment that counter proinflammatory signals. Because it is now increasingly apparent that local inflammation plays a critical role in many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and asthma, experiments were undertaken to evaluate the actions of the newly described EPA-derived Resolvin E1 (RvE1) in regulation of neutrophil tissue destruction and resolution of inflammation. The actions of an aspirin-triggered lipoxin (LX) analog and RvE1 in a human disease, localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP), were determined. Results indicate that neutrophils from LAP are refractory to anti-inflammatory molecules of the LX series, whereas LAP neutrophils respond to RvE1. In addition, RvE1 specifically binds to human neutrophils at a site that is functionally distinct from the LX receptor. Consistent with these potent actions, topical application of RvE1 in rabbit periodontitis conferred dramatic protection against inflammation induced tissue and bone loss associated with periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W2100368894,"Pancreatic beta cell-surface expression of glucose transporter 2 (Glut-2) is essential for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, thereby controlling blood glucose homeostasis in response to dietary intake. We show that the murine GlcNAcT-IVa glycosyltransferase is required for Glut-2 residency on the beta cell surface by constructing a cell-type- and glycoprotein-specific N-glycan ligand for pancreatic lectin receptors. Loss of GlcNAcT-IVa, or the addition of glycan-ligand mimetics, attenuates Glut-2 cell-surface half-life, provoking endocytosis with redistribution into endosomes and lysosomes. The ensuing impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion leads to metabolic dysfunction diagnostic of type 2 diabetes. Remarkably, the induction of diabetes by chronic ingestion of a high-fat diet is associated with reduced GlcNAcT-IV expression and attenuated Glut-2 glycosylation coincident with Glut-2 endocytosis. We infer that beta cell glucose-transporter glycosylation mediates a link between diet and insulin production that typically suppresses the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1975548496,"The phylogenetic relationships among most metazoan phyla remain uncertain. We obtained large numbers of gene sequences from metazoans, including key understudied taxa. Despite the amount of data and breadth of taxa analyzed, relationships among most metazoan phyla remained unresolved. In contrast, the same genes robustly resolved phylogenetic relationships within a major clade of Fungi of approximately the same age as the Metazoa. The differences in resolution within the two kingdoms suggest that the early history of metazoans was a radiation compressed in time, a finding that is in agreement with paleontological inferences. Furthermore, simulation analyses as well as studies of other radiations in deep time indicate that, given adequate sequence data, the lack of resolution in phylogenetic trees is a signature of closely spaced series of cladogenetic events."
https://openalex.org/W1991890472,"The maintenance of stem cells in defined locations is crucial for all multicellular organisms. Although intrinsic factors and signals for stem cell fate have been identified in several species, it has remained unclear how these connect to the ability to reenter the cell cycle that is one of the defining properties of stem cells. We show that local reduction of expression of the RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) gene in Arabidopsis roots increases the amount of stem cells without affecting cell cycle duration in mitotically active cells. Conversely, induced RBR overexpression dissipates stem cells prior to arresting other mitotic cells. Overexpression of D cyclins, KIP-related proteins, and E2F factors also affects root stem cell pool size, and genetic interactions suggest that these factors function in a canonical RBR pathway to regulate somatic stem cells. Expression analysis and genetic interactions position RBR-mediated regulation of the stem cell state downstream of the patterning gene SCARECROW.

Expression analysis and genetic interactions position RBR-mediated regulation of the stem cell state downstream of the patterning gene SCARECROW. Stem cells of multicellular organisms maintain themselves and generate daughters that may initiate developmental programs as simple as the replacement of a single cell type or as complex as the formation of an entire organism. Plants form organs throughout their entire life span, which can extend over 1000 years. For that purpose, they maintain pluripotent somatic stem cells within the meristems, local pools of mitotically active cells (Weigel and Jurgens, 2002Weigel D. Jurgens G. Stem cells that make stems.Nature. 2002; 415: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In the Arabidopsis root meristem (RM), stem cells for all root cell types surround a small group of organizing cells, the quiescent center (QC; Scheres et al., 1994Scheres B. Wolkenfelt H. Willemsen V. Terlouw M. Lawson E. Dean C. Weisbeek P. Embryonic origin of the Arabidopsis primary root and root meristem initials.Development. 1994; 120: 2475-2487Google Scholar) and together they form a stem cell niche. Laser ablation studies have demonstrated that the QC maintains the stem cell status of immediately surrounding cells (van den Berg et al., 1997van den Berg C. Willemsen V. Hendriks G. Weisbeek P. Scheres B. Short-range control of cell differentiation in the Arabidopsis root meristem.Nature. 1997; 390: 287-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The QC is specified by combinatorial action of two gene sets. PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLETHORA2 (PLT2) encode AP2-type putative transcription factors whose transcripts are restricted to the QC and stem cells in response to distribution of the phytohormone auxin (Aida et al., 2004Aida M.

SCARECROW (SCR) and SHORTROOT (SHR) encode members of the GRAS family of transcription factors required for aspects of radial patterning but also for QC identity (Di Laurenzio et al., 1996Di Laurenzio L.

Heidstra R. Wildwater M. Scheres B. SCARECROW is involved in positioning the stem cell niche in the Arabidopsis root meristem.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Loss of PLT1 and PLT2 or loss of either SHR or SCR results in defective QC specification, differentiation of stem cells, and meristem termination. While the patterning mechanisms that position plant stem cells are beginning to be understood, it is unknown how these maintain stem cell division and prevent differentiation. In mammalian cells, the decision to enter a new cell cycle is made during the G1 restriction point. One of the key regulators of this restriction point is the retinoblastoma protein (RB; reviewed in Weinberg, 1995Weinberg R.A. The retinoblastoma protein and cell cycle control.Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4183) Google Scholar) which exerts its antiproliferative activity, at least in part, by inhibiting cell cycle promoting E2F transcription factors. Upon release from RB-mediated inhibition, E2Fs activate their target genes and allow cell cycle progression. In addition to its role in cell cycle progression, RB activity has been linked to maintenance of the differentiated state (Lipinski and Jacks, 1999Lipinski M.M. Jacks T. The retinoblastoma gene family in differentiation and development.Nature. 1999; 18: 7873-7882Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that conditional inactivation of RB and/or its close homologs in mice stimulate cell cycle reentry and increase epidermal and neural precursor cell number, which makes the RB pathway an attractive candidate for the regulation of stem cell characteristics (Ruiz et al., 2004Ruiz S. Santos M. Segrelles C. Leis H. Jorcano J.L. Berns A. Paramio J.M. Vooijs M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Many mammalian systems, however, lack definitive stem cell markers, and it is difficult to pinpoint effects to true stem cells. Plants contain homologs of RB, E2F, CDKs, cyclin D, and KIP-related proteins (KRPs), which suggests that a canonical G1-S regulatory pathway could be active (Inze, 2005Inze D. Green light for the cell cycle.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In vitro analyses support this notion, as plant RBR interacts with CYCD proteins (Huntley et al., 1998Huntley R. Healy S. Freeman D. Lavender P. de Jager S. Greenwood J. Makker J. Walker E. Jackman M. Xie Q. et al.The maize retinoblastoma protein homologue ZmRb-1 is regulated during leaf development and displays conserved interactions with G1/S regulators and plant cyclin D (CycD) proteins.Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and can be phosphorylated by a CDK2a/CYCD3 complex (Nakagami et al., 1999Nakagami H. Sekine M. Murakami H. Shinmyo A. Tobacco retinoblastoma-related protein phosphorylated by a distinct cyclin-dependent kinase complex with Cdc2/cyclin D in vitro.Plant J. 1999; 18: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis contains a single RB homolog, RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR), that is required already in the haploid phase of the life cycle prior to fertilization (Ebel et al., 2004Ebel C. Mariconti L. Gruissem W. Plant retinoblastoma homologues control nuclear proliferation in the female gametophyte.Nature. 2004; 429: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Here, we address postembryonic functions of the RBR gene using conditional loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. We show that RBR is transcribed in all mitotically active cells but that the stem cell population in the Arabidopsis root is particularly sensitive to RBR manipulation. RBR regulates the size of the stem cell population downstream of the SCR patterning gene and in a canonical CYCD/RB/E2F pathway. This connects stem cell niche patterning and stem cell maintenance in plants and indicates overlap between plant and animal stem cell maintenance mechanisms. We investigated the transcriptional regulation of RBR after fertilization to gain insight into its potential roles at later phases of the life cycle. In situ hybridization with a RBR-specific probe reveals a salt-and-pepper distribution in all embryos up to the heart stage (n = 27), which suggests cell cycle regulation (Figures 1A and 1B). At early torpedo stage, RBR transcripts are retained predominantly in actively dividing root and shoot meristem anlagen (Figure 1C, arrowheads). In the postembryonic root meristem, RBR mRNA is elevated in a patchy pattern mostly within pairs of small cells (92% of intensely staining cells; n = 75), indicating that RBR transcription is highest after cells have completed a cell division cycle (Figure 1F). In the shoot, RBR transcription is restricted to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and young leaf primordia (Figure 1I). Together, our data suggest a role for plant RBR in actively dividing cells. Since RBR knockouts are gametophytic lethal (Ebel et al., 2004Ebel C. Mariconti L. Gruissem W. Plant retinoblastoma homologues control nuclear proliferation in the female gametophyte.Nature. 2004; 429: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), we used the root meristem-specific RCH1 promoter, active from early heart stage onward in the root primordium and in the postembryonic root meristem (Casamitjana-Martinez et al., 2003Casamitjana-Martinez E. Hofhuis H.F. Xu J. Liu C.M. Heidstra R. Scheres B. Root-specific CLE19 overexpression and the sol1/2 suppressors implicate a CLV-like pathway in the control of Arabidopsis root meristem maintenance.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1435-1441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), to drive an RBR RNAi construct in the root cell-division zone. Two independent RCH1::RBR RNAi (“rRBr”) lines showed silencing as determined by quantitative PCR (data not shown). To determine whether silencing was region specific, we performed in situ hybridization on rRBr embryos and seedlings. In early embryonic development, when the RCH1 promoter is not active, RBR transcript distribution in rRBr is similar to wild-type (wt; Figure 1D). At torpedo stage, RBR expression vanishes in root primordia of rRBr lines (Figure 1E). After germination, RBR transcript is low in rRBr root meristems (Figure 1H), but wild-type levels can be observed in rRBr shoot apices (Figure 1J). We concluded that a root-specific RNAi system can significantly reduce RBR mRNA levels in embryos and postembryonic roots. Antibodies against RBR protein detected a 110 kDa protein in wt roots that was strongly reduced in roots from rRBr lines (Figure 1K), indicating that region-specific RNAi significantly affects RBR protein levels. In Arabidopsis roots, the columella root cap consists of a single layer of stem cells immediately distal to the QC and several tiers of differentiated cells that elongate and contain starch granules (Figure 2A). In 4 days postgermination (dpg) rRBr seedlings, additional undifferentiated cells appear in the columella stem cell area (Figure 2B). These cells encompass more tiers and occupy a larger area than wt stem cells (Figures 2C and 2P). This indicates that columella cells differentiate at a more distal position in rRBr plants. The differentiated columella cells in rRBr plants contain starch granules but reach smaller sizes (Figures 2B and 2F). The total area occupied by columella root cap cells steadily increases (Figure 2P). To verify whether the QC is still functional in rRBr roots and whether the excessive undifferentiated columella cells are stem cells, we ablated the QC, which leads to columella stem cell differentiation in wt roots (Figure 2D; van den Berg et al., 1997van den Berg C. Willemsen V. Hendriks G. Weisbeek P. Scheres B. Short-range control of cell differentiation in the Arabidopsis root meristem.Nature. 1997; 390: 287-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Ablation of QC cells in rRBr roots induces rapid differentiation of all undifferentiated columella layers (Figure 2E). We concluded that the QC is functional in rRBr lines and that additional stem cell layers accumulate in the columella root cap. Lateral root cap (LRC) stem cells, which also act as epidermal stem cells, perform a characteristic periclinal cell division that creates new layers (Figure 2G, white arrowheads). In rRBr plants, 1–2 additional layers of LRC tissue are present (Figure 2H), suggesting additional stem cell activity. Promoter fusions of the GL2 and WER genes mark the epidermis, but they are less active in LRC/epidermal stem cells of the wt (Lee and Schiefelbein, 1999Lee M.M. Schiefelbein J. WEREWOLF, a MYB-related protein in Arabidopsis, is a position-dependent regulator of epidermal cell patterning.Cell. 1999; 99: 473-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, Masucci et al., 1996Masucci J.D. Rerie W.G. Foreman D.R. Zhang M. Galway M.E. Marks M.D. Schiefelbein J.W. The homeobox gene GLABRA2 is required for position-dependent cell differentiation in the root epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana.Development. 1996; 122: 1253-1260PubMed Google Scholar). Excessive cells with lower activity of these promoters are present in rRBr plants (Figures 2I–2L), consistent with an increased domain of LRC/epidermal stem cell activity. Cell size of LRC cells becomes progressively reduced (Figures 2H, 2J, and 2L), but LRC identity marker N9099 remains expressed in fully mature cells (Figures 2M and 2N). Our data suggest that, in both columella and LRC/epidermis, excessive stem cells accumulate which eventually differentiate; mature root cap cells gradually reach smaller final sizes. While the number of ground tissue stem cells and their cortex and endodermis daughter cell files in circumference is 8 in the wild-type (Dolan et al., 1993Dolan L. Janmaat K. Willemsen V. Linstead P. Poethig S. Roberts R. Scheres B. Cellular organisation of the Arabidopsis thaliana root.Development. 1993; 119: 71-84PubMed Google Scholar), rRBr plants contained between 10 and 14 ground tissue stem cells and derived cell files (Figure 2O; n = 13). A stem cell-specific probe for ground tissue stem cells expanded in a significant proportion of rRBr plants (Figures 3P and 3R; see below), indicating that ground tissue stem cell attributes expand in response to RBR reduction. Finally, provascular cell number was significantly increased at the stem cell level from 23–25 in wt to 32–37 in rRBr plants (Figure 2O; n = 9). Although consistent with increased stem cell activity, vascular stem cell-specific markers will be needed to substantiate this result. In the proximal meristem, cells undergo several division rounds before they rapidly elongate and differentiate. rRBr root length, meristem size, meristem cell number, and size of differentiated epidermal and cortical cells are not significantly different from wt (Figures 2Q–2T), which indicates that the size of the proximal mitotic cell pool and postmitotic cell expansion are not affected in rRBr plants. SCR, SHR, and the PLT genes are required for QC and stem cell patterning, and the expression of SCR and SHR protein fusions and PLT1 promoter activity is not significantly altered in rRBr plants even at late developmental stages (Figures 3A–3C and 3F–3H). Also the quiescent center-specific markers QC25, QC46, and QC184, which depend on SHR, SCR, and PLT input, are initially correctly expressed, but switch off at later stages (Figures 3D, 3E, 3I, and 3J and data not shown). Together with our laser ablation studies which suggest that the QC in rRBr plants remains functional, these observations indicate that RBR does not influence stem cell fate through changes in cell patterning. scr, shr, and plt1,plt2 double mutants cannot maintain their meristems due to defects in QC specification and loss of stem cells. To find out if reduction of RBR activity maintains stem cells downstream of SCR, SHR, or PLT genes, rRBr was combined with strong mutant alleles for these genes. scr-4,rRBr plants retain undifferentiated columella and LRC cells (Figures 3L and 3N). QC ablation in this background causes rapid differentiation of these cells (Figure 3O), indicating that QC function is restored in scr-4,rRBr roots and that columella stem cells are present. At 14 dpg, when the meristem of scr-4 mutants is completely consumed, scr-4,rRBr roots retain a large meristem. Additional cells files are created by excessive periclinal cell divisions in vasculature and ground tissue of scr-4,rRBr roots suggesting that, in the scr-4 background, RBR reduction leads to excessive activity of all root stem cells (Figure 3N). Large numbers of undifferentiated cells in scr-4,rRBr indicate that the transition to cell differentiation is compromised, a feature not seen in scr-4 or outside the root cap area of rRBr plants. As these cells hardly expand, they barely contribute to root growth which is consequently not restored in scr-4,rRBr plants (Figure 2Q). To further investigate whether RBR reduction can rescue stem cell activity downstream of SCR, we utilized a probe derived from the At5g44160 gene that is specific for ground tissue stem cells in early-stage roots (Figure 3P). At5g44160 mRNA accumulation in stem cells strongly depends on SCR activity (Figure 3U and Table 1), and its expression domain in the ground tissue is expanded in rRBr roots (Figures 3Q, 3R, and 3V), consistent with an expansion of the stem cell population after RBR reduction. Importantly, scr-4,rRBr plants significantly restore the expression of At5g44160 in the ground tissue layer (Figure 3W and Table 1), supporting rRBr action downstream of SCR.Table 1Ground Tissue Stem Cell Marker Gene ExpressionSCNSC−nwt111032143scr-44aWeak staining in all roots.5aWeak staining in all roots.8392rRBr592178158scr-4, rRBr216bWeak staining in 25% of roots.7290Quantification of At5g44160 in situ hybridization data.

Open table in a new tab Quantification of At5g44160 in situ hybridization data. Numbers of 3 dpg roots with staining focused in stem cells (SC), in non-stem cells (NSC), without staining (−), and totals analyzed (n). To investigate how RBR might be regulated by SCR, we determined transcript and protein levels in scr-4 mutants. RBR transcript (data not shown) as well as protein (Figure 1K) was lower in scr-4 mutants opposite to changes expected from SCR-mediated downregulation of RBR levels. Collectively, our data indicate that SCR acts upstream of RBR function and regulates both RBR activity and amount, but in opposite directions. In the rRBr background, shr-1 mutants contain a cluster of small undifferentiated cells in the stem cell area not present in shr-1 alone (Figures 3S and 3X), but these completely differentiate after 5 dpg (n = 15), indicating only transient rescue of stem cell activity by RBR reduction in shr-1. plt1,plt2,rRBr roots do not show any additional stem cell activity compared to plt1,plt2 mutants at early stages when these still possess stem cells (Figures 3T and 3Y). Furthermore, plt1,plt2,rRBr roots differentiate at the same rate as plt1,plt2 double mutant (n = 21). This full epistasis indicates that PLT gene function cannot be bypassed by RBR reduction. Additional cells in the columella stem cell area might arise as a consequence of an enhanced cell cycle in the single cell layer that performs these divisions in wt or by stem cell-like divisions in more layers. In the first scenario, the additional layers arise due to an inability of the differentiation process to keep up with the proliferation of daughter cells, whereas in the latter case the displaced daughters behave exactly like the stem cell layer. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used a novel in vivo time lapse recording procedure (B. Garcia et al., 2004, LNCS, abstract). We combined a plasmalemma marker LTI6b:GFP with the chromatin marker H2B:YFP to observe cell divisions in wt and rRBr roots. Unlike in wt, cell divisions can be observed in two layers of columella in rRBr roots (Figures 4A and 4B, arrows). The frequency of cell divisions in the rRBr stem cell region on a per-cell basis was not higher (Figure 4C). These data indicate that reduction of RBR maintains stem cell fate in columella daughters, rendering them competent to divide again. In the meristem region proximal to the QC and stem cells, the number of divisions observed in time lapses is comparable between wt and rRBr plants (Figure 4C), supporting the notion that stem cells are more sensitive than the proximal meristem to changed levels in RBR. To analyze cell cycle progression in proximal meristem cells independently, we visualized cells in the G2-M phase using D Box CYCB1;1:GUS (Colon-Carmona et al., 1999Colon-Carmona A. You R. Haimovitch-Gal T. Doerner P. Spatio-temporal analysis of mitotic activity with a labile cyclin-GUS fusion protein.Plant J. 1999; 20: 503-508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The total number of GUS-staining cells in wt and rRBr roots was similar (Figures 4D and 4E and data not shown), consistent with a similar overall division rate. D Box CYCB1;1:GUS was observed in the QC of ∼30% of rRBr but not wt plants, suggesting that QC cells divide more frequently than in wt (Figure 4E, asterisk). The stem cell-specific defects and the reduction of cell expansion in rRBr plants could be due to variable levels of silencing of the RBR gene by the RNAi approach. To investigate whether a defined reduction in RBR gene copies could separate these effects, we utilized the gametophytic lethal rbr1-3 allele. First, we noticed that rbr1-3/RBR+ plants display subtle columella cell expansion defects and, more rarely, stem cell proliferation (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Next, we sought to complement the gametophytic defect of rbr1-3 by a single copy insertion of an 8.5 kb genomic RBR region between lox recombination sites (pCB1-RBR; Ebel et al., 2004Ebel C. Mariconti L. Gruissem W. Plant retinoblastoma homologues control nuclear proliferation in the female gametophyte.Nature. 2004; 429: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, Heidstra et al., 2004Heidstra R. Welch D. Scheres B. Mosaic analyses using marked activation and deletion clones dissect Arabidopsis SCARECROW action in asymmetric cell division.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1964-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The genomic RBR fragment partially complemented gametophytic RBR requirement, which resulted in plants containing at least one wt RBR allele and additional pCB1-RBR alleles (see Experimental Procedures). Crosses to plants with heat-shock promoter-driven Cre recombinase (HS-CRE) allows heat-shock-induced removal of RBR copies between lox sites in clones marked by GFP (Heidstra et al., 2004Heidstra R. Welch D. Scheres B. Mosaic analyses using marked activation and deletion clones dissect Arabidopsis SCARECROW action in asymmetric cell division.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1964-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). pCB1-RBR and HS-CRE parental lines reveal no phenotypic defects after heat shock (data not shown). Clones in rbr1-3/RBR+ background where either one or two copies of pCB1-RBR can be removed fall into three phenotypic classes. Plants with clones at both sides of the root cap show stem cell proliferation only (Figure 4F). Plants with clones that encompass part of the QC and root cap cells show stem cell proliferation and root cap bending (Figure 4G) or root cap bending only (Figure 4H). In the latter case, root cap bending occurs toward the region containing cells with excisions (n = 18). Interestingly, only clones associated with root cap bending can be found in RBR+/RBR+ background after removal of one copy of pCB1-RBR (data not shown). We concluded that a decrease from three to two RBR copies leads to a reduction in root cap cell growth (resulting in bending), which is consistent with the observed gradual reduction of columella cell size in RBR RNAi plants. Reduction from three to one copies leads to stem cell proliferation and attenuation of cell growth. We next investigated the effects of RBR copy number reduction in the proximal meristem. Plants with reduced RBR copy number in significant portions of the meristem do not decrease root growth rate and meristem size up to 7 days after heat shock (data not shown). Clones generated in meristematic derivatives of stem cells after short heat shock corroborate that all cells outside of the root cap display wt growth characteristics upon RBR reduction (Figure 4I). Our data substantiate the specific effects on stem cell maintenance observed in the RNAi lines. Moreover, they indicate that columella cell growth is most sensitive to acute RBR reduction because it requires reduction of only one RBR gene copy. Proximal meristem cells only show expansion defects after simultaneous RBR reduction and mutation of the SCR gene. Our data suggest that RBR affects cell growth, as has been observed for Drosophila G1-S transition regulators (Johnston et al., 1999Johnston L.A. Prober D.A. Edgar B.A. Eisenman R.N. Gallant P. Drosophila myc regulates cellular growth during development.Cell. 1999; 98: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In one plant, we found supernumerary stem cells that had not undergone RBR excision themselves, but abutting cells that had undergone RBR excision (Figure 4F, inset). This observation suggests that RBR reduction may influence stem cell fate nonautonomously. To analyze whether downregulation of RBR is essential for stem cell maintenance, we overexpressed RBR cDNA fused to the GR domain for inducible activation. As negative control, we used RBR cDNA with an essential amino acid substitution (RBRc788p; Huntley et al., 1998Huntley R. Healy S. Freeman D. Lavender P. de Jager S. Greenwood J. Makker J. Walker E. Jackman M. Xie Q. et al.The maize retinoblastoma protein homologue ZmRb-1 is regulated during leaf development and displays conserved interactions with G1/S regulators and plant cyclin D (CycD) proteins.Plant Mol.

A single amino acid substitution results in a retinoblastoma protein defective in phosphorylation and oncoprotein binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 6922-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). When seedlings were transferred on 0.1μM dexamethasone (dex), columella stem cell identity in 35S::RBR:GR was lost within 1 day as differentiated cells adjoined the QC (Figures 5A and 5B) and ground tissue stem cell identity was compromised as judged by the loss of At5g44160 RNA (Figures 5I and 5J). Both stem cell effects occurred prior to any other phenotypic changes. SCR, SHR, PLT promoter activity and the QC25 marker were not affected in 35S::RBR:GR on 0.1μM dex, confirming that patterning is not primarily affected upon manipulation of RBR activity (data not shown). The expression of D Box CYCB1;1:GUS in the proximal meristem was not altered after 1 day on 0.1 μM dex, confirming that stem cells respond more sensitively than the proximal meristem to changing levels in RBR expression (Figures 5E and 5F). Upon prolonged exposure to 0.1 μM dex and on 1μM dex, however, root growth is reduced, meristem size severely decreases, and expression of D Box CYCB1;1:GUS disappears (Figures 5C, 5D, 5G, and 5H). The sensitive response of stem cells to RBR overexpression and the contrasting consequences compared to RBR reduction further support that modulation of RBR activity is critical for stem cell maintenance. According to current models of cell cycle regulation in mammals and plants, cyclin D (C"
https://openalex.org/W2029146318,"A critical question about signal transduction is how weak or transient activation of signaling pathways achieves a robust and long-term switch in gene expression. We report that a microRNA is part of a mechanism that makes cells sensitive to signals in the Drosophila eye. Expression of miR-7 is activated in cells as they begin differentiating into photoreceptors. This is dependent on EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling that triggers ERK-mediated degradation of the transcription factor Yan. In nonstimulated cells, Yan represses miR-7 transcription, whereas miR-7 RNA represses Yan protein expression in photoreceptors, by binding to sequences within its mRNA 3'UTR. We propose that reciprocal negative feedback between Yan and miR-7 ensures mutually exclusive expression, with Yan in progenitor cells and miR-7 in photoreceptor cells. Expression is switched when EGFR signaling transiently triggers Yan degradation. This two-tiered mechanism explains how signal transduction activity can robustly generate a stable change in gene-expression patterns."

The structure of a C-terminal domain of AvrPtoB that is essential for anti-PCD activity reveals an unexpected homology to the U-box and RING-finger components of eukaryotic E3 ubiquitin ligases, and we show that AvrPtoB has ubiquitin ligase activity. Mutation of conserved residues involved in the binding of E2 ubiquitin–conjugating enzymes abolishes this activity in vitro, as well as anti-PCD activity in tomato leaves, which dramatically decreases virulence. These results show that Pseudomonas syringae uses a mimic of host E3 ubiquitin ligases to inactivate plant defenses."

We found that during an acute decrease in external amino acid supply, before up-regulation of the autophagosomal-lysosomal pathway, efficient translation was ensured by proteasomal protein degradation. Amino acids for the synthesis of new proteins were supplied by the degradation of preexisting proteins, whereas nascent and newly formed polypeptides remained largely protected from proteolysis. Proteasome inhibition during nutrient deprivation caused rapid amino acid depletion and marked impairment of translation. Thus, the proteasome plays a crucial role in cell survival after acute disruption of amino acid supply."
https://openalex.org/W2067073663,"Instead of the immunoglobulin-type antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, jawless fish have variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs), which consist of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules. Somatic diversification of the VLR gene is shown here to occur through a multistep assembly of LRR modules randomly selected from a large bank of flanking cassettes. The predicted concave surface of the VLR is lined with hypervariable positively selected residues, and computational analysis suggests a repertoire of about 10 14 unique receptors. Lamprey immunized with anthrax spores responded with the production of soluble antigen-specific VLRs. These findings reveal that two strikingly different modes of antigen recognition through rearranged lymphocyte receptors have evolved in the jawless and jawed vertebrates."

Hence, many of the discrepancies between previous microarray studies of the E. coli FNR regulon were resolved.

In both groups of experiments, glucose was used as the carbon source for growth, and in both studies rigorous statistical methods and cluster analysis were used to analyze the data. In the former study, expression levels of 1,445 genes changed in response to the availability of oxygen. Although the corresponding figure in the study of Kang et al. (2Kang Y. Weber K.D. Qiu Y. Kiley P.J. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1135-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) was 962, only 334 genes were common to both data sets, and of those, 123 appeared to be regulated in opposite directions. Thus only 211 genes showed similar responses, 10% of the 2073 genes for which changes were observed. Both of the previous studies were valuable in revealing the far greater extent of changes in response to FNR and oxygen than had been revealed by previous operon-by-operon approaches or from proteomic studies (3Gunsalus R.P.

They also revealed previously unsuspected possible links between different global regulons, in addition to the already established dependence of the ArcB-ArcA regulon on FNR (5Compan I. Touati D. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, neither study was designed to define the number of operons that are regulated directly rather than indirectly by FNR, nor were different anaerobic growth conditions used to identify operons that are either repressed during growth with glucose (6Browning D.F. Grainger D.C. Beatty C.M. Wolfe A.J. Cole J.A. Busby S.J.W. Mol.

Consequently, changes in expression levels of operons known from a range of genetic, biochemical, and in vitro data to be dependent upon FNR activation were not detected in the previous studies, and the nirB promoter in which there is a consensus binding site for FNR activation even appeared to be repressed by FNR (1Salmon K.

We now report results from a more extensive study designed to reveal the extent of the FNR regulon in E. coli strain MG1655. Particular attention has been paid to defining growth conditions in which most (but clearly not all) FNR-dependent promoters are active. A specific challenge was to find growth conditions in which the anaerobic growth rates of the fnr mutant are comparable with those of the parental strain, but glucose repression was avoided. The effects of nitrate and nitrite on the E. coli transcriptome during anaerobic growth have also been investigated, resulting in a new list of operons that are apparently regulated by both FNR and NarL. Proposals based solely upon microarray and bioinformatic information were then confirmed by independent experiments, including analysis of the transcriptomes of narXL and narXL-narP deletion strains during anaerobic growth in the presence of nitrate. Strains and Mutant Construction—E. coli K12 strain MG1655 (CGSC7740), for which the chromosomal DNA sequence is known, was used throughout this study (11Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar). A Δfnr derivative was constructed by the gene-replacement method using primers K12 FNR1 and K12 FNR2 to amplify the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene cassette from plasmid pKD3 (12Datsenko K. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). The nucleotides underlined for each primer (Table 1) represent sequences that are homologous to genomic K12 DNA flanking fnr, and were used for the pKD46 λ Red-mediated recombination of the chloramphenicol resistance gene cassette into the E. coli MG1655 chromosome (12Datsenko K. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar).

Primers FNR PRIMER A and FNR PRIMER B were used to screen chloramphenicol-resistant colonies for replacement of fnr by the chloramphenicol resistance cassette. PCR products were sequenced using a BigDye™ version 3 sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and analyzed on an ABI 3700 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).

Open table in a new tab The narXL deletion was constructed in strain JCB4021 (14Potter L. Millington P. Thomas G. Cole J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) by the same method using primers NarX-P1 and NarL-P2 and with plasmid pKD3 DNA as PCR template. The deletion was transferred by bacteriophage P1-mediated transduction into strain MG1655 with selection for chloramphenicol resistance. Purified transductants were checked by PCR with primers XL1 and XL2 and phenotypically for the correct retention of adjacent narK and narGHJI genes. The resulting strain was designated JCB1002. A further derivative in which the narP gene was inactivated was constructed by using bacteriophage P1 propagated in strain JCB3875 (8Wu H.C. Tyson K.L. Cole J.A. Busby S.J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to transduce strain JCB1002 to chloramphenicol resistance. To confirm that the narP allele had replaced the narP+ gene, purified transductants and strain JCB1002 were transformed with a napF::lacZ transcriptional fusion plasmid. Transformants were grown anaerobically in minimal medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose in the presence or absence of 20 mm nitrate, and the resulting β-galactosidase activity was assayed. The purified narXL narP mutant in which transcription from pnapF was no longer activated in the presence of nitrate was designated strain JCB1003. The deletion mutants were finally verified as containing unique chromosomal deletions using genomic DNA microarray hybridizations. Strain JCB1011, a gift from Dr. Hirofumi Aiba, is a derivative of E. coli MG1655 carrying a chromosomally encoded C-terminal 3xFLAG-tagged fnr gene. Growth Conditions—Stock cultures were stored as liquid cultures in 50% glycerol at –20 °C. A standardized procedure was used to prepare inocula for cultures used to grow the various strains in different media. Inocula were streaked onto a fresh nutrient agar (Oxoid) plate. After 16 h at 37 °C, a 0.5-cm streak of colonies showing confluent growth was transferred into a 250-ml conical flask containing 30 ml of minimal salts medium (15Pope N.R. Cole J.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 319-322PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glycerol, 40 mm sodium fumarate, 20 mm trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and 10% (v/v) Luria-Bertani broth (LB). The culture was aerated rapidly at 37 °C until the absorbance at 650 nm had increased to 0.25 (100 μg of bacterial dry mass per ml). For a few experiments, 70 ml of the same medium in a 500-ml conical flask was used. For anaerobic cultures, 20 ml of the aerobic inoculum was transferred to 80 ml of the same medium in a 100-ml conical flask, and the culture was incubated without agitation at 37 °C until the optical density had increased to 0.5–0.6 (corresponding to a biomass density of 0.20–0.24 g/liter). TMAO or fumarate was omitted in some control experiments, and 5 mm sodium nitrite or 20 mm potassium nitrate was added, as required. Both nitrite and nitrate were still present in the appropriate cultures when samples were harvested. Construction of E. coli Whole-genome Array—Highly specific 70-mer oligonucleotides from the Operon E. coli Array Ready Oligonucleotide Set™ version 1.0 were printed with Lucidea™ Universal Scorecard™ (Amersham Biosciences) controls, as described previously (16Zheng D. Constantinidou C. Hobman J.L. Minchin S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5874-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), onto Corning UltraGAPS™ slides (Corning Life Sciences, Netherlands) using Corning Pronto! spotting solution. Slides were desiccated under vacuum for 48 h and then UV light cross-linked with a dose of 600 mJ using a Stratalinker (Stratagene limited, UK). Slides were stored under desiccating conditions in the dark until use. RNA and DNA Isolation—Pool RNA was isolated from four independently grown cultures of E. coli K12 MG1655. Except for the control experiments for which the pool of RNA was prepared from aerobically grown bacteria, the pool of control RNA was isolated from independent cultures of bacteria grown anaerobically in the same medium in the absence of nitrate or nitrite but in the presence of TMAO. Test RNA was isolated from three independently grown cultures for each growth condition. Samples were mixed with 2 volumes of RNA Protect (Qiagen) to stabilize the total RNA. An RNeasy kit (Qiagen) was used to extract the total RNA according to manufacturer’s instructions. Contaminating DNA was removed by using on-column DNase I digestion (Qiagen). The quality and quantity of the RNA preparations were determined with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer by using the RNA 6000 nanoassay Labchip (Agilent, Stockport, UK). DNA was isolated from 15 ml of culture grown to OD 0.7–0.8 using Genomic Tip 500/G, genomic DNA buffer set, and proteinase K stock solution (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality and quantity of DNA were determined by gel electrophoresis (0.8% agarose gel) with the aid of Bioline Hyperladder I. Reverse Transcription and Labeling—Total RNA (20 μg) was reverse-transcribed to Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA using the CyScribe post-labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pool samples were labeled with Cy3 N-hydroxysuccinimide ester dye, and samples from the various other growth conditions and genetic backgrounds were labeled with Cy5 N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Amersham Biosciences). Lucidea Universal Scorecard spike mRNA reference controls (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the reverse transcriptase reactions for both samples. DNA (5 μg) isolated from each deletion mutant and the wild type strain was labeled with FluoroLink™ Cy5-dCTP and FluoroLink™ Cy3-dCTP, respectively, using random hexamer primers at final concentrations of 60 ng/μl (Invitrogen), 50 units of Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Biolab UK), dNTPs at 0.1 mm dA/G/TTP, 0.04 mm dCTP, and 1× EcoPol buffer in a 50-μl reaction. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for at least 90 min. Labeled genomic DNA was purified using QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was eluted in 2× 35-μl sterile high pressure liquid chromatography grade water. Hybridization—Prior to hybridization, the slides were treated with the background-reducing Pronto! Pre-Soak System (Corning Life Sciences). The slides were incubated for 20 min in prewarmed Universal Pre-Soak solution at 42 °C and washed twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 s at room temperature. Slides were immediately transferred into prewarmed prehybridization solution (5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 2–4 h at 42 °C. The microarray slides were finally washed at room temperature once in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 min and twice in 0.1× SSC for 30 s, briefly dipped in water and then ethanol, and dried by centrifugation for 5 min at 800 × g. For each experiment, equal quantities (80 pmol) of each Cy5- and Cy3-labeled cDNA were added to a final volume of 80 μl of hybridization solution containing 25% formamide, 10 mg of bovine serum albumin (fraction V) per ml, 5× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, 8 μg of poly(A), and 1× Denhardt’s solution. The cDNA probes were denatured at 95 °C for 3 min and hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C. After hybridization was complete, the slides were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 2 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 min at room temperature, and finally twice in 0.1× SSC for 2 min at room temperature. The microarray slides were dried by centrifugation for 5 min at 800 × g and were then scanned at 532 and 630 nm by using a Genepix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Analysis of Microarray Data—The microarray images were analyzed using GenePix software (Axon Instruments), and spots that either failed to print or to hybridize were flagged and rejected (at most 20 K12 genes in any experiment). The data were imported into GeneSpring, version 6.1 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). A Lowess curve (locally weighted linear regression curve) was fitted to the plot of log intensity versus log ratio, and 40% of the data were used to calculate the Lowess fit at each point. The curve was used to adjust the control value for each measurement. If the control channel signal was below a threshold value of 10, then 10 was used instead. Spots with an intensity value lower than the GeneSpring error model cut-off value were then filtered out, which in different experiments were in the range 40–70. A second filter was then applied that required a fold change less than 0.667 and greater than 1.334 across all conditions. The resulting list was used to extract genes that showed at least 2-fold differential expression levels between the test sample and the reference pool under the different growth conditions by using Student’s t test and applying the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate test with a p value cut off of 0.05. The resulting list was used with the same statistical analysis to extract genes that showed at least 2-fold differential expression levels between strains with different genetic backgrounds and/or between different growth conditions using Student’s t test and applying Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate test with a p value cut-off value of 0.05. Identification of FNR- and NarP Promoter-binding Sites—Potential FNR- and NarP-binding sites were located using the sequence motif search facility of Colibri (genolist.pasteur.fr/Colibri/genome.cgi) allowing two mismatches. For FNR, the consensus sequence TTGATNNNNATCAA was used. For NarP, the consensus sequence TACYNMTNNAKNRGTA was used. The search was limited to 500 bp upstream of open reading frames. For FNR-binding sites, a position-weight matrix-based search developed by Robison et al. (17Robison K. McGuire A.M. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) was also consulted (available on-line at arep.med.harvard.edu/ecoli_matrices/). Operon structures and transcription start sites were taken from either RegulonDB (www.cifn.unam.mx/Computational_Genomics/regulondb/) or ecocyc (www.ecocyc.com). Only potential FNR- and NarP-binding sites within 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site were considered. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—FNR-DNA interactions were studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (18Grainger D.C. Overton T.W. Reppas N. Wade J.T. Tamai E. Hobman J.L. Constantinidou C. Struhl K. Church G. Busby S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6938-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cultures of E. coli strain JCB1011 carrying a chromosomally encoded C-terminal 3xFLAG-tagged fnr gene were grown as described for RNA extraction. Cross-linking, chromatin preparation, and immunoprecipitations were described previously (18Grainger D.C. Overton T.W. Reppas N. Wade J.T. Tamai E. Hobman J.L. Constantinidou C. Struhl K. Church G. Busby S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6938-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), except that the tagged FNR was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) for 16 h at 4 °C. The concentration of potential FNR-bound promoter fragments was measured using real time quantitative PCR (QPCR) (19Aparicio O. Geisberg J.V. Sekinger E. Yang A. Moqtaderi Z. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York2005: 21.3.1-21.3.33Google Scholar). Primers for each promoter were designed using PrimerExpress (Applied Biosystems) and are listed in Table 1. The yabN promoter, to which FNR does not bind, was used as a negative control to normalize the data. Promoter fragments enriched by 2-fold or more in at least two independent ChIP experiments, relative to the yabN promoter fragment, were scored positive. Data Accession—Data from these experiments are accessible via Gene expression omnibus (GEO) accession number GSE3591. Strategy for Experimental Design and Avoidance of Some Common Artifacts—An fnr mutant is either unable to grow anaerobically in the presence of most terminal electron acceptors and a nonfermentable carbon source such as glycerol or lactate or grows far more slowly than the parental strain (20Lambden P.R. Guest J.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 97: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, any differences in the transcriptomes of an fnr mutant and its parental strain would be due to both direct effects of FNR and to differences in growth rate. Presumably this is why in previous studies glucose was used as the carbon source for growth (1Salmon K. Hung S.-P. Mekjian K. Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. Gunsalus R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29837-29855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 2Kang Y. Weber K.D. Qiu Y. Kiley P.J. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1135-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), despite the fact that glucose represses expression from some FNR-activated promoters (6Browning D.F. Grainger D.C. Beatty C.M. Wolfe A.J. Cole J.A. Busby S.J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Tyson K. Busby S. Cole J. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Replacement of glucose by a less repressing fermentable carbohydrate would decrease effects because of glucose repression but to an unknown extent. We therefore exploited the fact that fnr mutants can be grown anaerobically in the presence of the nonfermentable and nonrepressing carbon source, glycerol, in the presence of TMAO in addition to fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor. Furthermore, the presence of TMAO has a minimal effect on NarX-NarL or NarQ-NarP-dependent induction or repression. Under these conditions, the fnr mutant grew as well as the parental strain, but not if either TMAO or fumarate was omitted (Fig. 1), and indicated that use of the glycerol/TMAO/fumarate medium would enable us to reveal the response of the E. coli transcriptome to nitrate, nitrite, and the two-component regulator system NarX-NarL. In control experiments, RNA isolated from bacteria grown under rigorously anaerobic conditions in an anaerobic cabinet was compared with RNA from cultures grown in unshaken conical flasks, as used in this study. No differences in transcript levels were observed, justifying the simpler growth conditions used for this and many previous studies. A second key feature in the experimental design was the use in each large set of experiments of a common pool of reference RNA isolated from bacteria that had been grown anaerobically, and in which FNR-activated genes were expressed at a significant level. Preliminary experiments (data not shown) confirmed that there was excellent (>98%) agreement between hybridization data from single RNA preparations and the reference pool. It was therefore possible to make comparisons between all of the data from individual batches of experiments. A potential disadvantage of this approach was the risk that some promoters repressed by FNR would be expressed at such a low level that the microarray signals would be too low to yield reliable data and would be rejected by the statistical screens used. To check for this artifact, further experiments were completed in which the reference RNA was a pool of samples isolated from bacteria in the early exponential phase of aerobic growth. In further control experiments, RNA was isolated from the same anaerobic cultures at different stages of the growth cycle, and concentrations of RNA from genes that are known to be activated by FNR were monitored. Similar levels of these RNA species were detected in bacteria harvested at culture densities in the range 0.14–0.32 mg dry mass/ml, but levels were lower earlier in the growth cycle or as the growth rate declined when the culture approached the stationary phase. RNA samples from anaerobic cultures were always isolated at a culture density in the narrow range of 0.18–0.22 mg/ml. Overview of the Effects of Oxygen, Nitrate, and Nitrite on the Transcriptomes of MG1655 and an fnr Mutant—RNA was isolated from early exponential phase aerated cultures of MG1655 and an isogenic fnr mutant and from mid-exponential phase cultures of the same strains growing anaerobically in the presence or absence of nitrate or nitrite. RNA from three biologically independent experiments for each of the seven types of culture was compared with the reference pool of RNA from the parental strain that had been grown in the absence of nitrate or nitrite. Only greater than 2-fold differences in microarray signals and with a probability of a false positive identification of less than 5% were considered to be significant. Supplemental Table S1 lists raw data for 502 genes for which transcript levels were significantly affected by FNR during anaerobic growth in at least one growth condition. Transcripts that are less abundant (repressed) in the reference pool relative to the test sample include those that are induced directly or indirectly during aerobic growth, transcripts that are induced during anaerobic growth by nitrate or nitrite, or repressed by FNR. Conversely, transcripts that are more abundant in the reference pool than in the test sample include genes that, directly or indirectly, are activated by FNR or induced during anaerobic growth. For cultures supplemented with nitrate or nitrite, entries in supplemental Table S1 indicate the levels of induction or repression by nitrate or nitrite in the parental strain or in the fnr mutant relative to the pooled RNA from anaerobic cultures unsupplemented with nitrate or nitrite. Transcripts that were found to vary significantly betw"

The detailed mechanism of this process is currently unknown. We present here the crystal structures of the ribosome from Thermus thermophilus with RF1 and RF2 bound to their cognate stop codons, at resolutions of 5.9 Å and 6.7 Å, respectively. The structures reveal details of interactions of the factors with the ribosome and mRNA, including elements previously implicated in decoding and peptide release. They also shed light on conformational changes both in the factors and in the ribosome during termination. Differences seen in the interaction of RF1 and RF2 with the L11 region of the ribosome allow us to rationalize previous biochemical data.

Finally, this work demonstrates the feasibility of crystallizing ribosomes with bound factors at a defined state along the translational pathway. During the elongation phase of protein synthesis, triplet codons on mRNA are decoded on the ribosome by their cognate aminoacyl tRNAs, resulting in addition of amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues until a stop codon is presented in the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, signifying the end of the coding sequence for a particular gene. The triplets UAG, UGA, or UAA act as stop codons in almost all species. Stop codons are decoded not by a tRNA but by proteins known as class I release factors (RFs) (Capecchi, 1967Capecchi M.R. Polypeptide chain termination in vitro: isolation of a release factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1967; 58: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Caskey et al., 1968Caskey C.T.

Tompkins R. Caskey T. Nirenberg M. Release factors differing in specificity for terminator codons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1968; 61: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, the three stop codons are recognized by two proteins with overlapping specificities: RF1, which recognizes UAG and UAA, and RF2, which recognizes UGA and UAA (Scolnick et al., 1968Scolnick E. Tompkins R. Caskey T. Nirenberg M. Release factors differing in specificity for terminator codons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1968; 61: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Eukaryotes, archaea, and mitochondria possess a single class I RF, termed eRF1, aRF1, and mtRF1, respectively, which recognizes all three stop codons (Konecki et al., 1977Konecki D.S. Aune K.C. Tate W. Caskey C.T. Characterization of reticulocyte release factor.J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4514-4520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotic and archaeal release factors are more similar to each other in sequence and are relatively distinct from their bacterial counterparts (Frolova et al., 1999Frolova L.Y. Tsivkovskii R.Y. Sivolobova G.F. Oparina N.Y. Serpinsky O.I. Blinov V.M. Tatkov S.I. Kisselev L.L. Mutations in the highly conserved GGQ motif of class 1 polypeptide release factors abolish ability of human eRF1 to trigger peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis.RNA. 1999; 5: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Upon stop-codon recognition, class I RFs promote hydrolysis of the ester bond that links the nascent polypeptide chain with the tRNA in the P site, leading to release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome (Capecchi, 1967Capecchi M.R. Polypeptide chain termination in vitro: isolation of a release factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1967; 58: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Caskey et al., 1968Caskey C.T.

Tompkins R. Caskey T. Nirenberg M. Release factors differing in specificity for terminator codons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1968; 61: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the release of the bound class I RF from the ribosome is facilitated by RF3, a class II release factor, which is a GTPase like many of the other protein factors involved in translation. It has been proposed that the ribosome-class I RF complex promotes GDP-to-GTP exchange in RF3 only after polypeptide release (Zavialov et al., 2001Zavialov A.V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. A posttermination ribosomal complex is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for peptide release factor rf3.Cell. 2001; 107: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Nucleotide exchange is followed by release of RF1 or RF2 from the ribosome. Finally, GTP hydrolysis by RF3 results in its own release. Two key unresolved questions concerning RF function are (1) how are stop codons recognized specifically by a protein, and (2) how does this result in release of the polypeptide chain from P site tRNA? Discrimination between stop and sense codons by RFs is achieved without the proofreading used in tRNA selection (Freistroffer et al., 2000Freistroffer D.V. Kwiatkowski M. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. The accuracy of codon recognition by polypeptide release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments have shown that it is possible to switch the specificity of RF1 and RF2 by swapping a tripeptide motif within each factor, P(A/V)T in RF1 and SPF in RF2 (Ito et al., 2000Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. A tripeptide “anticodon” deciphers stop codons in messenger RNA.Nature. 2000; 403: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This led to the suggestion that a tripeptide “anticodon” may be involved in direct recognition of the stop codon. However, the situation may be somewhat more complicated for several reasons. First, bases that are both downstream (Poole et al., 1995Poole E.S. Brown C.M. Tate W.P. The identity of the base following the stop codon determines the efficiency of in vivo translational termination in Escherichia coli.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and upstream (Mottagui-Tabar, 1998Mottagui-Tabar S. Quantitative analysis of in vivo ribosomal events at UGA and UAG stop codons.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2789-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) of the stop codon seem to affect termination efficiency. Second, the ribosome itself may be involved in decoding of stop codons since mutations in both 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA result in readthrough of stop codons in vivo (reviewed in Arkov and Murgola, 1999Arkov A.L. Murgola E.J. Ribosomal RNAs in translation termination: facts and hypotheses.Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1999; 64: 1354-1359PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, mutations elsewhere in RF2 within the domain containing the tripeptide motif, in which lysine residues are exchanged for glutamic-acid residues, can trigger polypeptide release at noncognate stop codons as well as sense codons (Ito et al., 1998Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. Single amino acid substitution in prokaryote polypeptide release factor 2 permits it to terminate translation at all three stop codons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 8165-8169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Uno et al., 2002Uno M. Ito K. Nakamura Y.

USA. 2002; 99: 1819-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The only sequence motif universally conserved in all known class I RFs is the GGQ motif (Frolova et al., 1999Frolova L.Y. Tsivkovskii R.Y. Sivolobova G.F. Oparina N.Y. Serpinsky O.I. Blinov V.M. Tatkov S.I. Kisselev L.L. Mutations in the highly conserved GGQ motif of class 1 polypeptide release factors abolish ability of human eRF1 to trigger peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis.RNA. 1999; 5: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). It is likely to be involved in the hydrolytic activity of RFs by a yet unknown mechanism since its mutation greatly reduces the ability of RFs to stimulate peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis but does not affect ribosome binding in either eukaryotes (Frolova et al., 1999Frolova L.Y.

The glutamine residue of the conserved GGQ motif of E. coli RF1 and RF2 and yeast eRF1 is methylated at the N5 position (Dincbas-Renqvist et al., 2000Dincbas-Renqvist V. Engstrom A. Mora L. Heurgue-Hamard V. Buckingham R. Ehrenberg M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 2439-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The absence of this methylation decreases the in vitro release activity of E. coli RF2 by several-fold. Mutational studies suggest a role for ribosomal RNA in peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis. In one study, it was concluded that, of four conserved residues at the core of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the 50S subunit, A2451, U2585, and C2063 do not significantly affect the reaction, whereas mutations of A2602 dramatically impede peptide release but have little effect on peptide-bond formation (Polacek et al., 2003Polacek N. Gomez M.J. Ito K. Xiong L. Nakamura Y. Mankin A. The critical role of the universally conserved A2602 of 23S ribosomal RNA in the release of the nascent peptide during translation termination.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, more recent kinetic analysis on affinity-purified mutant ribosomes showed that mutations of these same residues all affect peptide release to varying degrees but have little effect on peptide-bond formation (Youngman et al., 2004Youngman E.M. Brunelle J.L. Kochaniak A.B. Green R. The active site of the ribosome is composed of two layers of conserved nucleotides with distinct roles in peptide bond formation and peptide release.Cell. 2004; 117: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition to their codon specificities, another major difference between RF1 and RF2 appears to be in their interactions with the L11 region of the ribosome. It has been shown that, with ribosomes lacking L11, RF1 has significantly lower efficiency, but RF2 function is only somewhat inhibited (Tate et al., 1983Tate W. Schulze H. Nierhaus K.

A later study showed that it was the N-terminal domain of L11 that was responsible for the observed effect on termination (Van Dyke and Murgola, 2003Van Dyke N. Murgola E.J. Site of functional interaction of release factor 1 with the ribosome.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutations in the corresponding L11 binding region of 23S RNA affected RF2 but not RF1 function (Arkov et al., 1998Arkov A.L. Freistroffer D.V. Ehrenberg M. Murgola E.J. Mutations in RNAs of both ribosomal subunits cause defects in translation termination.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of isolated RF1 and RF2 are similar (Vestergaard et al., 2001Vestergaard B. Van L.B. Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Buckingham R.H. Kjeldgaard M.

Biol. 2004; 341: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), as might be expected given the homology between the two factors, and are unlike the previously solved structure of eRF1 (Song et al., 2000Song H. Mugnier P. Das A.K. Webb H.M. Evans D.R. Tuite M.F. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. The crystal structure of human eukaryotic release factor eRF1—mechanism of stop codon recognition and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis.Cell. 2000; 100: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, in the case of RF1 and RF2, the distance between the tripeptide motif that confers stop-codon specificity and the GGQ motif that is involved in peptide release is incompatible with the distance between the decoding center in the 30S subunit and the PTC in the 50S subunit. A model for RF2 binding to the ribosome was proposed based on its similarity with the shape of tRNA (Vestergaard et al., 2001Vestergaard B. Van L.B. Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Buckingham R.H. Kjeldgaard M. Bacterial polypeptide release factor RF2 is structurally distinct from eukaryotic eRF1.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1375-1382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), but this model was incompatible with a direct interaction between the tripeptide motif and the stop codon proposed earlier (Ito et al., 2000Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. A tripeptide “anticodon” deciphers stop codons in messenger RNA.Nature. 2000; 403: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This discrepancy was resolved by two independent cryo-EM reconstructions of RF2 bound to a stop codon on the ribosome (Klaholz et al., 2003Klaholz B.P. Pape T. Zavialov A.V. Myasnikov A.G. Orlova E.V. Vestergaard B. Ehrenberg M. van Heel M. Structure of the Escherichia coli ribosomal termination complex with release factor 2.Nature. 2003; 421: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, Rawat et al., 2003Rawat U.B. Zavialov A.V. Sengupta J. Valle M. Grassucci R.A. Linde J. Vestergaard B. Ehrenberg M. Frank J. A cryo-electron microscopic study of ribosome-bound termination factor RF2.Nature. 2003; 421: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In these structures, RF2 does not act as a strict structural mimic of tRNA. Rather, there appears to be a dramatic change in the relative orientation of the various domains in RF2 compared to the isolated crystal structure: When bound to the ribosome, the domain that contains the GGQ motif extends toward the PTC, whereas it is packed against the core of RF2 in the isolated crystal structure. This allowed a model in which the domain containing the tripeptide motif could be placed in the decoding center of the 30S subunit. While the results from cryo-EM represented a major advance, it is clear that understanding the mode of action of RFs will require more detailed structures. For example, there are differences in the detailed conformation of RF2 between the two independent cryo-EM structures even though the two structures were determined from similar samples obtained from the same laboratory. Similar differences in the structure and interactions of EF-Tu and tRNA with the ribosome also arose in previous independent cryo-EM structures (Stark et al., 2002Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Wieden H.J. Zemlin F. Wintermeyer W. Van Heel M. Ribosome interactions of aminoacyl-tRNA and elongation factor Tu in the codon-recognition complex.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 849-854PubMed Google Scholar, Valle et al., 2002Valle M. Sengupta J. Swami N.K. Grassucci R.A. Burkhardt N. Nierhaus K.H. Agrawal R.K. Frank J. Cryo-EM reveals an active role for aminoacyl-tRNA in the accommodation process.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3557-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These differences make it difficult to make detailed statements about interactions of various elements of RFs with the ribosome or conformational changes that cannot be resolved in medium-resolution cryo-EM maps. There are fewer problems in interpretation when a threshold of about 7 Å resolution is reached. Beyond this resolution, protein α helices are apparent as tubes of electron density and β sheets as surfaces, while the RNA backbone is well resolved. This allows accurate placement of protein domains without reference to external constraints such as biochemical or genetic data. Such a resolution is now being approached in cryo-EM studies but is still far from routine. On the other hand, crystallization of programmed ribosomes with bound translational factors at specific points on the translational pathway has proven challenging, probably due to the difficulty of preparing a homogeneous and stable population of ribosomes in a defined state. Here we report crystal structures of programmed ribosomes with P site tRNA; a cognate stop codon in the A site; and RF1 or RF2, at 5.9 Å and 6.7 Å resolution, respectively. We also report a structure at 6.4 Å of the corresponding complex without release factor. At this resolution, the secondary structure of all four RF domains can be clearly seen for both RF1 and RF2, allowing their unambiguous placement in electron density maps. The structures reveal details about the environment of the RFs in the decoding center and the PTC, changes in the L11 region in response to RF binding, and differences between RF1 and RF2 in this region. The results provide a more detailed understanding of the interactions of class I release factors with the ribosome. Release complexes were formed with 70S ribosomes, leaderless mRNA, tRNAPhe bound to a cognate codon in the P site, and an A site that was either empty (RC0) or contained specifically bound RF1 (RC1) or RF2 (RC2). Separation of functional complexes from the overall ribosome population was accomplished by affinity purification using a His tag on RF1 or RF2. Indeed, such affinity purification showed that stable binding of the RF to the A site depended on the presence of both mRNA and P site tRNA (Figure 1). These studies also showed that there is virtually no binding of RF1 with UGA or RF2 with UAG, indicating that the purified complexes of the ribosome contain a release factor bound specifically to a cognate stop codon. Since the P site tRNA used here is deacylated, the complexes represent the state after release of the peptide chain by RF. Despite significant effort, we were unable to reproduce the crystallization conditions for complexes of T. thermophilus 70S ribosomes with mRNA and tRNA reported previously (Cate et al., 1999Cate J.H. Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Earnest T.N. Noller H.F. X-ray crystal structures of 70S ribosome functional complexes.Science. 1999; 285: 2095-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), even when identical ligands were used. An extensive search for new crystallization conditions resulted in crystals in the space group P43212 that diffracted to resolutions of up to 5.5 Å. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined (Table 1) as described in Experimental Procedures. Difference Fourier maps showed clear and continuous density for both P site tRNA and RF1 or RF2, when present (Figures 2A–2C). Homology models for T. thermophilus RF1 and RF2 were generated from the isolated crystal structures from T. maritima (Shin et al., 2004Shin D.H. Brandsen J. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim R. Kim S.H. Structural analyses of peptide release factor 1 from Thermotoga maritima reveal domain flexibility required for its interaction with the ribosome.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and E. coli (Vestergaard et al., 2001Vestergaard B. Van L.B. Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Buckingham R.H. Kjeldgaard M.

These homology models allowed an unambiguous fit of the factors without reference to prior biochemical or genetic data. As in previous crystal structures of the 70S ribosome (Yusupov et al., 2001Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H.D. Noller H.F.

In agreement with the previous cryo-EM results on RF2 bound to the ribosome (Klaholz et al., 2003Klaholz B.P. Pape T. Zavialov A.V. Myasnikov A.G. Orlova E.V. Vestergaard B. Ehrenberg M. van Heel M.

A cryo-electron microscopic study of ribosome-bound termination factor RF2.Nature. 2003; 421: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), both RF1 and RF2 exhibit an extended conformation compared to the isolated crystal structures: Domain 3 of each factor has peeled away from away from the core of RF consisting of domains 2 and 4 and extends into the PTC, whereas domain 2 makes contact with the decoding center (Figures 3B–3D). However, the two RF2 cryo-EM models differ significantly both from one another and from the crystal structure in the placement of structural elements, including the GGQ and tripeptide motifs (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), showing both the strengths and limitations of models based on medium-resolution cryo-EM maps. Moreover, at the resolution of the crystal structures, several detailed interactions of RF with the ribosome now become apparent. In addition to the changes in the orientation of the domains, we also see induced conformational changes within and between domains in RF upon binding to the ribosome, as well as changes in the conformation of L11 in the ribosome. Globally, the structures of RF1 and RF2 are similar. Domains 2 and 4 remain as a compact superdomain, as in the isolated crystal structures. The dimensions and location of the superdomain 2/4, which interacts with the decoding site, and domain 3 in the PTC taken together match that of A site tRNA (Figures 3D and 3E). Domain 1 of the RFs is more accessible and extends from the L11 region to the 30S beak. Its conformation, along with that of the C-terminal helix of domain 4, varies more between RF1 and RF2 (Figure S1D). Most of the conformational changes in the RFs that are observed upon binding to the ribosome are in domain 3, which contains the GGQ motif. This domain flips out from the core of the protein in order to reach the PTC. Its long helix (α7) appears extended by several residues (RF1, 283–287; RF2, 297–303) compared to the isolated crystal structures. In contrast, the adjacent linker that connects domain 2 to domain 3 appears to be an extended polypeptide chain that is clearly defined in the electron density map. Interestingly, the loop between strands β6 and β7 containing the GGQ motif (residues 223–236 in RF1; 233–246 in RF2), which is highly mobile and not resolved in the isolated crystal structures, becomes ordered when it interacts with the PTC and is visible as a continuous loop of electron density in both structures (Figures 2B and 2C). We also observe a rotation of domain 1 away from the 2/4 superdomain, which anchors it to the L11 region. In the isolated crystal structure, helix α3 of RF2 (residues 43–81) appears bent, unlike the corresponding helix in RF1, which is straight. This helix appears straight in both factors in complex with the ribosome. To date, the question of how class I RFs recognize stop codons has remained elusive. In the structures presented here, the RF region closest to the stop codon is the loop between strands β4 and β5 containing the putative tripeptide anticodon (PVT, 184–186 for RF1; SPF, 191–193 for RF2) (Ito et al., 2000Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. A tripeptide “anticodon” deciphers stop codons in messenger RNA.Nature. 2000; 403: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the electron density for this loop region suggests that RF surrounds the anticodon, especially in the second and third position (Figure 4). All the residues in this loop are in close proximity to the A site codon. It was not possible to resolve the loop from the stop codon itself, presumably due to their close association. If one assumes that the loop is in approximately the same conformation as in the isolated crystal structures, then residues 184–187 and 191–193 (RF1 numbering) surround the stop codon, whereas residues 188–190 constitute the tip of the loop. This means that the loop would have to change conformation upon binding to the ribosome for the tripeptide motif to be in direct contact with the stop codon. The electron density extends from the tip of this loop to the base just 3′ of the stop codon (+1 in Figure 2, and 3′ U in Figure 4), which is in accordance with the biochemical finding that this downstream base contributes to the decoding efficiency of the stop signal. Interestingly, the uridine in the first position of the stop codon is flanked by the tip of helix α5 of the RFs (Figure 4). Thr115 and the highly conserved residues Glu118 and Glu119 (RF1 numbering) are in close proximity to this base, while Gly116 and Gly117 allow the sharp bend at the end of the helix. Whereas the tripeptide loop faces the stop-codon bases, the blunt tip of helix α5 is parallel to the plane of the first base. Together, both of these elements in RF may act as molecular tweezers. The tip of helix α5 (common to RF1 and RF2) could discriminate against A, G, and C at position 1, and the anticodon loop (specific to RF1 or RF2) could recognize the second and third bases as AG or GA, respectively. The loop must also allow the recognition of AA for both factors. Thus, stop-codon recognition appears to involve elements other than just the tripeptide. Indeed, when a region containing the loop with the tripeptide (residues 163–216 for RF1; 171–226 for RF2) was swapped between RF1 and RF2, both factors were inactive. The tripeptide-swap experiment could only be done in the context of hybrid RFs that contained combinations of residues from RF1 and RF2 in other parts of the molecule (Ito et al., 2000Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. A tripeptide “anticodon” deciphers stop codons in messenger RNA.Nature. 2000; 403: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, although changing the tripeptide sequence switches stop-codon specificity between RF1 and RF2, it may be that other elements are required to maintain discrimination against the various sense codons. A second fundamental problem is how the binding of class I RFs results in peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, a reaction that needs to be inhibited during elongation but facilitated during termination. Out of the four class I RF crystal structures solved so far, the GGQ loop is disordered in all except the structure of E. coli RF2, where it is constrained by crystal contacts (Vestergaard et al., 2001Vestergaard B. Van L.B. Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Buckingham R.H. Kjeldgaard M. Bacterial polypeptide release factor RF2 is structurally distinct from eukaryotic eRF1.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1375-1382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, this loop is ordered in our structures of both RF1 and RF2 (Figures 2B and 2C). The tip of this loop reaches into the PTC, where it faces A76 of P site tRNA and is surrounded by nucleotides C2063, A2451, U2506, and A2602 of 23S RNA (Figure 5). Of these, the closest are A2451 and A2602, the latter being the nucleotide most essential for hydrolysis based on mutational data (Youngman et al., 2004Youngman E.M. Brunelle J.L. Kochaniak A.B. Green R. The active site of the ribosome is composed of two layers of conserved nucleotides with distinct roles in peptide bond formation and peptide release.Cell. 2004; 117: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Notably, the tip of the loop is constituted by not only the GGQ motif but several residues flanking the motif. However, mutational studies have so far focused mainly on the GGQ motif. It is not yet clear whether class I RFs function by directly coordinating a water molecule, as has been proposed (Song et al., 2000Song H. Mugnier P. Das A.K. Webb H.M. Evans D.R. Tuite M.F. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. The crystal structure of human eukaryotic release factor eRF1—mechanism of stop codon recognition and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis.Cell. 2000; 100: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), or by inducing conformational changes in the PTC. As might be expected given the 50% sequence similarity and the fact that they both perform stop-codon-dependent peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, RF1 and RF2 bind to the ribosome in a similar manner. Domains 2, 3, and all but the C-terminal helix of domain 4 assume nearly identical structures in the ribosome (Cα rmsd of 2.8 Å between equivalent residues, which is comparable to the typical coordinate error at this resolution; also see Figure S1D). However, domain 1 does assume significantly different conformations in RF1 and RF2. Domain 1 is not directly involved in the release function and has been shown to interact with RF3 (Mora et al., 2003Mora L. Zavialov A. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. Stop codon recognition and interactions with peptide release factor RF3 of truncated and chimeric RF1 and RF2 from Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As discussed below, its interactions with the C-terminal helix are different for RF1 and RF2. This domain shows the largest sequence variation between members of the class I RF family, and, not surprisingly, we find it in significantly different orientations for RF1 and RF2 (Cα rmsd of 8.2 Å; also see Figure 6 and Figure S1D). In RF2, the loop leading into helix α3 and the start of this helix (residues 40–50) are close to nucleotides 1067–1068 of helix 43 and 1095–1096 of helix 44 of the L11 binding region of 23S RNA (Figure 6A). The corresponding part of RF1 (residues 25–33) is shifted away from the L11 binding region by approximately 5 Å, suggesting that it does not directly contact this region. This finding rationalizes biochemical data suggesting that RF2 interacts with bases 1067 and 1093–1095 (Xu et al., 2002Xu W. Pagel F.T. Murgola E.J. Mutations in the GTPase center of Escherichia coli 23S rRNA indicate release factor 2-interactive sites.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1200-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It also provides a structural basis for the finding that the termination efficiency of RF2 but not RF1 is reduced when bases in the L11 binding region of RNA are mutated. The differences in the orientation of domain 1 in RF1 and RF2 may arise from differences in the contacts of this domain with the C-terminal helix of domain 4. In RF1, this helix interacts with helices α2 and α4. In the case of RF2, the C-terminal helix associates with α1, α3, and α4 to form a four-helical bundle (Figure S1D). Strikingly, the N-terminal domain of L11 (L11-NTD) is shifted away from the ribosome when either RF1 or RF2 is bound (Figure 6B). This brings the end of helix α2 of both factors close to residues 21–22 of the proline-rich helix of the L11-NTD (Figure 6C). However, it is not clear at this resolution why the L11-NTD should be necessary for RF1 function but somewhat inhibitory for RF2 (Van Dyke and Murgola, 2003Van Dyke N. Murgola E.J. Site of functional interaction of release factor 1 with the ribosome.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, more recent genetic studies on L11 show that mutations throughout L11 affect RF1 and RF2 function equally (H. Sato, K. Ito, and Y. Nakamura, personal communication), which would be consistent with our observation of a conformational change in L11 with both factors. The binding site of the thiazole antibiotic thiostrepton has been narrowed down to the region between the L11-NTD and the L11 binding region of 23S RNA (Thompson et al., 1979Thompson J. Cundliffe E. Stark M. Binding of thiostrepton to a complex of 23-S rRNA with ribosomal protein L11.Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Ryan et al., 1991Ryan P.C. Lu M. Draper D.E. Recognition of the highly conserved GTPase center of 23S ribosomal RNA by ribosomal protein L11 and the antibiotic thiostrepton.J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Whereas the C-terminal domain of L11 is closely associated with 23S RNA, the L11-NTD interacts more loosely and has therefore been proposed to function during factor binding as a molecular switch that interacts with translation factors; the binding of thiostrepton would lock the conformation of the L11-NTD, resulting in loss of binding or function of various factors (Wimberly et al., 1999Wimberly B.T. Guymon R. McCutcheon J.P. White S.W. Ramakrishnan V. A detailed view of a ribosomal active site: the structure of the L11- RNA complex.Cell. 1999; 97: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The movement of the L11-NTD seen in our structures on RF binding and the observation that thiostrepton inhibits class I RF binding (Brot et al., 1974Brot N. Tate W.P. Caskey C.T. Weissbach H. The requirement for ribosomal proteins L7 and L12 in peptide-chain termination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1974; 71: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) are consistent with such a role for the L11-NTD. Indeed, movement of the L11-NTD has also been implicated in cryo-EM studies of EF-G binding (Agrawal et al., 2001Agrawal R.K. Linde J. Sengupta J. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. Localization of L11 protein on the ribosome and elucidation of its involvement in EF-G-dependent translocation.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have shown that it is possible to obtain milligram amounts of homogenous and stable functional complexes of the ribosome at a defined point along the translation pathway and crystallize them. The techniques described here could in principle be used for other states of the ribosome. The structures of the release factors bound to the ribosome expand on prior cryo-EM results and also show details of induced changes within the RFs themselves, such as the ordering of the GGQ loop at the peptidyl transferase center, as well as details of interactions of RF with the PTC and the decoding center. The structures also suggest that the tip of helix α5 of RF may be important for stop-codon recognition. Finally, the structures show a movement of the N-terminal domain of L11 in response to RF binding and differences between RF1 and RF2 in their interaction with this region, which rationalize biochemical and genetic data."
https://openalex.org/W2009611668,"Cortical polarity regulates cell division, migration, and differentiation. Microtubules induce cortical polarity in yeast, but few examples are known in metazoans. We show that astral microtubules, kinesin Khc-73, and Discs large (Dlg) induce cortical polarization of Pins/Galphai in Drosophila neuroblasts; this cortical domain is functional for generating spindle asymmetry, daughter-cell-size asymmetry, and distinct sibling fates. Khc-73 localizes to astral microtubule plus ends, and Dlg/Khc-73 and Dlg/Pins coimmunoprecipitate, suggesting that microtubules induce Pins/Galphai cortical polarity through Dlg/Khc-73 interactions. The microtubule/Khc-73/Dlg pathway acts in parallel to the well-characterized Inscuteable/Par pathway, but each provides unique spatial and temporal information: The Inscuteable/Par pathway initiates at prophase to coordinate neuroblast cortical polarity with CNS tissue polarity, whereas the microtubule/Khc-73/Dlg pathway functions at metaphase to coordinate neuroblast cortical polarity with the mitotic spindle axis. These results identify a role for microtubules in polarizing the neuroblast cortex, a fundamental step for generating cell diversity through asymmetric cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2083518550,"Here we describe the synthesis of two imido analogs of the uranyl ion, UO 2+ 2 , in which the oxygens are replaced by divalent alkyl or aryl nitrogen groups: U(N t Bu) 2 I 2 (THF) 2 (1) and U(NPh) 2 I 2 (THF) 3 (2) (where t Bu is tert -butyl and THF is tetrahydrofuran). Both compounds have been fully characterized by standard analytical techniques, including x-ray crystallography, and the chemical bonding between the metal center and the nitrogen ligands was quantified by using hybrid density functional theory calculations. As expected for a uranyl analog, these complexes exhibit linear N-U-N linkages and very short U-N bonds. In addition, the theoretical calculations show strong involvement of the 5f and 6d electrons in the U-N bonding."
https://openalex.org/W1973876898,"Stem cells are highly conserved biological units of development and regeneration. Here we formally demonstrate that stem cell lineages are also legitimate units of natural selection. In a colonial ascidian, Botryllus schlosseri, vascular fusion between genetically distinct individuals results in cellular parasitism of somatic tissues, gametes, or both. We show that genetic hierarchies of somatic and gametic parasitism following fusion can be replicated by transplanting cells between colonies. We prospectively isolate a population of multipotent, self-renewing stem cells that retain their competitive phenotype upon transplantation. Their single-cell contribution to either somatic or germline fates, but not to both, is consistent with separate lineages of somatic and germline stem cells or pluripotent stem cells that differentiate according to the niche in which they land. Since fusion is restricted to individuals that share a fusion/histocompatibility allele, these data suggest that histocompatibility genes in Botryllus evolved to protect the body from parasitic stem cells usurping asexual or sexual inheritance."
https://openalex.org/W2071984045,"The human mitochondrial transcription termination factor mTERF plays a central role in the control of heavy-strand rDNA transcription by promoting initiation, besides termination, of this transcription. However, until now, the mechanism underlying this stimulation of transcription by mTERF was not understood. In the present work, addition of mTERF to a HeLa cell mitochondrial lysate-based reaction mixture containing an artificial rDNA template did indeed specifically stimulate rDNA transcription. This stimulation required that mTERF be simultaneously bound to the rDNA transcription termination and initiation sites in the same molecule, thus forming a loop. Most significantly, a double binding of mTERF to the rDNA molecule, with resulting loop formation, was also shown in vivo. These results strongly suggest that, to satisfy the need for high rate of rDNA transcription, human mitochondrial rRNA synthesis involves mTERF-mediated rDNA looping that promotes recycling of the transcription machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1982561453,"Transcriptional dysregulation has emerged as a potentially important pathogenic mechanism in Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder associated with polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin (htt) protein. Here, we report the development of a biochemically defined in vitro transcription assay that is responsive to mutant htt. We demonstrate that both gene-specific activator protein Sp1 and selective components of the core transcription apparatus, including TFIID and TFIIF, are direct targets inhibited by mutant htt in a polyglutamine-dependent manner. The RAP30 subunit of TFIIF specifically interacts with mutant htt both in vitro and in vivo to interfere with formation of the RAP30-RAP74 native complex. Importantly, overexpression of RAP30 in cultured primary striatal cells protects neurons from mutant htt-induced cellular toxicity and alleviates the transcriptional inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor gene by mutant htt. Our results suggest a mutant htt-directed repression mechanism involving multiple specific components of the basal transcription apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2020448392,"The unicellular conifer tracheid should have greater flow resistance per length (resistivity) than the multicellular angiosperm vessel, because its high-resistance end-walls are closer together. However, tracheids and vessels had comparable resistivities for the same diameter, despite tracheids being over 10 times shorter. End-wall pits of tracheids averaged 59 times lower flow resistance on an area basis than vessel pits, owing to the unique torus-margo structure of the conifer pit membrane. The evolution of this membrane was as hydraulically important as that of vessels. Without their specialized pits, conifers would have 38 times the flow resistance, making conifer-dominated ecosystems improbable in an angiosperm world."
https://openalex.org/W2142034214,"To better understand ligand-induced structural transitions in cytochrome P450 2B4, protein-ligand interactions were investigated using a bulky inhibitor. Bifonazole, a broad spectrum antifungal agent, inhibits monooxygenase activity and induces a type II binding spectrum in 2B4dH(H226Y), a modified enzyme previously crystallized in the presence of 4-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole (CPI). Isothermal titration calorimetry and tryptophan fluorescence quenching indicate no significant burial of protein apolar surface nor altered accessibility of Trp-121 upon bifonazole binding, in contrast to recent results with CPI. A 2.3 Å crystal structure of 2B4-bifonazole reveals a novel open conformation with ligand bound in the active site, which is significantly different from either the U-shaped cleft of ligand-free 2B4 or the small active site pocket of 2B4-CPI. The O-shaped active site cleft of 2B4-bifonazole is widely open in the middle but narrow at the top. A bifonazole molecule occupies the bottom of the active site cleft, where helix I is bent ∼15° to accommodate the bulky ligand. The structure also defines unanticipated interactions between helix C residues and bifonazole, suggesting an important role of helix C in azole recognition by mammalian P450s. Comparison of the ligand-free 2B4 structure, the 2B4-CPI structure, and the 2B4-bifonazole structure identifies structurally plastic regions that undergo correlated conformational changes in response to ligand binding. The most plastic regions are putative membrane-binding motifs involved in substrate access or substrate binding.

Drug Metab. Rev. 2002; 34: 83-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Unlike most classical enzymes with their strict substrate selectivity, these microsomal P450s can each bind and metabolize a number of substrates that are different in size, shape, and stereochemistry. A challenging problem is to understand how microsomal P450s accommodate different substrates and oxidize each in a regiospecific and stereo-specific manner. At the tertiary structural level, P450s exhibit a similar overall fold with a well conserved heme-binding core (2Poulos T.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, recent results demonstrate that microsomal P450s exhibit striking conformational diversity and plasticity (3Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 4Scott E.E. He Y.A. Wester M.R. White M.A. Chin C.C. Halpert J.R. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D.

Not only do different P450s exhibit different conformations, but an individual P450 can adopt multiple conformations in response to various ligands, making it difficult to model protein-ligand interactions even when one atomic structure of a P450 is known. Therefore, a good sampling of P450 “conformational space” is a prerequisite for understanding P450-ligand interactions and for performing modeling studies with high predictive power. P450s from the 2B subfamily are inducible by barbiturates and have been the object of numerous biochemical and biophysical investigations for several decades. P450 2B4, in particular, was the first microsomal P450 to be purified and is one of the best characterized xenobiotic metabolizing P450s (6Coon M.J. Hoeven T.A. Kaschnitz R.M. Strobel H.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1973; 212: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recent structural investigations using an N-terminal modified form of P450 2B4 (2B4dH) have revealed that the enzyme can adopt strikingly different conformations (4Scott E.E. He Y.A. Wester M.R. White M.A. Chin C.C. Halpert J.R. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13196-13201Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 5Scott E.E. White M.A. He Y.A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 27294-27301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), making it one of the best sources for study of P450 conformational plasticity. In addition, a wealth of site-directed mutagenesis data on 2B4 and other 2B enzymes are available to correlate structural features with functional properties (7Domanski T.L. Halpert J.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). When P450 2B4dH was crystallized without ligand, a tight dimer was formed by two symmetrical molecules that each adopted a widely open conformation (4Scott E.E. He Y.A. Wester M.R. White M.A. Chin C.C. Halpert J.R. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13196-13201Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). A large cleft is formed by helices F through G on one side and the B′/C loop and helix C on the other side (Fig. 1A). The cleft is ∼15 Å wide and is filled by helices F′ and G′ of the symmetry-related molecule, whose His-226 forms an intermolecular coordinate bond to the heme iron of the other monomer. In order to investigate the structure of 2B4 with a ligand bound, the H226Y mutant was created to minimize dimer formation (5Scott E.E. White M.A. He Y.A. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Halpert J.R. J.

When 2B4dH(H226Y) was crystallized with the inhibitor 4-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole (CPI), a closed conformation was observed (Fig. 1B), which resembles those of P450s 2C5 (8Williams P.A. Cosme J.

Helices F through G move toward the B′ helix and cap the top of the active site. The ligand-free 2B4 structure and the 2B4-CPI structure have significantly advanced our knowledge of the structure and function of microsomal P450s. However, CPI (178.6 Da) is the smallest ligand that has been structurally characterized in a mammalian P450 active site, and the compound is highly constrained by the enzyme on all sides. Accordingly, it is impossible to accommodate any larger ligands in the 2B4-CPI active site without substantial reorganization. We reasoned that structures of 2B4 bound with bulkier ligands should reveal new insights into the conformational changes required to reconstruct the active site. Azole-containing compounds are well established drugs for the treatment of fungal infections in both humans and animals (16Bossche H.V. Koymans L. Moereels H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 79-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These drugs inhibit cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase (CYP51), an essential enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol in fungi (17Waterman M.R. Lepesheva G.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Many azole compounds also block host P450s, causing toxic side effects. Bifonazole (1-[phenyl-(4-phenylphenyl)-methyl]imidazole) (Fig. 1C) is one such azole drug used in the treatment of fungal skin infections. Initial spectral titration experiments indicated that bifonazole (310.4 Da) binds tightly to 2B4dH(H226Y), suggesting the possibility of an intermediate conformation between the open ligand-free structure and the closed 2B4-CPI structure. In this study, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (18Leavitt S. Freire E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and tryptophan fluorescence-quenching experiments were used to investigate the interactions of 2B4dH(H226Y) with bifonazole in solution. The results suggested a very different conformation from 2B4-CPI. Crystallographic studies of 2B4-bifonazole revealed a structure (Fig. 1C) that is significantly different from either ligand-free 2B4 or 2B4-CPI. The different conformations of 2B4-CPI and 2B4-bifonazole indicate that helix C and the N-terminal half of helix I are central to enzyme plasticity. Based on analysis of the three 2B4 structures, a model for the membrane-associated state of 2B4 is proposed. The model is consistent with other biochemical and structural information and suggests how mammalian P450s, including P450 3A4, evolved as membrane-associated proteins to gain the conformational plasticity required to act on diverse substrates and to provide access to lipophilic substrates that may reside in the bilayer. Protein Expression and Purification—Cytochrome P450 2B4dH(H226Y) was expressed and purified as described previously (5Scott E.E. White M.A. He Y.A. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27294-27301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli transformed with the vector pKK2B4dH(H226Y) was grown at 37 °C with shaking until the A600 reached 1.0. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to Terrific broth. After an induction period of 48-72 h, the cells were harvested and lysed. P450 2B4dH(H226Y) was extracted from membranes by adding the detergent Cymal-5 (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) in high salt buffer. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was first purified using metal-affinity chromatography. The fractions containing P450 2B4dH(H226Y) were pooled together and then further purified by ion-exchange chromatography. The final buffer contained 500 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. For crystallization, bifonazole (Sigma) was added to the purified protein in 10-fold excess, and the complex was concentrated by using an Ultra-15 centrifugal device (Millipore, Billerica, MA). For solution experiments, 2B4dH(H226Y) was dialyzed against 50 mm citrate-phosphate, pH 4.5, containing 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm Cymal-5, and a stock of bifonazole was prepared using the same buffer. Enzymatic Assays and Solution Studies—O-Deethylation of 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (7-EFC) was assayed as described previously (19Scott E.E. Spatzenegger M. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with 10 pmol of P450, 40 pmol of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, 20 pmol of cytochrome b5, and 200 μm 7-EFC in the presence of 0-10 μm bifonazole. The 7-EFC O-deethylation activities were plotted in relation to the bifonazole concentrations in SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA). Nonlinear regression analysis was performed to fit the data using a four-parameter logistic function to derive the inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) value. Bifonazole was titrated into ∼1 μm P450, and difference spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer at room temperature. The differences between the 433 nm maximum and 411 nm minimum were plotted against the bifonazole concentrations. Nonlinear regression analysis was performed in KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA), and the spectral dissociation constant (KS) was obtained by fitting the data to the equation for “tight binding”: 2ΔA =ΔAmax((KD + [I0] + [E0]) - ((KD + [I0] + [E0])2 - 4[E0][I0])1/2), where ΔA and ΔAmax are differential absorbances at particular and saturating inhibitor concentrations, respectively. ITC experiments were performed on a VP-ITC calorimeter interfaced with a computer for data acquisition and analysis. Protein concentration was 60 μm, and its monomeric state was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. P450 2B4dH(H226Y) and bifonazole (1 mm stock) were quickly preincubated to 25 °C and loaded into the calorimetric cell and titration syringe, respectively. A typical titration schedule included 30-35 injections of 5 μl of bifonazole spaced at 3-min intervals. The titration cell was continuously stirred at 305 rpm. Reference titrations were carried out by titrating bifonazole into buffer alone in the calorimetric cell with the identical injection schedule, and the heat of dilution was subtracted from the bifonazole-protein titration data. The resulting binding isotherms were fit to a one-set binding site model by Marquardt nonlinear least square analysis to obtain binding stoichiometry (N), association constant (Ka), and thermodynamic parameters of interaction using Origin 7.0 software (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). In acrylamide-quenching experiments, 5 μm 2B4dH(H226Y) was incubated with bifonazole at 25 °C for 1 h at a molar ratio of 1:2 prior to measuring the tryptophan fluorescence on a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin-Yvon, Edison, NJ). The tryptophan was excited at 295 nm and emission measured between 310 and 400 nm. Collision quenching was described by the Stern-Volmer equation as follows: F0/F = 1+ kq τ0 [Q] = 1 + KSV[Q], where F0 and F are fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of acrylamide; kq is the bimolecular quenching constant; τ0 is the lifetime of the fluorophore in the absence of quencher; [Q] is the concentration of acrylamide, and KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant. Structure Determination and Analysis—The protein sample was prepared as a 31 mg/ml stock in buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm bifonazole, 4.8 mm Cymal-5, and 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The 2B4-bifonazole complex was crystallized from vapor diffusion hanging drops in which 2 μl of protein sample was mixed with 2 μl of reservoir buffer containing 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.1 m KH2PO4, 1.9-2.2 m NaCl, and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.25. The drops were equilibrated against the reservoir buffer for 3-4 weeks at 18 °C. When the crystals were about 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.2 mm, the crystallization drop was transferred to another well and dehydrated by equilibrating for 2-3 days against 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.1 m KH2PO4, 3.5 m NaCl, and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, at 18 °C. Crystals were briefly soaked in the mother liquor supplemented with 15% glycerol and 15% ethylene glycol, followed by flash freezing in liquid N2. Initially, 360 frames (0.25°/frame) were collected on a single crystal held at 100 K to a resolution of 3.4 Å using a M06XHF rotating anode x-ray generator and a DIP2030H Imaging Plate detector (MacScience). The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). The resolution was extended to 2.3 Å on a dehydrated crystal at beam line 9-1 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Stanford, CA) using a Quantum-315 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.). One hundred eighty frames (0.5°/frame) collected at 100 K were processed using MOSFLM (21Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Translational search was performed for both P6122 and P6522 space groups. The top solution had a Z-score of 21.91 and was in space group P6122. The molecular replacement solution from PHASER was used for rigid body refinement in CNS (25Terwilliger T.C.

However, multiple regions including helices B′ through C and helices F through I did not fit the density. They were removed from the starting model and rebuilt manually into the map using the Xfit module of XtalView (27McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). Cycles of model building and minimization in CNS (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Bifonazole, Cymal-5, and water molecules were added into the model after most protein residues were well defined. The structural topology and parameters of bifonazole and Cymal-5 were generated using the PRODRG web server (29Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4189) Google Scholar). The final model contains protein residues 28-492, 3 molecules of bifonazole, 4 molecules of Cymal-5, and 131 water molecules. Refinement was carried out using CNS (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D.

Refinement and model statistics are shown in Table 1. Structure evaluation with PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicated that the final model has good stereochemistry with no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). The average B-factor of three bifonazole molecules is comparable with the average B-factor of protein residues. Two Cymal-5 molecules near the active site are well ordered. The maltose head groups of the other two Cymal-5 molecules extend out of the protein surface and are disordered, giving rise to the high average B-factor of Cymal-5. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The distances between Cα atoms and the heme iron were calculated for the ligand-free 2B4 structure (4Scott E.E. He Y.A. Wester M.R. White M.A. Chin C.C. Halpert J.R. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13196-13201Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), the 2B4-CPI structure (5Scott E.E. White M.A. He Y.A. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27294-27301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and the 2B4-bifonazole structure, respectively. For each residue, a standard deviation was calculated from its Fe-Cα distances in three 2B4 structures using the equation S.D. = (Σ(d - avg(d))2/(n - 1))1/2, where d is the Fe-Cα distance in each structure, avg(d) is their average, and n equals 3. Structurally plastic regions (PR) were identified when most residues (>90%) in a sequential segment had S.D. values greater than 1 Å (an arbitrary cutoff). Note that this one-dimensional calculation underestimates the conformational change when a residue moves without changing its Fe-Cα distance. Overall, the analysis identified the plastic regions efficiently, because conformational changes are clustered. This analysis does not require superposition of the structures; thus no bias is introduced because of the choices of superposition. Bifonazole Binds to 2B4dH(H226Y) and Inhibits Its Monooxygenase Activity—Binding of bifonazole to 2B4dH(H226Y) induced type II difference spectra with a peak at 433 nm and a trough at 411 nm (Fig. S1A), characteristic of nitrogen coordination to the heme iron. Titration of the enzyme with increased bifonazole concentrations defines a KS of 0.13 μm (Fig. S1B). Binding of bifonazole to 2B4dH(H226Y) inhibits its 7-EFC O-deethylation activity with an IC50 of 0.9 μm (Fig. S1C). With care to maintain 2B4dH(H226Y) in a monomeric state, ITC has been successfully employed in our laboratory to characterize the binding thermodynamics of imidazole inhibitors with the enzyme. 4Muralidhara, B. K., Negi, S., Chin, C. C., Braun, W., and Halpert, J. R. (January 26, 2006) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbcM09696200. In the case of bifonazole, the thermogram exhibits a monotonic decrease in the exothermic heat of binding with successive injections of bifonazole until saturation is reached (supplemental Fig. S1D). The resulting binding isotherm was fit to the single-class of binding-site model (supplemental Fig. S1E), yielding a binding site (N) of 0.95 ± 0.02 and an association constant (Ka) of (3.2 ± 0.1) × 105 M. The enthalpy change (ΔH) and entropy change (ΔS) obtained from the fit were -17.6 kcal mol-1 and -33.8 cal mol-1 K-1, respectively. The large negative value of ΔH indicates that bifonazole binding is enthalpically driven and largely hydrophobic. The large negative value of ΔS implies that the binding is entropically unfavorable, and no significant burial of protein apolar surface is induced upon bifonazole binding. In contrast, CPI binding is entropically favorable and induces burial of a large protein apolar surface. 4Muralidhara, B. K., Negi, S., Chin, C. C., Braun, W., and Halpert, J. R. (January 26, 2006) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbcM09696200. Acrylamide quenching of tryptophan fluorescence indicated that CPI binding to 2B4dH(H226Y) significantly decreases the solvent accessibility of the sole tryptophan (Trp-121), 4Muralidhara, B. K., Negi, S., Chin, C. C., Braun, W., and Halpert, J. R. (January 26, 2006) J. Biol.

In acrylamide-quenching experiments, the Stern-Volmer constants were 3.3 m-1 for ligand-free 2B4 and 3.4 m-1 for 2B4-bifonazole, respectively. These results show that, unlike CPI, bifonazole binding does not change the solvent accessibility of Trp-121 significantly. Thus, both the ITC and fluorescence studies suggested a conformation of 2B4-bifonazole distinct from that of 2B4-CPI. The Overall Structure of the 2B4-Bifonazole Complex—The structure of 2B4-bifonazole was determined from data collected on a single crystal diffracting to 2.3 Å. The complex crystallized in the P6122 space group with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The monomer exhibits the typical P450 fold (Fig. 2A). Two monomers related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis form a dimer with the regions between helices F and G of one molecule inserting into the active site of the other molecule and vice versa.

https://openalex.org/W2071834525,"Current models of autoimmunity suggest that delayed clearance of apoptotic cells leads to the presentation of apoptotic antigens in the context of inflammatory signals, with resultant autoimmunity. These models implicitly assume that, in contrast to early apoptotic cells (that retain membrane integrity), late apoptotic cells (with compromised membranes) act like necrotic cells (which also lack intact membranes), possibly because of the release of proinflammatory intracellular contents. We showed previously that early apoptotic and necrotic cells induce distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase modules in macrophages with which they interact. Exposure to apoptotic cells led to nearly complete inhibition of both basal and macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced ERK1/2 by macrophages. In contrast, necrotic cells induced ERK1/2. We show here that apoptotic cells also strongly induced both c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38, whereas necrotic cells had no detectable effect on c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38. We also compared the signaling events induced in macrophages by exposure to early apoptotic cells, late apoptotic cells, and necrotic cells. The signaling events induced by late apoptotic cells were identical to and just as potent as those induced by early apoptotic cells. Thus, apoptotic cells are functionally equivalent throughout the cell death process, irrespective of membrane integrity. Moreover, the effects of both early and late apoptotic cells on signaling were dominant over those of necrotic cells. These data show that apoptotic cells do not become proinflammatory upon the loss of membrane integrity and are inconsistent with the notion that delayed clearance alone can lead to autoimmunity.

These data show that apoptotic cells do not become proinflammatory upon the loss of membrane integrity and are inconsistent with the notion that delayed clearance alone can lead to autoimmunity. Apoptosis is an active energy-dependent process that generally occurs without inflammation or injury to surrounding tissues (1Majno G. Joris I. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 14: 3-15Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells express surface markers that permit their rapid recognition and ingestion by phagocytes (2Platt N. da Silva R.P. Gordon S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 365-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 3Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cell membrane of cells undergoing apoptosis remains intact until relatively late (1Majno G. Joris I. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 14: 3-15Google Scholar). Thus, the vast majority of cells dying by apoptosis are cleared by phagocytes while their cell membranes are still intact and before they can release their potentially inflammatory intracellular contents. In this view, the noninflammatory behavior of apoptotic cells is essentially passive in that inflammation is avoided by rapid and efficient clearance of apoptotic cells. In fact, apoptotic cells are also actively anti-inflammatory (4Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y. Henson P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar, 5Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For example, the uptake of apoptotic cells actively inhibits the release of proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor-α by macrophages (mφ) 2The abbreviations used are: mφ, macrophage(s); BM, bone marrow; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; LCM, L929 cell conditioned medium; PI, propidium iodide.

This contrasts with the effect of necrotic cell uptake, which may lead to mφ activation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines (7Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Guthrie L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6847-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Based on this differential response to apoptotic versus necrotic cells, antigens derived from cells dying by these two distinct processes are thought to have opposite effects on the activation of T cells (8Skoberne M. Beignon A.S. Larsson M. Bhardwaj N. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 289: 259-292PubMed Google Scholar). The proinflammatory effects of necrotic cells may act as a “danger signal” and provide the costimulation required for T cell activation and immunity. In contrast, early apoptotic cells, being anti-inflammatory, are unlikely to activate T cells and may even be tolerogenic (9Gaipl U.S. Voll R.E. Sheriff A. Franz S. Kalden J.R. Herrmann M. Autoimmun. Rev. 2005; 4: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The effect of late apoptotic cells (apoptotic cells that have lost membrane integrity), also referred to as post-apoptotic or secondarily necrotic cells, is more uncertain (10Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). According to many current models, late apoptotic cells should behave like necrotic cells, because of the release of potentially inflammatory intracellular contents (11Wu X. Molinaro C. Johnson N. Casiano C.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2642-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is a prevailing belief that delayed or reduced clearance of apoptotic cells leads to the presentation of apoptotic antigen in the context of inflammatory signals, with resultant autoimmunity (9Gaipl U.S. Voll R.E. Sheriff A. Franz S. Kalden J.R. Herrmann M. Autoimmun. Rev. 2005; 4: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Herrmann M. Voll R.E. Zoller O.M. Hagenhofer M. Ponner B.B. Kalden J.R.

Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This view is supported by studies in mice in which genetic deficiencies of any number of gene products (for example, C1q (14Mitchell D.A. Pickering M.C. Warren J. Fossati-Jimack L. Cortes-Hernandez J. Cook H.T. Botto M. Walport M.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2538-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the MER receptor tyrosine kinase (15Cohen P.L. Caricchio R. Abraham V. Camenisch T.D. Jennette J.C. Roubey R.A. Earp H.S. Matsushima G. Reap E.A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), or MFG-E8 (16Hanayama R. Tanaka M. Miyasaka K. Aozasa K. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Science. 2004; 304: 1147-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar)) give rise both to delayed clearance of apoptotic cells and to the development of systemic autoimmune disease. This apparent linkage may not reflect a causal relationship between altered clearance and autoimmunity. As we and others have shown, the recognition and/or uptake of apoptotic cells is accompanied by intracellular signal transduction (17Reddy S.M. Hsiao K.H. Abernethy V.E. Fan H. Longacre A. Lieberthal W. Rauch J. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Giles K.M. Ross K. Rossi A.G. Hotchin N.A. Haslett C. Dransfield I. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For example, although necrotic cells activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) elements extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and 2, apoptotic cells strongly inhibit ERK1/2 activity (17Reddy S.M. Hsiao K.H. Abernethy V.E. Fan H. Longacre A. Lieberthal W. Rauch J. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that it is the absence of appropriate apoptotic cell-induced signaling events, rather than delayed apoptotic cell clearance per se, that is responsible for the loss of tolerance and the development of autoimmunity in these mutant mice. A strong prediction of our hypothesis is that signaling events triggered by late apoptotic cells should resemble those of early apoptotic cells and not necrotic cells. In accord with previous work, we show here that early apoptotic and necrotic cells induce distinct MAPK modules. Consistent with our hypothesis, and in contradiction to the delayed clearance model of autoimmunity, we find that the signaling events induced in mφ by late apoptotic cells are identical to those induced by early apoptotic cells. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that both early and late apoptotic cells are dominant over necrotic cells with respect to MAPK signaling. Taken together, these data imply that delayed clearance of apoptotic cells, in and of itself, is unlikely to cause autoimmunity and suggest that the signaling events induced by apoptotic cells, whether early or late, may play a critical role in the maintenance of immune tolerance. Materials—Unless otherwise stated, all of the chemicals were obtained from Sigma, Invitrogen, or Fisher. Antibodies—Antibodies detecting Rsk were affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit IgG recognizing either the active Thr359–Ser363-phosphorylated form of Rsk (major reactivity to Rsk1 with cross-reactivity to Rsk3) or total Rsk irrespective of its state of phosphorylation (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). All of the antibodies detecting the active or total forms of ERK (ERK1 and ERK2), JNK (JNK1 and JNK2), and p38 (p38α, p38γ, and p38δ) were affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit IgG (Promega, Madison, WI). Anti-active ERK1/2 detects the dually phosphorylated Thr183-Glu-Tyr185 region (pTEpY) from the catalytic core of the active ERK kinase. Anti-active JNK1/2 detects the dually phosphorylated Thr183-Pro-Tyr185 region (pTPpY) derived from the catalytic core of the active form of the JNK kinase. Anti-active p38 detects the dually phosphorylated Thr180-Gly-Tyr182 region (pTGpY) derived from the catalytic core of the active form of the p38 kinase. Cell Culture—Primary cultures of bone marrow (BM)-derived mφ were prepared as previously described (19Levine J.S. Pugh B.J. Hartwell D. Fitzpatrick J.M. Marshak-Rothstein A. Beller D.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, BM cells were expressed from the femur and tibia of BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice. After centrifugation at 500 × g, red blood cells were lysed by resuspending the cell pellet in Tris/NH4Cl lysis buffer (9:1 mixture of 0.16 m NH4Cl, pH 7.2, and 0.17 m Tris base, pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 5 min. The cells were then washed three times in RPMI 1640 and plated in 100-mm tissue culture plates at 5 × 106 cells/dish in R.10 medium (RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS, with 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) containing 15% L929 cell conditioned medium (LCM) as a source of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). After 3 days of incubation, additional R.10 plus 15% LCM was added. After an additional 3 days, when BM mφ were ∼90% confluent, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh R.10 plus 15% LCM. After 24 h, to make the cells quiescent for use in signaling studies, the medium was replaced with R.0 (R.10 medium minus FBS) without LCM for 48 h. The Jurkat human T cell leukemia line (American Type Culture Collection, TIB-152, Manassas, VA) and the conditionally immortalized mouse kidney proximal tubule epithelial cell line (BUMPT (Boston University mouse proximal tubule cells)) (20Sinha D. Wang Z. Ruchalski K.L. Levine J.S. Krishnan S. Lieberthal W. Schwartz J.H. Borkan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F703-F713Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were used as a source of apoptotic and necrotic cells. Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin. BUMPT cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 10 units/ml γ-interferon. Preparation of Apoptotic, Necrotic, and Late Apoptotic Cells and Latex Beads—Apoptosis of Jurkat cells was induced by transferring cells to R.0 containing 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 1 μg/ml staurosporine. Apoptosis was produced by exposure to staurosporine for 3 h, followed by washing and resuspension in fresh medium plus 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Early apoptotic cells were used after incubation for an additional 2 h, and late apoptotic cells were used after overnight incubation for an additional 18 h. Apoptosis of BUMPT cells was similarly induced, except that staurosporine was added to FBS-free medium, and the cells were detached by the addition of 5 mm EDTA after exposure to staurosporine. Necrosis of both Jurkat and BUMPT cells was induced by washing cells three times in FBS-free medium and then heating cells suspended in the appropriate FBS-free medium to 65 °C for 40 min. Latex beads (1.15 μm) obtained from Seradyne (Indianapolis, IN) were used in control studies as a neutral phagocytic stimulus in place of apoptotic or necrotic cells. Induction of apoptosis and necrosis was confirmed by flow cytometry. Viable cells were defined as cells that were both propidium iodide (PI)- and annexin V-negative. Early apoptotic cells were defined as PI-negative cells with annexin V staining and decreased cell size. Necrotic cells were defined as PI-positive cells of normal or increased cell size. Late apoptotic cells were defined as PI-positive cells with annexin V staining and decreased cell size. The loss of membrane integrity in necrosis and late apoptosis was also confirmed by Trypan blue staining. By these criteria, early apoptotic cell preparations contained ∼85% early apoptotic and ∼15% late apoptotic cells. Necrotic cell preparations contained ∼95% necrotic cells. Late apoptotic cell preparations contained ∼95% late apoptotic cells. In all preparations, viable cells, defined as PI-negative cells of normal size without annexin V staining, comprised <5% of the total cell population. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were lysed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 μm orthovanadate. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at –70 °C. Samples standardized for protein content by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–20% acrylamide gels (Novex Tris-glycine gels; Invitrogen). Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with antibody according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Apoptotic and Necrotic Cells Have Divergent Effects on the ERK1/2 Pathway—For apoptotic and necrotic cells to have differential effects on immune function, the signaling events induced by exposure to these two types of dead cells must be distinct. In accord with this notion, we have previously shown that apoptotic and necrotic cells have opposite effects on ERK1/2 signaling (17Reddy S.M. Hsiao K.H. Abernethy V.E. Fan H. Longacre A. Lieberthal W. Rauch J. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the necrotic cells used in our studies, although lacking membrane integrity, are intact cells and have a normal nuclear morphology, as assessed by light microscopy and Hoechst staining (17Reddy S.M. Hsiao K.H. Abernethy V.E. Fan H. Longacre A. Lieberthal W. Rauch J. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although exposure to necrotic cells activated ERK1/2 in primary cultures of BM mφ, as indicated by phosphorylation at the catalytic core on Thr183 and Tyr185, exposure to apoptotic cells inhibited both basal and M-CSF-induced ERK1/2 activity (17Reddy S.M. Hsiao K.H. Abernethy V.E. Fan H. Longacre A. Lieberthal W. Rauch J. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To examine this differential behavior in greater detail, we determined the concentration dependence of the ERK1/2 response to apoptotic and necrotic cells (Fig. 1). Primary cultures of BM mφ were grown to confluence and rendered quiescent by culture for 48 h in FBS-free medium (R.0). Quiescent mφ showed minimal levels of basal active phosphorylated ERK1/2. Stimulation with M-CSF for 15 min induced nearly maximal levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2. In the absence of M-CSF, exposure to early apoptotic BUMPT cells induced no phosphorylated ERK1/2 and, in fact, in most experiments inhibited basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, exposure to necrotic BUMPT cells for 15 min activated ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner. Induction was first evident at a necrotic cell to mφ ratio of ∼1:32, reached half-maximal levels at a ratio of 1:4 to 1:2, and matched the M-CSF response at a ratio of 1:1. Latex beads, a neutral phagocytic stimulus, had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Apoptotic and necrotic cells alone contributed no activated ERK1/2 in these experiments (Ref. 17Reddy S.M. Hsiao K.H. Abernethy V.E. Fan H. Longacre A. Lieberthal W. Rauch J. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and data not shown). We next determined the effect that prior exposure to these stimuli for 30 min had on subsequent activation of ERK1/2 by M-CSF (Fig. 1B). Strikingly, prior exposure to early apoptotic cells strongly inhibited M-CSF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Inhibition by early apoptotic cells occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition was first evident at an apoptotic cell to mφ ratio of 1:32, reached half-maximal levels at a ratio of 1:16, and was virtually complete at a ratio of 1:4. In contrast, prior exposure to necrotic cells slightly increased the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 seen after 15 min of stimulation with M-CSF. Thus, the responses to early apoptotic and necrotic cells were not only opposite in direction but also different in concentration dependence. Early apoptotic cells were more potent stimuli, achieving a half-maximal effect at an ∼4-fold lower ratio of 1:16, as compared with a ratio of 1:4 for necrotic cells. Latex beads had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to M-CSF. To confirm these effects on ERK1/2 activation, we examined the state of phosphorylation of the ribosomal kinase Rsk, an immediate downstream target of ERK1/2. We specifically looked at the ERK1/2 phosphorylation site Ser573 on the activation loop of Rsk (21Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the pattern of phosphorylation for Rsk in response to early apoptotic cells, necrotic cells, and latex beads closely paralleled that for phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Early apoptotic cells strongly inhibited Rsk phosphorylation in response to M-CSF, whereas necrotic cells alone induced dose-dependent phosphorylation of Rsk. To ensure that the total protein (irrespective of phosphorylation) was equivalent on all blots and to ensure that decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p90Rsk following exposure to apoptotic cells cannot be attributed to dilution of intact macrophage proteins by phagocytosed proteins derived from apoptotic cells, we performed Ponceau S staining (not shown), and we probed lysates for total ERK1/2, total p90Rsk, total p38, and total JNK1/2 (supplemental figures). As shown in supplemental Figs. S1 and S2, the levels of total ERK1/2 and total p90Rsk were equivalent and not affected by exposure to apoptotic cells. This equivalence of total levels of ERK1/2 and p90Rsk, despite exposure to apoptotic cells, implies that phagocytosed material from apoptotic cells represents a minor fraction of macrophage cell lysates. Similarly, exposure to necrotic cells had no effect on the expression of total ERK1/2 and total p90Rsk. It should also be noted that dilutional effects are not a concern in the case of necrotic cells, because they activated ERK1/2 and p90Rsk. Moreover, as shown below, exposure to apoptotic cells not only inhibited ERK1/2 and p90Rsk but also induced the activation of JNK and p38 (Fig. 3). Because the same lysates were probed for all four kinases, it is unlikely that a dilutional artifact can explain such divergent signaling events. We observed identical results with early apoptotic and necrotic cells derived from human Jurkat cells (data not shown). Together with our previous results (17Reddy S.M. Hsiao K.H. Abernethy V.E. Fan H. Longacre A. Lieberthal W. Rauch J. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we note that these effects on ERK1/2 are characteristic of early apoptotic and necrotic cells, regardless of the species or tissue type of the dead cells. We have observed similar effects on ERK1/2 activation with all of the following: human Jurkat T cells, murine renal epithelial BUMPT cells, and primary murine splenocytes and thymocytes. The ability of apoptotic cells to inhibit ERK1/2 activation is also independent of the particular suicidal stimulus with which death is induced (e.g. staurosporine, high dose hydrocortisone, γ-irradiation, and ultraviolet irradiation) (Ref. 17Reddy S.M. Hsiao K.H. Abernethy V.E. Fan H. Longacre A. Lieberthal W. Rauch J. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and data not shown). Moreover, these effects of early apoptotic and necrotic cells on ERK1/2 are not limited to mφ but extend also to nonprofessional phagocytes, because early apoptotic cells inhibited epidermal growth factor-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in murine embryonic fibroblasts (and data not shown). 3M. Cvetanovic, J. E. Mitchell, V. Patel, B. S. Avner, Y. Su, P. T. van der Saag, P. L. Witte, S. Fiore, J. S. Levine, and D. S. Ucker, submitted for publication. We conclude that early apoptotic and necrotic cells, without restriction to species or stimulus, have characteristic and divergent effects on the phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2. Apoptotic and Necrotic Cells Also Have Differential Effects on Other MAPK Modules—We examined the effects of early apoptotic and necrotic cells on two additional MAPK modules, JNK1/2 and p38 (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S3). Quiescent BM mφ had undetectable levels of phosphorylated JNK1/2 and p38. M-CSF weakly induced phosphorylation of p38 and had no effect on JNK1/2. In contrast to their inhibitory effect on ERK1/2 activity, early apoptotic cells induced dose-dependent phosphorylation of both JNK1/2 and p38. The concentration dependences of the JNK1/2 and p38 responses to early apoptotic cells were similar to that of the ERK1/2 response. Although the JNK and p38 modules are activated in response to a wide variety of stresses and inflammatory stimuli (23Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar), exposure to necrotic cells had no detectable effect on these two pathways, either alone (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S3) or administered prior to M-CSF stimulation (data not shown). Latex beads, like necrotic cells, had no effect on the levels of phosphorylated JNK1/2 and p38 (data not shown). These data extend our observations of the divergent patterns of the effects of early apoptotic and necrotic cells on the three MAPK modules. The Effects of Apoptotic Cells Are Dominant over Those of Necrotic Cells—The fact that early apoptotic and necrotic cells have divergent effects on the ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 modules presents a definitive setting with which to determine the effect of mixtures of these two stimuli on mφ signaling events. Implicit in the delayed clearance model of autoimmunity is the assumption that the proinflammatory effects of necrotic cells, like those hypothesized for late apoptotic cells, should dominate over those of early apoptotic cells. We tested this in two complementary sets of experiments. In the first (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S4A), we incubated BM mφ with a fixed number of necrotic cells (inducing maximal phosphorylation of ERK1/2; first lane in Fig. 4A), together with a graded number of apoptotic cells, the ratio of apoptotic to necrotic cells ranging from 1:8 to 1:1. In the second (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S4B), we added a fixed number of apoptotic cells (inducing maximal inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation; first lane in Fig. 4B), together with a graded number of necrotic cells, the ratio of apoptotic to necrotic cells ranging from 8:1 to 1:1. Remarkably, in both sets of experiments, and with respect to each MAPK module examined, the effects of apoptotic cells were strongly dominant over those of necrotic cells. For example, when apoptotic cells were present at an optimal number for inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation, no number of necrotic cells was able to even minimally counter the apoptotic cell signal (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S4B). Similarly, despite an optimal number of necrotic cells for induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, 1 apoptotic cell/4 necrotic cells was able to overcome completely the necrotic cell effect (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S4A). This last result is especially noteworthy in that a suboptimal number of apoptotic cells (with respect to M-CSF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation) still was able to completely inhibit the response to an optimal number of necrotic cells. Despite the Loss of Membrane Integrity, Late Apoptotic Cells Behave Equivalently to Early Apoptotic Cells—In light of these observations, we asked whether late apoptotic cells, which have lost membrane integrity, still retain the characteristic behavior of early apoptotic cells. Late apoptotic cells were generated by overnight incubation at 37 °C following a 3-h exposure to staurosporine. These cells displayed the features of late apoptosis, including reduced cell size and failure to exclude Trypan blue or PI. Late apoptotic cells were not washed and were added directly to BM mφ in their overnight culture medium, so that BM mφ were exposed not only to the late apoptotic cells themselves but also to any intracellular contents that may have been released. Strikingly, late apoptotic cells induced the same characteristic MAPK response profile, as did early apoptotic cells (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S5A). Thus, late apoptotic cells inhibited M-CSF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and subsequent Rsk phosphorylation and also stimulated phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38. Importantly, the dose dependence of late apoptotic cells was similar to that of early apoptotic cells. We also tested the relationship of late apoptotic cells and necrotic cells when the two populations were cultured together with BM mφ (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S5B). We found that late apoptotic cells were as effective as early apoptotic cells in inhibiting phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Rsk in response to necrotic cells. Late apoptotic cells also induced phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38, irrespective of the presence or quantity of necrotic cells. We conclude that, at least with respect to modulation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38, late apoptotic cells behave identically to early apoptotic cells. Thus, regardless of membrane integrity, apoptotic cells have a characteristic effect on mφ signal transduction, at least in relation to MAPK signaling events, and this effect is strongly dominant over that of necrotic cells. Late Apoptotic Cells Do Not Release Proinflammatory Contents—The dominance of apoptotic cells with respect to ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 signaling may mask the potential release of proinflammatory intracellular contents from late apoptotic cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, we explored this possibility by separating a suspension of late apoptotic BUMPT cells (Fraction 1) into the following fractions: low speed centrifugation supernatant (apoptotic bodies, secreted molecules, and released intracellular material) (Fraction 2), low speed centrifugation pellet (dead cells and cell ghosts) (Fraction 3), high speed ultracentrifugation supernatant (soluble intracellular material) (Fraction 4), and high speed ultracentrifugation pellet (apoptotic bodies plus particulate intracellular material) (Fraction 5). Fractions 1, 2, and 3 were derived from late apoptotic cell suspensions corresponding to an apoptotic to mφ cell ratio of 1:1 (inducing maximal inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation; see Fig. 5A). To control for the fact that the later fractions may contain decreased cellular material, Fractions 4 and 5 were derived from late apoptotic cell suspensions corresponding to a 4-fold increased apoptotic to mφ cell ratio of 4:1. When added to mφ as a sole stimulus, none of the fractions from late apoptotic cells, including the high speed ultracentrifugation supernatant containing the soluble intracellular contents from late apoptotic cells, induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. S6B). When mφ were stimulated with M-CSF after prior exposure to these fractions for 30 min, inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurred with each of the fractions except the high speed ultracentrifugation supernatant, for which we observed an undiminished ERK response. We conclude that the characteristic inhibitory activity of apoptotic cells resides in the membrane fractions derived from those cells, including apoptotic bodies and cell ghosts. We could detect no separable proinflammatory activity in any of the fractions, including the soluble intracellular contents from late apoptotic cells. By comparison, all fractions derived from a parallel separation of necrotic cells induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6C and supplemental Fig. S6C). In contrast to apoptotic cells, the proinflammatory activity associated with necrotic cells is both soluble and membrane-associated. Our results demonstrate that apoptotic cells and necrotic cells trigger divergent signaling responses in BM mφ. These results extend previous findings indicating that recognition of apoptotic cells and necrotic cells by mφ occurs via distinct mechanisms (5Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and reveal that separate recognition processes are linked to contrasting signaling outcomes. Necrotic cells activate ERK1/2, whereas apoptotic cells inhibit activated ERK1/2, regardless of the activating stimulus. We presented data demonstrating that prior interaction with apoptotic cells precludes subsequent ERK1/2 activation; apoptotic cells also can inhibit previously activated ERK1/2 (data not shown) (17Reddy S.M. Hsiao K.H. Abernethy V.E. Fan H. Longacre A. Lieberthal W. Rauch J. Koh J.S. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells also activate JNK1/2 and p38, whereas necrotic cells have no detectable effect on these two MAPK modules. We find that the effects of apoptotic cells on signaling responses, like their effects on cytokine secretion (5Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), are dominant over those of necrotic cells and can be exerted even when the apoptotic cells are present in reduced numbers. It is important to note that both soluble and membrane-associated material derived from necrotic cells can mimic the effects exerted by whole necrotic cells. Strikingly, our data document that apoptotic cells retain the ability to elicit their characteristic signaling responses throughout the death process, irrespective of membrane integrity. Indeed, the effects of late apoptotic cells are identical in all respects to those of early apoptotic cells. Any intracellular contents released from late apoptotic cells are neutral and not proinflammatory. Our results may have important implications for our understanding of autoimmunity and tolerance (Fig. 7). Recent studies suggest that necrotic and apoptotic cells have opposing effects on immune homeostasis (24Albert M.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Necrotic cells, by virtue of leaking their inflammatory intracellular contents, may provide the costimulation needed for activation of naive T cells and therefore may promote immunity (25Barker R.N. Erwig L.P. Hill K.S. Devine A. Pearce W.P. Rees A.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 127: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells, on the other hand, being actively anti-inflammatory, do not activate T cells, and may even be tolerogenic (26Hugues S. Mougneau E. Ferlin W. Jeske D. Hofman P. Homann D. Beaudoin L. Schrike C. Von Herrath M. Lehuen A. Glaichenhaus N. Immunity. 2002; 16: 169-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). According to current models, late apoptotic cells, which have lost membrane integrity and leak their intracellular contents, should behave like necrotic cells and induce an immune response (27Savill J. Dransfield I. Gregory C. Haslett C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Thus, delayed or impaired clearance of apo-ptotic cells, as observed with targeted deletion of the complement protein C1q (14Mitchell D.A. Pickering M.C. Warren J. Fossati-Jimack L. Cortes-Hernandez J. Cook H.T. Botto M. Walport M.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2538-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) or the MER receptor tyrosine kinase (15Cohen P.L. Caricchio R. Abraham V. Camenisch T.D. Jennette J.C. Roubey R.A. Earp H.S. Matsushima G. Reap E.A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), is thought to lead to presentation of apoptotic antigen in the context of inflammatory signals, with resultant autoimmunity (Fig. 7). The delayed clearance model makes several predictions that we tested directly. First, for necrotic and apoptotic cells to have opposing effects on immune function, the signaling events induced by exposure to these two types of cells must be distinct. This prediction is fulfilled, at least in terms of signaling events involving the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK modules. Second, the model predicts that late apoptotic cells, which have lost membrane integrity, should behave like necrotic cells. However, in sharp contrast to this prediction, late apoptotic cells were indistinguishable from early apoptotic cells in all of their effects on mφ. Late apoptotic cells inhibited basal and M-CSF-induced ERK1/2 activity, late apoptotic cells activated JNK1/2 and p38, and, as elaborated below in the third prediction of the delayed clearance model, late apoptotic cells were fully dominant over necrotic cells. Third, the model predicts that the signaling events induced by necrotic cells must be dominant over those induced by apoptotic cells. This prediction arises from the following considerations. Because apoptotic cells are continuously generated in vivo, delayed clearance of apoptotic cells will lead to the coexistence of both early and late apoptotic cells. Immunity will result only if the inflammatory signals in response to the presumed inflammatory intracellular contents of late apoptotic cells can override the anti-inflammatory effects of early apoptotic cells. Because the intracellular contents of necrotic cells should be at least as inflammatory as those of late apo-ptotic cells, we pitted apoptotic cells against necrotic cells. Again, in sharp contrast to the prediction of the delayed clearance model, the signaling events induced by apoptotic cells were dominant over those induced by necrotic cells. Remarkably, late apoptotic cells were just as dominant as early apoptotic cells in terms of inhibiting ERK1/2 activity and stimulating JNK1/2 and p38. Thus, in striking contrast to the predictions of the delayed clearance model, apoptotic cells appear to be functionally equivalent throughout their existence, irrespective of membrane integrity. Finally, in direct opposition to the delayed clearance model, neither cell-associated nor soluble material recovered from late apoptotic cells was proinflammatory. Although our results argue against the delayed clearance model of autoimmunity, there is an important caveat. Our studies focused on three specific MAPK signaling cascades and may not generalize to other signal transduction pathways. It is possible that there exist other signaling pathways and/or intermediates for which the predictions of the delayed clearance model hold true and that these other pathways play a more determining role in the balance between tolerance and immunity. This seems unlikely, however, because we have also shown that late apoptotic cells mimic early apoptotic cells with respect to proinflammatory transcriptional activity (10Cvetanovic M. Ucker D.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and inflammatory cytokine secretion (5Cocco R.E. Ucker D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, even if delayed clearance contributes to the development of autoimmunity, it is not in and of itself sufficient to produce autoimmunity, because targeted deletion of CD14 or the mannose-binding lectin leads to the in vivo accumulation of apoptotic cells in the absence of autoimmunity (28Devitt A. Parker K.G. Ogden C.A. Oldreive C. Clay M.F. Melville L.A. Bellamy C.O. Lacy-Hulbert A. Gangloff S.C. Goyert S.M. Gregory C.D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Stuart L.M. Takahashi K. Shi L. Savill J. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3220-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In light of these considerations, we propose that the absence of apoptotic cell-induced signaling events, rather than delayed apoptotic cell clearance per se, is the critical event leading to the loss of tolerance and the development of autoimmunity. We therefore hypothesize that the signaling pathways induced by the binding and/or uptake of apoptotic cells are critical to the maintenance of tolerance and that deficient or abnormal signaling events within these same pathways can predispose to autoimmunity. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have previously shown that mφ from prediseased mice of all the major inbred murine models of spontaneous autoimmunity, including multiple strains that develop systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as the autoimmune diabetes-prone NOD strain, have an identical apoptotic cell-dependent abnormality in the expression of multiple cytokines (22Koh J.S. Wang Z. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4190-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Longacre A. Koh J.S. Hsiao K.K.-H. Gilligan H. Fan H. Patel V.A. Levine J.S. J.

Affected systemic lupus erythematosus-prone strains include MRL/+, MRL/lpr, NZB, NZW, NZB/W F1, BXSB, and LG/J. No similar defect in cytokine expression can be found in 16 nonautoimmune strains, including three strains that develop type II (nonautoimmune) diabetes mellitus. Importantly, in the absence of apoptotic cells, cytokine expression by these autoimmune-prone strains is completely normal. Furthermore, cytokine expression is not the sole apoptotic cell-dependent abnormality observed in mφ from prediseased autoimmune-prone mice. mφ from NOD and the same systemic lupus erythematosusprone strains also have a reversible defect in the activity of the cytoplasmic G protein Rho, a key regulator of the cytoskeleton, resulting in abnormalities of adhesion and cytoskeletal organization (31Fan H. Longacre A. Meng F. Patel V. Hsiao K Koh J.S. Levine J.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4834-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Fan H. Patel V.A. Longacre A. Levine J.S. J. Leuk. Biol. 2006; 79: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Again, no similar abnormalities were observed in mφ from multiple nonautoimmune control strains. These results provide strong support for our hypothesis that abnormalities in the signaling events induced by apoptotic cells may be causally related to the development of autoimmunity. The downstream consequences of these signaling events, in terms of gene transcription and phentotypic function, are the subject of ongoing investigation. Download .pdf (.23 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2136261906,"Quality control machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) helps ensure that only properly folded and assembled proteins accumulate in the ER or continue along the secretory pathway. Aberrant proteins are retrotranslocated to the cytosol and degraded by the proteasome, a process called ER-associated degradation. Doa10, a transmembrane protein of the ER/nuclear envelope, is one of the primary ubiquitin ligases (E3s) participating in ER-associated degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we report the membrane organization of the 1319-residue Doa10 polypeptide. The topology was determined by fusing a dual-topology reporter after 16 different Doa10 fragments. Our results indicate that Doa10 contains 14 transmembrane helices (TMs). Based on protease digestion of yeast microsomes, both the N-terminal RING-CH domain and the C terminus face the cytosol. Notably, the experimentally derived topology was not predicted correctly by any of the generally available TM prediction algorithms. Bioinformatic analysis and in silico mutagenesis guided the topological studies through problematic regions. The conserved TD domain in Doa10 includes three TMs. These TMs might function in cofactor binding or substrate recognition, or they might be part of a retrotranslocation channel. The Derlins were previously proposed to provide such channels, but we show that the two yeast Derlins are not required for degradation of Doa10 membrane substrates, as was found before for the Sec61 translocon. Finally, we provide evidence that the likely human Doa10 ortholog, TEB4 (MARCH-VI), adopts a topology similar to that of Doa10."

In addition, extracellular and cell surface glycoconjugates that participate in the construction of specialized cell microenvironments, so-called “niches,” could be involved in the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells.Proteoglycans are a group of proteins bearing covalently bound sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and are typical glycoconjugates in the extracellular matrix and at the surface of cells of the central nervous system (6Bandtlow C.E.

Development. 1996; 122: 3443-3452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are expressed in the neuroepithelium and are considered modulators for the proliferation of neural stem cells.Many molecular species of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are expressed in the central nervous system and have been shown to be involved in various cellular events in the formation and maintenance of the neural network (6Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 7Oohira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, very few studies have been done on the structure and function of CS-GAG/CSPGs in the brain primordium. Recently, neural precursor cells have been shown to synthesize and secrete CSPGs, including some lectican family members (14Kabos P. Matundan H. Zandian M. Bertolotto C. Robinson M.L. Davy B.E. Yu J.S. Krueger Jr., R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that cultured tissue segments of E13 mouse brains synthesize CS rich in a disaccharide unit containing 4,6-disulfated N-acetylgalactosamine (E-unit) and that the CS preparation has an affinity for midkine, a heparin-binding growth factor (15Zou P. Zou K. Muramatsu H. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Habuchi O. Ohtake S. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A commercial preparation including chondroitin sulfate E (CS-E) from the squid cartilage binds with a high affinity to various heparin-binding growth factors such as FGFs, pleiotrophin, and midkine (16Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43707-43716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). CS rich in a disaccharide unit composed of iduronic acid and 4-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine (B-unit) from embryonic pig brain also binds to them (17Bao X. Mikami T. Yamada S. Faissner A.

These observations led us to hypothesize that neural stem/progenitor cells synthesize and deposit some CSPGs with B/E-unit-rich CS chains in their surroundings and that these CSPGs modulate the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells through the molecular interaction of their CS chains with these growth factors. To substantiate the hypothesis, we first characterized CS-GAG/CSPGs in the milieu of neural stem cells and then examined the involvement of the CS-GAG in growth factor-mediated proliferation of neural stem cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The following materials were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan); protease-free chondroitinase ABC from Proteus vulgaris (EC 4.2.2.4), chondroitinase ACII from Arthrobacter aurescens (EC 4.2.2.5), heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8) and II from Flavobacterium heparinum, hyaluronidase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus (EC 4.2.2.1), GAGs (chondroitin sulfate A (CS-A) from whale cartilage, chondroitin sulfate B (CS-B/dermatan sulfate (DS)) from pig skin, chondroitin sulfate C (CS-C) from shark cartilage, chondroitin sulfate D (CS-D) from shark cartilage, chondroitin sulfate E (CS-E) from squid cartilage, HS from bovine kidney, keratan sulfate from bovine cornea, and hyaluronic acid (HA) from human umbilical cords), antibodies to HS (10E4, mouse IgM), CS (CS-56, mouse IgM), unsulfated CS stub (1-B-5, mouse IgG), and 6-O-sulfated CS stub (3-B-3, mouse IgM).

Heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa and EGF were purchased from Sigma. FGF-2 was obtained from Roche Applied Science.Neurosphere Culture—The treatment of animals was performed according to the ethical rules of our institution. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats at a gestational age of 14 days were killed with an overdose of diethyl ether, and fetuses were transferred in Petri dishes containing ice-cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution. Telencephalons were excised from the fetuses and mechanically dissociated by pipetting into a single cell suspension in Hanks’ balanced salt solution without Mg2+ and Ca2+ in the presence of 0.01% DNase I (Roche Applied Science). Cells were plated at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells/ml/well in Falcon non-tissue culture-treated 24-well plates (catalog no. 35-1147; BD Biosciences) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) mixture medium (Invitrogen) containing two supplements, N2 and B27 (both purchased from Invitrogen (22Capela A.

On day 4, 0.5 ml of the culture medium was added to each well. On day 6, floating neurospheres were collected and used for further examinations as follows.Immunohistochemistry—Pregnant (E14) dams were killed under ether anesthesia as described above, and their fetuses were removed and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C. The fetuses were embedded in paraffin and cut to serial 6-μm-thick sagittal sections. The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. For the digestion of CS, sections were preincubated in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.03 m sodium acetate (chondroitinase buffer) for 15 min at 37 °C and digested with 0.5 units/ml protease-free chondroitinase ABC in digestion buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. After three washes with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline), sections were incubated in blocking solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 2% horse serum, and 2% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline and applied for 1 h. After three washes with Tris-buffered saline, sections were treated sequentially with biotinylated secondary antibodies for 1 h, with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 (γ1) antibody for 1 h. After being mounted with Permafluor (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA), sections were examined with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Fluoview; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).Neurospheres floating in the culture medium were fixed by adding the same volume of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 1% sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C overnight and collected by centrifugation at 50 × g for 5 min. The collected neurospheres were washed with PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 15% sucrose in PBS. They were embedded in a drop of Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA). Specimens were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Frozen sections, cut at 15 μm, were collected on MAS-coated slide glasses (Matsunami Glass, Osaka, Japan) and processed for immunocytochemistry as described above for embryo sections after permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in the blocking solution.Preparation of Samples for Western Blotting—Brain homogenates were prepared as described previously (25Matsui F. Watanabe E. Oohira A. Neurochem. Int. 1994; 25: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In brief, four E14 fetal rat telencephalons were homogenized on ice in 100 μl of PBS containing 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To the homogenate, 400 μl of 2% SDS in PBS containing 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NEM, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. The homogenate was then solubilized by boiling for 5 min. To analyze CSPGs in neurospheres and the culture medium, neurospheres were separated from the culture medium on day 6 by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min. CSPGs in the neurospheres were extracted by stirring in PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NEM, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C overnight. To analyze CSPGs in the neurosphere culture medium (60 ml), it was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Solid NaCl was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.3 m. CSPGs in this solution were adsorbed to 4 ml of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.3 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, by gentle agitation for 2 days at 4 °C and then were eluted from the DEAE-Sephacel resin with 0.7 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The eluate is hereafter referred to as the medium-PG fraction. Virtually no proteoglycans were obtained in the wash of the residual DEAE-Sephacel resin with 2 m NaCl.Western Blotting—Proteins were precipitated from the brain homogenates, neurosphere extracts, and medium-PG fractions by adding 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate at 0 °C, and the precipitates were digested with protease-free chondroitinase ABC as described previously (25Matsui F. Watanabe E. Oohira A. Neurochem. Int. 1994; 25: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 3% stacking gel and a 6% separating gel. After electrophoresis, proteins in gels were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.), and immunoreactive materials were detected by sequential treatments of the membranes with primary antibodies, biotinylated secondary antibodies, and a Vectastain ABC elite kit. For the detection of neurocan, phosphacan, and RPTPβ, Konica immunostain HRP-1000 (Konica, Tokyo, Japan) was used to visualize the bands. For the detection of NG2, goat anti-rabbit IgG(H + L)-horse-radish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) and Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used.Immunoprecipitation—Telencephalons of five E14 fetal rats or neurospheres from one plate of a 12-well plate were homogenized in 1 ml of PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NEM, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice, and the homogenates were stirred overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation of the homogenate at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of anti-NGC antibody (rabbit IgG) at 4 °C for 1 h. To the mixture, 2 μl of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the suspension was stirred gently overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was recovered as a pellet by centrifugation and washed with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in PBS three times and then with chondroitinase buffer. The immunocomplex was digested with 10 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC in 25 μl of chondroitinase buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 3 volumes of 95% ethanol, 1.3% potassium acetate at 0 °C. Proteins were precipitated by centrifugation and dissolved in 50 μl of the sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Western blot analyses were performed as described above.Isolation of GAGs—A GAG mixture was prepared from the telencephalon essentially as described previously (8Oohira A. Matsui F. Matsuda M. Shoji R. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In brief, E14 fetal rat telencephalons were dissected free of adherent connective tissues from 251 fetuses under a dissecting microscope and placed in ice-cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution. After centrifugation of the brain tissue suspension at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the brain pellet (wet weight, 3.1 g) was homogenized in 31 ml of ice-cold acetone. The homogenate was centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. After a wash with ice-cold ether, the final precipitate was dried under reduced pressure. The dried brain powder was hydrated by adding 4 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 3% ethanol. After the addition of Pronase-E (Kaken Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, the mixture was incubated with shaking at 50 °C for 24 h. The digested material was then treated sequentially with 0.2 m NaOH and 5% trichloroacetic acid and precipitated with 75% ethanol containing 1% potassium acetate to obtain crude GAGs. Postnatal day 8 (P8) rat telencephalons were dissected from 13 rats in ice-cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution. The brains were homogenized in 2.6 ml of distilled water and additionally homogenized by the addition of 26 ml of methanol/chloroform (2:1). The homogenate was centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was homogenized in 26 ml of methanol/chloroform/distilled water (2:1: 0.8), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. After a wash with ice-cold ether, the final precipitate was dried and processed for the preparation of crude GAGs similar to the preparation of E14 GAGs described above.The crude GAG preparation contaminated with nucleic acids was digested by RNase T1 and DNase I (both purchased from Roche Applied Science). GAGs precipitated from the digest by the ethanol treatment were dissolved in 1 ml of 2 m urea containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm EDTA (urea buffer), and the solution was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of DEAE-Sephacel with gentle agitation overnight at 4 °C, and GAGs were separated by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography with 10 ml of a linear salt gradient (0.15-0.7 m NaCl in urea buffer) and 5 ml of an additional 2 m NaCl in urea buffer. The amount of hexuronate in each fraction was determined by the method of Bitter and Muir (26Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). GAGs in peak fractions were precipitated with ethanol/potassium acetate, and the precipitate was redissolved in distilled water at a hexuronate concentration of 2 nmol/μl. Aliquots (2 nmol of hexuronate) of the solution were analyzed by cellulose acetate electrophoresis using a buffer system composed of 0.1 m pyridine and 0.47 m formic acid (8Oohira A. Matsui F. Matsuda M. Shoji R. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GAGs on the cellulose acetate strip were stained with 0.5% Alcian blue in 3% acetic acid, and excess stain was removed by rinsing in distilled water.Fluorophore-assisted Carbohydrate Electrophoresis—Obtained GAG fractions (3 nmol as uronic acid/tube) were lyophilized and dissolved in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.3, and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h with chondroitinase ACII (0.96 units/ml) alone or with both chondroitinase ABC and ACII (0.18 and 0.88 units/ml, respectively); the digests were recovered with Microcon YM-3 ultrafiltration devices (Mr 3,000 cut-off; Millipore) to obtain the lyase products of HA, CS, and DS. The undigested materials on the filter of Microcon YM-3 were recovered in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin, and digested at 37 °C for 8 h with both heparitinase I and II (0.03 units/ml each); the HS lyase products were recovered with Microcon YM-3. The recovered samples were dried and then fluorotagged at 90 °C for 30 min with 2-aminoacridone hydrochloride (27Matsuno Y.K. Kinoshita M. Kakehi K. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 2004; 36: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The fluorotagged disaccharide units of HA, CS, and DS were immediately separated on separating gels (19.5% acrylamide, 0.52% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, 2.5% glycerol, 0.05% ammonium persulfate, 0.6% agarose, 0.1% TEMED, and 0.045 m Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.0) with a stacking gel (7.5% acrylamide, 0.2% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, 2.5% glycerol, 0.05% ammonium persulfate, 0.6% agarose, 0.1% TEMED, and 0.045 m Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.0). Similarly, the fluorotagged disaccharide units of HS were separated on separating gels (19.5% acrylamide, 0.52% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, 2.5% glycerol, 0.1 m Tris borate, pH 8.3, 0.05% ammonium persulfate, and 0.1% TEMED) with a stacking gel (7.5% acrylamide, 0.2% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, 2.5% glycerol, 0.1 m Tris borate, pH 8.3, 0.05% ammonium persulfate, 0.6% agarose, and 0.1% TEMED). The fluorescent images were displayed in a gel documentation system (AE-6914; Atto, Tokyo, Japan). The bands of unsaturated disaccharide units were quantitatively analyzed with the NIH Image Analysis software using the bands of standards, d-galactose 6-sulfate (100, 200, 300, and 400 pmol/lane) in CS/DS and unsaturated glucuronic acid-6-O-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine (50, 100, 200, and 400 pmol/lane) in HS, which were purchased from Sigma. Amounts of iduronic acid-containing disaccharide units from DS were estimated by subtracting the amount of disaccharide units generated by digestion with chondroitinase ACII alone from that of the corresponding disaccharide units generated by digestion with both chondroitinase ABC and ACII.Molecular Weight Analysis—To remove HS and HA from the GAG fractions, an aliquot (200 nmol of hexuronate) was digested with hyaluronidase (5 turbidity-reducing units/ml) in 400 μl of 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, at 60 °C for 1 h. The enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate. The ethanol-precipitated material was additionally digested with heparitinase I (16 milliunits/ml) in 300 μl of 5 mm calcium acetate and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, at 40 °C for 1 h. The enzyme reaction was stopped by the ethanol precipitation, and the material was separated by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography as described above. CS recovered in peak fractions was precipitated with ethanol/potassium acetate, and the precipitate was redissolved in distilled water at a hexuronate concentration of 2 nmol/μl (about 0.9 μg of CS/μl).To estimate the molecular size of CS, an aliquot (4 μg) was applied to a gel permeation chromatography system consisting of a TSK-gel G4000PWXL column and a TSK-gel G3000PWXL column (TOSOH Corp., Tokyo, Japan). CS was eluted from the column with 0.2 m NaCl, and its molecular size was calculated from the position of its elution with Borwin-gel permeation chromatography software (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) using a calibration curve depicted for a standard CS mixture (52.2, 31.4, 20.0, 10.2, and 6.6 kDa).Effects of GAGs on Growth Factor-mediated Proliferation of Neural Stem Cells—Primary neurospheres, which were largely composed of neural stem cells, were collected and washed twice with the medium in the absence of EGF and FGF-2. The neurospheres were triturated with a 1000-μl micropipette tip in growth factor-free medium, and the cell suspension was filtered through a Falcon cell strainer (BD Biosciences) to obtain a single cell suspension. Cells (1.0 × 104 cells/well) in 0.1 ml of medium containing either EGF (10 ng/ml), FGF-2 (10 ng/ml), or a mixture of EGF and FGF-2 (each 10 ng/ml) were plated onto 96-well plates.Commercial GAGs (1.0 mg/ml PBS) were added to the cultures at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml just after the plating of cells. In the case of telencephalon-derived CS, an aliquot of the GAG preparation (50 nmol of hexuronate) was digested with a mixture of heparitinase I and II (10 milliunits/ml) in 50 μl of 5 mm calcium acetate and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, at 40 °C for 2 h in order to remove HS from the GAG preparation. The enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate. This enzymatic digestion removed 43, 13, and 8% of total hexuronate from fraction I, II, and III (see Fig. 4), respectively. The ethanol-precipitated material was lyophilized and then dissolved in sterile PBS at a final concentration of 0.5 nmol (fraction I; see Fig. 4) or 1 nmol (fractions II and III) of hexuronate/μl, about 0.25 μg (fraction I) or 0.5 μg (fractions II and III) of GAG/μl, respectively. Since our preliminary experiment confirmed the complete inactivation of both heparitinases by ethanol precipitation and lyophilization, the telencephalon-derived CSs were added without removal of these denatured enzymes to the cultures at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml (fractions II and III) or 5 μg/ml (fraction I) just after the plating of cells.The growth factors and GAGs were again added to the cultures on day 2. On day 4, 50 μl of fresh medium was added to each well, and then the cultures were supplemented with the growth factors and GAGs at the final concentration described above. On day 6, growth of the cells in cultures was determined by measuring the activity of mitochondrial succinate-tetrazolium reductase detectable only in live cells with a Cell Proliferation Assay System (Premix WST-1; Takara, Kyoto, Japan). Four wells were used for a single experimental condition, and the data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical comparisons of data between samples with and without GAGs were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. To estimate the exte"
https://openalex.org/W2118597946,"H1 histones, isolated from logarithmically growing and mitotically enriched human lymphoblastic T-cells (CCRF-CEM), were fractionated by reversed phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and analyzed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry. During interphase the four H1 subtypes present in these cells differ in their maximum phosphorylation levels: histone H1.5 is tri-, H1.4 di-, and H1.3 and H1.2, only monophosphorylated. The phosphorylation is site-specific and occurs exclusively on serine residues of SP(K/A)K motifs. The phosphorylation sites of histone H1.5 from mitotically enriched cells were also examined. In contrast to the situation in interphase, at mitosis there were additional phosphorylations, exclusively at threonine residues. Whereas the tetraphosphorylated H1.5 arises from the triphosphosphorylated form by phosphorylation of one of two TPKK motifs in the C-terminal domain, namely Thr137 and Thr154, the pentaphosphorylated H1.5 was the result of phosphorylation of one of the tetraphosphorylated forms at a novel nonconsensus motif at Thr10 in the N-terminal tail. Despite the fact that histone H1.5 has five (S/T)P(K/A)K motifs, all of these motifs were never found to be phosphorylated simultaneously. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of human H1 variants occurs nonrandomly during both interphase and mitosis and that distinct serine- or threonine-specific kinases are involved in different cell cycle phases. The order of increased phosphorylation and the position of modification might be necessary for regulated chromatin decondensation, thus facilitating processes of replication and transcription as well as of mitotic chromosome condensation.

The order of increased phosphorylation and the position of modification might be necessary for regulated chromatin decondensation, thus facilitating processes of replication and transcription as well as of mitotic chromosome condensation. The nucleosome core, which consists of 146 bp of DNA wrapped 1.75 times around an octamer of core histones, represents the fundamental subunit of chromatin (for review, see Ref. 1Van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Arents G. Moudrianakis E. Elgin S.C.R. Elements of Chromatin Structure: Histones, Nucleosomes, and Fibres. 9. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1995: 1-26Google Scholar). The H1 or linker histones are associated with the core histone-DNA complex and with the linker DNA between adjacent nucleosomes. Histone H1 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner: levels of H1 phosphorylation are usually lowest in the G1 phase and rise continuously during S and G2. The M phase, where chromatin is highly condensed, shows the maximum number of phosphorylated sites. The individual H1 subtypes, however, differ in their degree of phosphorylation during the cell cycle (2Lennox R.W. Oshima R.G. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5183-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A number of studies indicate that H1 phosphorylation is more likely involved in chromatin decondensation than in condensation (4Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). H1 phosphorylation seems to destabilize chromatin structure, thus weakening its binding to DNA. This decondensation of chromatin may give the DNA access to factors involved in transcription and replication in G1 and S as well as to condensing factors active during mitosis (5Chadee D.N.

Recent studies demonstrate that H1 phosphorylation regulates specific gene expression in vivo and that it acts by mimicking the partial removal of H1 (6Dou Y. Mizzen C.A. Abrams M. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 641-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The H1 histones consist of a globular central region flanked by short N- and long C-terminal domains (7Van Holde K.E. Rich A. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988: 69-180Google Scholar). These two domains contain the serine and threonine residues that are cell cycle-dependently phosphorylated in both interphase and mitosis. The state of H1 phosphorylation is thought to depend on a balance of protein phosphatase 1 and CDC2/CDK2 kinase activities in the cell (8Paulson J.R. Patzlaff J.S. Vallis A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These kinases, when complexed with various cyclins, require the consensus sequence (S/T)PXZ, where X is any amino acid and Z is a basic amino acid (for review, see Ref. 9Moreno S. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 61: 549-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The p34cdc2/cyclin B kinase, having maximum activity at mitosis (10Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), was expected to be the enzyme responsible for phosphorylation of the mitotic-specific serine and threonine sites of histone H1. Surprisingly, in Chinese hamster ovary cells mitotic-specific phosphorylation of both serine and threonine residues was found to be located at the end of the N-terminal region of H1, which has no (S/T)PXZ consensus sequences (11Gurley L.R. Valdez J.G. Buchanan J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27653-27660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Only few data exist about site-specific phosphorylation during interphase. Gurley et al. (11Gurley L.R. Valdez J.G. Buchanan J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27653-27660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) assumed that there is no absolute cell cycle-specific site of phosphorylation and that during interphase, the number of phosphates per H1 molecule is more important than which sites are phosphorylated. On the other hand, Mizzen et al. (12Mizzen C.A. Dou Y. Liu Y. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14533-14536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) demonstrated that phosphorylation of macronuclear H1 in the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena occurs hierarchically during interphase. So far it is not clear how phosphorylation of histone H1 brings about the DNA-H1 interactions that result in different chromatin states at interphase and mitosis. This is also true for the moderate phosphorylation of H1 occurring during interphase, which is associated with the process of DNA replication (13Yasuda H. Matsumoto Y. Mita S. Marunouchi T. Yamada M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4414-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Halmer L. Gruss C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1420-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To gain more information on how phosphorylation influences the interaction of H1 with DNA and, in turn, modulates chromatin structure during interphase and mitosis, it is necessary to investigate in more detail the phosphorylation of H1 during the different cell cycle phases. The present paper demonstrates that human lymphoblastic T-cells have an unambiguous site specificity for the phosphorylation of histone H1. During interphase, phosphorylation occurs exclusively on serine residues in the consensus sequences SPK(A)K. The up-phosphorylation occurring during mitosis, however, is the result of an additional specific phosphorylation of threonine residues. We found two tetraphosphorylated H1.5 forms (with phosphorylation at either Thr137 or Thr154) and two pentaphosphorylated forms consisting of the two tetraphosphorylated forms each being additionally phosphorylated at Thr10, which does not occur in a TPK(A)K consensus sequence. Interestingly, a hyperphosphorylated H1.5 protein with a phosphate group at both Thr137 and Thr154 was not detected.

Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (4000cP) was obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were purchased from Merck if not otherwise indicated. Cell Culture and Synchronization of Cells—Human lymphoblastic T-cells (line CCRF-CEM) and HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom; Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Sigma), 60 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in the presence of 5% CO2. Exponentially growing CCRF-CEM cells were labeled for 18 h in sodium phosphate-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with carrier-free 32Pi (10 mCi/1.5 × 109 cells, 8 μCi/ml medium; Amersham Biosciences). To obtain mitotic-enriched CCRF-CEM cells, exponentially growing cells were incubated with 0.06 μg of colcemid/ml of medium for 5 h. The cells were characterized using flow cytometry and light microscopy. For cell synchronization, HeLa cells were grown as a monolayer and cultured at an initial cell density of 1.5 × 105/dish (10 cm). After 24 h of growing in normal medium, cells were incubated with 2 mm thymidine for 24 h, recovered for 8 h in normal medium, and incubated further with 2 mm thymidine for an additional 14 h. Finally, cells were incubated again in normal medium for a further 5 h (90% of cells in S phase) or 10 h (40% of cells in late S phase and 60% in G2/mitosis). Immunofluorescence—An amount of 1 × 105 HeLa cells was cytospun onto slides. Cells were permeabilized using Triton X-100 (1% for 2 min and 0.1% for 10 min) in KCM buffer (120 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5), blocked for 1 h in KCM buffer containing 2.5% bovine serum albumin, and sequentially incubated with rabbit polyclonal to histone H1.4 phosphothreonine 146 (Abcam, ab3596) as the primary antibody (1:200 diluted in KCM containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100). As secondary antibody we used goat anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Sigma) (1:160 diluted in KCM containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100). Cells were fixed for 10 min with 2% paraformaldehyde in KCM, stained with DAPI for 1 min, and mounted in ProLong antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). Staining was visualized using a 100 × objective on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope and SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Images were captured using MetaVue Software (Universal Imaging Corp.) and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop. Preparation of H1 Histones—Human cells (1.5 × 109) were collected by centrifugation (800 × g for 10 min) and H1 histones extracted with perchloric acid (5%, w/v) according to the procedure of Lindner et al. (15Lindner H. Sarg B. Helliger W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1997; 782: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HLPC)—The equipment used consisted of a 127 Solvent Module and a model 166 UV-visible region detector (Beckman Instruments). The effluent was monitored at 210 nm, and the peaks were recorded using a Beckman System Gold software. Reversed Phase (RP)-HPLC—The separation of whole linker histones was performed on a Nucleosil 300-5 C4 column (250 × 8 mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle pore size; 30-nm pore size; end-capped; Macherey-Nagel). The lyophilized proteins were dissolved in water containing 200 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and samples of ∼ 500 μg were injected onto the column. The histone H1 sample was chromatographed within 40 min at a constant flow of 1.5 ml/min with a two-step acetonitrile gradient starting at solvent A:solvent B (63:37) (solvent A: water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 37 to 45% B in 10 min and from 45 to 54% B in 30 min. The peptides obtained by enzymatic cleavage were chromatographed using solvent A (water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (85% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Histone H1 peptide fractions obtained by chymotrypsin digestion were separated using a Nucleosil 300-5 C18 column (100 × 4 mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle pore size; end-capped; Macherey-Nagel). Samples of 20-100 μg were injected onto the column. Chromatography was performed within 55 min at a constant flow of 0.5 ml/min. The concentration of solvent B was increased linearly from 5 to 10% in 5 min, from 10 to 25% in 20 min, from 25 to 50% in 30 min, and from 50 to 100% in 5 min. To separate the peptide fractions obtained by trypsin and endoprotease Glu-C cleavage a Nucleosil 300-5 C18 column (250 mm × 3 mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle pore size; end-capped; Macherey-Nagel) was used. Peptide fractions obtained by endoprotease Glu-C cleavage of the N-terminal fragments of the individual human H1 histones were chromatographed within 90 min at a constant flow of 0.35 ml/min. The concentration of solvent B was increased linearly from 5 to 10% in 5 min, from 10 to 23% in 25 min, from 23 to 50% in 45 min, and from 50 to 100% in 15 min. The peptides obtained by digestion of human H1 histones by trypsin were separated within 150 min at a constant flow of 0.35 ml/min. The concentration of solvent B was increased linearly from 0 to 2% in 5 min, from 2 to 13% in 80 min, from 13 to 35% in 45 min, and from 35 to 100% in 20 min. Peptide fractions were collected and, after adding 20 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2 m), lyophilized and stored at -20 °C. Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography (HILIC)—The histone fraction H1.5 (150 μg) isolated from exponentially growing CCRF-CEM cells by RP-HPLC was fractionated on a PolyCAT A column (250 mm × 4.6 mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle size; 100-nm pore size; ICT) at 23 °C and at a constant flow of 1.0 ml/min using a two-step gradient starting at solvent A:solvent B (100:0) (solvent A: 70% acetonitrile, 15 mm TEA/H3PO4, pH 3.0; solvent B: 70% acetonitrile, 15 mm TEA/H3PO4, pH 3.0, and 0.68 m NaClO4). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 0 to 60% B in 5 min, from 60 to 100% in 35 min, and then maintained at 100% for 30 min. H1.5 from colcemid-treated cells was analyzed using a two-step gradient starting at solvent A:solvent B (100:0) (solvent A: 70% acetonitrile, 10 mm TEA/methanephosphonate (TEA/MPA, pH 3.0); solvent B: 70% acetonitrile, 10 mm TEA/MPA, pH 3.0, and 1 m NaClO4). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 0 to 30% B in 5 min and from 30 to 100% B in 60 min. The isolated protein fractions were desalted using RP-HPLC. Capillary Electrophoresis—High performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) was performed on a Beckman system P/ACE 2100. An untreated capillary (fused silica, 57 cm total length × 75 μm inner diameter) was used, protein samples were injected by pressure, and detection was performed by measuring UV absorption at 200 nm. Runs were carried out in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2.0, containing 0.02% hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose at a constant voltage (12 kV) and at a capillary temperature of 25 °C. Enzymatic Cleavage—Histone H1 fractions obtained by HILIC (20-100 μg) were digested with α-chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1; Sigma type I-S, 1/150 w/w) in 100 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, for 20 min at room temperature. The digest was subjected to RP-HPLC. The C-terminal fragments of the individual H1 histones obtained by digestion with chymotrypsin (∼ 5 μg) were digested with trypsin (Roche Applied Science sequencing grade, 1/50 w/w) in 100 μl of 5 mm NaHCO3 buffer, pH 8.3, for 24 h at 37 °C. The N-terminal fragments of the individual H1 histones obtained by digestion with chymotrypsin (∼5 μg) were digested further with endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Applied Science, 1/30 w/w) in 100 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 7.8, for 18 h at 37 °C. The digests were subjected to RP-HPLC. Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—Peptide sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems, Inc. (ABI) model 492 Procise protein sequenator. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Tryptic digests of the N- and C-terminal fragments of individual human H1 histones were analyzed using a LCQ ion trap instrument (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray interface. The nanospray voltage was set at 1.6 kV, and the heated capillary was held at 170 °C. MS/MS spectra were searched against a histone data base using SEQUEST (LCQ BioWorks; ThermoFinnigan). Determination of the molecular masses of the histone H1.5 subfractions obtained by HILIC and of peptides obtained by enzymatic cleavages were carried out by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Samples (5-10 μg) were dissolved in 50% aqueous methanol containing 0.1% formic acid and injected into an ion source. HILIC Separation of Phosphorylated Histone H1.5—To examine the interphase phosphorylation sites, 32P-labeled H1 histones were isolated from exponentially growing human lymphoblastic T-cells (CCRF-CEM) and fractionated using RP-HPLC. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, the main component histone H1.5 was clearly separated from the residual histones H1.2, H1.3, and H1.4. Of all H1 histones present in the cell line investigated (subtype H1.1 is absent from CEM cells) histone H1.5, which corresponds to the murine histone H1b in the nomenclature of Lennox et al. (2Lennox R.W. Oshima R.G. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5183-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exhibits the highest rate of phosphorylation during both interphase and mitosis (3Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Lennox R.W. Cohen L.H. Histone Genes. 1984; 3: 3-5Google Scholar). For this reason and because pure histone H1.5 can be isolated in a simple HPLC procedure, we investigated this histone subtype first. To determine the extent of phosphorylation, the histone H1.5 subfraction obtained by RP-HPLC (Fig. 1A) was subjected to HPCE. As shown in Fig. 1B, H1.5 was separated into four peaks belonging to the nonphosphorylated (designated H1.5p0), mono-(H1.5p1), di-(H1.5p2), and triphosphorylated (H1.5p3) forms of histone H1.5. To prove that the peaks shown in Fig. 1B are actually the result of differently phosphorylated forms of H1.5 and not caused by any contaminations or modifications other than phosphorylation, the H1.5 subfraction was digested with alkaline phosphatase. Thereafter, the sample was chromatographed and subjected to HPCE (data not shown). In contrast to Fig. 1B, only two peaks were visible: one main peak consisting of nonphosphorylated histone H1.5, and one minor peak of monophosphorylated H1.5. The complete loss of the higher phosphorylated forms of H1.5 (H1.5p2 and H1.5p3) and the dramatic decrease in H1.5p1 confirm the designation of peaks in Fig. 1B. Previously, we demonstrated the efficacy of HILIC by applying this method to the analytical and semipreparative scale isolation of core histone variants, acetylated and methylated core histone variants, and phosphorylated H1 histone subtypes (15Lindner H. Sarg B. Helliger W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1997; 782: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Lindner H. Sarg B. Meraner C. Helliger W. J. Chromatogr.

Chem. 2004; 279: 53458-53464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). When histone H1.5 isolated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 1A) was subjected to HILIC, surprisingly, not four peaks as in CE but five peaks were obtained (Fig. 2). By comparing the number and height of peaks obtained with HILIC (Fig. 2) and CE (Fig. 1B), respectively, we found that the single CE peak p1 was further resolved into two fractions (designated p1g and p1m, corresponding to the greater and minor monophosphorylated H1.5 fraction) by HILIC. We therefore assumed that HILIC has the potential to separate two monophosphorylated H1.5 subfractions differing in the position of the phosphate group. Characterization of the Five H1.5 Subfractions Obtained by HILIC—Confirmatory assignment of the five fractions obtained by HILIC (Fig. 2) was performed by mass spectrometry. Table 1 shows the ESI-MS analysis of the intact protein fractions: histones H1.5p0-H1.5p3. In fact, the two histones H1.5p1g and H1.5p1m contain one phosphate each, whereas H1.5p2 and H1.5p3 are di- and triphosphorylated, respectively.TABLE 1ESI-MS data of histone H1.5 peaks p0-p3 The individual HILIC fractions p0, p1g, p1m, p2, and p3 (Fig. 2) were analyzed using ESI-MS. The mass for the unphosphorylated intact molecule was calculated to be 22.491 Da.

Under the conditions used, two main peptide fragments were obtained. Using ESI-MS and sequence analysis by Edman degradation (data not shown) we found a cleavage at position 107 on the C-terminal side of phenylalanine, as expected. The C-terminal fragment (II; 108-225) was less well retained in RP-HPLC and was eluted at about 25 min, whereas the N-terminal peptide fragment (I; 1-107) was eluted at about 52 min. As an example, the RP separation of digested histone H1.5p1g is shown in Fig. 4. The procedure described was performed with all five HILIC fractions (Fig. 2). To determine the number and location of phosphate groups in the C- and N-terminal fragments, the cells were grown in presence of 32PO4. By measuring radioactivity and determining the molecular mass the phosphate content was investigated in each peptide fraction. The data clearly show that p1g contains one phosphate group located within the first 107 amino acids, whereas in p1m the phosphate group is bound to the C-terminal chymotryptic fragment. Diphosphorylated histone H1.5 is phosphorylated in both the N- and C-terminal fragments; the triphosphorylated protein shows one phosphate group in the N-terminal fragment and two phosphate groups in the C terminus. The results of interphase phosphorylation of H1.5 are summarized in Table 2.FIGURE 4RP-HPLC of peptide fractions of chymotrypsin-digested H1.5p1g. Histone H1.5p1g isolated by HILIC was digested with chymotrypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The digest (containing 20-100 μg of peptides) was injected onto a Nucleosil 300-5 C18 column (100 × 4 mm). Analysis was performed at a constant flow of 0. 5 ml/min using a multistep acetonitrile gradient starting at 90% A, 10% B (solvent A: water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: 85% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The concentration of solvent B was increased linearly from 10 to 15% in 5 min, from 15 to 23% in 25 min, from 23 to 50% in 45 min, and from 50 to 100% in 15 min. The peptide fraction designated N term (containing the first 107 amino acids) was used for digesting with endoproteinase Glu-C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 2Phosphorylation status of histone H1.5 during interphase and mitosis Distribution of phosphate groups in the N- and C-terminal fragments of differently phosphorylated H1.5 forms from exponentially growing CEM cells (interphase) and cells treated with colcemid (mitosis). p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5 = non-, mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentaphosphorylated H1.5 histones, respectively; p1g = greater monophosphorylated H1.5 histone fraction; p1m = minor monophosphorylated H1.5 histone fraction.TABLE 2Phosphorylation status of histone H1.5 during interphase and mitosis Distribution of phosphate groups in the N- and C-terminal fragments of differently phosphorylated H1.5 forms from exponentially growing CEM cells (interphase) and cells treated with colcemid (mitosis). p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5 = non-, mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentaphosphorylated H1.5 histones, respectively; p1g = greater monophosphorylated H1.5 histone fraction; p1m = minor monophosphorylated H1.5 histone fraction. To identify the exact positions of phosphorylation, we subsequently digested the peptide fragments I obtained from H1.5, namely p1g, p1m, p2, and p3 by V8 endoproteinase Glu-C and the corresponding fragments II by trypsin (see Fig. 3). The cleavage products obtained after Glu-C digestion of the N-terminal fragments of differently phosphorylated H1.5 histones were separated by RP-HPLC and their 32P content determined. Glu-C digestion of H1.5p1g, p2 and p3 yielded two radioactive fractions each (data not shown), which were characterized by MS analysis and Edman degradation. The more radioactive fraction was found to be a peptide with 37 amino acids (residues 8-44; designated III 8-44 in Fig. 3), whereas the fraction with the lesser content of 32P consisted of a peptide with 42 amino acids (residues 3-44; III 3-44 in Fig. 3). Thus, both of the radioactive fractions contain the same SPAK motif (positions 17-20). The precise site of phosphorylation was determined by amino acid sequencing and indeed found to be Ser17 of this SPAK sequence. H1.5p1m was analyzed in the same manner. As expected, we found only minute amounts of radioactivity in the fragments III 8-44 and III 3-44 caused by inevitable cross-contamination of H1.5p1m with H1.5p1g. Tryptic digestion of fragments II of H1.5p1m and -p2, both containing one phosphate group in the C-terminal region, yielded two radioactive fractions after HPLC separation (data not shown). The individual peptides were identified by amino acid sequencing and proved to be different length peptides out of the C-terminal domain containing a part of a SPKK motif with a phosphorylated serine in position 172 (designated VI 168-174, 169-174 in Fig. 3). Cleavage of the C-terminal fragment II of H1.5p3 yielded three radioactive fractions, two of them identical to those obtained by enzymatic digestion of histones H1.5p1m and -p2. The third one was characterized by MS and designated VII 184-193 (Fig. 3). This peptide was analyzed by Edman degradation, which showed that the third phosphorylation site during interphase is Ser188. Proportion of Histone H1.5p1g to p1m in Various Cell Lines—The finding that monophosphorylation of H1.5 occurs at only two specific positions, namely at Ser17 in the N-terminal region (H1.5p1g) and at Ser172 (H1.5p1m) in the C-terminal domain, was unexpected and indicates a nonrandom distribution of phosphate groups. To clarify the question of whether this result is valid only for CEM cells or is generally true for other cell lines, we investigated the relative amounts of p1g and p1m in several human cell lines (Raji, U937) and in mouse erythroleukemia cells (line F4N) using the HILIC technique (Fig. 5). We found p1g and p1m forms in all of these cell lines, and, surprisingly, the patterns were very similar to those found for CEM cells. Fig. 5 shows that monophosphorylated H1.5 obtained from interphase consists of roughly 70% p1g and about 30% p1m. Characterization of Hyperphosphorylated Histone H1.5 from Mitotic-enriched CEM Cells—To extend our investigations to the identification of mitotic phosphorylation sites, H1.5 was isolated from colcemid-treated CEM cells by RP-HPLC (Fig. 1A). The extent of its phosphorylation was examined by HPCE (Fig. 1B), and in addition to H1.5p0, p1, p2, and p3 forms, two further peaks belonging to the tetra-(p4) and pentaphosphorylated (p5) forms were detected"

All of them orbit outside of Uranus's previously known (main) ring system but are interior to the large, classical moons. The outer new moon, U XXVI Mab, orbits at roughly twice the radius of the main rings and shares its orbit with a dust ring. The second moon, U XXVII Cupid, orbits just interior to the satellite Belinda. A second ring falls between the orbits of Portia and Rosalind, in a region with no known source bodies. Collectively, these constitute a densely packed, rapidly varying, and possibly unstable dynamical system."
https://openalex.org/W2128533844,"Antibodies against heparan sulfate (HS) are useful tools to study the structural diversity of HS. They demonstrate the large sequential variation within HS and show the distribution of HS oligosaccharide sequences within their natural environment. We analyzed the distribution and the structural characteristics of the oligosaccharide epitope recognized by anti-HS antibody HS4C3. Biosynthetic and synthetic heparin-related oligosaccharide libraries were used in affinity chromatography, immunoprecipitation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to identify this epitope as a 3-O-sulfated motif with antithrombin binding capacity. The antibody binds weakly to any N-sulfated, 2-O- and 6-O-sulfated hexa- to octasaccharide fragment but strongly to the corresponding oligosaccharide when there is a 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residue present in the sequence. This difference was highlighted by affinity interaction and immunohistochemistry at salt concentrations from 500 mm. At physiological salt conditions the antibody strongly recognized basal lamina of epithelia and endothelia. At 500 mm salt conditions, when 3-O sulfation is required for binding, antibody recognition was more restricted and selective. Antibody HS4C3 bound similar tissue structures as antithrombin in rat kidney. Furthermore, antithrombin and antibody HS4C3 could compete with one another for binding to heparin. Antibody HS4C3 was also able to inhibit the anti-coagulant activities of heparin and Arixtra as demonstrated using the activated partial thromboplastin time clotting and the anti-factor Xa assays. In summary, antibody HS4C3 selectively detects 3-O-sulfated HS structures and interferes with the coagulation activities of heparin by association with the anti-thrombin binding pentasaccharide sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1971480441,"Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals is restricted to specialized areas of the plasma membrane, so-called active zones. Active zones are characterized by a network of cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins involved in active zone generation and synaptic transmission. To analyze the modes of biogenesis of this cytomatrix, we asked how Bassoon and Piccolo, two prototypic active zone cytomatrix molecules, are delivered to nascent synapses. Although these proteins may be transported via vesicles, little is known about the importance of a vesicular pathway and about molecular determinants of cytomatrix molecule trafficking. We found that Bassoon and Piccolo co-localize with markers of the trans-Golgi network in cultured neurons. Impairing vesicle exit from the Golgi complex, either using brefeldin A, recombinant proteins, or a low temperature block, prevented transport of Bassoon out of the soma. Deleting a newly identified Golgi-binding region of Bassoon impaired subcellular targeting of recombinant Bassoon. Overexpressing this region to specifically block Golgi binding of the endogenous protein reduced the concentration of Bassoon at synapses. These results suggest that, during the period of bulk synaptogenesis, a primordial cytomatrix assembles in a trans-Golgi compartment. They further indicate that transport via Golgi-derived vesicles is essential for delivery of cytomatrix proteins to the synapse. Paradigmatically this establishes Golgi transit as an obligatory step for subcellular trafficking of distinct cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins. Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals is restricted to specialized areas of the plasma membrane, so-called active zones. Active zones are characterized by a network of cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins involved in active zone generation and synaptic transmission. To analyze the modes of biogenesis of this cytomatrix, we asked how Bassoon and Piccolo, two prototypic active zone cytomatrix molecules, are delivered to nascent synapses. Although these proteins may be transported via vesicles, little is known about the importance of a vesicular pathway and about molecular determinants of cytomatrix molecule trafficking. We found that Bassoon and Piccolo co-localize with markers of the trans-Golgi network in cultured neurons.

Synapses of the central nervous system are highly specialized asymmetric cell-cell contact sites mediating communication between neurons. A characteristic feature of synaptic junctions is the deposition of electron-dense meshworks of cytoskeletal and cytoskeleton-associated proteins at the pre- and postsynaptic plasma membrane. On the presynaptic side, this cytoskeletal protein matrix is called cytomatrix assembled at active zones (CAZ) 4The abbreviations used are: CAZ, cytomatrix assembled at active zones; DIV, day(s) in vitro; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; GBR, Golgi-binding region, BFA, brefeldin A; PTV, Piccolo-Bassoon transport vesicle; TGN, trans-Golgi network; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; Bsn, Bassoon; ARF, ADP ribosylation factor; CtBP/BARS, COOH-terminal binding protein 1/brefeldin A adenosine diphosphate-ribosylated substrate. 4The abbreviations used are: CAZ, cytomatrix assembled at active zones; DIV, day(s) in vitro; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; GBR, Golgi-binding region, BFA, brefeldin A; PTV, Piccolo-Bassoon transport vesicle; TGN, trans-Golgi network; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; Bsn, Bassoon; ARF, ADP ribosylation factor; CtBP/BARS, COOH-terminal binding protein 1/brefeldin A adenosine diphosphate-ribosylated substrate.; it defines the sites where synaptic vesicles dock and fuse to release neurotransmitter (1Dresbach T.

The N-terminal 609 amino acids of Bassoon may be targeted to the Golgi apparatus and to synaptic vesicle clusters but are not required for either trafficking step. By contrast, a central region of Bassoon is essential for its anchoring within the CAZ, for synaptic transmission at a certain set of synapses, and for anchoring synaptic ribbons at active zones in retinal photoreceptor cells (17Dresbach T.

Fluorescence imaging studies have revealed a stepwise incorporation of mobile units of Bassoon into nascent presynapses (21Shapira M. Zhai R.G. Dresbach T. Bresler T. Torres V.I. Gundelfinger E.D.

Gundelfinger E.D. Ziv N.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In axons of immature neurons Bassoon and Piccolo are specifically associated with a class of 80-nm dense core vesicles, which have been termed Piccolo-Bassoon transport vesicles (PTVs) and which may represent cellular vehicles delivering packets of Bassoon to nascent synapses (23Zhai R.G.

Indeed it is an emerging view that presynaptic elements could be transported to synapses en bloc via active zone precursor vesicles whose exocytotic fusion might directly result in active zone generation (21Shapira M.

However, although such mechanisms are likely to exist, little is known about their importance in synapse formation. Moreover a need for vesicle-based transport of CAZ proteins, all of which are non-transmembrane proteins, is not directly obvious. Here we used cultured hippocampal neurons to ask: (i) what are the molecular mechanisms and subcellular sites of CAZ assembly and (ii) what is the importance of vesicular transport of CAZ proteins. Our data suggest that association within the trans-Golgi network is an obligatory step in transport of Bassoon and Piccolo to synapses. Antibodies and Constructs—The following monoclonal antibodies were used in this study: anti-MAP2, anti-synaptophysin, anti-58k (Ref. 27Gao Y.S. Alvarez C. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. J. Biol.

Polyclonal antibodies used in the study were: anti-Bassoon Sap7f (13tom Dieck S. Sanmarti-Vila L. Langnaese K. Richter K. Kindler S. Soyke A. Wex H. Smalla K.-H. Kampf U. Franzer J.T. Stumm M.

All constructs were fusions to EGFP under cytomegalovirus promoter control. CFP-Golgi, CFP-Mem, and dsRed2-Mito were purchased from Clontech. Bsn-GFP is a fusion of full-length (3938 amino acids) Bassoon to the N terminus of EGFP. GFP-Bsn-(95–3938) (also termed GFP-Bsn) and GFP-Bsn-(609–3938) are fusions of amino acids 95–3938 and 609–3938 to the C terminus of EGFP, respectively. GFP-Bsn-ΔGBR is a fusion of Bassoon with a deletion of amino acids 2088–2564 to the C terminus of EGFP. GFP-BsnGBR is a fusion of amino acids 2088–2564 to the C terminus of EGFP. The cDNAs for synaptophysin and monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) were kind gifts from A. Jeromin and R. Y. Tsien, respectively. Cell Cultures—Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were prepared, maintained, and transfected as described previously (17Dresbach T. Hempelmann A. Spilker C. tom Dieck S. Altrock W.D. Zuschratter W. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly cells from embryonic day 19 rat brains dissociated with trypsin were plated onto coverslips at a density of 60,000 cells/cm2 and maintained in Neurobasal medium including B27 (Invitrogen), antibiotics, and glutamine. Neurons were transfected using the calcium phosphate method on day in vitro (DIV) 3 or 7 as described (17Dresbach T. Hempelmann A. Spilker C. tom Dieck S. Altrock W.D. Zuschratter W. Garner C.C.

Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in minimum Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected using the calcium phosphate method. Immunofluorescence and Fluorescence Imaging—Cells were fixed by incubation for 5–20 min in 4% formaldehyde or for 20 min in -20 °C-cold methanol (13tom Dieck S. Sanmarti-Vila L. Langnaese K. Richter K. Kindler S. Soyke A. Wex H. Smalla K.-H. Kampf U. Franzer J.T. Stumm M. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. J.

Coverslips were mounted using Mowiol and viewed with a 63× numerical aperture 1.4 Plan-Apo objective in a Zeiss Axioplan II microscope equipped with a SpotRT cooled charge-coupled device camera (Visitron Systems). Examples of specimen were analyzed and verified in addition by data acquisition using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M motorized microscope followed by deconvolution using Autoquant/Metamorph software (Visitron Systems) and Openlab software (Improvision). Confocal images were acquired using a Leica TSC4D confocal microscope. Analysis of digital images was performed using Metamorph software (Visitron Systems). Fusion constructs were detected using anti-GFP immunofluorescence when high detection sensitivity was necessary, e.g. for detection of large constructs after relatively short times of expression. For reasons of consistency, all images of fixed samples represent immunofluorescence data. Formaldehyde and methanol fixation yielded similar results for all markers. Cells expressing Bsn-GFP were fixed using methanol to remove soluble GFP, which is cleaved off from a fraction of Bsn-GFP (17Dresbach T. Hempelmann A. Spilker C. tom Dieck S. Altrock W.D. Zuschratter W. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Constructs tagged at their N termini, which do not lose GFP, were fixed using either formaldehyde or methanol. Quantitative Analysis of Synaptic Accumulation Bassoon—Neurons were double transfected on DIV 3 with mRFP-synaptophysin as a marker for presynaptic specializations and with either an inert construct or the Golgi-binding region of Bassoon. Cells were fixed on DIV 8 and immunostained for endogenous Bassoon. For analysis only axons that could clearly be assigned to a double transfected neuron were chosen. For determination of synapse density the number of mRFP-synaptophysin puncta/20 μm of axon was determined in several regions of the distal axon. Proximal axon parts (prior to the first accumulation of synapses, or 50 μm from the soma) were excluded because they were usually devoid of synaptic puncta. Brefeldin A Treatment—Brefeldin A (BFA; Sigma) was stored at -20 °C as a stock solution of 5 mg/ml in ethanol. Ethanol or a diluted stock solution of BFA (0.5 mg/ml in ethanol) was added directly to the culture medium of control or experimental neurons, respectively, at 1:500. The final concentration of BFA was 3.57 μm (1 μg/ml). Addition of ethanol had no effect on localization of Golgi markers, synaptic markers, and recombinant proteins as compared with untreated neurons. Endogenous Bassoon and Piccolo at the Golgi Apparatus—To investigate where Bassoon may associate with cellular membranes and possibly with PTVs we immunostained cultured hippocampal neurons grown for 3–4 DIV using Bassoon antibodies. The neurons frequently exhibited, in addition to the punctate staining pattern in axons characteristic of PTVs, an accumulation of Bassoon immunofluorescence in a juxtanuclear region (Fig. 1A). To assess whether this juxtanuclear distribution represents an association of Bassoon with the Golgi apparatus, cells were treated for 30 min with BFA, a drug that disrupts the Golgi complex. Under these conditions the juxtanuclear immunofluorescence of Bassoon was dispersed as characteristic of Golgi-associated proteins (Fig. 1, B and C). By contrast, the maximum intensity of juxtanuclear Bassoon immunofluorescence was increased ∼2.2-fold when cultures were incubated at 19 °C for 45 min (Fig. 1, D and E), a treatment known to attenuate the exit of organelles from the Golgi apparatus (30Keller P. Toomre D. Diaz E. White J. Simons K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Under these conditions virtually all neurons displayed juxtanuclear Bassoon immunofluorescence. Neither the 19 °C block nor the BFA treatment had any effect on the punctate distribution pattern of Bassoon in axons (data not shown). Together these data suggest that Bassoon becomes associated with membranes within the Golgi apparatus and that this step is perhaps a prerequisite to its transport into axons in association with PTVs. As the Golgi complex is rather condensed in young neurons, it was not possible to assess with which membranes within the Golgi stack Bassoon initially becomes associated. We therefore turned to older neurons (7–9 DIV), which contain a larger Golgi apparatus. Because the percentage of neurons containing a detectable juxtanuclear accumulation of Bassoon decreased with time in culture, we performed these experiments after a 45-min shift to 19 °C. Under these conditions, both Bassoon and Piccolo co-localized with TGN38, a marker of the trans-Golgi network (TGN; Fig. 2). Bassoon and Piccolo immunofluorescence exhibited a somewhat granular staining pattern aligned with the rather continuous TGN38 staining. There was significantly less overlap of Bassoon with 58k protein (Fig. 2, G–I), another marker of the Golgi complex, than with TGN38 (for references to Golgi markers see “Materials and Methods”). A comparable separation of immunofluorescence signals was also observed for TGN38 and 58k (Fig. 2, J–L) demonstrating that the localization of Golgi proteins to distinct subcompartments can be separated by immunofluorescence. Hence co-localization of Bassoon and Piccolo with TGN38-positive structures may reflect association of the two proteins primarily with a TGN-related compartment (see also Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Co-localization of Bassoon and Piccolo at the Golgi apparatus. Neurons expressing Bsn-GFP were fixed on DIV 8 without prior 19 °C block and then immunostained for GFP (green) and additional proteins (red in Merged images). Images show immunofluorescence in the soma of transfected neurons (for a low magnification example of the area displayed see supplemental Fig. 1). Bsn-GFP is co-distributed with TGN38 (A–C) and with VAMP4/synaptobrevin 4, a marker of TGN-related compartments (D–F). There is little overlap of Bsn-GFP with the cis-Golgi marker gm130 (G–I) or 58k (J–L) and the transferrin receptor (TFR, M–O). By contrast, Bsn-GFP co-localizes extensively with Piccolo (P–R).

Hempelmann A. Spilker C. tom Dieck S. Altrock W.D. Zuschratter W. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), are also not required for Golgi association (Fig. 3). Similarly Bsn-GFP, a C-terminally tagged full-length construct of Bassoon that is targeted to synapses (17Dresbach T. Hempelmann A. Spilker C. tom Dieck S. Altrock W.D. Zuschratter W. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), displayed juxtanuclear accumulation (Figs. 3, H–J, and 4). The juxtanuclear localization of recombinant Bassoon was dispersed upon 30-min treatment with BFA (Fig. 3, K–M). Bsn-GFP was detected at the Golgi complex of all transfected neurons at all culture stages without 19 °C block. Double immunofluorescence analysis revealed a pattern of Bsn-GFP fluorescence aligned with TGN38 (Figs. 3, H–J, and 4, A–C) in a way similar to the granular distribution of endogenous Bassoon at the Golgi complex. Moreover the degree of co-localization was highest for markers of TGN-related compartments, such as VAMP4 (Fig. 4, D–F) and syntaxin 6 (supplemental Fig. 1). There was less overlap with the cis-Golgi marker gm130 (Fig. 4, G–I) and with 58k (Fig. 4, J–L) and no overlap with the endosomal markers transferrin receptor (Fig. 4, M–O) and EEA1 (data not shown). Interestingly juxtanuclear immunofluorescence of Bsn-GFP exactly co-localized with Piccolo (Fig. 4, P–R). Together these data indicate that Bassoon and Piccolo associate with the same TGN compartment. Bsn-GFP Is Not Transported to Synapses When Vesicle Biogenesis Is Blocked—Is the association of Bassoon and Piccolo with the Golgi complex important for axonal transport of these proteins? To investigate this question we aimed to express recombinant Bassoon in the presence or absence of a functional Golgi apparatus on DIV 8. After this time in culture, Bassoon is associated with axonal PTVs and synapses (21Shapira M. Zhai R.G. Dresbach T. Bresler T. Torres V.I. Gundelfinger E.D. Ziv N.E. Garner C.C. Neuron. 2003; 38: 237-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Moreover axon length remains stable during a 14-h Golgi disruption paradigm using BFA in neurons of that culture stage (31Jareb M. Banker G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8955-8963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When neurons were transfected with Bsn-GFP on DIV 7 and fixed 18 h later, Bsn-GFP fluorescence was observed at the Golgi apparatus, as indicated by co-localization with syntaxin 6 in the soma, as puncta all along the axon and at synapses (supplemental Fig. 1 and Fig. 5G). Weak Bsn-GFP fluorescence was detected at the Golgi apparatus as short as 6 h after transfection, but 18 h were necessary for detection of fluorescence at synapses. When we applied BFA to DIV 7 neurons 4 h after transfection and fixed the neurons after an additional 14 h in the presence of the drug, Bsn-GFP was confined to the soma of transfected neurons (Fig. 5A). Bsn-GFP was always found in clusters (up to several micrometers in size) that also contained Piccolo (Fig. 5, C and D). Co-transfection of mRFP to visualize axons further supported this conclusion. Axons of BFA-treated neurons were devoid of recombinant Bassoon (Fig. 5, E and F, and Table 1), whereas puncta of recombinant Bassoon were abundant in axons of control neurons (Fig. 5, G and H, and Table 1). This indicates a significant impairment of axonal targeting of recombinant Bassoon in BFA-treated neurons. Immunostaining for endogenous Bassoon and Piccolo in untransfected, BFA-treated cultures revealed that the endogenous proteins co-localized in clusters in the soma too (Fig. 6). Under these conditions, extrasomatic puncta of Bassoon and Piccolo co-localizing with synaptophysin were still abundant, presumably representing pre-existing synapses (data not shown). However, the number of Bassoon puncta was reduced to 63% (p < 0.002), and the number of Piccolo puncta was reduced to 48% (p < 0.001). Moreover the intensity of these puncta was reduced to 57% for Bassoon (p < 0.002) and to 44% for Piccolo (p < 0.001). Together these experiments reveal a dramatic redistribution of Bassoon and Piccolo upon long term disruption of the Golgi apparatus. Moreover they corroborate the data obtained with Bsn-GFP and suggest that axonal transport of these proteins requires a functional Golgi apparatus.TABLE 1Effects of blocking Golgi function on axonal localization of recombinant full-length constructs of Bassoon and actin Constructs were detected in transfected neurons by anti-GFP immunofluorescence (IF). Axonal immunofluorescence of Bsn-GFP was always punctate. Data were obtained from transfected cells in three independent experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2074048523,"Molecules with three or more nuclei of nonzero spin exist as discrete spin isomers whose interconversion in the gas phase is generally considered improbable. We have studied the interconversion process in ethylene by creating a sample depleted in the B2u nuclear spin isomer. The separation was achieved through spatial drift of this isomer induced by resonant absorption of narrow-band infrared light. Evolution of the depleted sample revealed conversion between B2u and B3u isomers at a rate linearly proportional to pressure, with a rate constant of 5.5 (+/-0.8) x 10(-4) s(-1) torr(-1). However, almost no change was observed in the Ag isomer populations. The results suggest a spin conversion mechanism in C2H4 via quantum relaxation within the same inversion symmetry."

The enzyme is a heterodimer whose α-subunit contains the glycosyl hydrolase active site. The function of the β-subunit has yet to be defined, but mutations in the human gene have been linked to an autosomal dominant form of polycystic liver disease. Here we report the identification and characterization of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, GTB1, encoding a polypeptide with 21% sequence similarity to the β-subunit of human glucosidase II. The Gtb1 protein was shown to be a soluble glycoprotein (96–102 kDa) localized to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen where it was present in a complex together with the yeast α-subunit homologue Gls2p. Surprisingly, we found that Δgtb1 mutant cells were specifically defective in the processing of monoglucosylated glycans. Thus, although Gls2p is sufficient for cleavage of the penultimate glucose residue, Gtb1p is essential for cleavage of the final glucose. Our data demonstrate that Gtb1p is required for normal glycoprotein biogenesis and reveal that the final two glucose-trimming steps in N-glycan processing are mechanistically distinct.

The transferred oligosaccharide is then processed in the ER by the sequential action of specialized trimming enzymes (see Fig. 1). Glucosidase I, a type II membrane protein with a lumenal catalytic domain (3Shailubhai K. Pukazhenthi B.S. Saxena E.S. Varma G.M. Vijay I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16587-16593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) removes the outermost α1,2-linked glucose residue to yield the G2 form of the glycan (Glc2Man9GlcNAc2), followed by the action of glucosidase II, which removes the middle and innermost α1,3-linked glucose residues, yielding the G1 and M9 forms, respectively (Glc1Man9GlcNAc2; Man9GlcNAc2). Finally, in a slower reaction, ER mannosidase I selectively removes a specific mannose residue, yielding the M8 form (Man8GlcNAc2) before glycoproteins either exit the ER or are targeted for degradation if they have failed to fold correctly. In higher eukaryotic cells, there is a close link between N-glycan-processing events and ER quality control (for reviews, see Refs. 1Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar and 2Hebert D.N. Garman S.C. Molinari M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 364-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the middle glucose by glucosidase II generates monoglucosylated glycans that are required for productive interactions with the ER-resident chaperones calnexin and calreticulin (4Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Nauseef W.M. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the final glucose residue then prevents further association with calnexin/calreticulin, allowing correctly folded proteins to proceed through the secretory pathway. In contrast, incorrectly folded glycoproteins can be reglucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (Fig. 1, GT), which acts as a folding sensor (7Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), permitting another cycle of calnexin/calreticulin interaction. This enables unfolded substrates to go through multiple rounds of interaction with the chaperones of the cycle until the native conformation is reached, when recognition by glucosidase II (but no longer by glucosyltransferase) allows exit from the cycle and the ER. If the native conformation is not achieved, the slower acting ER mannosidase I cleaves a specific terminal mannose, resulting in the targeting of the glycoprotein for degradation (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Glucosidase II has been extensively characterized from mammalian tissues as a soluble luminal enzyme composed of two tightly associated α and β glycoprotein chains (8Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The α-subunit (GIIα) is a 107-kDa protein sharing sequence similarity with other glycosidase enzymes and that has a glycosyl hydrolase activity in vitro that is independent of the β-subunit (9Trombetta E.S. Fleming K.G. Helenius A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The function of the β-subunit (GIIβ) is less well defined, but it has been suggested that it may be required to retain the heterodimer in the ER via its C-terminal HDEL motif (10D'Alessio C.

More recently, it has been proposed that GIIβ interacts with N-glycans via a carbohydrate recognition domain to stimulate the GIIα trimming of both the middle and innermost glucose residues (13Deprez P. Gautschi M. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The importance of a physiological role for GIIβ is underlined by the finding that autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease can develop in individuals carrying mutations in the GIIβ gene (14Drenth J.P.

Glucosidase II has been characterized to a lesser extent in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The GLS2 gene encodes a GIIα homologue (Gls2p), and a Δgls2 null mutant is unable to process the G2 form of glycoproteins (8Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 18Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Here we report that a previously uncharacterized open reading frame (ORF), YDR221w, encodes the yeast homologue of GIIβ. This ORF, which we now refer to as GTB1 (glucosidase two β-subunit), expresses a soluble 96–102 kDa glycoprotein that co-immunoprecipitates in a complex together with Gls2p. In Δgtb1 null mutant cells, we found the stability and localization of Gls2p to be unaltered; thus yeast Bgt1p is not required for retention of Gls2p in the ER. Surprisingly, we found that trimming of G2 to G1 was unaffected in Δgtb1 cells, demonstrating that Gls2p is sufficient for this reaction. In striking contrast, we found that the Δgtb1 cells accumulated monoglucosylated forms of N-linked glycoproteins. These results indicate that Gtb1p is specifically required for the final glucose-trimming event during normal glycoprotein processing. We propose a model in which the β-subunit is specifically required to present monoglucosylated substrates to the catalytic domain of the α-subunit. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Growth Conditions—Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C with rotation in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) containing 20 mg/liter adenine and 2% glucose (YPAD) or in minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base) with 2% glucose and 10 mm ammonium chloride plus appropriate supplements for selective growth. Geneticin (Melford Labs, UK) was added to the YPAD medium at 200 μg/ml for kanMX4 marker selection. Standard techniques of mating haploid strains, sporulation, and tetrad analysis were employed to construct double mutant strains. The genotypes of yeast strains are detailed in Table 1.

This cassette was used to transform the haploid strain BY4741 to geneticin resistance. Transformants were tested by genomic PCR amplification of GLS2 to confirm correct integration. BWY616 (gtb1::HA) and BWY618 (gls2::Myc) were mated to create a gtb1::HA/gls2::Myc double mutant strain. The resulting diploid was sporulated and subjected to tetrad analysis. After scoring the geneticin resistance, colonies from tetrads showing a 2 resistant:2 sensitive segregation were immunoblotted for the presence of the expression of Gtb1p-HA and Gls2p-Myc. The isolate named BWY620 expressing both tagged proteins was thus identified. Yeast Cell and Medium Extract Preparation—Yeast whole cell extracts were prepared from 5.0 A600 units of exponentially growing cells by suspension in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.5-mm glass beads, followed by disruption at 6.5 m/s for 30 s (Hybaid Ribolyser) and incubation for 5 min at 95 °C. Growth medium protein extracts were also prepared from exponentially growing cultures. Typically, 10.0 A600 nm units of culture were subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant removed to a fresh tube, and the centrifugation repeated again. Trichloroacetic acid was added to the resulting cell-free medium to a final concentration of 15%, with incubation on ice for 30 min. Precipitated material was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was washed twice with ice-cold acetone and then resuspended in 1% SDS, 62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 1 mm EDTA at 95 °C. For endoglycosidase H digestion, whole cell or growth medium extracts prepared in 1% SDS, 62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 1 mm EDTA were diluted 10-fold into 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride HCl and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Mock or endoglycosidase H (2 milliunits/A600 nm equivalents) digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h. Reactions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated as described above and resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer at 95 °C.

Monoclonal antibodies against the Myc (9E10) and HA (12CA5) epitopes were obtained from Sigma. After migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon), and antibody incubations were performed as previously described (25Wilkinson B.M.

Immunodetection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgGs (Sigma). Membrane Extraction—The membrane association of Gtb1p-HA and Gls2p-Myc were analyzed by the extraction of microsomes with reagents that discriminate between integral, peripheral, and soluble proteins. For each extraction, 2.5 A280 nm units of microsomes prepared as previously described (25Wilkinson B.M. Esnault Y. Craven R.A. Skiba F. Fieschi J. Kepes F. Stirling C.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4549-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were harvested at 17,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 100 μl of membrane storage buffer containing the extracting reagent, except for carbonate extraction, when microsomes were resuspended with vortexing directly into 100 μl of 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.0). Extractions were incubated on ice for 30 min before centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant fractions were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and all fractions were heated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer at 95 °C. Native Immunoprecipitation—For native immunoprecipitation, 2.5 A280 nm units of microsomes, prepared as previously described (25Wilkinson B.M. Esnault Y. Craven R.A. Skiba F. Fieschi J. Kepes F. Stirling C.J.

The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min prior to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. For anti-HA precipitation, 25 μl of anti-HA affinity matrix (rat monoclonal antibody, clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science) washed in solubilization buffer was added to the supernatant followed by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h. Antigens were dissociated from the beads by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Radiolabeling and Denaturing Immunoprecipitation—For [35S]methionine labeling, cells were grown in minimal medium, and cell extracts were prepared as previously described (24Young B.P. Craven R.A. Reid P.J. Willer M. Stirling C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). 5.0 A600 nm equivalents of cell extract were added to saturating amounts of antiserum followed by rotation for 2 h at room temperature. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads (Sigma) at room temperature for 2 h. The beads were pelleted in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer. Antigens were dissociated from beads by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Radiolabeled samples were processed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA 3000) before exposure to x-ray film (Kodak). For Lhs1p and DPAP B immunoprecipitations, 5.0 A600 nm equivalents were loaded per lane and 2.0 equivalents for CPY. Analysis of N-Glycans—N-glycans labeled with [3H]mannose for 4 min were prepared from yeast strains and analyzed as described by Jakob et al. (18Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). 20 A600 nm equivalents of [3H]mannose-labeled N-glycan were run on a Supelcosil LC-NH2 (240 × 4.6 mm) column in acetonitrile:water (70:30, v:v), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using an Akta purifier (Amersham Biosciences). Samples (1.0 ml) were collected and analyzed by scintillation counting. Immunofluorescence—BWY625 cells transformed with pAC54 (SEC61-GFP) were prepared for immunofluorescence analysis essentially as described by Craven et al. (26Craven R.A. Egerton M. Stirling C.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2640-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures grown in minimal medium to A600 nm of 0.4 with selection for pAC54 were harvested and fixed in 5% formaldehyde at room temperature. The cells were spheroplasted by treatment with yeast lytic enzyme (ICN), and anti-Myc antibody (1:400; Sigma) staining was carried out for 1 h before visualization with Cy3-conjugated antibody (1:400; Sigma). Stained cells were incubated with 0.1 mg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min. Images were captured with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope at 2500× magnification. Plasmid pAC54 expresses the N-terminal 475 residues of Sec61p fused to GFP. A 2.5-kb HindIII fragment containing the SEC61 gene with a unique BamHI site, as described in the construction of a plasmid expressing the N-terminal 475 residues of Sec61p fused to invertase (27Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), was cloned into HindIII-digested pRS425 (2 μm, LEU2). The GFP gene was derived from pS65T as an EcoRI fragment cloned into pUC118 and then ligated as a BamHI fragment into the SEC61 vector to create pAC54. This plasmid complements the lethal Δsec61 mutation (data not shown). GTB1 Encodes the Yeast Homologue of GIIβ—There is a single uncharacterized yeast open reading frame, YDR221w, sharing significant (21%) sequence identity with human GIIβ (11Pelletier M.F. Marcil A. Sevigny G. Jakob C.A. Tessier D.C. Chevet E. Menard R. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 815-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). This ORF, which we now refer to as GTB1, would encode a 702-residue polypeptide with a predicted N-terminal signal sequence and six consensus sites for N-glycosylation. However, it lacks a C-terminal ER retrieval motif (-XDELCOOH), which is a general feature of other known GIIβ sequences. The highest degree of sequence similarity is found in the N-terminal region corresponding to residues Gln64–Cys84 of the S. cerevisiae protein (Fig. 2). The equivalent region of the human protein has been shown to be involved in binding GIIα and has significant similarity to a calcium-dependent EF-hand (28Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Another conserved Asn100–Cys148 region, has homology with C-type lectin domains (Fig. 2), suggesting a role in calcium-dependent carbohydrate recognition. In addition, there is another region toward the C terminus of the molecule with 27% identity to the mannose-6-phosphate receptor homology domain, including three completely conserved residues that have been implicated in mannose binding (Fig. 2) (29Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R499-R501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Gtb1p Is Required for N-Glycan Processing in Vivo—To examine a possible role for Gtb1p in N-glycan trimming, we analyzed the biogenesis of glycoproteins in null mutant cells. Wild-type, Δgtb1, and Δgls2 cells were labeled for 4 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine in minimal medium at 30 °C. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against three different glycoproteins, namely Lhs1p, CPY, and DPAP B. As expected, Δgls2 mutant cells accumulated glycoproteins that migrated more slowly than those from wild-type cells due to their failure to remove two glucose residues from N-glycans (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 5). Glycoproteins from Δgtb1 mutant cells also migrated more slowly than those from wild-type cells but faster than those from the Δgls2 mutant (Fig. 3A, lane 3). This indicated a partial defect in glucose trimming in the Δgtb1 mutant but not the complete block in glucosidase II function seen with the Δgls2 mutant. Treatment with tunicamycin led to the accumulation of unglycosylated species of the same size in all of the strains, thus confirming that the decreased gel mobility of glycoproteins in the mutants was because of a defect in N-glycan processing. The most obvious explanation for the phenotype of Δgtb1 mutant cells is that the middle glucose is trimmed normally but that there is a defect in the trimming of the final glucose residue. The trimming of glucose residues was analyzed further using a genetic approach to manipulate the glucosylation state of N-glycans. Cells carrying the Δalg8 mutation synthesize an incomplete core sugar that is equivalent to the G1 monoglucosylated glycan (30Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This structure would normally be trimmed by glucosidase II but accumulates in Δgls2/Δalg8 double mutant cells (31Jakob C.A. Burda P. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Roth J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It follows that, if GTB1 is required for the trimming of the final glucose, then a Δgtb1/Δalg8 strain should have the same glucosylation phenotype as the Δgls2/Δalg8 mutant. The double mutant strains were constructed and glucose trimming analyzed by radiolabeling cells and immunoprecipitation with antisera against CPY. As previously reported, the transfer of the incomplete cores onto proteins in Δalg8 cells is inefficient, leading to detection of a range of glycoforms with fewer N-glycans (30Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This is evident in the two faster migrating forms of CPY detected in Δalg8 cells compared with wild type (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). As expected, all glycoforms of CPY were larger in the Δgls2/Δalg8 double mutant compared with Δalg8 alone, indicating the accumulation of monoglucosylated glycans (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Significantly, the forms of CPY detected in the Δgtb1/Δalg8 strain (Fig. 3B, lane 4) were identical in size to the Δgls2/Δalg8 strain, indicating that both Gls2p and Gtb1p are required to trim the final glucose in N-linked glycans. Our interpretation of the trimming defect in Δgtb1 cells has thus far considered only the trimming of glucose residues. However, a change in the rate of mannosidase I trimming must also be considered. This is particularly relevant when one considers the possibility that the gel migration assays above might not discriminate between Glc1Man9 and Glc2Man8 glycoforms. To address this issue, we used the Δmns1 mutation to block mannose trimming, thus ensuring that all N-glycans retain a full complement of nine mannose residues (18Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The Δmns1 allele was combined with either Δgtb1 or Δgls2 and then glycoproteins analyzed as done previously. We observed a small but reproducible increase in the relative molecular weight of Lhs1p from Δmns1 cells compared with wild type, consistent with the expected defect in mannose trimming (Fig. 3C). The Δgls2/Δmns1 double mutant accumulates Glc2Man9 glycans (18Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), resulting in a substantially reduced gel mobility compared with the glucose-trimmed Man9 (M9) control from Δmns1 (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 2 and 4). Crucially, Lhs1p from the Δgtb1/Δmns1 double mutant has an intermediate mobility, from which we must conclude that it represents monoglucosylated glycans. Similar patterns of migrat"

At least 27 different collagen types, consisting of 42 distinct gene products, have been identified in vertebrates, underlining their vast diversity in biological functions such as tissue compartmentalization and specialization during the development (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). In the endoplasmic reticulum, the newly synthesized collagen chains assemble into triple-helical molecules with specific chain compositions, which oligomerize to form supramolecular structures, including filaments and networks after secretion to the ECM. Some collagens are obligate homotrimers, such as collagen III, which comprises three identical pro-α1(III) chains forming an α1(III)3 procollagen, whereas others form heterotrimers containing at least one different α-chain; such as collagen I (2Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Despite significant sequence identity and a propensity to form triple helices, procollagen chains have an extraordinary ability to discriminate between each other in the endoplasmic reticulum to form specific collagen types. For example, skin fibroblasts express six highly homologous but genetically distinct fibril-forming procollagen chains that are assembled in a type-specific manner to form type I, III, and V collagens. The mechanism by which different collagen chains are selected for assembly is a fundamental question that remains unanswered. Emerging evidence suggests that the C-terminal propeptide of the procollagen molecules plays a key role in the chain-specific recognition (3Bachinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J.

Bulleid and colleagues (9Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) demonstrated that transferring the C-propeptide of pro-α1(III) chain to the corresponding region of the naturally heterotrimeric pro-α2(I) molecule was sufficient to direct the new hybrid molecules to form stable homotrimers. They also identified a discontinuous variable sequence motif of 15 residues within the C-propeptide of pro-α1(III) chain, which, when transferred to the corresponding region of pro-α2(I) chain, enabled those chains to form homotrimers. The three-dimensional location of the motif awaits high resolution structural analysis, but analytical ultracentrifugation and small angle x-ray scattering studies suggest that chain specificity is defined by the core of a three-lobed structure of the C-propeptide of procollagen III (10Bernocco S.

In the case of network-forming collagens, parallel findings have indicated that the NC1 domains encode chain recognition for molecular assembly (12Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Bondar O. Gunwar S.

We have shown that the NC1 domains have an extraordinary capacity to reassemble in vitro to their native hexamer structure (12Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Bondar O. Gunwar S. Netzer K.O. Singh N.

A recent cell-culture study has also shown that the NC1 domain is necessary to initiate and direct triple-helix formation and assembly of collagen IV (8Soder S. Poschl E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Collagen IV provides a unique opportunity to delineate the molecular basis of chain selection in the assembly of triple-helical collagen molecules. It consists of 6 homologous α-chains (α1-α6), which out of 56 possible combinations assembles only into 3 specific trimeric molecules (α1·α1·α2, α3·α4·α5, and α5·α5·α6), reflecting a remarkable specificity (12Boutaud A.

Importantly, the recently resolved crystal structure of its NC1 domains has provided detailed structural information to decipher three-dimensional features of the recognition sites (16Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31142-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Than M.E. Henrich S. Huber R. Ries A. Mann K. Kuhn K.

The capacity of NC1 domains to reassemble in vitro provides the means to study the mechanism of assembly. Furthermore, the primary structures of the six α-chains from several mammalian species are known, providing the means for comparative analysis between sequence variability and chain specificity across species. In the present study, we have studied the molecular mechanism and the structural basis for chain selection in the assembly of collagen IV. We have utilized a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor and designed specific mathematical models to determine the kinetics of interaction and assembly of isolated α1(IV) and α2(IV) NC1 domains as the classic model for the collagen IV assembly. We show that the higher affinity of α2(IV) NC1 monomer for dimer formation with the α1(IV) NC1 monomer directs the molecular stoichiometry of chains and assembly of (α1)2α2 trimer. Furthermore, crystal structure analysis of the NC1 hexamer and sequence alignments of all six α-chains across mammalian species identified the molecular recognition sites, which include a hypervariable region of 15 residues and a 13-residue long β-hairpin motif involved in the domain swapping mechanism described earlier (16Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31142-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). At the domain interface, the two regions are located adjacent to each other and directly involved in the monomer-monomer interactions. Given its genetic hypervariability across all six α-chains and its critical location at the domain interface, the 15-residue long hypervariable region is thought to play a major role in the early mechanism of chain selection and assembly of collagen IV. Purification of NC1 Domains—Frozen bovine eye lens capsule were purchased from Pel-Freeze Biological (Rogers, AR). The NC1 hexamer was prepared by digestion of lens basement membrane using bacterial collagenase, followed by purification on a DE-52 ion-exchange chromatography and a Superdex S-300 gel chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (18Gunwar S. Ballester F. Kalluri R. Timoneda J. Chonko A.M. Edwards S.J. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15318-15324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monomers of α1 and α2 NC1 domains were separated from homo- and heterodimers by chromatofocusing using a Mono-P column (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (18Gunwar S. Ballester F.

The fractions were analyzed by Western blot analysis using chain-specific monoclonal antibodies against α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains as described (12Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Bondar O. Gunwar S. Netzer K.O. Singh N. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30716-30724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Acid Dissociation and in Vitro Reconstitution—Equal volumes (0.5 ml) of native NC1 hexamer (0.5 mg/ml) were loaded into 0.5-ml slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (Pierce) with a molecular weight cut-off value of 10,000 and equilibrated overnight with 10 mm KHPO4 buffers with pH adjusted to 7.4, 5.0, and 4.5. For complete dissociation a sample was equilibrated overnight in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 3.0. For the reconstitution study, a pH 3.0-dissociated sample was re-equilibrated overnight against 10 mm KHPO4 buffer, pH 7.4. After equilibrium, a volume (50 μl) of each sample was analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 (S200 HR 10/30) column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a high-performance liquid chromatography system (ÄKTA purifier, Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with the same buffers containing 150 mm NaCl, and the samples were run at the constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elusion volume of each protein species was compared with that of protein standards as described below. A sample of monomer fractions from both α1 and α2 NC1 domains isolated by chromatofocusing were also brought to equal concentration, dialyzed against 10 mm KHPO4 buffer (pH 7.4) and analyzed on the gel filtration column. The remaining of the samples after equilibration was used for circular dichroism study as described below. Calculation of Molecular Mass and Stokes Radii—Molecular mass and stokes radius for each protein was estimated by comparing their peak elution volumes (Ve) to a linear standard graph, obtained by plotting the logarithm of Mr versus Ve of selected protein standards with a known molecular mass and Stokes radius: thyroglobulin (Mr 669,000, Stokes radius 85.0 Å), γ-globulin (Mr 158,000, Stokes radius 52.2 Å), ovalbumin (Mr 44,000, Stokes radius 30.5 Å), and myoglobin (Mr 17,000, Stokes radius 20.8) as described (19Rogers K.S. Rodwell V.W. Geiger P. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1997; 61: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The protein standards were run in the same buffers and running conditions as for each study described above. Circular Dichroism—Protein samples from acid dissociation and in vitro reconstitution study were diluted with high-performance liquid chromatography-grade water to a concentration of 0.15 mg/ml. The CD spectra were recorded for each sample at 25 °C on a Jasco J-810 CD spectropolarimeter using 1 nm steps from 195 to 250 nm and a 0.1-cm path length. Buffers were scanned three times, and their average data were generated. Protein sample was also scanned three times and their average data were calculated and buffer subtracted. Mean residue ellipticity [θ], expressed in deg.cm2.dmol-1, was calculated on the basis of mean residue mass of 110 per residue and a total number of 240 amino acid residues per NC1 domain according to the equation, [θ] = 100·θobs/C·n·l, where θobs is observed ellipticity in millidegrees, C is the concentration of the protein in millimolar, n is the number of amino acid residues, and l is the length path in centimeters. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding analysis based on SPR was performed using a BIAcore 2000 optical biosensor (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Analyte-ligand interactions were measured in resonance units (1 RU = 1 pg/mm2 bound protein). Ligand Immobilization—All proteins were dialyzed against running buffer, TBST-EDTA (10 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% surfactant Tween 20, 3.0 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Ligands to be immobilized were diluted in immobilization buffer (10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.0) to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml and immobilized in equivalent molar ratios. Amine-coupling chemistry was used to immobilize the ligand proteins on carboxymethylated dextran surfaces of CM5 research-grade sensor chips (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Prior to immobilization, the sensor chips were washed twice with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.0) at 20 μl/min for 1 min each, followed by two additional washes with running buffer. The flow-cell surfaces were activated by injecting a 1:1 mixture of 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.2 m 3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl-N-ethylcarbodiimide at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C for 10 min. For immobilization, ligands were injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Different CM5 chips with both high density (∼1500 RU) and low density (∼200 RU) of ligand-surfaces were generated to examine the binding at different ligand-densities. Flow cells 1 and 2 were used to immobilize α1 and α2 NC1 domains, respectively. BSA as negative control was immobilized on flow cell 3 and was used for background subtractions. The fourth flow cell was treated only with activation and blocking solutions and was used as a blank surface for monitoring the refractive indices of buffers and samples. After immobilization, the remaining reactive esters on the carboxymethyl-dextran surfaces were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.0). Protein Interaction Analysis—All interactions were performed at 25 °C. Analyte samples were diluted in the running buffer and injected in triplicates at different concentrations ranging from 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, to 4.0 μm. The flow rate for interaction was set at 20 μl/min with a contact time for 300 s followed by dissociation for an equal time. After each cycle, the surfaces were regenerated by two subsequent injections of 40 μlof1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.0) followed by equilibration with the running buffer for 10 min. Data Analysis and Determination of Kinetic Constants—All data processing, including scale transformation, background and reference subtractions, were performed using BIAevaluation 3.0 (BIAcore AB). Data evaluation and calculations based on numerical approaches, including global curve fitting to interaction models, and calculation of kinetic constants were performed with IGOR Pro (version 4.01.A, WaveMetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Curve-fit functions based on specific interaction models for trimers and hexamers were arranged as external operation routines, written and compiled in C, using Code-Warrior IDE (version 5.1.1.1105, Metrowerks Corp., Austin, TX) and applied together with the Global Fit Procedure of IGOR Pro, based on a nonlinear least-squares method, utilizing the Levenberg-Marquard algorithm (20Press W. Teukolsky S. Vetterling W. Fleannery B. Numerical Recipes in C.2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1999Google Scholar). For numerical integration, a fifth order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method was applied (20Press W. Teukolsky S. Vetterling W. Fleannery B. Numerical Recipes in C.2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1999Google Scholar). The applied interaction models assumed a mass transport limited process based on the previously described two compartment model (21Myszka D.G. Morton T.A. Doyle M.L. Chaiken I.M. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mathematical descriptions of these models are provided in the attached supplemental data. The flow cell diffusion layer height (hdiff) and the mass transport coefficient (kc) at a given flow rate were obtained according to a previously described approach (22Sigmundsson K. Masson G. Rice R. Beauchemin N. Obrink B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8263-8276Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Global curve-fit calculations were performed with fixed values for the constant parameters Mw, hdiff, and kc, whereas the global parameters ka, kd, and Rmax were defined as free-running parameters to be determined by the global fit routine. However, the Rmax value was constrained by upper limit equal to a theoretical surface saturation with the highest Mw complex of the particular interaction model. The local parameter CA (analyte monomer concentration) was also defined as a free running variable but with upper and lower constraints within the range of total analyte concentration. Curve-fit routines were in all cases trimmed to keep the amount of fit variables at minimum. Analysis of Intermolecular Contacts and Structural Graphics—The intermolecular contacts between the α-chains were studied using DIMPLOT, which is included within the software package LIGPLOT (23Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4298) Google Scholar). The analyses were performed in conjunction with HBPLUS (24McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Three types of bonds were analyzed: hydrogen bonds, ion pairs (salt bridges), and non-polar bonds. The geometric criteria defining hydrogen bonds and ion pairs, consisting of minimum angles and maximum distances, were as previously defined (25Baker E.N. Hubbard R.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Non-polar bonds were defined as residues interacting, not with hydrogen bonds or as ion pairs, but rather though hydrophobic and van der Waal interactions. The calculations were performed on a chain-pair basis, excluding crystal packing contacts. The LIGPLOT output was modified in Adobe Photoshop to optimize the visual clarity of the residue positions. Structural graphics were performed by The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA, www.pymol.org). Primary Sequences of α1-α6 Chains—The complete amino acid sequences of NC1 domains of α1-α6 chains of mammalian collagen IV were obtained from the NCBI Entrez (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Structural Features and Stability of NC1 Hexamer—We and others have recently reported the atomic structure of the NC1 hexamer (16Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31142-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Than M.E. Henrich S. Huber R. Ries A. Mann K. Kuhn K. Timpl R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The structure provides a foundation on which to elucidate the mechanism of molecular assembly and identify the recognition sites for interaction. Thus we briefly present key features relevant to this topic. Each NC1 hexamer consists of two identical hetero-trimers with a molecular stoichiometry of two α1 and one α2 NC1 domains. The heterotrimers form a virtually flat surface of ∼4400 Å2, through which they interact end-to-end to form a compact ellipsoid-shaped molecule (Fig. 1A). The hexamer is stabilized through extensive hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions without a need for disulfide bonds, whereas the trimers are formed through a three-dimensional domain swapping mechanism (16Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31142-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In these types of interactions, a β-hairpin from each chain is swapped into a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet from the flanking chain to form a six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet structure, providing a stable inter-subunit contact (Fig. 1, B and C). Each NC1 subunit possesses two sites through which it interacts with the neighboring subunits; one site covers the β-hairpin and the other includes the docking site for the domain swapping (Fig. 1C). Because the α2 NC1 domain forms two different heterodimers with the neighboring α1 NC1 domains, each α1 NC1 domain has been indicated with different color to distinguish them (Fig. 1B). To establish a deeper understanding about the intermolecular forces involved in chain selection and stability of NC1 domain interactions within the hexamer, we performed a series of acid dissociation and reassembly studies, circular dichroism at different pH, and structural analysis of the x-ray crystal structure of the hexamer as described below. Acid Dissociation and Reassembly of NC1 Domains—Gradual and pH-dependent dissociation of the native NC1 hexamer and its reassembly were examined by analytical gel filtration. The native hexamer was prepared from bovine lens capsule basement membrane, because its collagen fraction consists almost entirely of α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains with lowest degree of covalently cross-linked NC1 domain (26Langeveld J.P. Wieslander J. Timoneda J. McKinney P. Butkowski R.J. Wisdom Jr., B.J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10481-10488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the native hexamer migrated as a single protein complex at pH 7.4 with a relative molecular mass of 85 ± 4 kDa (calculated Stokes radius of 43 ± 2 Å). This molecular migration is significantly slower than what is expected from the calculated molecular mass of a globular hexameric molecule consisting of six NC1 domains (6 × 25 = 150 kDa). We propose that this is most likely due to the domain-swapping interactions, which result in a highly compact and volumetrically smaller molecular shape, hence resulting in slower migration in a gel chromatography column. Nonetheless, from the calculated Stokes radius, a theoretical molecular diameter of 86 ± 4 Å can be derived, which is in good agreement with the molecular dimensions of the hexamer (95 × 70 Å) reported by x-ray crystallography (17Than M.E. Henrich S. Huber R. Ries A. Mann K. Kuhn K. Timpl R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At pH 5.0 the hexamer was still intact, however, at pH 4.5 it began to dissociate as revealed by appearance of a minor shoulder peak, which could correspond to a trimer peak (Fig. 2A). At pH 3.0, the hexamer was almost completely dissociated into monomers migrating as a major peak with a relative molecular mass of 24 ± 1 kDa (calculated Stokes radius of 27 ± 1 Å). A minor fraction of the hexamer did not dissociated into monomers at pH 3.0 and migrated as a dimer with a relative molecular mass of 46 ± 2 kDa (Stokes radius 35 ± 2 Å). This minor fraction (∼20%) corresponds to covalently cross-linked dimers (27Vanacore R.M. Friedman D.B. Ham A.J. Sundaramoorthy M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29300-29310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Finally, when a sample of the dissociated hexamer was returned to neutral pH by overnight dialysis, the hexamer configuration was regained, indicating that a mixture of α1(IV) and α2(IV) NC1 monomers can be reassembled to a hexamer, as it was reported earlier (12Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Bondar O. Gunwar S. Netzer K.O. Singh N. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30716-30724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). By circular dichroism, we further investigated the pH-dependent conformational change of the NC1 domains during acid dissociation of the hexamer and reassembly in neutral pH. The CD spectra of the native hexamer at pH 7.4 in the far-UV range (195-250 nm) was compared with samples at pH 5.0, pH 3.0, and to that of a re-associated hexamer in pH 7.4. The CD spectra for all samples demonstrated a negative band peaking at 199 nm and a positive band with a broad maximum at 225-235 nm (Fig. 2B). The negative peak at 199 nm is likely to derive from the unordered random coil structure of the NC1 domains, which in the crystal structure comprise ∼35% in α1 and 41% in the α2 NC1 domain. In the crystal structure, the β-strands constitute ∼53% of the hexamer structure. However, the lack of characteristic β-sheet CD signals is most probably due to the significant contribution of the CD spectra from the unordered portion of the structure, as mentioned above, and the abundance of aromatic residues and disulfide chromophores, which can make a strong contribution in the CD spectrum in the range of 215-235 nm (28Woody R.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 29Myers J.K. Morris D.P. Greenleaf A.L. Oas T.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8479-8486Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In fact, the notion that the positive band at 225-235 nm disappeared in the denatured sample at pH 3.0 indicates that this positive band is most likely to arise from the aromatic residues in the native structure of the hexamer. Nonetheless, based on the apparent difference in the CD spectra of the acid-dissociated sample at pH 3.0 and the spectra of other samples, it could be concluded that a complete dissociation of the hexamer occurs at pH 3.0 due to changes in the secondary structure. This conformational change seems to be reversible as the CD spectra for the refolded sample at pH 7.4 aligned with that of native structure (Fig. 2B). This is also in agreement with our gel-filtration data, showing that the native hexamer configuration can be recovered once the pH is changed"

RecA functions in the form of nucleoprotein filaments that are assembled most readily on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). 2The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ldsDNA, linear double-stranded DNA; cssDNA, circular single-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol. Filament assembly on duplex DNA (dsDNA) can also be achieved under some conditions, especially if a suitable nucleation site is available. RecA is a DNA-dependent ATPase, promoting ATP hydrolysis with a kcat of ∼30 or 20 min–1 when bound to ssDNA or dsDNA, respectively. RecA filaments assemble and disassemble in the 5′ to 3′ direction on ssDNA, with protomers being added to one end and subtracted from the other under appropriate conditions (7Bork J.M. Cox M.M.

The activities of RecA protein must be regulated in the cell to target RecA to locations where it is needed and to avoid aberrant DNA transactions. This is true of all RecA homologs in all classes of organisms. The aberrant reactions could in principle include gross chromosomal rearrangements that lead to many human diseases, including cancer (11Yu V.P. Koehler M. Steinlein C. Schmid M. Hanakahi L.A. van Gool A.J. West S.C. Venkitaraman A.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1400-1406PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding how the RecA family of recombinases are regulated is thus of utmost importance. RecA itself provides one level of control. This involves autoregulation mediated by the RecA C terminus (12Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

The RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins have been implicated in the modulation of RecA filament assembly (8Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol.

The RecX protein is an inhibitor of RecA function both in vivo and in vitro (23Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Mol.

The rdgC gene appears to be restricted to the Beta and Gamma subdivisions of the proteobacteria (26Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). During exponential growth, there are ∼1000 dimers of RdgC protein present per cell (26Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), so the cellular concentration is similar to that of the E. coli SSB protein. Deletion of the rdgC gene in nuclease-deficient recBC sbcBC mutant strains is only possible if the RecA and RecF proteins are functional (hence, recombination-dependent growth) (27Ryder L. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RdgC protein is also important in strains lacking PriA, the replication restart protein, because it alleviates a toxic effect of the RecFOR proteins (26Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mutations in SSB also alleviate this toxic effect (26Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because RecFOR are implicated in loading RecA onto SSB-coated DNA, the toxic effect could be due to formation of RecA filaments at inappropriate times or places (26Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is possible that RdgC, like SSB, binds to DNA to prevent RecA filament formation. In vitro, RdgC has been shown to bind both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA, with stronger binding to the duplex DNA (26Moore T. McGlynn P. Ngo H.P. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The results suggest a role for RdgC protein at stalled replication forks. RdgC might interact with RecA, SSB, or any of the other proteins that regulate RecA (RecF, RecO, RecR, DinI, or RecX). To begin an in vitro exploration of the function of RdgC protein, we here investigate the effects of RdgC on RecA function. Enzymes—The E. coli wild-type RecA protein and the RecAΔC17 mutant were purified as described previously (13Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I.

Following a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, 12.7 g of cells was harvested by centrifugation, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. The protein expressed is the native polypeptide, with no protein tags or other additions present. Purification of the RdgC Protein—All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell paste (12.7 g) was thawed and fully resuspended in 80 ml of 25% (w/v) sucrose and 250 mm Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5). Cells were lysed by a 60-min incubation with 40 ml of 5 mg/ml solution of lysozyme in 250 mm Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5), followed by the addition of 50 ml of 25 mm EDTA, sonication, and centrifugation. The cleared lysate was fractionated with 35–70% ammonium sulfate. The RdgC protein was collected from the final cut by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in R buffer plus 1.5 m ammonium sulfate (5 ml per g of cell paste) and loaded onto a butyl-Sepharose column. The column was washed with R buffer plus 1.5 m ammonium sulfate. RdgC was eluted with a linear gradient from R buffer plus 1.5 m ammonium sulfate to R buffer over 10 column volumes. Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, pooled, and dialyzed versus R buffer plus 50 mm KCl. RdgC was loaded onto a Source 15Q column equilibrated with R buffer plus 50 mm KCl and washed with the same buffer. RdgC was eluted with a linear gradient from R buffer plus 50 mm KCl to R buffer plus 500 mm KCl over 10 column volumes. Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, tested individually for nuclease contamination, then pooled and dialyzed into R buffer plus 50 mm potassium acetate. The RdgC protein preparation used in this study was over 98% homogeneous and free of detectable nucleases. The concentration of the purified RdgC protein was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient for RdgC, ∈ = 2.98 × 104 ± 0.15 m–1 cm–1. This extinction coefficient was determined during the present study using a modification of a published procedure (32Marrione P.E. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9809-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), described in detail in the online supplementary material. DNA Substrates—Bacteriophage φX174 circular single-stranded DNA (virion) was purchased from New England Biolabs. φX174 RF I supercoiled circular duplex DNA was purchased from Invitrogen. Full-length linear duplex DNA was generated by the digestion of φX174 RF I DNA (5386 bp) with the XhoI restriction endonuclease, using conditions suggested by the enzyme supplier. The digested DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), followed by ethanol precipitation. Circular single-stranded DNA from bacteriophage M13mp8 (7229 nucleotides) was prepared using previously described methods (33Neuendorf S.K. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

The regeneration of ATP from phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH and followed by the decrease in absorbance of NADH at 380 nm (380 nm wavelength was used so that the signal remained within the linear range of the spectrophotometer for the duration of the experiment). The assays were carried out on a Varian Cary 300 dual beam spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller and a 12-position cell changer. The cell path length and band pass were 1 cm and 2 nm, respectively. The NADH extinction coefficient at 380 nm of 1.21 mm–1 cm–1 was used to calculate the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation, pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 3 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 5% (w/v) glycerol, an ATP regeneration system (10 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 3.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate), a coupling system (1.5 mm NADH and 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase), and 4 μm M13mp8 circular single-stranded DNA. The aforementioned components were incubated for 10 min. The figure legends note the time of addition of wild-type RecA protein (usually 2.4 μm), the RdgC protein (concentration indicated in the figure legends), the SSB protein (0.4 μm when present), and ATP (3 mm). DNA Three-strand Exchange Reactions Promoted by the RecA Protein—Three-strand exchange reactions were carried out in 25 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation, pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, and an ATP regeneration system (10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase and 12 mm phosphocreatine). All incubations were carried out at 37 °C. The following are final concentrations. The wild-type RecA protein, 3 μm, and 21 μm DinI protein (when included) were preincubated with 9 μm φX174 circular ssDNA for 5 min. SSB protein (0.9 μm) and ATP (3 mm) were then added, followed by another 5-min incubation. The reactions were initiated by the addition of φX174 linear dsDNA to 9 μm and after 5-min of incubation, the indicated concentration of RdgC protein was added. The reactions were incubated for 60 min. To stop the reaction, a 10-μl aliquot was removed and added to 5 μl of a solution containing 15% Ficoll, 4% SDS, 0.24% Bromphenol Blue, 0.24% xylene cyanol, and 72 mm EDTA. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels with 1× TAE buffer, stained with ethidium bromide, and exposed to ultraviolet light. Gel images were captured with a digital charge-coupled device camera utilizing GelExpert software (Nucleotech). RecA-promoted LexA Cleavage Assay—Reactions were carried out in 25 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation, pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm potassium glutamate, 3 mm Mg(OAc)2, and an ATP-regeneration system (2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase). The following are final concentrations. All incubations were at 37 °C. The reactions contained wild-type RecA protein (3 μm), φX174 circular ssDNA (9 μm), the SSB protein (0.9 μm, where indicated), ATP (3 mm), and RdgC (concentrations indicated in figure legend). The order of addition varies and is described in the figure legends. The LexA protein (3 μm) was added to start the reaction. All reactions were incubated for 15 min. Laemmli sample buffer (5 μl) was added to 10-μl reactions to stop the reaction. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on 17% acrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—A fluorescently end-labeled single-stranded 30-mer oligonucleotide was purchased and used in these experiments. For one experiment, the labeled DNA was annealed to a complementary unlabeled 30-mer complement to produce a 30-bp blunt duplex oligonucleotide. The annealing reaction contained 1 μm molecules each of labeled and unlabeled DNA, 25 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation, pH 7.4), 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm potassium glutamate, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2 and was placed in a boiling water bath and allowed to cool. The labeled DNA was used at 10 nm in molecules in DNA binding reactions containing 25 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation, pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 3 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 5% (w/v) glycerol. These components were incubated at 37 °C with varying concentrations of RdgC protein or RdgC storage buffer. After 10 min, 10 μl of each reaction was added to 5 μl of loading dye (20% Ficoll and 20 mm Tris-OAc 80% cation), and the reactions were loaded onto a native 10% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis in TBE buffer. Results were read using a Typhoon 9410 Variable Mode Imager by Amersham Biosciences. Sedimentation Equilibrium—To prepare samples for sedimentation equilibrium, an aliquot of RdgC protein was dialyzed at 4 °C into 20 mm Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm potassium acetate. The dialyzed protein was diluted into three batches to final concentrations of 5.7 μm, 11.1 μm, and 19.5 μm using the final dialysis buffer. Centrifugation was at 4 °C in a Beckman Optima XLA Analytical Ultracentrifuge using 1.2-cm double sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces. The protein gradients were recorded at 280 nm every 2–3 h until they were superimposable. Equilibrium data were collected at 6,000, 8,400, 10,600, 13,000, and 16,000 rpm. Non-sedimenting absorbance in each sample was determined by high speed depletion at the end of the run and was <0.025 for all samples. After obtaining the equilibrium data at 16,000 rpm, the rotor was slowed to 10,600 rpm to check for reversibility. The equilibrium gradients were nearly superimposable, indicating no significant loss of protein due to irreversible aggregation at high concentrations. Absorbance in the gradients ranged from ∼0 to ∼1.5, which corresponds to ∼0 to ∼42 μm protein. The partial specific volume and molecular weight of the polypeptide were calculated from the composition as 0.743 ml/g and 33,990. The dialysate density at 4 °C was measured as 1.00351 g/ml using an Anton Paar DMA5000 density meter. The extinction coefficient used was 29800 m–1 cm–1. The data from the three samples at five speeds were globally tested against models of a single species, two and three species in equilibrium, and two independent non-interacting species. In all models the measured non-sedimenting absorbance was included as a fixed parameter. Data analysis utilized programs developed in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR) by Darrell R. McCaslin. Fluorescence Polarization Assays—RdgC protein was serially diluted in fluorescence polarization buffer. The same fluorescently labeled DNA substrates were used as in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The DNA was added to a final concentration of 0.7 nm molecules or 21 nm nucleotides for experiments with single-stranded oligonucleotides and 42 nm nucleotides for duplex oligonucleotides. The anisotropy of the samples was measured using a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization system. The data were analyzed using Curve Expert 1.37 (available at curveexpert.webhop.biz/). For challenge experiments, unlabeled DNA substrates identical to the labeled oligonucleotides were used. RdgC protein diluted in fluorescence polarization buffer was added to 0.7 nm molecules of DNA. After equilibrium binding was reached, 100-fold excess of unlabeled single-stranded or duplex oligonucleotide was added and anisotropy was monitored over time. Electron Microscopy—A modified Alcian method was used to visualize RdgC in the presence of DNA. Activated grids were prepared as described previously (13Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16372-16380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Samples for electron microscopy were prepared by incubating 1 μm RdgC and 4 μm M13mp8 circular ssDNA or 8 μm φX174 ldsDNA, 25 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation) buffer, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm potassium glutamate, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2 for 10 min. All incubations were at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures described above were diluted as indicated in the figure legend with 200 mm ammonium acetate, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The samples were prepared for analysis as described (22Lusetti S.L. Voloshin O.N. Inman R.B. Camerini-Otero R.D. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30037-30046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine if RdgC-bound DNA molecules were extended or condensed relative to naked DNA, molecules were measured from micrographs magnified 52,000 or 42,000 times using the software OpenLab 3.1.7 by Improvision. Five molecules each of RdgC-bound dsDNA and naked dsDNA were measured at least three times each, and these measurements were averaged after normalization for the magnification. Scale bars on the micrographs were used to convert measurements into microns. RdgC Protein Inhibits RecA Protein Activities—We first surveyed the effects of RdgC protein on a series of classic RecA functions. As seen in Fig. 1B, RdgC protein has a potent effect on RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange. In this series of experiments, RdgC was added after RecA filaments had formed on the ssDNA and 5 min after the ldsDNA was added. With 3 μm RecA protein present in this experiment, a sharp reduction in DNA strand exchange products was seen with 0.4 μm RdgC protein, and the generation of products was abolished at 0.8 μm RdgC. Some reaction intermediates were observed even when 16 μm RdgC was present. Additional effects of RdgC on strand exchange are described below. The effects of RdgC on RecA-mediated ATPase activity depends on the order of addition of the proteins in a pattern suggesting a simple competition of RdgC and RecA for DNA binding sites. When RdgC protein is added after RecA filaments have formed on ssDNA, the inhibition is modest and slow to materialize (Fig. 2A). The concentrations of RecA and DNA are somewhat less than those in Fig. 1, yet 20 μm RdgC has little effect on activity in the first few minutes. The inhibition slowly increases with time, suggesting that RdgC is able to replace RecA protein on the DNA as RecA dissociates at filament breaks via end-dependent filament disassembly (23Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Arenson T.A. Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To explain the results, the RdgC binding would have to block the extension of trailing RecA filaments. Alternatively, the RdgC protein could be capping the growing ends of RecA filaments much as RecX protein appears to do (23Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the case of RdgC, the inhibition patterns are most consistent with a simple competition with RecA for DNA binding sites, as is discussed below. When the RdgC protein was added prior to RecA protein, the RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis declined as a direct function of RdgC protein concentration, with the effect saturating at full inhibition above 0.5 μm RdgC protein (Fig. 2B). We suspected that RdgC was excluding RecA from the DNA, but the effects could also reflect a direct inhibitory binding of RdgC to RecA. To determine if the RecA protein was actually free of the DNA and still active, we added excess cssDNA to the above experiment to provide substrate for any free RecA protein to bind. This produced a recovery of ATP hydrolysis to a rate equal to hydrolysis in the absence of RdgC (data not shown), indicating that RecA was free to bind the new DNA and that RdgC was not inhibiting hydrolysis directly by binding the RecA filament. It also indicates that the RdgC protein remained bound to the original DNA and is not interacting with the displaced RecA as it binds the challenge DNA. Because there is 4 μm ssDNA in the experiment shown in Fig. 2B, the saturation of the inhibitory effect of RdgC at 0.5 μm is consistent with a binding site size of ∼8 nucleotides for RdgC, or ∼16 nucleotides for an RdgC dimer. The binding of RdgC protein to M13 cssDNA appears to be sufficiently stable that RdgC is not readily displaced by RecA protein once bound (and vice versa). Note that sub-saturating amounts of RdgC added prior to RecA result in a steady state of RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis, albeit at levels inversely proportional to the added RdgC concentration. This suggests that the RdgC is simply taking up space on the DNA, while RecA can bind and establish dynamic filaments on whatever free DNA is remaining. In contrast, the filament-capping activity of the RecX protein results in more complex kinetics, little indication of direct binding of RecX to DNA, and more evident effects on RecA filaments at much lower RecX concentrations (23Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A similar pattern is seen for RdgC inhibition of the LexA cleavage reaction (Fig. 3). RecA filaments bound to ssDNA promote the autocatalytic cleavage of the LexA protein (36Little J.W.

https://openalex.org/W2161523746,"A short, in-frame deletional mutant (E746-A750del) is one of the major mutant forms of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and has been reported to be a determinant of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. However, the biological and pharmacological functions of mutational EGFR remain unclear. To clarify these biological functions of deletional EGFR, we examined the cellular response to EGF ligand stimulation. Dimerization and phosphorylation of EGFR were observed without any ligand stimulation in the 293(D) cells transfected with deletional EGFR as compared with those transfected with wild-type EGFR (293(W) cells). When the 293(D) cells were exposed to gefitinib, an immunoblotting analysis revealed remarkable inhibition of AKT phosphorylation but not phospho-p44/42 MAPK. To examine the cellular response in a lung cancer cell line intrinsically expressing deletional EGFR, phospho-EGFR, and downstream reactions were monitored under EGF stimulation with a beads-based mulitiplex assay. EGFR and its downstream proteins were constitutively phosphorylated in the PC-9 cells without any ligand stimulation as compared with A549 lung cancer cells expressing wild-type EGFR. In conclusion, deletional EGFR is constitutively active and phosphorylates p44/42 MAPK and AKT in the cells, although the fact that the EGFR phosphorylation in the PC-9 cells is still modulated by EGF stimulation cannot be ignored. Gefitinib-inhibited phospho-AKT predominantly in deletional EGFR expressing cells."

As the oldest extant multicellular animals, sponges are good candidates to have remnants of the molecules responsible for that crucial innovation. Sponge cells associate in a species-specific process through multivalent calcium-dependent interactions of carbohydrate structures on an extracellular membrane-bound proteoglycan termed aggregation factor. Single-molecule force spectroscopy studies of the mechanics of aggregation factor self-binding indicate the existence of intermolecular carbohydrate adhesion domains. A 200-kDa aggregation factor glycan (g200) involved in cell adhesion exhibits interindividual differences in size and epitope content which suggest the existence of allelic variants. We have purified two of these g200 distinct forms from two individuals of the same sponge species. Comparison of allotypic versus isotypic g200 binding forces reveals significant differences. Surface plasmon resonance measurements show that g200 self-adhesion is much stronger than its binding to other unrelated glycans such as chondroitin sulfate. This adhesive specificity through multiple carbohydrate binding domains is a type of cooperative interaction that can contribute to explain some functions of modular proteoglycans in general. From our results it can be deduced that the binding strength/surface area between two aggregation factor molecules is comparable with that of focal contacts in vertebrate cells, indicating that strong carbohydrate-based cell adhesions evolved at the very start of Metazoan history.

This raises the question of whether the species-specific carbohydrates could also have individual-specific structures and interactions, particularly in view of the fact that allotype rejection could be shown in this lowest extant Metazoan phylum (35Fernàndez-Busquets X.

To explore that issue, we have performed force spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies of the self-interactions of MAF and MAF subunits purified from different individual sponges. Dissecting MAF into its active adhesive components has allowed us to track the individual self-binding units down to the circular core of the sunburst-like molecule and further down to the g200 glycan itself. The identification of different allelic-like g200 forms suggests a role for carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions in sponge allogeneic recognition. The results obtained reveal surprisingly high forces and selectivity for this most ancient cell adhesion system and open new perspectives on proteoglycan function-structure relationships. Preparation of Samples and Biochemical Analyses—Specimens of the marine sponge M. prolifera were collected by the Marine Resources Department at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. Isolation of cell surface proteoglycans and purification of the g200 glycan were performed as described previously (37Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). g200 stock solutions were prepared by dissolving ≥10 mg of the purified lyophilized molecule in water. Calcium- and magnesium-free artificial seawater (CMF: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, buffered Ca2+-, Mg2+-free artificial seawater) was made according to the standards of the Marine Biological Laboratory (see www.mbl.edu). MAF rings were prepared according to established protocols (14Humphreys S. Humphreys T. Sano J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1977; 7: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, Alcian blue stainings, Western blots, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were done as described previously (35Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) Imaging and Force Spectroscopy— AFM visualization in air of proteoglycans was done as specified elsewhere (24Jarchow J. Fritz J. Anselmetti D. Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Gerosa D. Burger M.M. Fernàndez-Busquets X. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 132: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Force spectroscopy studies were performed with a Molecular Force Probe one-dimensional microscope (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA). Gold-coated pyramidal Si3N4 tips mounted on triangular 100-μm long cantilevers (k = 0.09 newtons/m) were purchased from Olympus (Tokyo, Japan). The spring constant of every tip was measured individually through the equipartition theorem using the thermal noise of the cantilever (38Florin E.L. Rief M. Lehmann H. Ludwig M. Dornmair C. Moy V.T. Gaub H.E. Biosensors Bioelec. 1995; 10: 895-901Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar) with an absolute uncertainty of ∼10%. For the preparation of gold surfaces we followed the template-stripped gold method (39Hegner M. Wagner P. Semenza G. Surface Sci. 1993; 291: 39-46Crossref Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The biomolecules were attached through their endogenous sulfate groups to gold-coated surfaces and tips by overlaying the surface with or floating the tip on a drop of a solution of the molecule (1 mg/ml for chondroitin sulfate B (CSB) and 0.1 mg/ml for MAF, rings, and g200) in the corresponding solvent (CMF + 2 mm CaCl2 for MAF and H2O for all others) for 1 h, followed by a wash with the respective solvents. Tips so prepared were used immediately and performed well for up to 24 h when washed with deionized H2O and kept dry at 4 °C. Surfaces were stored by floating them on CMF + 2 mm CaCl2, at 4°C, and in these conditions they yielded reproducible results for up to 96 h. For pulling experiments, the gold surface was mounted in the AFM and overlaid with 100 μlofCMF +10 mm CaCl2. The cantilever was manually lowered to the surface, and the AFM was operated such that it moved away from and then toward the sample surface during the course of each pull. Between consecutive pulls the tip was allowed a surface dwell time of 1 s. All of the results presented here were obtained with a pulling velocity of 1 μm/s. For data analysis we used the software provided by the AFM manufacturer (IgorPro version 4.09A, WaveMetrics, Inc.). Peaks were selected manually setting a minimum length threshold of 40 nm and considering only the last adhesion event of force-extension curves except where otherwise indicated. Force peaks below 100 piconewtons (pN) were rare, and thus this value was generally chosen as lower force threshold. Calculations done automatically with different minimum force thresholds between 0 and 100 pN gave results essentially identical to those of the manual analysis. Curves that extended beyond the expected contour length of two fully stretched interacting molecules and force peaks above 1 nanonewton (nN) were not considered, and experiments containing more than 1% of either were discarded. Exceptionally, for data analysis of control experiments we considered all force peaks regardless of their intensity or distance from the contact point. This was justified because the adhesion of the immobilized molecules to gold results in a large peak above 1 nN and less than 40 nm from the contact point. For statistical treatments the Origin 6.0 software package was used. p values were calculated with the Mann-Whitney test. As a consequence of the uncertainty inherent to the cantilever calibration described above, changing the AFM tip between two consecutive experiments might result in significant quantitative variations (up to ±10%) in the mean binding force recorded between any given pair of molecules, whereas changing only the surface did not have such an effect. For this reason p values were calculated always for the comparison of data from consecutive experiments where the tip was maintained and only the surface was changed. SPR Studies—SPR studies were carried out with a BIAcore 1000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using plain gold surfaces in Au sensor chips. When the surface was functionalized with ligand before docking the chip into the SPR system, this was done by depositing on the gold surface of the sensor 40 μl of a solution of the molecule (1 mg/ml for CSB and 0.1 mg/ml for MAF and g200) in the corresponding solvent (CMF + 2 mm CaCl2 for MAF and water for g200 and CSB), followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C in a wet chamber. Before docking the chip was washed extensively with the same solvent in which it was incubated. For each assay 60 μl of analyte solution was injected with a flow of 5 μl/min. Single-molecule Force Spectroscopy of Native MAF Reveals the Existence of Multiple Intermolecular Binding Sites—MAF was bound to gold-coated surfaces and AFM tips by deposition of a 0.1 mg/ml solution of the molecule in CMF supplemented with 2 mm Ca2+ (CMF + 2 mm Ca2+). Binding is provided by the affinity for gold of the sulfate groups present on both g6 and g200 (12Bucior I. Scheuring S. Engel A. Burger M.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Sponge cell aggregation experiments have shown that MAF purified from sulfate-depleted cells had an aggregative activity identical to that of sulfated MAF (40Kuhns W.J. Popescu O. Burger M.M. Misevic G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), indicating that sulfate groups are not involved in MAF self-binding and thus can be confidently used to immobilize the molecule on surfaces without affecting the functional groups. Sulfate accounts for about 4% of MAF by weight (40Kuhns W.J. Popescu O. Burger M.M. Misevic G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), an amount similar to that found in glycosaminoglycans such as CSB (41Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell.2nd Ed. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1989: 805Google Scholar). At the concentration and incubation time used MAF covered the gold surface with a film ∼5 nm thick (Fig. 2A), consistent with the deposition of a single layer of proteoglycans spread out and flat, in agreement with the molecular dimensions shown in Fig. 1A. Incubation with a 0.2 mg/ml MAF solution for an equal time resulted in the deposition of a layer about twice as deep (Fig. 2B), but the surface covering was not improved. Schematically, the setup for our force spectroscopy experiments is depicted in Fig. 2C. For clarity, in the illustration we have represented the molecules standing up. Although most likely several molecules are bound to the tip we assume that on average only one will be participating in the interaction because of the respective mean radii (∼200 nm for MAF and <40 nm for the tip apex). According to the surface molecular density estimated from Fig. 2A (about 30 MAF/μm2), the molecule on the tip can be expected to interact simultaneously with up to 6 MAF molecules on the surface. Single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments performed in this way in CMF supplemented with 10 mm Ca2+ (CMF +10 mm Ca2+) yielded curves with a sawtooth profile (Fig. 3A) consistent with the existence of multiple intermolecular binding sites in MAF interactions (25Dammer U. Popescu O. Wagner P. Anselmetti D. Güntherodt H.J. Misevic G.N. Science. 1995; 267: 1173-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). When all of the force peaks are recorded they group around a maximum below 400 pN, with virtually no peaks beyond 800 pN (Fig. 3B). In controls done with unfunctionalized tips versus functionalized surfaces (Fig. 3C) or vice versa (not shown), force curves exhibited a completely different profile dominated by a strong short range interaction that reflects the binding of MAF to gold (see force-extension curve in Fig. 3C). A histogram representation shows the corresponding Gaussian fit centered at ∼1.3 nN and spreading well beyond 2 nN (Fig. 3D), in good agreement with the reported strength of a sulfur-gold bond (42Grandbois M. Beyer M. Rief M. Clausen-Schaumann H. Gaub H.E. Science. 1999; 283: 1727-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The smaller peak indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3D is attributed to MAF-MAF interactions resulting from molecules that are being ripped off the surface by the gold tip that in this way becomes also functionalized. Rather than visualizing a good surface covering we have chosen as the best control for all the experiments presented in this work the presence of a histogram representation like that in Fig. 3B, lacking the characteristic interaction with gold above 1 nN. Controls were also performed with the objective of blocking any gold surface that could have remained exposed and that might interfere with the MAF self-binding. This was done immediately after MAF deposition by extensively washing away unbound proteoglycan with CMF + 2 mm Ca2+ and overlaying the surface for 30 min with a solution of 6 mg/ml l-cysteine in a buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1 m formate, pH 4.3 (43(1994) BIAapplications Handbook, Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, SwedenGoogle Scholar). The resulting force curves were indistinguishable from those obtained in the absence of the blocking step, and therefore the simplest and less aggressive method (i.e. without blocking) was chosen. The last peak of each pull was similar to all previous peaks in the same curve (Fig. 3A), as expected from an intermolecular polyvalent adhesive interaction. A significantly stronger last peak might reflect the detachment of molecules from the gold surface. The binding efficiency was very high, with more than 95% of approach-retract cycles resulting in adhesion, thus confirming a good surface coverage and the adequate preservation of the activity of the immobilized molecules. To ensure measuring only truly adhesive interactions, data collection from intermolecular adhesion experiments was restricted to the last peak of force curves except where otherwise indicated. The mean forces measured for this last adhesion event varied depending on the individual origin of the molecules between 200 and 300 pN (232 ± 9 pN for the example of Fig. 3E). If the force peaks obtained resulted from g200-g200 interactions and if, as deduced from biochemical evidence, g200 is on the ring of MAF (24Jarchow J. Fritz J. Anselmetti D. Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Gerosa D. Burger M.M. Fernàndez-Busquets X. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 132: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3F), the distance between peaks in a curve should correspond to the distance between g200 attachment points in the ring of the molecule. When the distance between consecutive peaks in MAF force-extension curves is computed, the resulting graph shows maxima at about 20, 40, and 60 nm (Fig. 3G). The observation that 20 is the most abundant value and that 40 and 60 are multiples of it (thus probably resulting from missing peaks rather than from the real spacing between anchoring points) suggests that g200 attachment sites are about 20 nm apart. From good resolution AFM images of MAF taken in air the spacing between g200 glycans on the ring was calculated to be 14 ± 2 nm (24Jarchow J. Fritz J. Anselmetti D. Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Gerosa D. Burger M.M. Fernàndez-Busquets X. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 132: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This discrepancy might reflect a more extended configuration of the molecule in liquid and/or the existence of elastic phenomena that are manifested in force spectroscopy experiments (44Fritz J. Anselmetti D. Jarchow J. Fernàndez-Busquets X. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The length of the curves showed a wide distribution up to ∼800 nm (Fig. 3H), and the number of peaks in a curve seldom exceeded 20, in agreement with interactions of a single molecular pair according to the known dimensions and structure of MAF. Short force-extension curves likely result from interactions between molecules bound tightly to surface and tip, whereas the longest pulls must arise from contacts between molecules that have fewer connections to gold and therefore can be partially lifted during extension. Force curves obtained after deposition on the gold surface of more concentrated MAF solutions (>0.2 mg/ml) could reach a length of several microns (Fig. 3I). These long curves maintained the typical jagged profile (Fig. 3J) and are the consequence of pulling concatamers made up of several MAF molecules. After hundreds of cycles the sawtooth pattern of the curves remained unaltered, indicating repeated zipping and unzipping of the intermolecular bonds. The arms of MAF have a modular structure resulting from the presence of a multiplicity of globular domains (15Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 88-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Jarchow J. Fritz J. Anselmetti D. Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Gerosa D. Burger M.M. Fernàndez-Busquets X. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 132: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the shape of MAF force-extension curves could also be consistent with the unfolding of such intramolecular protein domains (45Rief M. Gautel M. Oesterhelt F. Fernandez J.M. Gaub H.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, force spectroscopy experiments had to be performed with MAF molecules devoid of arms. Single-molecule Force Spectroscopy of MAF Ring Interactions—The arms of MAF, representing about three-fourths of the total mass of the molecule (24Jarchow J. Fritz J. Anselmetti D. Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Gerosa D. Burger M.M. Fernàndez-Busquets X. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 132: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), can be easily eliminated by removing calcium from the medium with a treatment in the presence of 1 mm EDTA (14Humphreys S. Humphreys T. Sano J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1977; 7: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). AFM imaging on mica of ring preparations reveals a characteristic beaded appearance (Fig. 4C), where each of the ∼20 beads in a ring is a MAFp3 unit (24Jarchow J. Fritz J. Anselmetti D. Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Gerosa D. Burger M.M. Fernàndez-Busquets X. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 132: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In hyalectans, the glycosylated link protein interacts with the proteoglycan monomer core protein, which is heavily substituted with glycosaminoglycan chains. In MAF, each glycosylated MAFp3 interacts with one arm that corresponds to the glycosylated MAFp4 protein (15Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 88-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Despite the topological analogy of MAFp3 and the hyalectan link protein, their amino acid sequences do not have significant homology. In high resolution AFM images, structures supposed to represent g200 can be seen as one or two short chains up to 30 nm long protruding from the MAFp3 beads (Fig. 4C, arrowheads). The resulting ring preparations yield reproducible force-distance curves in single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments performed in CMF + 10 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 4, B and D). The maximum length of ring"

Previous studies have been able to distinguish between reversible toxin binding to the membrane and irreversible insertion into the lipid matrix. Membrane lysis occurs as the combined effect of protein insertion plus a transient perturbation of the membrane bilayer structure. In the past, insertion and bilayer perturbation have not been experimentally dissected. This has now been achieved by studying HlyA penetration into lipid monolayers at the air-water interface, in which three-dimensional effects (of the kind required to break down the bilayer permeability barrier) cannot occur. The study of native HlyA, together with the nonlytic precursor pro-HlyA, and of different mutants demonstrates that although some nonlytic variants (e.g. pro-HlyA) exhibit very low levels of insertion, others (e.g. the nonlytic mutant HlyA H859N) insert even more strongly than the lytic wild type. These results show that insertion does not necessarily lead to membrane lysis, i.e. that insertion and lysis are not “coupled” phenomena. Millimolar levels of Ca2+, which are essential for the lytic activity, cause an extra degree of insertion but only in the case of the lytic forms of HlyA.

In addition, a hydrophilic calcium-binding domain, consisting of 15 Gly- and Asp-rich nonapeptides repeated in tandem, characteristic of the RTX (repeats in toxin) family, is found close to the C-end of the protein (7Baumann U.

The presence of amphipathic and hydrophilic domains confers to the protein an overall amphiphilic character, which explains its tendency both to aggregate and to interact with membranes (6Soloaga A.

HlyA is secreted by the bacterium to the extracellular medium as a soluble protein, but upon interaction with a membrane, the toxin becomes inserted in the lipid bilayer, behaving thereafter as an integral membrane protein. This transition from soluble to membrane-embedded protein constitutes an interesting problem in the field of proteinlipid interactions that has been explored in this and other laboratories. The toxin has a lytic effect on pure lipid liposomes (16Ostolaza H. Bartolome B. Ortiz de Zarate I. de la Cruz F. Goni F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1147: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and is able to form ion-permeable channels of large conductance on planar phospholipid bilayers (17Menestrina G. Mackman N. Holland I.B. Bhakdi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Benz R. Schmid A. Wagner W. Goebel W. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 887-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data obtained with photoactivable probes incorporated into the hydrophobic phase of the lipid bilayer indicate that the principal region inserting into the membrane lies within the N-terminal half of the toxin, between residues 177 and 411 (12Hyland C. Vuillard L. Hughes C. Koronakis V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5364-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HlyA interaction with membranes can be reversible (adsorption) or irreversible (insertion). Until now insertion has been operationally identified with membrane lysis. Lysis requires the presence of Ca2+ (8Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goni F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ostolaza H. Goni F.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and a bilayer in the fluid state (20Bakas L. Ostolaza H. Vaz W.L. Goni F.M. Biophys, J. 1996; 71: 1869-1876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two fatty acyl chains, which make part of the mature form of HlyA, are also essential for the lytic effect (21Herlax V. Bakas L. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 122: 185-190Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Lysis, i.e. disruption of the membrane permeability barrier (e.g. hemolysis or efflux of aqueous liposome contents), has been used in the past as proof of toxin insertion into the membrane. However, a conceptual separation of (i) protein insertion and (ii) changes in lipid architecture, leading to the observed release of cell/vesicle contents, has been proposed (6Soloaga A. Veiga M.P. Garcia-Segura L.M. Ostolaza H. Brasseur R. Goni F.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1013-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Ostolaza H. Bartolome B. Ortiz de Zarate I. de la Cruz F. Goni F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1147: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As a further step in the study of the HlyA membrane insertion process, we have examined the interaction of this toxin with lipid monolayers extended over an air-water interface. Lipid monolayers are a useful tool in the study of lipid-protein interactions (22Marsh D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 183-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 23Maget-Dana R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 109-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 24Brockman H. Curr. Opin. Struct.

In particular, the monolayer technique allows the direct observation of the insertion phenomenon separated from further changes in lipid architecture. This occurs because, by design, the monolayer cannot undergo three-dimensional membrane restructuring that would be essential to alter the membrane permeability barrier. Thus the lipid monolayer studies allow a further dissection of the insertion process, as separated from the membrane lytic event(s). Our results with native and mutant toxins show that high levels of insertion can occur even in the case of mutants that are totally nonlytic, i.e. that insertion is independent from lysis. However, Ca2+, which is essential for lysis to occur, does favor a further degree of insertion, only for the lytic variants of the toxin. Materials—Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and egg phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, UK). Cholesterol was supplied by Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 8-Aminonaphthalene-1,2,3-trisulfonic acid (ANTS) and p-xylene bis(pyridinium bromide) (DPX) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Purification of Wild Type and Mutant HlyA Proteins—Wild type HlyA and mutant HlyA proteins were purified as described previously for the wild type (25Netz R.R. Andelman D. Orland H. J. Phys.

Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyran (final concentration 0.5 mm) was then added, and expression was allowed to occur for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended in “TES buffer” (10 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0) and stored at –20 °C overnight. The cells were thawed at 37 °C and treated with lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml), 2.5 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in “lysis buffer” (1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0). Cell lysis was allowed to occur for 45 min in an ice bath, followed by 25 sonication cycles (15 s of sonication at 12 μm amplitude + 25 s at rest) in a Soniprep 150 MSE probe sonicator. The suspension was centrifuged at 18,000 × g (20 min, 4 °C), and pro-HlyA inclusion bodies, recovered in the pellet, were resuspended in “TU buffer” (6 m urea, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0). The sample in TU buffer was then applied to a DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 0–150 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Flow rate was 1 ml/min, and 5-ml fractions were collected. Pro-hemolysin eluted at 35 mm NaCl. The purified proteins were stored at –20 °C in 35 mm NaCl, 6 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Large Unilamellar Vesicles—Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) made of egg phosphatidylcholine:egg phosphatidylethanolamine:cholesterol (2:1:1) were prepared by extrusion through polycarbonate filters (Nuclepore, Pleasanton, CA), pore size 0.1 μm. Buffer was 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The diameter of the resulting vesicles was of ∼100 nm, according to quasi-elastic light scattering measurements. More details on the preparation of these vesicles can be found in Mayer et al. (28Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Release of Liposomal Contents—Leakage of vesicular aqueous contents was assayed with ANTS and DPX entrapped in the liposomes according to Ellens et al. (29Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). LUV were prepared in 70 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mm DPX, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Nonentrapped probes were removed passing the LUV through a Sephadex G-75 column, eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Assays were performed at 100 μm lipid in a total volume of 1 ml, with continuous stirring at 25 °C. Buffer was as above, with the addition of 10 mm CaCl2. The assay was started by adding 10 μg/ml (96 nm) HlyA or mutant proteins. ANTS fluorescence was recorded continuously (λex = 355 nm; λem = 520 nm). When leakage reached equilibrium, Triton X-100 was added (final concentration 0.1% w/v) to induce 100% release. Percent release was computed as shown in Equation 1,&x0025;release=(Ff-Fo)(F100-Fo)×100(Eq. 1) where Ff, F100, and Fo were, respectively, the fluorescence intensity values observed after addition of HlyA, after addition of Triton X-100, and before any addition. Lateral Pressure Measurements—Lateral pressure experiments were carried out with a MicroTrough S system from Kibron (Helsinki, Finland) at 25 °C and under constant stirring. The aqueous phase consisted of 1.0 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The lipid, dissolved in chloroform:methanol (2:1), was gently spread over the surface until the desired initial surface pressure was attained. The protein was injected with a micropipette through a hole connected to the subphase. The increment in surface pressure versus time was recorded until a stable signal was obtained. The figures show one of two closely similar independent measurements. HlyA Adsorption at the Air-Water Interface—HlyA tendency to self-aggregate and its affinity for lipid bilayers strongly suggest that the toxin is a surface-active molecule (5Soloaga A. Ramirez J.M. Goni F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6387-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Ostolaza H. Bartolome B. Ortiz de Zarate I. de la Cruz F. Goni F.M. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is confirmed by its behavior in the Langmuir balance. HlyA injection in the aqueous phase leads to a rapid, dose-dependent increase in the lateral pressure at the air-water interface, which is interpreted as protein adsorption at the interface. Adsorption at an interface is the characteristic property of surface-active or interface-active substances (31Adamson A.W. Physical Chemistry of Surfaces.6th Ed. Wiley Interscience, New York1997: 390-422Google Scholar). The time course of interface adsorption of HlyA can be seen in Fig. 1. The phenomenon is concentration-dependent, with both the rate of increase in surface pressure (dπ /dt) and the maximum increase of surface pressure (Δπ) increasing with HlyA concentration. Note that when referring to “maximum increase of surface pressure” we only mean an operational value, i.e. the value at which the surface free energy does not further change by more than 1 mn/m in 5 min, after start the experiment. Fig. 2 summarizes the change in Δπ as a function of HlyA concentration. The increase in surface pressure appears to reach a plateau value of ∼25 mn/m at ∼50 nm HlyA (see summary of data in Table 1). Identical results are obtained in the presence and absence of Ca2+ showing that this cation, which is essential for the membrane lytic activity of HlyA (8Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goni F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar), does not modify the surface-active properties of the protein at an air-water interface.FIGURE 2Maximum increase in lateral pressure caused by HlyA adsorption at an air-water interface.

Open table in a new tab HlyA Insertion in a Lipid Monolayer at the Air-Water Interface— HlyA is known to insert irreversibly into fluid lipid bilayers in the presence of Ca2+ (20Bakas L. Ostolaza H. Vaz W.L. Goni F.M. Biophys, J. 1996; 71: 1869-1876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HlyA is also able to insert into lipid monolayers extended at an air-water interface, at an initial surface pressure π i ≥25 mn/m, as seen in Fig. 3. The experiment shown in Fig. 3 was performed with a monolayer containing egg phosphatidylcholine, egg phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol at a 2:1:1 mol ratio, extended at the air-water interface of a Langmuir balance at an initial surface pressure π i = 25 mn/m. The lipid composition was chosen because it allows a high lytic activity when the toxin is applied to liposome preparations (16Ostolaza H. Bartolome B. Ortiz de Zarate I. de la Cruz F. Goni F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1147: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The protein (96 nm) is injected into the subphase, in the presence or absence of 10 mm Ca2+. In the absence of calcium, the change in surface pressure at equilibrium (Δπ) is smaller than when calcium is present (Fig. 3). The same trends are observed at different HlyA concentrations, between 10 and 150 nm, or different initial surface pressures, between 25 and 35 mn/m (not shown). The total change in lateral pressure Δπ decreases linearly with π i, both in the presence and absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4), but changes are consistently larger in the presence of Ca2+, with a difference in Δπ i of ≈2 mn/m. Essentially similar results are obtained when HlyA is allowed to insert into pure egg PC, instead of the PC:PE:Ch monolayer (Fig. 4, inset). Above a certain π i value insertion is no longer observed. Extrapolation of the Δπ versus π i lines to Δπ = 0 provides the so-called critical lateral pressure π c or π i above which no protein insertion occurs. π c values for wild type HlyA are 34.6 and 37.3 mn/m, respectively, in the absence and presence of Ca2+ (see summary of data in Table 1). These values are above the usually accepted average value of ∼30–35 mn/m for the lateral pressure of lipid monolayers in the cell membranes (22Marsh D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 183-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 24Brockman H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), in agreement with the known ability of HlyA to insert into those membranes. The plus/minus Ca2+ difference in Δπ can be measured at varying Ca2+ concentrations. A Ca2+ titration curve is shown in Fig. 5, together with the Ca2+ dependence of HlyA-induced vesicle leakage (leakage data taken from Ref. 9Cortajarena A.L. Goni F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23223-23229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is interesting that a plateau for Δπ is reached at ∼100 μm Ca2+, because this is precisely the Ca2+ concentration required for optimum lytic activity of HlyA (8Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goni F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayer Insertion of HlyA Variants—A number of HlyA mutants and variants, whose activity on red blood cells and liposomes has been tested in our laboratory, were used in monolayer insertion experiments. The HlyA precursor pro-α-hemolysin (pro-HlyA) differs from the mature protein only in that it lacks the two fatty acyl residues in Lys-564 and -690. It does not cause hemolysis or liposome efflux of aqueous contents (27Soloaga A. Ostolaza H. Goni F.M. de la Cruz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Its behavior in the Langmuir balance is very different from that of the mature protein (Fig. 6); maximum Δπ at the air-water interface is lower, by about 5 mn/m (Fig. 6A), and in the case of pro-HlyA, Ca2+ has the effect of decreasing Δπ by ∼ 2 mn/m. However, the main difference between the precursor and the mature protein is that the former is virtually unable to insert into the lipid monolayer, either with or without Ca2+ (Fig. 6B). An HlyA mutant has been constructed (9Cortajarena A.L. Goni F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23223-23229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in which His-859 has been replaced by Asn, using site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting mutant HlyAH859N is totally inactive, both on red blood cells and on liposomes, presumably because of its high tendency to aggregate. A Δπ versus π i plot (Fig. 7) shows again important differences with the wild type (Fig. 4). π c is higher, as is Δπ at comparable surface pressures, suggesting an increased capacity of the mutant over the wild type to insert into membranes, and Ca2+ has no effect (Table 1). It is interesting that this mutant, with a very high capacity to become inserted into cell membranes, judging from its high π c, is totally inactive because of its high self-aggregation properties (i.e. low free-monomer concentration). An additional mutant contains two substitutions, namely Asp instead of His-859 and Gly instead of Asp-863 (HlyA H859D/D863G). This mutant differs from the wild type in that it requires Ca2+ concentrations 2 orders of magnitude higher (≈20 mm) to achieve a similar degree of lytic activity (10Cortajarena A.L. Goni F.M. Ostolaza H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The Δπ versus π i plot of this mutant is very similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 8 and Table 1), except that a higher Ca2+ concentration is required. Fig. 8A shows that, at the air-water interface, the behavior of the protein is similar in the presence of either 10 or 50 mm Ca2+. Larger Δπ values are observed in the absence of Ca2+, particularly at low protein concentrations. The inset in Fig. 8B demonstrates that the insertion of H859D/D863G into a lipid monolayer in the presence of 50 mm Ca2+ is similar to that of the wild type in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+. Furthermore, Fig. 8B shows that monolayer insertion of the double mutant in the absence of Ca2+ is clearly lower than that of the WT under the same conditions (Figs. 8B and 4, compare open symbols). A Ca2+ titration experiment is depicted in Fig. 9, in which the plus/minus Ca2+ difference in Δπ is plotted as a function of Ca2+ concentration in the subphase. A plateau is observed above 20 mm Ca2+, and again the Ca2+ dependence of Δπ happens to parallel precisely the Ca2+ dependence of the lytic activity of this mutant (10Cortajarena A.L. Goni F.M. Ostolaza H.

Leakage data are redrawn from Fig. 1B in Cortajarena et al. (10Cortajarena A.L. Goni F.M. Ostolaza H.

After an apparent lag time (”induction time“(32Cornec M. Cho D. Narsinham G. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1999; 214: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Xia X.F. Wang F. Sui S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1515: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar)), a steep increase is observed, whose slope is interpreted as the rate constant k of protein adsorption or insertion (33Xia X.F.

In turn, the lag time indicates a cooperative facilitation of the toxin penetration process as the initial insertion proceeds, which is shortened with the increase of toxin concentration in the subphase.TABLE 2Rate constants (k) of HlyA (wild type and variants) insertion into lipid monolayers at the air-water interfaceProteinInitial pressure πiRate constants k × 1040 mm Ca2+10 mm Ca2+mn/ms-1HlyA0aAdsorption was to the air-water interface.104 (0.99)108 (0.99)HlyA25bInsertion into a PC:PE:Ch (2:1:1 mole ratio) monolayer extended at the indicated πi.58.7 (0.98)43.1 (0.99)HlyA30bInsertion into a PC:PE:Ch (2:1:1 mole ratio) monolayer extended at the indicated πi.42.9 (0.90)32.9 (0.98)Pro-HlyA0aAdsorption was to the air-water interface.117 (0.99)94.9 (0.99)H859N0aAdsorption was to the air-water interface.48 (0.99)53.1 (0.99)H859N30bInsertion into a PC:PE:Ch (2:1:1 mole ratio) monolayer extended at the indicated πi.19.9 (0.93)88.6 (0.94)H859D/D863G0aAdsorption was to the air-water interface.60.1 (0.99)46.5 (0.99)cExperiments in the presence of 50 mm Ca2+.H859D/D863G28bInsertion into a PC:PE:Ch (2:1:1 mole ratio) monolayer extended at the indicated πi.NDdThe experimental data could not be properly fit to the equation.55.1 (0.95)cExperiments in the presence of 50 mm Ca2+.a Adsorption was to the air-water interface.b Insertion into a PC:PE:Ch (2:1:1 mole ratio) monolayer extended at the indicated πi.c Experiments in the presence of 50 mm Ca2+.d The experimental data could not be properly fit to the equation.

Packaging of the double-stranded DNA of bacteriophages into the viral capsid relies on a molecular machine consisting of several proteins: the portal pore, which is located at one vertex of the capsid, and the terminases. The latter are implicated, first, in bringing the DNA concatemers to the empty prohead through interaction with the portal protein, then in active ATP-driven translocation of the DNA into the capsid, and, finally, in cutting the concatemer to generate the mature viral DNA (1Feiss M. Catalano C. Viral Genome Packaging Machines.in: Catalano C. Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 5-39Google Scholar). Terminases are generally described as hetero-multimeric structures consisting of two subunits. The small regulatory subunit binds to the viral DNA, and the large catalytic subunit carries both an endonuclease activity for DNA cleavage and an ATPase activity required for DNA packaging (2Earnshaw W.C.

Mutagenesis studies have shown that the endonuclease activity of phage λ is located within the C-terminal half of the terminase large subunit (gpA; 73 kDa) (17Hwang Y. Catalano C.E. Feiss M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Several mutations affecting this region, among which one was located on Asp-401, were shown to inactivate the endonuclease activity (16Davidson A.R. Gold M.

The C-terminal regions of terminases characterized so far share neither a sequence motif nor sequence similarities with any other known protein family. This sequence divergence makes difficult a clear delimitation of the endonuclease domain and a definition of its active site. No relationship with endonucleases already characterized at the structural level was described yet. Indeed, the numerous endonucleases studied so far adopt a great variety of folds ranging from all α to all β, including various α/β and α+β folds, but show no common sequence motifs (19Nishino T.

The recent sequencing of the bacteriophage T5 genome (GenBank™ accession numbers AY692264, AY734508, and AY543070) prompted us to search for new sequence structure-function relationships in terminases. The T5 genome is a linear double-stranded DNA of 121,750 bp that contains large direct terminal repeats of ∼10,000 bp (20Rhoades M. Rhoades E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 69: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Wang J. Jiang Y. Vincent M. Sun Y. Yu H. Bao Q. Kong H. Hu S. Virology. 2005; 332: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Its replication proceeds via concatemeric intermediates (22Everett R.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1981; 52: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but the processing pathway of T5 concatemers as well as the mechanism of DNA encapsidation remain unknown. The presence of unusually extensive terminal redundancies and of site-specific single-stranded interruptions (23McCorquodale J.D. Warner H.R. The Viruses.in: Calendar R. 1. Plenum Press, New York1988: 439-476Google Scholar) in the mature as well as in the concatemeric DNA (22Everett R.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1981; 52: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) makes T5 an interesting model of DNA packaging. Here we report an extended bioinformatics analysis of the endonuclease region of double-stranded DNA phage terminases that reveals new sequence similarities shared by this region and the Holliday junction resolvase RuvC and to a lesser extent by the HIV integrase and the ribonuclease H. This analysis is further validated by in vivo and in vitro functional studies of the endonuclease domain of bacteriophage T5 terminase. Bionformatic Procedures—The PSI-BLAST program (24Altschul S.F.

Protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI Entrez data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez). Their accession numbers are given in the legend of Fig. 2A. Fold compatibility for the full-length and truncated sequences of the terminases SPP1, T4, and T5 was searched using 3DPSSM (25Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol.

Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), SCWRL (31Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Karplus M. J. Mol.

Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), and the validity of the resulting models was evaluated with PROSA (33Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar) and Verify3D (34Eisenberg D. Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). Sequence-structure alignments including various terminases and PDB1HJR (see alignment in Fig. 2A) were manually refined with the help of the program ViTO (35Catherinot V. Labesse G. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 3694-3696Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Improved three-dimensional models were built for the T5 terminase using MODELLER 6.2 with the loop optimization procedure. Secondary structure assignments were performed using DSSP (36Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12257) Google Scholar). Cloning Procedure—The gene encoding the terminase large subunit was identified from the complete genome sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY692264). The Endo-Term 3The abbreviations used are: Endo-term, endonuclease domain of phage T5 terminase; Ni-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetate; WT, wild type; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus. domain, delimited between amino acids 191 and 438, was amplified by PCR using T5 DNA as a template. The oligonucleotides used for PCR were complementary to the coding sequence of the Endo-Term gene fragment over 6 codons at both 5′- and 3′-ends and contained additional bases to create a XhoI and a BamH1 restriction site at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene fragment, respectively. The amplified Endo-Term PCR fragment was cloned into the vector pET15b (Novagen), between the XhoI and BamH1 restriction sites of the multicloning site, to generate an N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged Endo-Term domain. Three mutated Endo-Term gene fragments were constructed with the following changes in the sequence: D286N, D342N, and D425N. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the kit “Expand High Fidelity PCR System” from Roche Applied Science according to the method of Ansaldi et al. (37Ansaldi M. Lepelletier M. Mejean V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 110-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The sequences of the mutated Endo-Term gene constructs were verified by sequence analysis in the pET15b plasmid. Protein Expression, Purification, and N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLys-S cells were used for overproduction of the wild type and the mutated endonuclease domains. Cells containing the various pET15b constructs were grown at 28 °C to an A600 of 0.4 in Luria Bertani medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml). Overexpression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm). Purification of the proteins was conducted at room temperature as follows. The induced cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g, 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl) and subjected to the French press procedure at 15,000 p.s.i. After centrifugation (30000 × g, 30 min), the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA Superflow affinity resin (Qiagen). The His-tagged proteins were eluted with 1 m imidazole and loaded onto a HR 10/30 Superose 12 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. The proteins were eluted with the same buffer. They were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE (12%) and stained with Coomassie blue. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed after transfer of the protein bands to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The concentration of the proteins was determined using a value of the molar extinction coefficient of 39070 m-1 cm-1. In Vivo Nuclease Assay—Cells containing the various pET15b constructs were grown to an A600 of 0.4 as described above. 1-ml aliquots of the cultures were withdrawn prior to induction and 60, 120, and 180 min after induction. Each aliquot was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was used to isolate the DNA by the alkaline lysis procedure. The DNA was further purified using the Quick purification kit Nucleospin; Macherey-Nagel. 10 μl of DNA were run on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel. In Vitro Nuclease Assays—All assays were performed soon after elution of the purified proteins from the gel filtration column to avoid their proteolysis. Purified proteins (36 μl; 0.2 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C with purified phage T5 DNA (4 μl; 0.32 mg/ml) in the presence of MgCl2 (5 mm). 10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after the beginning of the reaction. Nuclease activity was stopped by addition of EDTA (10 mm). DNA cleavage was followed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel. The nuclease activity of the purified proteins was also assessed from fluorescence measurements using the DNA intercalant YO-PRO-1 (38Boulanger P. le Maire M. Bonhivers M. Dubois S. Desmadril M. Letellier L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14216-14224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (1 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide; Molecular Probes). The dye was 1000-fold diluted in a 1-ml cuvette containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 μg of T5 DNA. The purified proteins (200 μg) were then added. The fluorescence intensity was monitored at 30 °C as a function of time on a Varian fluorimeter with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 491 and 509 nm, respectively. Bioinformatic Analysis of Terminase Sequences—The T5 genome encodes a putative 49-kDa large subunit terminase, and the latter was used as a representative member of the terminase family together with those of bacteriophages SPP1 and T4 (10Kanamaru S. Kondabagil K. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40795-40801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35311-35319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A sequence similarity search using the program PSI-BLAST (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59725) Google Scholar) and the large subunit of the T5 terminase as a query only hit several terminase sequences at convergence. This search also confirmed a higher level of homology at the N terminus (residues 1-165) and a higher divergence at the C-terminal part (residues 170-438). We further searched for structural similarities using the full-length terminases of bacteriophages SPP1, T4, and T5 as queries. Among the 5-fold recognition servers used, four highlighted strong similarities (>95% certainty) to ATP-dependent helicases and related ATPases. Highly significant scores were computed by mGenThreader and FUGUE for phages T4 and T5 terminases (see supplementary materials at www.infobiosud.cnrs.fr/bioserver/TER/suppl.html). However, the detected similarities covered only roughly one half of the terminase sequences. No significant hit corresponded to the C-terminal half. However, analysis of the full-size protein sequence could hide other structural and functional relationships that the C-terminal part might share with other proteins. Delimitation of the C- and N-terminal regions was therefore undertaken starting from the above similarity searches and from additional fold-compatibility searches. To further confirm and refine the proposed structural alignments, sequence analyses were performed with the N terminus and the C-terminal sequences, separately. According to sequence comparisons, the N-terminal region corresponds to an ATPase domain. It possesses characteristic Walker A (Motif, gXXXGKs where “X” stands for any amino acid and small and capital letters represent mostly present and strictly conserved amino acids, respectively) and Walker B (Motif, ////DE where “/” stand for a hydrophobic residue) Mg-ATP binding motifs and an ATPase-coupling motif (motif III). These motifs are located at positions 62-68, 150-155, and 184-186 in the T5 terminase (Fig. 1). This signature is present in most terminases (11Rao V.B. Black L.W. Viral Genome Packaging Machines.in: Catalano C. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 40-58Google Scholar, 39Mitchell M.S. Matsuzaki S. Imai S. Rao V.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4009-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 40Mitchell M.S. Rao V.B. Virology. 2004; 321: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and is related to the ATP binding signature of helicases (41Parris W. Rubinchik S. Yang Y.C. Gold M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13564-13574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (notably the particular Walker B motif////DEad). The minimal ATPase region should encompass these motifs, and sequence-structure comparisons using the full-length terminases suggested that the N-terminal domain is roughly 160 residues in length. Fold-compatibility searches using the derived N-terminal region revealed the same trends: highly significant similarities (e-values below e-4 corresponding to >95% certainties) were observed with various helicases despite a rather low level of sequence identity (∼15%). Molecular modeling using MODELLER (32Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) was performed to analyze the proposed structural alignment and to precisely delimit the helicase-like ATP-binding domain of the terminases (data not shown). It suggested that the ∼160 residues of the N-terminal domain could form a stable and functional ATP-binding domain autonomously. Fold-recognition searches were then performed using the C-terminal region from distinct terminases. No significant score for any known structure was observed in the various runs performed using PSI-BLAST, in agreement with previous studies. On the contrary, fold-recognition using the metaserver @TOME suggested distant relationships with various structures, among which were some endonucleases (see supplementary materials at www.infobiosud.cnrs.fr/bioserver/TER/suppl.html). However, the compatibility scores were rather weak, and most structural alignments seemed to match only to the very C terminus (residues 270-438). The searches were resumed with shorter sequences according to the primary matches. In addition, the 14 top-scoring sequence-structure alignments were systematically tested using the automatic procedure available on the @TOME server. Promising three-dimensional models were observed for the C-terminal domain of the T5 and T4 phage terminases with scores ranging between -0.45 and -0.65 in PROSA and 0.25 and 0.35 in Verify3D. However, the overall sequence identity was low (∼10% over 150 residues). In most cases the models were built using three structurally related templates: a resolvase RuvC (PDB1HJR), a ribonuclease H (PDB1IO2), and two retroviral integrases (PDB1A5V and PDB1B9D). These four proteins possess a similar catalytic domain sharing a common topology (α/β) and the same enzymatic mechanism (42Yang W. Steitz T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 131-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Among these enzymes, resolvase RuvC appeared to be the most closely related to the terminases (data not shown). Resolvases were used for further alignment refinement and validation of the structural comparison. The first sequence-structure alignments including various terminases and the resolvase RuvC (PDB: 1HJR, see alignment in Fig. 2A) were manually refined and used to build new three-dimensional models for the T5 terminase. The resulting model (Fig. 2B) appeared significantly better and more satisfactory, taking into account the low level of sequence identity (PROSA score below -1.0 versus -1.2 for the template PDB 1HJR; verify3D score above 0.32 and 0.35, respectively). These results supported the proposed structural alignment of the catalytic domain of resolvases with the C-terminal endonuclease domain of the terminases. Furthermore, two sequence motifs (/g/D/g and dX/DXXXXX/) corresponding to the active site of RuvC resolvases (residues 5-10 and 139-148, respectively) are conserved in the terminases (in T5, residues 283-288 and 422-431, respectively). This suggested a potential functional homology and also enabled us to delimit more precisely the C-terminal domain (residues 281-438). To further confirm this new relationship, the sequence motifs containing two putatively catalytic aspartates were refined using the program PATTINPROT (43Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Extensive sequence comparison and motif refinement led us to a specific sequence signature (see alignment in Fig. 2A) of the resolvase-terminase subfamily with a highly significant e-value of 4.4e-11. This signature contains three well conserved acidic residues (aspartates 286, 342, and 425 according to the T5 terminase numbering). They are equivalent to the residues of the Holliday junction resolvase (PDB 1HJR) that form a catalytic triad requiring divalent cations (Mg2+ or Mn2+) for activity (44Rice P. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 45Nowotny M. Gaidamakov S.A. Crouch R.J. Yang W. Cell. 2005; 121: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). This local sequence and overall fold conservation suggested that the terminases possess a similar endonuclease domain sharing a common enzymatic mechanism with resolvases. To validate this proposal, we expressed the wild type T5 endonuclease domain and three recombinant proteins in which each of the predicted catalytic aspartates was substituted by an asparagine and measured their endonuclease activity. Expression of Endo-term, the Endonuclease Domain of Phage T5 Terminase: Mutations of the Three Predicted Catalytic Aspartates Abolish in Vivo Endonuclease Activity—The constructs used (respectively, named WT, D286N, D342N, D425N Endo-term) were delimited between amino acids 191 and 438 and contained an additional N-terminal hexahistidine sequence. The recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS to lower their basal expression and subsequent toxicity. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction resulted in an immediate arrest of growth of the bacteria carrying the WT Endo-term plasmid but only slightly affected the growth of those carrying the D286N, D342N, D425N mutations. Aliquots of the cells were taken at different times after induction and tested for protein expression. Although the level of expression of WT Endo-term appeared significantly lower than that of the mutated proteins (data not shown), its nuclease activity was higher. Indeed, WT Endo-term expression resulted in cleavage of the corresponding pET15b-derived plasmid and of the genomic DNA (see below), generating a complex mixture of DNA fragments that migrated as a characteristic smear on agarose gels (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). The DNA was totally cut at t = 180 min (lane 4). On the contrary, the plasmids harboring each of the conservative mutations D286N, D342N, or D425N showed no sign of degradation over 180 min (lanes 6-8, 10-12, 14-16). These results suggested that mutation of the conserved aspartate residues strongly affected the in vivo endonuclease activity of the proteins. To validate these results and to determine how the mutations affected the nuclease activity, we purified the four proteins and determined their in vitro endonuclease activity. Purification and in Vitro Endonuclease Activity of the WT, D286N, D342N, and D425N Endo-term Proteins—All four proteins, expressed as described above, were found in the supernatant of cells centrifuged after a French pressure treatment. They were purified to near homogeneity by successive passage on an affinity column and on a gel filtration column as described. WT Endo-term migrated at an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa, corresponding to that expected for the cloned DNA fragment (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 5). The protein underwent limited proteolysis with time. A single product with molecular mass of 25 kDa was obtained after 72 h (Fig. 4, lane 7). Sequencing indicated that the protein was missing its N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Because proteolysis resulted in a shift of the molecular mass from 31 to 25 kDa this indicated that the cleavage had essentially occurred in the C-terminal region. The release of these 6 kDa results in a loss of the critical aspartate 425 and is also likely to affect the protein fold, explaining why the proteolyzed protein showed no nuclease activity when assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The purified D286N, D342N, and D425N Endo-term proteins showed a pattern of time-dependent proteolysis similar to that of WT Endo-term (data not shown). Further functional assays were therefore only performed on freshly prepared proteins that were retained on the Ni-NTA column. Each of the four proteins was mixed with phage T5 DNA in a one:one protein:nucleotide molar ratio. Aliquots were taken at given times, and DNA cleavage was followed on agarose gel. Fig. 5A, lanes 5-8, shows that WT Endo-term efficiently cut T5 DNA in less than 60 min. DNA cleavage by the three mutants was slower: D286N and D425N Endo-term showed the same activity and cut the DNA in less than 180 min (lanes 9-12 and 17-20). D342N Endo-term showed the lowest nuclease activity, and the DNA was only slightly cut after 180 min (lanes 13-16). In all cases was the cut nonspecific, confirming that the smear observed in the in vivo assay corresponded to small pieces of E. coli genomic DNA. Endonuclease activity had an absolute requirement for divalent cations (MgCl2 or MnCl2) because it was not observed in the absence of these cations or arrested by addition of an excess of EDTA (data not shown). The decreased activity of the mutated proteins compared with the wild type protein was not due to a misfolding of the proteins because all four proteins retained the same content of secondary structure as judged by their circular dichroism spectrum (data not shown). Endonuclease activity was further quantified by measuring the dependence with time of the DNA intercalant YO-PRO1 fluorescence, which is enhanced upon binding to DNA and decreased when the DNA is cut by nucleases (38Boulanger P. le Maire M. Bonhivers M. Dubois S. Desmadril M. Letellier L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14216-14224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fig. 5B highlights the difference in nuclease activity of the four proteins. The t1/2 of endonuclease activity was 14 and 50 min for the WT and D342N Endo-term proteins, respectively, and 30 min for both the D286N and D425N Endo-term proteins. This unambiguously demonstrated that the aspartate mutations affected nuclease activity and that all three substitutions were not equivalent. In this study we have used a combination of bioinformatics and biochemical analysis to precisely define the catalytic residues involved in the endonuclease activity of the large subunit of tailed phage terminases. Extensive sequence comparisons led to the conclusion that, despite primary sequence divergence, terminases including those of phage T7, P1, λ, P22, SPP1, T1, P2, T4, and T5 contain three well conserved aspartate residues that are equivalent to the residues of the Holliday junction resolvases and, to a lesser extent, the HIV integrase and ribonuclease H. The role of these residues in the endonuclease activity of the terminase large subunits was attested by functional assays performed on phage T5. From sequence comparisons and from the known location of the functional domains of phage T4 (10Kanamaru S. Kondabagil K. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40795-40801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and λ terminases (16Davidson A.R. Gold M. Virology. 1992; 189: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 46Hwang Y. Feiss M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we could delimit the endonuclease domain (Endo-Term) of the T5 terminase. Expression of the plasmid-encoded corresponding protein resulted in in vivo cutting of both plasmid and genomic DNA. Such in vivo nuclease activity was considerably reduced by mutating each of the critical conserved aspartate residues (respectively D286N, D342N, and D425N). Further purification of the corresponding expressed proteins confirmed the role played by the aspartate residues and allowed determination of the relative nuclease activity of the proteins: WT Endo-term showed the highest nuclease activity, and the activity of D286N and D425 was about half that of WT Endo-term. Finally, D342 showed the lowest nuclease activity. The defect in DNA cleavage activity was not due to misfolding, because all four proteins retained the same content of secondary structure. The endonuclease activity of the proteins had an absolute requirement for divalent cations (mainly Mg2+ or Mn2+) in agreement with that found for the nuclease domain of phage λ terminase (1Feiss M. Catalano C. Viral Genome Packaging Machines.in: Catalano C. Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 5-39Google Scholar) and for Holliday junction resolvases, among which is the E. coli protein RuvC (47Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A divalent metal cation is also a cofactor required for the catalytic activity of the proteins belonging to the integrase/ribonuclease-H superfamily (45Nowotny M. Gaidamakov S.A. Crouch R.J. Yang W. Cell. 2005; 121: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). All these proteins have similar active sites containing three to four catalytic carboxylate-bearing residues (44Rice P. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that phage endonucleases and these proteins share a common catalytic mechanism in which the acidic residues are involved in the coordination of the metal required for the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond. Does such a mechanism explain the differences observed in the nuclease activity of the three mutated proteins? According to the model shown in Fig. 2B, Asp-286 and D425N are located in the vicinity of the aspartate 291 residue so that chelation of the metal might occur via this third aspartate if any of the two others is mutated. As a result, some of the nuclease activity would be restored. On the other hand, the nuclease activity would not be restored by mutation of Asp-342 because this residue lies too far away from any other aspartate to permit chelation. Exhaustive mutagenesis experiments have allowed critical amino acids involved in the endonuclease activity of phage T4 and λ terminases to be defined (15Rentas F.J. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Davidson A.R. Gold M. Virology. 1992; 189: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Hwang Y. Catalano C.E. Feiss M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In particular, it was shown that residue Asp-401 (which corresponds to Asp-286 in T5) from phage T4 and λ terminases was absolutely required for in vivo and in vitro DNA cutting activity, but not for in vitro packaging of the phage genome. On the basis of the T5 data and given the high conservation of the three-aspartate motif (among which is Asp-401 from λ and T4) (see Fig. 2A), we propose that the aspartate residues are required, and sufficient, to promote the endonucleotidic activity of phage T4 and λ terminases. Therefore phage endonucleases share the same catalytic activity independently of whether DNA cleavage is sequence specific as in λ or nonspecific as in T4. Altogether, our results suggest that bacteriophage-encoded terminases share a conserved endonuclease domain that is distantly related to the resolvase/integrase/ribonuclease-H superfamily and that behaves as a properly folded and independent domain. The interplay between the nuclease and packaging domains starts to be understood in the case of phage T4 (10Kanamaru S. Kondabagil K. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40795-40801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and λ (7Dhar A. Feiss M. J. Mol.

The recent sequencing of the T5 genome has allowed identification of the genes encoding the different partners of the encapsidation machinery.

In detergent-solubilized membranes from HeLa cells expressing both γ and CHIF or CHIF and hemagglutinin A-tagged CHIF, mixed complexes of CHIF and γ or CHIF and hemagglutinin A-tagged CHIF with α/β subunits are undetectable. This implies that the α/β/FXYD protomer is the major species in detergent solution.

In detergent-solubilized HeLa cell membranes, dibromobimane cross-links wild-type CHIF to α but not the C49F mutant, and also the corresponding F36C mutant but not wild-type γb, and F48C but not wild-type PLM. C140S, C338A, C804A, and C966S mutants of the α subunit have been expressed. Only the C140S mutant prevents cross-linking with CHIF. The data demonstrated the proximity of trans-membrane segments of CHIF, γ, and PLM to M2 of α. Molecular modeling is consistent with location of the trans-membrane segment of all FXYD proteins between M2, M6, and M9 and the proximity of Cys-49 of CHIF or Phe-36 of γ with Cys-140 of M2.

The Na+,K+-ATPase actively transports Na+ and K+ ions across cell membranes and is responsible for maintaining the normal trans-membrane gradients of Na+ and K+ ions. As could be expected for a protein with such a central physiological role, Na+,K+-ATPase is closely regulated at several levels. A unique mode of regulation of the Na+,K+-ATPase has been described recently, involving interactions between the α/β complex and the FXYD proteins (1Therien A.G. Pu H.X. Karlish S.J. Blostein R. J.

The FXYD family consists of seven short single-span trans-membrane proteins (extracellular N terminus), named after the conserved FXYD motif in the extracellular segment (5Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The FXYD proteins show a tissue-specific expression pattern. For example, γ is expressed in kidney, CHIF 4The abbreviations used are: CHIF, corticosteroid hormone-induced factor; PLM, phospholemman; HA, hemagglutinin A; DOPC, 1,2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine; DOPS, 1,2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] or dioleoyl phosphatidylserine; C12E10, polyoxyethylene(10)dodecyl ether; DB, dibromobimane; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; NHS-ASA, N-hydroxylsuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acid; DST, disuccinimidyl tartrate; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. in kidney and colon, PLM in heart and skeletal muscle, and FXYD7 in brain. In kidney γ is expressed as two splice variants, γa and γb (5Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 6Kuster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X.

Six members of the family, FXYD1 (PLM), FXYD2 (γ), FXYD3 (Mat-8), FXYD4 (CHIF), FXYD5 (related to ion channel), and FXYD7, are now known to interact specifically with the Na+,K+-ATPase and to alter the pump kinetics in characteristic and different ways (2Geering K.

Thus, the working hypothesis is that FXYD proteins function as tissue-specific modulators of Na+,K+-ATPase, which adjust its kinetic behavior to the special needs of the given tissue, cell type, or physiological state (3Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar, 4Garty H. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev.

Functional interactions between the γ subunit and the Na+,K+-ATPase have now been studied extensively. The γ subunit has been found to raise the apparent affinity for ATP, shifting the E1-E2 conformational equilibrium toward E1 (9Therien A.G. Karlish S.J. Blostein R. J. Biol.

Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes and whole HeLa cells with a membrane potential of -50 mV or more hyperpolarized, γ somewhat raises extracellular K+ affinity (13Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H.

Biol. 2005; 204: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Exposure of cultured renal cells to hyperosmotic solutions has been reported to be associated with a significantly reduced Vmax value of Na+,K+-ATPase in parallel with induction of expression of γ, and the effect is blocked by silencing γ expression with small interfering RNA (15Wetzel R.K. Pascoa J.L. Arystarkhova E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41750-41757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By contrast, however, transfection of γ into Xenopus oocytes or HeLa cells is not associated with significant effects on Vmax values (13Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Zouzoulas A. Dunham P.B. Blostein R. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 204: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In renal microsomes isolated from γ knock-out mice, the major effect appears to be that on the cytoplasmic Na+ affinity (16Jones D.H. Li T.Y. Arystarkhova E. Barr K.J. Wetzel R.K. Peng J. Markham K.

CHIF raises the apparent affinity for cell Na+ by 2-3-fold, the reverse effect to that of γ (13Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.D. Geering K.

The opposite functional effects of CHIF and γ on the apparent Na+ affinity are consistent with their different patterns of expression along the nephron and physiological roles (reviewed in Refs. 2Geering K. Beguin P. Garty H. Karlish S. Fuzesi M. Horisberger J.D. Crambert G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. News Physiol.

The structural interactions of FXYD proteins with α/β subunits are not well understood, but information is accumulating (4Garty H. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; (August 25)10.1146/annurev.physiol.68.040104.131852Google Scholar). Structure-function studies have supplied good evidence for multiple sites of interaction involving both trans-membrane segments and the extra-membrane domains. Based on a series of γ-CHIF chimeric molecules in which extracellular, trans-membrane, and cytoplasmic sequences were interchanged, the stability of the FXYD-α/β complex in detergent and the effects on the apparent Na+ affinity were found to be determined by the origin of the trans-membrane segment (18Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Lubarski I. Karlish S.J. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18738-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The latter conclusion was confirmed in a study showing that peptides corresponding to the trans-membrane segment of γ reduce apparent Na+ affinity of the α/β complex in HeLa cell membranes (19Zouzoulas A. Therien A.G. Scanzano R. Deber C.M. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40437-40441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In summary, trans-membrane segments mediate the effects of γ and CHIF on cation affinities, whereas the extra-membrane segments mediate the effect of γ on apparent ATP affinity. On the basis of cryoelectron microscopy of renal Na+,K+-ATPase, the γ subunit helix was proposed to lie in a groove bound by M2, M6, and M9 of the α subunit (20Hebert H. Purhonen P. Vorum H. Thomsen K. Maunsbach A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 479-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A denaturation study also suggested that γ might interact in the M8 to M10 region (21Donnet C. Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7357-7365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A role for M9 of the α subunit has been inferred from the effects of mutants in M9 on the stability of α/β-γ, α/β-CHIF, or α/β-FXYD7 complexes, and the functional consequences of the mutations have been studied in Xenopus oocytes (22Li C. Grosdidier A. Crambert G. Horisberger J.D. Michielin O. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38895-38902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Modeling of the FXYD helix was consistent with docking in the groove between M2, M6, and M9 in the α subunit. In a recent study we have used covalent cross-linking to obtain direct evidence for proximities between the γ subunit and α and β subunits of pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase and in HeLa cells expressing rat α and γ subunits (23Fuzesi M. Gottschalk K.E. Lindzen M. Shainskaya A. Kuster B. Garty H. Karlish S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18291-18301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The inferred position of the α-γ cross-links was at Lys-54 and Lys-55 in the cytoplasmic domains of γ and Lys-347 of α (pig γ and α1 numbering), which lies in the cytoplasmic stalk S4 emerging from M4. This site of cross-linking in the cytoplasmic stalk overhangs the groove between M2, M6, and M9 and supports the proposed location of the trans-membrane segment. Based on the cross-linking and other data on α-γ proximities, we modeled interactions of the trans-membrane α-helix and an unstructured cytoplasmic segment SKRLRCGGKKHR of γ with a homology model of the pig α1 subunit. According to the model, the trans-membrane segment fits in a groove between M2, M6, and M9, and the cytoplasmic segment interacts with loops L6/7, L8/9, and stalk S5. Because the model in Ref. 23Fuzesi M. Gottschalk K.E. Lindzen M. Shainskaya A. Kuster B. Garty H. Karlish S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18291-18301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar is based on limited information, its major value is that it provides a framework for further experimentation designed to test its predictions and to modify it as necessary. One objective of this study has been to obtain more direct evidence for the location of the trans-membrane segment of the FXYD by using primarily a hydrophobic cysteine-cysteine cross-linker, dibromobimane, with a range of 3.2-6.6 Å (24Kosower E.M. Kosower N.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Kim J.S. Raines R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 174-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Green N.S. Reisler E. Houk K.N. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The experiments utilize HeLa cells expressing rat α1 subunit and γ, CHIF, PLM, or the appropriate mutants. A related objective of this study has been to define the stoichiometry of α/β/FXYD interactions by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Previously, we showed that α/β subunits of purified renal Na+,K+-ATPase or renal microsomal membranes could be co-immunoprecipitated with either γa or γb but not both γa and γb and similarly with either CHIF or γ but not with both CHIF and γ (17Garty H. Lindzen M. Scanzano R. Aizman R. Fuzesi M. Goldshleger R. Farman N. Blostein R. Karlish S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F607-F615Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Garty H. Lindzen M. Fuzesi M. Aizman R. Goldshleger R. Asher C. Karlish S.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A possible problem with the experiment with CHIF and γ is that CHIF and γ are largely expressed in different nephron segments, and thus membranes must have been derived from different cell types. Thus, the current series of experiments have been analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation assays whether different FXYD proteins, expressed in the same HeLa cells, interact simultaneously with α/β subunits. Together, the experiments provide information on the likely stoichiometric ratios of α/β:FXYD and the location of the trans-membrane segment of FXYD proteins. Part of these data have been published previously in an abstract form (28Lindzen M. Fuzesi M. Garty H. Karlish S.J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126 (Abstr. 117): 51aGoogle Scholar). DNA Manipulations—The coding regions of rat CHIF, γa, γb, and PLM were subcloned into the BamHI/BstXI site of the mammalian expression vector pIRES-hyg (Clontech). This vector has an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that enables translation of the cloned cDNA and the hygromycin-resistant gene from a single RNA species. Thus, a better correlation is achieved between hygromycin resistance and high level expression of the desired protein. For transfection of more than one FXYD protein, the second round of transfection utilized a pIRES vector that confirms puromycin resistance (pIRES-P, kindly provided by Dr. S. Hobbs, Royal Cancer Hospital). Hemagglutinin A (HA) and His10 tags were introduced in the C termini (between the last amino acid and the stop codon) of CHIF and rat α1, respectively. The tags were added by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides, and the modified constructs were subcloned into pIRES-P (CHIF) and pcDNA-3 (α1) vectors. A pig β1 subunit tagged in its N terminus with His10 (29Cohen E. Goldshleger R. Shainskaya A. Tal D.M. Ebel C. le Maire M. Karlish S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16610-16618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was excised from the pGAPZa vector (Invitrogen) and subcloned into to pIRES-P. Point mutations were introduced in FXYD proteins and the α1 and β1 subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase by PCR using overlapping primers. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Transfection and Selection of HeLa Cells—HeLa cells overexpressing the rat α1 subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase (HeLa-α1, kindly provided by Dr. J. B Lingrel, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine) were transfected with FXYD constructs by Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Colonies stably expressing various FXYD constructs were selected in 400 μg/ml hygromycin B, and membranes were tested for protein expression by Western blotting. HeLa-α1 cells expressing different wild-type and mutated FXYD proteins (CHIF, γb, and PLM) were transfected with the His10-β construct in pIRES-P, and colonies expressing His10-β were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin. For co-expression of two different FXYD proteins, single colonies expressing rat α1 and CHIF were transfected with constructs containing γb or HA-CHIF cloned into pIRES-P, and transfectants were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin. HeLa cells expressing six histidine-tagged rat α1 and its mutants were selected at 1 μm ouabain. This concentration of ouabain fully blocks the endogenous (human) but not the transfected (rat) pump. Immunoprecipitation Assays—HeLa cell membranes were suspended in a buffer containing 25 mm imidazole and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and either 20 mm Tris·HCl, 20 mm NaCl plus 0.1 mg/ml oligomycin (incubated for 25 min at room temperature), or 10 mm RbCl plus 5 mm ouabain (incubated for 20 min at room temperature). Membranes were solubilized at 0 °C by adding C12E10 to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml (unless otherwise indicated) and a final protein concentration of ∼0.5 mg/ml. The detergent-solubilized membranes were centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected, and Tris·HCl, NaCl, or RbCl was added to a final concentration of 100 mm.An ∼40-μg aliquot of protein was removed (total protein samples), and the rest was subjected to immunoprecipitation. Total protein samples were delipidated by adding 4 volumes of methanol/ether (2:1) and incubation at -20 °C overnight. The suspensions were spun down, and the pellets were dried and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For immunoprecipitation (17Garty H. Lindzen M. Scanzano R. Aizman R. Fuzesi M. Goldshleger R.

Physiol. 2002; 283: F607-F615Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the detergent-solubilized proteins (∼300 μg) were incubated for 4 h at 4°C with an appropriate antibody (anti-α(6H), anti-γC, anti-CHIF, anti-HA, at 1:50 dilutions). Protein A-Sepharose was added (50-μl volumes of washed and preincubated beads), and the suspensions were further incubated with swirling overnight at 4 °C. The beads were sedimented and washed three times in the original imidazole/EDTA buffer plus Tris·HCl, NaCl, or RbCl plus 0.2 mg/ml C12E10. They were suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on 10% Tricine gels together with 40-μg aliquots of the total delipidated membrane proteins. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters in CAPS buffer plus 10% methanol (12 V, 1.4 h). The immunoblots were carried out using polyclonal antibodies to the C termini of α (anti-KETYY, 1:3,000), CHIF (1:1,000), HA (1:10,000), or γ (anti-γC 1:1,000).

Dibromobimane-induced Cross-linking—Colonocyte membranes were solubilized with 0.25 mg/ml C12E10 in a medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml oligomycin. Renal Na+,K+-ATPase and cardiac membranes were solubilized in similar solutions, but containing 1 or 1.5 mg/ml C12E10, respectively. Unsolubilized protein was removed by centrifugation. The soluble protein was treated with 1-2 mm dibromobimane, added in 3 aliquots each time for 20 min. In some cases the protein was diluted a further 10-fold with the solubilization buffer before addition of the dibromobimane. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 mm dithiothreitol. Protein was precipitated by addition of 2% SDS and 4 volumes of methanol/ether (2:1 v/v). HeLa cells expressing the rat α1 subunit were stably transfected with His10-tagged β subunit and wild-type or mutant FXYD proteins (CHIF, γ, or PLM). Alternatively, HeLa cells expressing rat CHIF were transfected with His6-tagged rat wild-type or mutant α1 subunits. Membranes were solubilized in 2 mg/ml C12E10 in the presence of 25 mm imidazole, 10 mm RbCl, and 5 mm ouabain. Na+,K+-ATPase complexes were bound to Ni-NTA beads by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed twice with 10 volumes of the solubilization buffer containing also 0.3 mg/ml of DOPC/DOPS (2:1 w/w) and then 30 mm imidazole to remove contaminant proteins. The washed beads were then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and another hour at room temperature with 0.02 mm DB or diluent. The beads were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride paper, and the bands were visualized in immunoblots using the appropriate antibodies (anti-CHIF, anti-γC, or anti-PLM, respectively). Cross-linking Induced by NHS-ASA, DST, and EDC—C12E10-solubilized or intact colonocyte membranes were treated with NHS-ASA, DST, and EDC as described for renal Na+,K+-ATPase (23Fuzesi M.

In the case of NHS-ASA the intact colonocyte membranes were first reacted in the dark at pH 9.5, and then the membranes were solubilized with 0.25 mg/ml C12E10 in a medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml of oligomycin, prior to illumination with UV light. Modeling the α-FXYD Interaction—The trans-membrane domains of γ and CHIF were positioned manually between the helices M2, M6, and M9 of a homology model of the rat α1 subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase. The homology model was obtained as described previously (23Fuzesi M. Gottschalk K.E. Lindzen M. Shainskaya A. Kuster B. Garty H. Karlish S.J. J. Biol.

For both γ and CHIF, three different starting conformations with identical backbone but varying side chain conformations were generated. From each starting conformation, 100,000 structures were generated by randomly rotating the helix 0-360° around the long axis, translating it -3 to +5Å toward or away from the center of the bundle, respectively, translating the helix ±10 Å along its long axis, and tilting the CHIF helix relative to the fixed angles of the TM helices of the α1 subunit by ±20°. The coordinate transformations were done using the program package CNS parameter set (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Each such generated conformation was subjected to 50 steps of Powell minimization, and the interaction energy of the FXYD helix with the α1 subunit was calculated. A dielectric constant of 20 was used for the electrostatic interactions. The rotation was sampled in 1° bins and the tilt in 0.1° bins, and the longitudinal and translational shifts were sampled in 0.1 Å bins. The average energy of each bin was evaluated independently by using Boltzmann averaging of all conformations within this bin. A similar procedure has been shown to reliably model four helix bundles (36Gottschalk K.E. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2004; 23: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 37Gottschalk K.E.

Co-immunoprecipitation of FXYD Proteins with α/β Complexes— Figs. 1 and 2 document the results of immunoprecipitation experiments, which indicate the possible stoichiometric ratios of rat α/β subunits with or without co-expressed rat CHIF, HA-tagged CHIF, or γ in detergent-soluble complexes isolated from HeLa cells. To obtain cultures expressing two FXYD proteins, single colonies of transfected cells expressing CHIF were grown and then transfected with γb or HA-CHIF in pIRES-P, and colonies were selected in hygromycin plus puromycin and grown. This procedure ensures that all the cells of the transfected culture express both CHIF and either γb or HA-CHIF and that both FXYD proteins are exposed to α/β subunits and to each other in the cellular context. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were done with HeLa cell membranes dissolved in C12E10 in the presence of Rb+ plus ouabain, conditions that we have shown previously to optimize the yields of co-immunoprecipitated α/β and FXYD proteins (17Garty H. Lindzen M. Scanzano R. Aizman R. Fuzesi M. Goldshleger R. Farman N. Blostein R. Karlish S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F607-F615Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For the experiment of Fig. 1, the detergent-solubilized membranes from HeLa cells expressing CHIF and γ together, or CHIF or γ alone, were immunoprecipitated with anti-γC or anti-CHIF or with monoclonal antibody, which recognizes an epitope near the N terminus of the α subunit (6H). The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were probed with either anti-CHIF or anti-γC. γ is expressed as two bands as observed previously in HeLa cells (referred to as γb and γb′ (11Pu H.X.

The result is quite clear-cut. Although antibody 6H immunoprecipitates both CHIF and γ, and both anti-γ and anti-CHIF immunoprecipitate α, anti-CHIF immunoprecipitates CHIF but not γ, and anti-γ immunoprecipitates γ but not CHIF. Thus the experiments do not detect significant amounts of mixed complexes containing both CHIF and γ. Judging by the amounts of total (T) and immunoprecipitated protein applied to the gels, and the intensity of the chemiluminescent signals, the efficiency of co-immunoprecipitation of CHIF or γ with α is about 1-2% of the total CHIF and about 5% of total γ, similar to efficiencies observed previously (17Garty H.

However, the endocytic pathways of luminal antigens involved in underlying MHC class II presentation by CECs remain unknown. Our aim was to elucidate antigen trafficking and associated MHC class II expression in CECs of CD patients in vivo. In CD patients (Crohn's colitis and remission) and healthy controls undergoing colonoscopy, ovalbumin (OVA) was sprayed onto inflamed or healthy mucosa. The subcellular localization of OVA and MHC class II was visualized in biopsies taken from OVA-incubated mucosa using fluorescence and cryoelectron microscopy. Targeting of OVA into late endosomes of CECs was found in healthy (controls and CD in remission) and inflamed mucosa (Crohn's colitis). MHC class II expression in CECs was not detected in healthy mucosa but strongly up-regulated during CD inflammation. Induced MHC class II in CECs was predominantly seen at basolateral membranes and in late endosomes, which were efficiently accessed by internalized OVA. Our data provide in vivo evidence that the endocytic pathway of luminal antigens in CECs of Crohn's colitis patients intersects MHC class II-enriched late endosomes and support the postulated role of CECs in MHC class II-associated antigen presentation during CD."

This Essay explores how classical approaches such as forward genetics fit into this emerging framework. Systems biology has become a fashionable label for a new generation of large-scale experiments. This Essay explores how classical approaches such as forward genetics fit into this emerging framework. There is little doubt that we are witnessing the arrival of the era of systems biology. There is a feeling that something important is going on that may shift the intellectual and experimental landscape on which we stand. Not that we are sure yet precisely what systems biology is. Preliminary definitions either highlight the conceptual aspects of studying complex biological systems (e.g., Kirschner, 2005Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2005; 121: 503-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) or focus more on the technical approaches of large-scale data acquisition and integration (e.g., Liu, 2005Liu E.T. Cell. 2005; 121: 505-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In any case, systems biology has the flavor of something far removed from the gory details of standard molecular biology. We are told that systems biologists see a bigger and more holistic picture, and that the reductionist approach (studying complex systems by investigating only their isolated components) may soon become old fashioned, boring, and perhaps even a little embarrassing. Although it is true that looking at a biological problem from a larger perspective is intuitively interesting, the current excitement about systems approaches to biological problems raises a number of important issues. There appear to be certain types of approaches that are viewed as synonymous with the notion of systems biology. Large-scale molecular measurements and computational modeling are key elements of a systems biology experiment. Other methods, such as large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screens, have also become associated with systems biology. One approach that is conspicuous by its absence is forward genetics (the unbiased screening for genetic mutations causing a phenotype of interest). Whereas leading geneticists continue to remind us of the past achievements of the genetic approach and of the promises that genetic toolboxes hold for future research (Nagy et al., 2003Nagy A. Perrimon N. Sandmeyer S. Plasterk R. Nat. Genet. 2003; : 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Gregan et al., 2005Gregan J. Rabitsch P.K. Sakem B. Csutak O. Latypov V. Lehmann E. Kohli J. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1663-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), one generally fails to find serious consideration of forward genetics in discussions of systems biology. Indeed, it is not uncommon to hear speakers at systems workshops and symposia refer to moving from a genetics approach to a systems approach. This observation is closely related to the perception that systems biology is here to replace the so-called traditional reductionist strategies. In reflecting on these considerations, we would like to raise the following question: how holistic are large-scale molecular experiments, and what is the nature of the relationship between forward genetics and systems biology? To answer these questions, we would like to briefly consider three topics: (1) the timing of the transition from gene discovery to systems biology, (2) the idea of systems biology as an alternative to a reductionist scientific landscape, and, most importantly, (3) the relationship between forward genetics, quantitative molecular biology, and the systems concept. The first consideration is rather trivial, as revealed by the following thought experiment. Currently, mutations in less than 25% of all genes have been phenotypically characterized in multicellular model organisms such as the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila, and the mouse. Let us consider the example of the fruit fly genome. Assume that, starting in January 2006, the first characterizations of fly mutants are reported for 50 new fly genes every month. At this unrealistically rapid rate, January 2021 will have passed well before all remaining fly genes are described (and that's assuming only one publication per gene). Clearly, the era of gene discovery is far from over. This does not mean that the time for an integrative systems approach is not ripe; quite the contrary. Geneticists—perhaps more than biochemists, physiologists, and cell biologists—have been keepers of the myth of the gene as the holy grail of biology. As molecular genetics took center stage, biological processes often became the context in which to understand the function of a given gene, rather than the other way round. Thus, the experimental questions asked and the conclusions drawn became rather gene centric. When thinking at the systems level, geneticists should accept that genes only matter because they are one of many cellular codes. No single gene is more or less important than any other, and the loss of function of gene x causing phenotype X is not itself an interesting observation. It is only interesting if we can begin to quantitatively explain how gene x interacting with genes w, y, and z together produce phenotype X in context A but not in context B, and what predictive value this interaction has on the system. From this perspective, the synergistic combination of quantitative molecular biology, forward genetics, reverse genetics, and computational modeling constitutes systems biology (e.g., Gunsalus et al., 2005Gunsalus K.C. Ge H. Schetter A.J. Goldberg D.S. Han J.D. Hao T. Berriz G.F. Bertin N. Huang J. Chuang L.S. et al.Nature. 2005; 436: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Our second consideration relates to the perception that, as the star of system biology rises, that of reductionism must fade. Curiously, however, it is not a great achievement per se to approach a given problem more holistically. Most visionaries of the past are forgotten because their grand ideas and books became useless once the pedestrian way of experimental science revealed their incompatibilities with the facts of nature. Science remains the art of the solvable. Traveling the systems road, we must constantly ask ourselves how appropriate the big picture is and how adequate the systems approach is to the level of the question we are trying to answer. The fundamentally new characteristic of systems biology is its way of thinking, rather than its way of doing. Systems thinking realizes that the phenotype of a system (from the shape of a cell to an evolutionary stable strategy) is the emergent property of the interactions among all of the components of this system. Thus, it is neither the scale of the system nor the particular approach used to arrive at a list of its functional components that defines a systems approach. In fact, perhaps paradoxically, for research driven by this concept to succeed, it may be necessary first to isolate a reduced system to provide an experimentally testable hypothesis. For example, to understand the molecular changes that occur in a cell upon binding of a ligand to its receptor, most quantitative biologists largely query well-defined in vitro cell culture systems, which do not necessarily reflect the in vivo responses of a complex developing system. Thus, for the time being, the practical (as opposed to the conceptual) translation of systems biology is much better referred to as large-scale reductionism. A further complication is that every system can be described at numerous levels, but only very few of these are relevant to a useful understanding of the system. To give an example, the early universe, a car engine, and a boa constrictor are all products of quantum interactions of subatomic particles. Yet a quantum description of these interactions is only useful for one of the three systems: it can neither tell us if the engine is working nor what the snake had for lunch. Richard Dawkins refers to this necessary feature of scientific inquiry as “hierarchical reductionism” (Dawkins, 1986Dawkins R. The Blind Watchmaker.1st Edition. Norton & Company, New York1986Google Scholar). So, although large-scale measurements are imperative for a comprehensive description of the system, the level at which both measurements and integration occur must vary depending on the system being studied and the question being asked. Our third consideration questions the assumption that if systems biology is holistic, then genetics is reductionist. Let us first have a closer look at the “omics” approach. It is now possible to measure, with increasing precision and in some cases in real time, the molecular constituents of a system and their variations across a series of dynamic phenotypic changes. These measurements are collectively referred to as “omics” (as in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and so on). But not every “omics” experiment is systems biology. It depends on the question. If the purpose of a microarray experiment, for example, is to identify a few target genes for a transcription factor and then validate the “most promising candidates,” then this is not systems biology. If, on the other hand, the purpose is to describe the global transcriptional response of the cell to changes in the level, localization, or sequence of the transcription factor and then ask how the new molecular conditions created in the cell interact to produce the phenotype, then that is systems biology. Thus, the tools put constraints on the task at hand, but they do not define it. So, what about the genetic approach? We argue that the assumption that genetics, and especially forward genetics, is a reductionist approach is simply erroneous. Like a microarray experiment, a genetic screen is not itself reductionist or holistic. It is the use of the genetic toolbox that defines its outcome. It seems that, by mistaking the “omics” wave for the systems approach itself, we are forgetting some of the most influential systems approaches of the past: when Christiane Nusslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus (Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980Nusslein-Volhard C. Wieschaus E. Nature. 1980; 287: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (3016) Google Scholar) targeted the whole Drosophila genome using random mutagenesis to unravel the riddle of embryonic pattern formation, they were doing systems biology. Other classical examples include the Drosophila screens of Seymour Benzer (for example Hotta and Benzer, 1972Hotta Y. Benzer S. Nature. 1972; 240: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and the C. elegans screens of Sydney Brenner (for example, Hodgkin and Brenner, 1977Hodgkin J.A. Brenner S. Genetics. 1977; 86: 275-287PubMed Google Scholar). How conceptually different is a genome-wide forward genetic screen from genome-wide RNAi screens (reviewed in Friedman and Perrimon, 2004Friedman A. Perrimon N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)? Today, mouse RNAi screens and proteomics measurements can only be done in vitro. As such, is a forward genetic screen for behavioral defects in the living mouse not at least as much, if not more, relevant to systems biology? In general, a genetic screen addresses the following questions: what is the total number of components required to build a given phenotype (system) and what is the contribution of each of these components to the phenotype? To answer these questions, genetics assumes (correctly) that perturbation of these components should result in some change in the expression of the phenotype. Furthermore, our ever-increasing capacity to visualize and quantify subtle and dynamic phenotypes—from cell shape to behavior—in live animals means future genetic screens will provide an unprecedented wealth of physiologically relevant information. Genetics is not only compatible with systems biology, it is a corner stone of any useful form of it. But if all it takes to remain fashionable is a fresh label, “Forward Genetomics” might do nicely."

Nature. 1978; 271: 501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar) and are now known to be important for generating diversity in RNA and proteins in animal cells. Analyses of the completely sequenced genomes of vertebrates (such as humans, mice, and fish) and invertebrates (such as the fruit fly and nematode) have shown that the former contain a larger number of introns per gene (5.2–7.9) than the latter (3.1–5.5) (Lynch, 2005Lynch M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; (Published online November 9, 2005.)https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msj050Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Using completely sequenced animal genomes along with those of plants and fungi, researchers have attempted to discern which of the following two hypotheses is true. The first is the gain-of-introns hypothesis, which states that the genome of the last common ancestor of arthropods (for example, insects) and deuterostomes (for example, vertebrates) was intron poor and then gained introns during the evolution of its vertebrate descendants (Rogozin et al., 2003Rogozin I.B. Wolf Y.I. Sorokin A.V. Mirkin B.G. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1512-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The second is the loss-of-introns hypothesis, which states that the genome was intron-rich and then lost introns in the evolutionary lineage leading to arthropods (Roy and Gilbert, 2005Roy S.W. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 1986-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To decide which hypothesis is correct would require obtaining many partial or complete genome sequences, especially from invertebrates. However, until recently, the invertebrate genomes used in the computational analyses were primarily from only two phyla—arthropods and nematodes—both of which are intron poor. Moreover, these lineages represent only a fraction of all animal phyla (see Figure 1A ). In a recent paper in Science, Raible et al., 2005Raible F. Tessmar-Raible K. Osoegawa K. Wincker P. Jubin C. Balavoine G. Ferrier D. Benes V. de Jong P. Weissenbach J. et al.Science. 2005; 310: 1325-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar provide a glimpse into the intron composition of the phylum Annelida by sequencing a total of 2.3 megabases of the genome of the segmented worm Platynereis dumerilii and by predicting 30 gene transcripts. These transcripts contain an average of 7.8 introns, very similar to the number seen for homologous genes in humans (8.4 introns per gene), and the highest yet found in any invertebrate (assuming that the remainder of the annelid genome yields a similar number). Given that both of the two debated hypotheses of animal phylogeny (see Figures 1B and 1C) place annelid worms closer to arthropods than to deuterostomes, there are only two ways that the annelid could have an intron-rich genome: (1) It was retained from the last common ancestor of arthropods and deuterostomes, or (2) it acquired the higher number of introns secondarily. To determine which explanation is more likely, the authors scored the number of shared introns between the genes of the marine annelid and other animals. An intron was considered to be shared if it was found in the same amino acid position and the same codon position (the same intron phase). Interestingly, annelid genes shared more than 60% of introns with the human genome but fewer than 30% with the other invertebrate genomes examined (those of the honey bee, fruit fly, and nematode). This observation supports the idea that intron richness is an ancient trait that has been preserved in the marine annelid genome. It also provides experimental support for the recent conclusion that a large number of introns in living animals are quite old (Roy and Gilbert, 2005Roy S.W. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 1986-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The reason why this marine annelid retained introns when some other invertebrates lost most of them remains a mystery. Raible et al., 2005Raible F. Tessmar-Raible K. Osoegawa K. Wincker P. Jubin C. Balavoine G. Ferrier D. Benes V. de Jong P. Weissenbach J. et al.Science. 2005; 310: 1325-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar also found that Platynereis shows a slow rate of protein sequence evolution, but, at present, it is unclear whether the high intron retention is causally related to a lower rate of protein evolution. The phylogenetic scenario assumed by Raible et al., 2005Raible F. Tessmar-Raible K. Osoegawa K. Wincker P. Jubin C. Balavoine G. Ferrier D. Benes V. de Jong P. Weissenbach J. et al.Science. 2005; 310: 1325-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar is the Ecdysozoa hypothesis, which postulates that nematodes and arthropods are close relatives (see Figure 1C). This hypothesis proposes that introns were lost in the Ecdysozoan common ancestor. The competing Coelomata hypothesis instead assumes that nematodes branched from the animal tree before the split of arthropods and deuterostomes (see Figure 1B). Under this scenario, introns were lost independently in the lineage leading to nematodes and the lineage leading to arthropods. On the other hand, if the last common ancestor of arthropods and deuterostomes was intron poor (e.g., Rogozin et al., 2003Rogozin I.B. Wolf Y.I. Sorokin A.V. Mirkin B.G. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1512-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), a different scenario of intron gain and loss would need to be postulated. However, current inferences about the evolution of introns are at best tentative because virtually no information exists about intron content for a vast majority of animal phyla and major clades. The sampling of species from each group is meager, and our ability to reliably map the intron gain and loss on ancestral evolutionary lineages is highly limited. A case in point is the observation that the tunicate Ciona, a deuterostome, contains far fewer introns per gene than its closest relatives (fish and human). If its genome were the only one available for deuterostomes, we would have erroneously inferred that deuterostomes lost introns early in their evolutionary history. Finally, the observation of intron loss in several independent lineages of animals may be an indication that the increased number of alternatively spliced gene products in the cell, afforded by an increased intron content, was not the prelude to a higher phenotypic complexity of animals. Perhaps, as suggested by Lynch and Conery, 2003Lynch M. Conery J.S. Science. 2003; 302: 1401-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, the evolution of introns is attributable to smaller population sizes of bigger (more complex) organisms. This allows introns to escape natural selection and to become fixed in the genome without initially having an adaptive role. In this case, the complexity and diversity of advanced animal body plans arose independently of the intronic enrichment of their genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2070684778,"With stringent U.S. federal restrictions on funding for human embryonic stem cell research still in place, states grapple with the issue of whether to fund such research themselves. With stringent U.S. federal restrictions on funding for human embryonic stem cell research still in place, states grapple with the issue of whether to fund such research themselves. When California voters approved spending state money for human embryonic stem (ES) cell research last November, other states began to formulate their own funding plans. However, court battles in California and political machinations elsewhere have slowed efforts by the states to circumvent federal restrictions on such research. Since 2001, the use of U.S. federal dollars for research on human ES cells has been restricted. Scientists can only use about two dozen human ES cell lines for research funded with federal dollars, which has hampered progress. Work prohibited by the federal policy can continue with private funds, but researchers with private support have had to keep these projects separate from any work bankrolled by federal dollars. To address the shortfall in federal cash for human ES cell research, a number of U.S. states are looking at ways to raise funds to support such studies, and California is leading the way. Last November, 59% of California voters approved Proposition 71 to create the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). This institute aims to provide $3 billion in state-issued bonds over 10 years for human ES cell research. The strategy is that investors would purchase the bonds, providing money for the research, and in return would receive interest payments on their investment. But a series of lawsuits have stalled the issuing of bonds and the dispersal of funds. One lawsuit argues that the Independent Citizens Oversight Committee—which presides over CIRM—is not under state control, and thus cannot handle state-issued bonds. Another lawsuit contends that committee members may have a conflict of interest because they work for California universities or companies that could reap the benefits of the funding initiative. Although the lawsuits address procedural issues, they are backed by the California Family Bioethics Council and the Life Legal Defense Foundation, groups opposed on ethical grounds to ES cell research. CIRM overcame one hurdle last month when a California judge ruled against a request to nullify parts of Proposition 71, saying that the plaintiffs in the lawsuits had not yet demonstrated that the institute violates California's state constitution. However, the judge did not dismiss the case, which will go to trial in February. The case could remain hung up in courts well into next year, which leaves the funding of CIRM in doubt. These setbacks “haven't taken momentum out of the interest in stem cell research,” says David Peckman, associate director of the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles. “It's of some concern, but it's a political issue that will be resolved,” he says. Daniel Perry, president of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research in Washington D.C., agrees: “It's a delay but it will not be fatal.” In the meantime, CIRM has subsisted on emergency funding, including a $3 million loan from the state, and a $5 million donation from the foundation of inventor Ray Dolby, which will keep the institute staffed and running through Spring 2006. In a tentative step forward, the CIRM awarded its first set of grants in September this year, allocating $12.5 million for training graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and clinical researchers at 16 institutions in California. No one knows when the institutions will receive the money, but CIRM says that it will provide funding through so-called bond anticipation notes, a stopgap financing measure that circumvents the need to issue state bonds. The promise of a windfall for stem cell research funding has attracted some researchers to California. For instance, Stefan Heller, who studies stem cells of the inner ear, left a faculty position at Harvard and moved to Stanford this fall. Proposition 71 helped to entice him. “It played a role for sure,” he says. Heller has been surprised by how few of his scientific colleagues have seriously considered moving to California, a fact that he attributes to a lack of interest in leaving communities where researchers have established personal roots. Still, the potential for state research money “was certainly not a decisive issue for me,” says Heller. Just as important were opportunities for collaboration at Stanford; teaming up with other researchers was possible at Harvard, he says, but it was difficult with labs spread throughout Boston. “Stanford offers everything in one place,” he says. And despite federal restrictions on funding for human ES cell research, Heller points out that researchers can find alternative sources of funding for solid research projects. A stimulating research environment prompted another stem cell researcher to move in the opposite direction and leave California. Meri Firpo, now at the University of Minnesota, left her previous post as a research professor at the University of California, San Francisco, in April. “I did not contemplate staying” because of the initiative, she says. “I chose based on the research environment I was moving into.” She points out that the availability of experts on pancreatic islet transplantation at the University of Minnesota should facilitate moving her research on developing stem cell-based therapies for diabetes into clinical studies. “Funding is an important aspect but it's really only one point,” she says. And in retrospect, “if I had chosen to stay in California, that would have been a mistake” because of the delay in dispersing research money by CIRM. Other researchers have moved too, but not to California. In late November, Neal Copeland and Nancy Jenkins, cancer researchers at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland, announced that they would move their laboratories to Singapore. Heavy investment in biotechnology and more permissive policies toward stem cell research have enabled Singapore to become a scientific mecca for many researchers including those who work on stem cells. New advances in stem cell research could aid Copeland and Jenkins in their efforts to study genetic changes leading to cancer. Stanford University had been wooing the pair, who cited restrictions on research and delays in Proposition 71 funding as figuring heavily in their decision. In addition to Singapore, other countries are poised to forge ahead as federal restrictions hamper researchers in the United States. Researchers in South Korea led by Woo Suk Hwang have marked significant milestones in therapeutic cloning research, creating cloned human embryos, nurturing stem cell lines from patients with particular diseases, and devising more efficient methods for cloning embryos. In October, Hwang announced the formation of a World Stem Cell bank, which would provide scientists worldwide with human ES cell lines. The Korean efforts have been tarnished, however, by Hwang's recent admission that egg donors had been paid and that the team's own scientists donated eggs for some studies, raising ethical concerns. Hwang had previously denied both allegations. Hwang subsequently resigned as director of the World Stem Cell Bank, and one of his associates has taken the helm. And some researchers are now questioning the scientific validity of the team's June 2005 Science paper because a figure showing DNA fingerprinting matches between human ES cell lines and the patients from which they were derived seems to contain duplicate traces. It has yet to be established whether the irregularity arose from a publication error or from scientific fraud. If California's funding effort bears fruit, it could help researchers in California to keep pace with research advances outside the United States. And the threat of a new California gold rush has inspired researchers and politicians in other states to follow suit. “There was concern that there would be a giant sucking sound from California slurping up researchers,” says David Beck, CEO of the Coriell Institute for Medical Research in Camden, New Jersey, and a member of the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology. The state of New Jersey allocated $11.5 million in May 2004 to start the Stem Cell Institute of New Jersey. The research committee of the state commission is currently reviewing applications for $5 million dollars in state research funding, says Beck, the committee's chair. “We want to be the first state to put money out on the street,” he says. Acting Governor of New Jersey Richard Codey also announced plans this year to devote $150 million in state funds to provide a building for the institute. (Jon Corzine was elected governor by New Jersey voters in November; Codey did not run.) In addition, Codey introduced a bill into the New Jersey legislature this year to authorize $230 million in state-issued bonds to fund stem cell research, including work on human ES cells. Wrangling over this and a similar but competing bill prevented passage in time to put a bond measure before New Jersey voters this November. Research advocates aim to have a measure on the ballot next fall. To avoid any concerns about conflicts of interest, the research commission is aiming to keep grant review committees as independent as possible, he says. And “we're aiming to keep a low profile” to avoid the intense media exposure surrounding Proposition 71, says Beck. The state of Connecticut is also moving into the stem cell research arena. In January 2005, Governor Jody Rell advocated spending $20 million of the state's budget surplus to fund human stem cell research. And in July, lawmakers approved legislation allowing all forms of stem cell research in the state, and appropriated $10 million over 10 years to support the work. The law forbids reproductive cloning but allows therapeutic cloning. Blood stem cell expert Diane Krause of Yale University in New Haven is optimistic the move will attract stem cell researchers to Connecticut. Yale University recently attempted to woo two stem cell researchers, who instead took positions in California, Krause says. Losing top people “is certainly one of our concerns.” In other states, research advocates have met fierce opposition to state-supported stem cell research. The Missouri legislature has considered several bills that would outlaw therapeutic cloning. “That persistent attempt has created an uncertainty that has interrupted expansion of the Stowers Institute,” says William Neaves, director of the Kansas City, Missouri, nonprofit research organization, “and have stymied attempts to recruit promising young scientists.” To counter the push to ban therapeutic cloning in Missouri, a coalition of advocates launched a campaign in October to put a constitutional amendment on next November's ballot; approval by voters would permit therapeutic cloning and prevent any bans on using this approach. The initiative won't provide any research dollars, says Neaves. “No one expects the state taxpayers to provide funding,” but he says that the amendment would help to ensure that Missouri is “a very cordial environment for biomedical research.” Other states have also launched stem cell efforts. In Illinois, Governor Rod R. Blagojevich issued an executive order in July this year that allocated $10 million for stem cell research and the creation of the Illinois Regenerative Medicine Institute. Blagojevich even sent letters to Missouri stem cell researchers in August inviting them to relocate to Illinois. In October, Governor Robert Ehrlich, Jr., of Maryland promised that his agenda for next year would include a stem cell program, after conservative state legislators killed a $25 million bill for stem cell research in April. This fall, research advocates in Florida launched an effort to put a $200 million stem cell research initiative on the November 2006 ballot. In other states, research proponents posted more modest victories. In November, Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle vetoed a bill that would outlaw therapeutic cloning to create stem cell lines. Texas advocates also fended off legislation that would outlaw some forms of stem cell research; the Texas House signed off on a bill that would allocate $41.1 million dollars to establish a stem cell research institute. Virginia lawmakers passed a bill that would allow ES cell research, but later struck provisions to fund the work with state money. Meanwhile, the New York and Pennsylvania legislatures introduced bills this year that would permit ES cell research and would provide state funding. State funds for stem cell research will likely come in a trickle rather than a flood, but some experts say that private money is sufficient to move the field forward regardless of what happens with state and federal funding. “We do of course hope that the NIH will eventually be able to support all kinds of stem cell research,” says Neaves. “But the federal ban has not really affected us. We have sufficient internal funding to enable our scientists to undertake any research they wish.” Other institutions are reaping the rewards of private funding. The Harvard Stem Cell Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts operates primarily on gifts from private donors. And in May, the Starr Foundation announced a $50 million dollar contribution for human stem cell research (including ES cell studies) to three New York City institutions: Rockefeller University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and Weill Medical College of Cornell University. As states continue to explore ways to support stem cell research, there are inklings that federal restrictions might be loosened. In May, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill that would broaden federal funding for stem cell research, allowing the derivation of new stem cell lines from human embryos created by in vitro fertilization. In July, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist broke with President George Bush and announced his support for the bill. The Senate would vote on the bill in 2005, Frist said. But other business—such as disaster relief and Supreme Court justice hearings—has halted discussion of the Senate stem cell bill. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the bill's sponsor, threatened to put the brakes on a mandatory spending bill until the stem cell issue was decided but has now relented in return for Frist's promise of considering the stem cell bill early in 2006. Neither house has enough votes to override a presidential veto, however. Regardless of what transpires in individual states, a change in direction at the federal level is vital for the field, say many researchers. “I do not feel that this is or should be a state issue,” said Harvard Stem Cell Institute codirector Douglas Melton in an email. Embryonic stem cell research should be part of a progressive national health care policy, and segregating research efforts doesn't encourage cooperation, he added. The federal restrictions force scientists to pursue research avenues solely to conform to politics, says Peter Mombaerts of the Rockefeller University in New York City, who studies methods for generating stem cell lines through therapeutic cloning in mice. For instance, in October of this year, two teams reported methods for generating human ES cell lines without harming a viable human embryo. “If there were not these restrictions, I would not do this research,” says Harvard University stem cell scientist Rudolf Jaenisch, who led one of the groups. As state officials move to resolve problems over funding for human ES cell research, scientists keep their sights on the ultimate goal: a better understanding of stem cell biology and the possibility of therapeutic applications of stem cell research."
