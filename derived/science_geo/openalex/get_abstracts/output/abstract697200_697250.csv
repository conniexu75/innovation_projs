https://openalex.org/W4286005461,"Detailed knowledge of how diversity in the sequence of the human genome affects phenotypic diversity depends on a comprehensive and reliable characterization of both sequences and phenotypic variation. Over the past decade, insights into this relationship have been obtained from whole-exome sequencing or whole-genome sequencing of large cohorts with rich phenotypic data1,2. Here we describe the analysis of whole-genome sequencing of 150,119 individuals from the UK Biobank3. This constitutes a set of high-quality variants, including 585,040,410 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, representing 7.0% of all possible human single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and 58,707,036 indels. This large set of variants allows us to characterize selection based on sequence variation within a population through a depletion rank score of windows along the genome. Depletion rank analysis shows that coding exons represent a small fraction of regions in the genome subject to strong sequence conservation. We define three cohorts within the UK Biobank: a large British Irish cohort, a smaller African cohort and a South Asian cohort. A haplotype reference panel is provided that allows reliable imputation of most variants carried by three or more sequenced individuals. We identified 895,055 structural variants and 2,536,688 microsatellites, groups of variants typically excluded from large-scale whole-genome sequencing studies. Using this formidable new resource, we provide several examples of trait associations for rare variants with large effects not found previously through studies based on whole-exome sequencing and/or imputation."

In equilibrium without energy supply, directional motion cannot be sustained without violating the laws of thermodynamics. Under conditions away from thermodynamic equilibrium, directional motion may be achieved within the framework of Brownian ratchets, which are diffusive mechanisms that have broken inversion symmetry1-5. Ratcheting is thought to underpin the function of many natural biological motors, such as the F1F0-ATPase6-8, and it has been demonstrated experimentally in synthetic microscale systems (for example, to our knowledge, first in ref. 3) and also in artificial molecular motors created by organic chemical synthesis9-12. DNA nanotechnology13 has yielded a variety of nanoscale mechanisms, including pivots, hinges, crank sliders and rotary systems14-17, which can adopt different configurations, for example, triggered by strand-displacement reactions18,19 or by changing environmental parameters such as pH, ionic strength, temperature, external fields and by coupling their motions to those of natural motor proteins20-26. This previous work and considering low-Reynolds-number dynamics and inherent stochasticity27,28 led us to develop a nanoscale rotary motor built from DNA origami that is driven by ratcheting and whose mechanical capabilities approach those of biological motors such as F1F0-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W4286209651,"The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 is essential for the suppression of innate immune activation and pathology caused by aberrant recognition of self-RNA, a role it carries out by disrupting the duplex structure of endogenous double-stranded RNA species1,2. A point mutation in the sequence encoding the Z-DNA-binding domain (ZBD) of ADAR1 is associated with severe autoinflammatory disease3-5. ZBP1 is the only other ZBD-containing mammalian protein6, and its activation can trigger both cell death and transcriptional responses through the kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3, and the protease caspase 8 (refs. 7-9). Here we show that the pathology caused by alteration of the ZBD of ADAR1 is driven by activation of ZBP1. We found that ablation of ZBP1 fully rescued the overt pathology caused by ADAR1 alteration, without fully reversing the underlying inflammatory program caused by this alteration. Whereas loss of RIPK3 partially phenocopied the protective effects of ZBP1 ablation, combined deletion of caspase 8 and RIPK3, or of caspase 8 and MLKL, unexpectedly exacerbated the pathogenic effects of ADAR1 alteration. These findings indicate that ADAR1 is a negative regulator of sterile ZBP1 activation, and that ZBP1-dependent signalling underlies the autoinflammatory pathology caused by alteration of ADAR1."
https://openalex.org/W4286008133,"The RNA-editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) limits the accumulation of endogenous immunostimulatory double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)1. In humans, reduced ADAR1 activity causes the severe inflammatory disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS)2. In mice, complete loss of ADAR1 activity is embryonically lethal3-6, and mutations similar to those found in patients with AGS cause autoinflammation7-12. Mechanistically, adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) base modification of endogenous dsRNA by ADAR1 prevents chronic overactivation of the dsRNA sensors MDA5 and PKR3,7-10,13,14. Here we show that ADAR1 also inhibits the spontaneous activation of the left-handed Z-nucleic acid sensor ZBP1. Activation of ZBP1 elicits caspase-8-dependent apoptosis and MLKL-mediated necroptosis of ADAR1-deficient cells. ZBP1 contributes to the embryonic lethality of Adar-knockout mice, and it drives early mortality and intestinal cell death in mice deficient in the expression of both ADAR and MAVS. The Z-nucleic-acid-binding Zα domain of ADAR1 is necessary to prevent ZBP1-mediated intestinal cell death and skin inflammation. The Zα domain of ADAR1 promotes A-to-I editing of endogenous Alu elements to prevent dsRNA formation through the pairing of inverted Alu repeats, which can otherwise induce ZBP1 activation. This shows that recognition of Alu duplex RNA by ZBP1 may contribute to the pathological features of AGS that result from the loss of ADAR1 function."
https://openalex.org/W4286007813,"Abstract Mutations of the ADAR1 gene encoding an RNA deaminase cause severe diseases associated with chronic activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses, including Aicardi–Goutières syndrome and bilateral striatal necrosis 1–3 . The IFN-inducible p150 isoform of ADAR1 contains a Zα domain that recognizes RNA with an alternative left-handed double-helix structure, termed Z-RNA 4,5 . Hemizygous ADAR1 mutations in the Zα domain cause type I IFN-mediated pathologies in humans 2,3 and mice 6–8 ; however, it remains unclear how the interaction of ADAR1 with Z-RNA prevents IFN activation. Here we show that Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1), the only other protein in mammals known to harbour Zα domains 9 , promotes type I IFN activation and fatal pathology in mice with impaired ADAR1 function. ZBP1 deficiency or mutation of its Zα domains reduced the expression of IFN-stimulated genes and largely prevented early postnatal lethality in mice with hemizygous expression of ADAR1 with mutated Zα domain ( Adar1 mZα /– mice). Adar1 mZα /– mice showed upregulation and impaired editing of endogenous retroelement-derived complementary RNA reads, which represent a likely source of Z-RNAs activating ZBP1. Notably, ZBP1 promoted IFN activation and severe pathology in Adar1 mZα /– mice in a manner independent of RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL-mediated necroptosis and caspase-8-dependent apoptosis, suggesting a novel mechanism of action. Thus, ADAR1 prevents endogenous Z-RNA-dependent activation of pathogenic type I IFN responses by ZBP1, suggesting that ZBP1 could contribute to type I interferonopathies caused by ADAR1 mutations."

https://openalex.org/W4286002045,"Abstract Quantum many-body systems away from equilibrium host a rich variety of exotic phenomena that are forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. A prominent example is that of discrete time crystals 1–8 , in which time-translational symmetry is spontaneously broken in periodically driven systems. Pioneering experiments have observed signatures of time crystalline phases with trapped ions 9,10 , solid-state spin systems 11–15 , ultracold atoms 16,17 and superconducting qubits 18–20 . Here we report the observation of a distinct type of non-equilibrium state of matter, Floquet symmetry-protected topological phases, which are implemented through digital quantum simulation with an array of programmable superconducting qubits. We observe robust long-lived temporal correlations and subharmonic temporal response for the edge spins over up to 40 driving cycles using a circuit of depth exceeding 240 and acting on 26 qubits. We demonstrate that the subharmonic response is independent of the initial state, and experimentally map out a phase boundary between the Floquet symmetry-protected topological and thermal phases. Our results establish a versatile digital simulation approach to exploring exotic non-equilibrium phases of matter with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors 21 ."
https://openalex.org/W4286007969,"Nascent platforms for programmable quantum simulation offer unprecedented access to new regimes of far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics in almost isolated systems. Here achieving precise control over quantum many-body entanglement is an essential task for quantum sensing and computation. Extensive theoretical work indicates that these capabilities can enable dynamical phases and critical phenomena that show topologically robust methods to create, protect and manipulate quantum entanglement that self-correct against large classes of errors. However, so far, experimental realizations have been confined to classical (non-entangled) symmetry-breaking orders1-5. In this work, we demonstrate an emergent dynamical symmetry-protected topological phase6, in a quasiperiodically driven array of ten 171Yb+ hyperfine qubits in Quantinuum's System Model H1 trapped-ion quantum processor7. This phase shows edge qubits that are dynamically protected from control errors, cross-talk and stray fields. Crucially, this edge protection relies purely on emergent dynamical symmetries that are absolutely stable to generic coherent perturbations. This property is special to quasiperiodically driven systems: as we demonstrate, the analogous edge states of a periodically driven qubit array are vulnerable to symmetry-breaking errors and quickly decohere. Our work paves the way for implementation of more complex dynamical topological orders8,9 that would enable error-resilient manipulation of quantum information."

https://openalex.org/W4286492114,"Background and objective The epidemiology of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) in developing countries remains unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence, prevalence, and national burden of ILDs in India. Methods Data of consecutive subjects (aged &gt;12 years) with ILDs included in a registry between March 2015 and February 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. The proportion of each ILD subtype was determined. The crude annual incidence and prevalence of ILDs for our region were estimated. Subsequently, the primary estimates of the national annual incident and prevalent burden of ILD and its subtypes were calculated. Alternative estimates for each ILD subtype were calculated using the current and a large, previous Indian study (n = 1,084). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22 and are presented descriptively. Results A total of 2,005 subjects (mean age, 50.7 years; 47% men) were enrolled. Sarcoidosis (37.3%) was the most common ILD subtype followed by connective tissue disease (CTD)-related ILDs (19.3%), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF, 17.0%), and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP, 14.4%). The crude annual incidence and prevalence of ILDs were 10.1–20.2 and 49.0–98.1, respectively per 100,000 population. The best primary estimates for the crude national burden of all ILDs, sarcoidosis, CTD-ILD, IPF, HP, and other ILDs (in thousands) were 433–867, 213–427, 75–150, 51–102, 54–109, and 39–78. The respective alternative estimates (in thousands) were sarcoidosis, 127–254; CTD-ILD, 81–162; IPF, 46–91; HP, 130–261; other ILDs, 49–98. Conclusion In contrast to developed countries, sarcoidosis and HP are the ILDs with the highest burden in India."
https://openalex.org/W4286496154,"""Undetectable equals Untransmittable"", or U=U, is a public health message designed to reduce HIV stigma and help communicate the scientific consensus that HIV cannot be sexually transmitted when a person living with HIV has an undetectable viral load. Between October 2020-February 2021 we conducted 11 in-depth interviews and 3 focus groups with diverse HIV/STI service providers (nurses, public health workers, physicians, frontline providers, and sexual health educators) in Ontario, Canada (n = 18). Our objective was to understand how U=U was communicated to sexual health service users in healthcare interactions. Interview questions were embedded in a larger study focused on improving access to HIV/STI testing. Transcripts were transcribed verbatim and analysed following grounded theory. Most providers emphasized the significance of U=U as a biomedical advancement in HIV prevention but had some challenges communicating U=U in everyday practice. We discovered four interrelated barriers when communicating the U=U message: (1) provider-perceived challenges with ""zero risk"" messaging (e.g., wanting to ""leave a margin"" of HIV risk); (2) service users not interested in receiving sexual health information (e.g., in order to provide ""client centered care"" some providers do not share U=U messages if service users are only interested in HIV/STI testing or if other discussions must be prioritized); (3) skepticism and HIV stigma from service users (e.g., providers explained how the hesitancy of some service users accepting the U=U message was shaped by a legacy of HIV prevention messages and persistent HIV stigma); and (4) need for more culturally appropriate resources (e.g., communities other than sexual and gender minority men; non-English speaking service users; that account for broader legal context). We discuss ways to overcome barriers to communicating the U=U message as well as the limitations and potential unintended consequences of U=U framings in the context of unequal access to HIV prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3171502084,"We construct an agent-based SEIR model to simulate COVID-19 spread at a 16000-student mostly non-residential urban university during the Fall 2021 Semester. We find that mRNA vaccine coverage at 100% combined with weekly screening testing of 25% of the campus population make it possible to safely reopen to in-person instruction. Our simulations exhibit a right-skew for total infections over the semester that becomes more pronounced with less vaccine coverage, less vaccine effectiveness and no additional preventative measures. This suggests that high levels of infection are not exceedingly rare with campus social connections the main transmission route. Finally, we find that if vaccine coverage is 100% and vaccine effectiveness is above 80%, then a safe reopening is possible even without facemask use. This models possible future scenarios with high coverage of additional “booster” doses of COVID-19 vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W4286499372,"Food webs map feeding interactions among species, providing a valuable tool for understanding and predicting community dynamics. Using species' body sizes is a promising avenue for parameterizing food-web models, but such approaches have not yet been able to fully recover observed community dynamics. Such discrepancies suggest that traits other than body size also play important roles. For example, differences in species' use of microhabitat or non-consumptive effects of intraguild predators may affect dynamics in ways not captured by body size. In Laubmeier et al. (2018), we developed a dynamic food-web model incorporating microhabitat and non-consumptive predator effects in addition to body size, and used simulations to suggest an optimal sampling design of a mesocosm experiment to test the model. Here, we perform the mesocosm experiment to generate empirical time-series of insect herbivore and predator abundance dynamics. We minimize least squares error between the model and time-series to determine parameter values of four alternative models, which differ in terms of including vs excluding microhabitat use and non-consumptive predator-predator effects. We use both statistical and expert-knowledge criteria to compare the models and find including both microhabitat use and non-consumptive predator-predator effects best explains observed aphid and predator population dynamics, followed by the model including microhabitat alone. This ranking suggests that microhabitat plays a larger role in driving population dynamics than non-consumptive predator-predator effects, although both are clearly important. Our results illustrate the importance of additional traits alongside body size in driving trophic interactions. They also point to the need to consider trophic interactions and population dynamics in a wider community context, where non-trophic impacts can dramatically modify the interplay between multiple predators and prey. Overall, we demonstrate the potential for utilizing traits beyond body size to improve trait-based models and the value of iterative cycling between theory, data and experiment to hone current insights into how traits affect food-web dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4286489717,"SCNT embryos suffer from poor developmental competence (both in vitro and in vivo) due to various defects such as oxidative stress, incomplete epigenetic reprogramming, and flaws in telomere rejuvenation. It is very promising to ameliorate all these defects in SCNT embryos by supplementing the culture medium with a single compound. It has been demonstrated that melatonin, as a multitasking molecule, can improve the development of SCNT embryos, but its function during ovine SCNT embryos is unclear. We observed that supplementation of embryonic culture medium with 10 nM melatonin for 7 days accelerated the rate of blastocyst formation in ovine SCNT embryos. In addition, the quality of blastocysts increased in the melatonin-treated group compared with the SCNT control groups in terms of ICM, TE, total cell number, and mRNA expression of NANOG. Mechanistic studies in this study revealed that the melatonin-treated group had significantly lower ROS level, apoptotic cell ratio, and mRNA expression of CASPASE-3 and BAX/BCL2 ratio. In addition, melatonin promotes mitochondrial membrane potential and autophagy status (higher number of LC3B dots). Our results indicate that melatonin decreased the global level of 5mC and increased the level of H3K9ac in the treated blastocyst group compared with the blastocysts in the control group. More importantly, we demonstrated for the first time that melatonin treatment promoted telomere elongation in ovine SCNT embryos. This result offers the possibility of better development of ovine SCNT embryos after implantation. We concluded that melatonin can accelerate the reprogramming of telomere length in sheep SCNT embryos, in addition to its various beneficial effects such as increasing antioxidant capacity, reducing DNA damage, and improving the quality of derived blastocysts, all of which led to a higher in vitro development rate."
https://openalex.org/W4286492745,"The UNAIDS 95-95-95 global targets for epidemic control aim to ensure by 2030 that 95% of HIV-positive people know their HIV status, 95% of people diagnosed with HIV receive sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 95% of people on ART have viral suppression. While data on the first and second 95 targets are routinely reported nationally, data on the third 95 target are not available for pregnant women in South Africa. The lack of data on the third 95 target limits the inclusion of low viral suppression as one of the contributing factors in MTCT root cause analyses. This study assessed progress towards the 95-95-95 targets among pregnant women between the ages of 15-49 years attending public health facilities in South Africa.Data were obtained from two consecutive national cross-sectional antenatal HIV sentinel surveys conducted between 1 October and 15 November in both 2017 and 2019. In each survey, data on age, knowledge of HIV status, ART initiation, and geographical location (province) were extracted from medical records. A blood specimen was collected from each woman and tested for HIV. Viral load tests were performed on HIV-positive specimens. Descriptive and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine association between province and viral suppression (defined as viral load <50 copies/mL) using the combined dataset (i.e., both 2017 and 2019 data combined). All analyses considered the survey design.Of 10 065 and 11 321 HIV-positive women included in the 2017 and 2019 surveys, respectively, 96.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 95.6-96.4%) and 97.6% (95% CI: 97.3-97.8%) knew their HIV-positive status; 86.6% (95% CI: 85.9-87.3%) and 96.0% (95% CI: 95.6-96.4%) of those who knew their HIV status were receiving ART; while 64.2% (95% CI: 63.2-65.2%) and 66.0% (95% CI: 65.1-66.8%) of those receiving ART were virally suppressed. Achievement of the third 95 target significantly varied by province ranging from 33.9-72.6% in 2017 and 43.4-77.3% in 2019. Knowledge of HIV-positive status, ART initiation, and viral suppression increased in both 15-24 and 25-49 year age groups between 2017 and 2019. In a multivariable analysis adjusting for survey year, gravidity, and education, the odds of viral suppression significantly varied by province (except KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape, other provinces were less likely to attain viral suppression compared to Gauteng), age (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for 15-24 years vs 25-49 years: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6-0.8), and timing of ART initiation (AOR for ART initiation during pregnancy vs before pregnancy: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.5-0.6).Although in 2019 the first and second 95 targets were achieved among pregnant women, meeting the third 95 target remains a challenge. This study highlighted the importance of promoting early ART initiation and the need to target young women in efforts to improve progress towards the third 95 target. Additionally, the provincial variation in viral suppression could be further investigated in future studies to identify and address the root causes underlying these differences."

The impact of fat mass, from bioimpedance analysis, on eGFR based on cystatin C and/or creatinine is studied.5049 participants from Malmö Diet and Cancer Study the cardiovascular arm (MDCS-CV) with available body mass composition (single frequency bioimpedance analysis) and cystatin C measured at baseline were selected. Body mass index (kg/m2) was used to define overweight/obesity. eGFR was calculated using cystatin C (eGFRCYS) and creatinine (eGFRCR) equations: Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2012 (CKD-EPICR, CKD-EPICYS, CKD-EPICR-CYS), eGFRCYS based on Caucasian, Asian, pediatric, and adult cohorts (CAPA), the Lund-Malmö revised equation (LMrev), and Modified Full Age Spectrum creatinine-based equation (EKFCCR). Two different fat mass index (FMI) z-scores were calculated: FMI z-scoreLarsson and FMI z-scoreLee.Lower eGFRCYS and eGFRCR-CYS following multiple adjustments were prevalent in overweight/obese subjects. Increase in FMI z-scoreLarsson or FMI z-scoreLee was related to decrease in predicted CAPA, CKD-EPICYS, CKD-EPICR-CYS and CAPA-LMrev equation.eGFRCYS, in contrast to combined eGFRCR-CYS and eGFRCR, demonstrate the strongest association between FMI and kidney function."
https://openalex.org/W4286491831,"MammoWave is a microwave imaging device for breast lesion detection, employing two antennas which rotate azimuthally (horizontally) around the breast. The antennas operate in the 1-9 GHz band and are set in free space, i.e., pivotally, no matching liquid is required. Microwave images, subsequently obtained through the application of Huygens Principle, are intensity maps, representing the homogeneity of the dielectric properties of the breast tissues under test. In this paper, MammoWave is used to realise tissues dielectric differences and localise lesions by segmenting microwave images adaptively employing pulse coupled neural network (PCNN). Subsequently, a non-parametric thresholding technique is modelled to differentiate between breasts having no radiological finding (NF) or benign (BF) and breasts with malignant finding (MF). Resultant findings verify that automated breast lesion localization with microwave imaging matches the gold standard achieving 81.82% sensitivity in MF detection. The proposed method is tested on microwave images acquired from a feasibility study performed in Foligno Hospital, Italy. This study is based on 61 breasts from 35 patients; performance may vary with larger number of datasets and will be subsequently investigated."
https://openalex.org/W4286489327,"The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the high mountain ecosystem by regulating prey populations and maintaining plant community structure. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the role of the snow leopard and its interaction with prey species. Further, elucidating landscape use and co-occurrence of snow leopard and its prey species can be used to assess the differential use of habitat, allowing them to coexist. We used camera trapping and sign survey to study the interactions of snow leopard and its prey species (Siberian Ibex- Capra sibrica and Blue sheep-Pseudois nayaur) in the Spiti valley Himachal Pradesh. Using the occupancy modelling, we examined whether these prey and predator species occur together more or less frequently than would be expected by chance. To understand this, we have used ten covariates considering the ecology of the studied species. Our results suggest habitat covariates, such as LULC16 (barren area), LULC10 (grassland), ASP (aspect), SLP (slope) and DW (distance to water), are important drivers of habitat use for the snow leopard as well as its prey species. Furthermore, we found that the snow leopard detection probability was high if the site was used by its prey species, i.e., ibex and blue sheep. Whereas, in the case of the prey species, the probability of detection was low when the predator (snow leopard) was present and detected. Besides this, our results suggested that both species were less likely to detect together than expected if they were independent (Snow leopard-Ibex, Delta = 0.29, and snow leopard-blue sheep, Delta = 0.28, both the values are <1, i.e., avoidance). Moreover, despite the predation pressure, the differential anti-predation habitat selection and restriction of temporal activities by the prey species when snow leopard is present allows them to co-exist. Therefore, considering the strong link between the habitat use by the snow leopard and its prey species, it is imperative to generate quantitative long-term data on predator-prey densities and the population dynamics of its prey species in the landscape."
https://openalex.org/W4286490346,"To reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), national governments implemented measures to limit contact between citizens. This study evaluated changes in physical activity and sitting in response to the first COVID-19 lockdown in England and factors associated with these changes. A cross-sectional online survey-based study collected data from 818 adults between 29 April and 13 May 2020. Participants self-reported demographic information, physical activity and sitting for a 'typical' week before and during lockdown. Participants were grouped into low, moderate and high physical activity, and low and high (≥8 hours/day) sitting. Paired samples t-tests compared physical activity (MET-min/week) before and during lockdown. Pearson's Chi-squared evaluated the proportion of participants in the physical activity and sitting categories. Logistic regression explored associations of demographic and behavioural factors with physical activity and sitting during lockdown. Walking and total physical activity significantly increased during lockdown by 241 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 176, 304) MET-min/week and 302 (CI: 155, 457) MET-min/week, respectively (P < 0.001). There was a 4% decrease in participants engaging in low physical activity and a 4% increase in those engaging in high physical activity from before to during lockdown (P < 0.001). The proportion engaging in high sitting increased from 29% to 41% during lockdown (P < 0.001). Lower education level (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65, P = 0.045) and higher BMI (OR = 1.05, P = 0.020) were associated with increased odds of low physical activity during lockdown, whereas non-White ethnicity (OR = 0.24, P = 0.001) was associated with reduced odds. Younger age was associated with increased odds of high sitting (OR = 2.28, P = 0.008). These findings suggest that physical activity and sitting both increased during lockdown. Demographic and behavioural factors associated with low physical activity and high sitting have been identified that could inform intervention strategies during situations of home confinement."
https://openalex.org/W4286495486,"Past research suggests that the ability to recognise the emotional intent of a speaker decreases as a function of age. Yet, few studies have looked at the underlying cause for this effect in a systematic way. This paper builds on the view that emotional prosody perception is a multi-stage process and explores which step of the recognition processing line is impaired in healthy ageing using time-sensitive event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Results suggest that early processes linked to salience detection as reflected in the P200 component and initial build-up of emotional representation as linked to a subsequent negative ERP component are largely unaffected in healthy ageing. The two groups show, however, emotional prosody recognition differences: older participants recognise emotional intentions of speakers less well than younger participants do. These findings were followed up by two neuro-stimulation studies specifically targeting the inferior frontal cortex to test if recognition improves during active stimulation relative to sham. Overall, results suggests that neither tDCS nor high-frequency tRNS stimulation at 2mA for 30 minutes facilitates emotional prosody recognition rates in healthy older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4286495749,"As classical soil analysis is time-consuming and expensive, there is a growing demand for visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared (Vis-NIR-SWIR, wavelength 350-2500 nm) spectroscopy to predict soil properties. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of soil bunds on key soil properties and to develop regression models based on the Vis-NIR-SWIR spectral reflectance of soils in Aba Gerima, Ethiopia. Soil samples were collected from the 0-30 cm soil layer in 48 experimental teff (Eragrostis tef) plots and analysed for soil texture, pH, organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (av. P), and potassium (av. K). We measured reflectance from air-dried, ground, and sieved soils with a FieldSpec 4 Spectroradiometer. We used regression models to identify and predict soil properties, as assessed by the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). The results showed high variability (CV ≥ 35%) and substantial variation (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001) in soil texture, OC, and av. P in the catchment. Soil reflectance was lower from bunded plots. The pre-processing techniques, including multiplicative scatter correction, median filter, and Gaussian filter for OC, clay, and sand, respectively were used to transform the soil reflectance. Statistical results were: R2 = 0.71, RPD = 8.13 and bias = 0.12 for OC; R2 = 0.93, RPD = 2.21, bias = 0.94 for clay; and R2 = 0.85 with RPD = 7.54 and bias = 0.0.31 for sand with validation dataset. However, care is essential before applying the models to other regions. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest spectroradiometry can supplement classical soil analysis. However, more research is needed to increase the prediction performance of Vis-NIR-SWIR reflectance spectroscopy to advance soil management interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4286498406,"Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are predisposed to the onset of osteoporosis (OP). It is known that iron overload induces osteoclasts (OCs) overactivity and that the iron chelator Deferasirox (DFX) can counteract it. The Cannabinoid Receptor type 2 (CB2) and the transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) are potential therapeutic targets for OP. In this study we isolated OCs from peripheral blood of 20 CCS and investigated osteoclast biomarkers expression and iron metabolism evaluating iron release by OCs and the expression of several molecules involved in its regulation. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of CB2 and TRPV1 stimulation in combination with DFX on osteoclast activity and iron metabolism. We observed, for the first time, an osteoclast hyperactivation in CCS suggesting a role for iron in its development. Moreover, we confirmed the well-known role of CB2 and TRPV1 receptors in bone metabolism, suggesting the receptors as possible key biomarkers of bone damage. Moreover, we demonstrated a promising synergism between pharmacological compounds, stimulating CB2 or inhibiting/desensitizing TRPV1 and DFX, in counteracting osteoclast overactivity in CCS to improve their quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4286489518,"Convolutional neural networks have enabled unprecedented breakthroughs in a variety of computer vision tasks. They have also drawn much attention from other domains, including drug discovery and drug development. In this study, we develop a computational method based on convolutional neural networks to tackle a fundamental question in drug discovery and development, i.e. the prediction of compound-protein interactions based on compound structure and protein sequence. We propose a hierarchical graph convolutional network (HGCN) to encode small molecules. The HGCN aggregates a molecule embedding from substructure embeddings, which are synthesized from atom embeddings. As small molecules usually share substructures, computing a molecule embedding from those common substructures allows us to learn better generic models. We then combined the HGCN with a one-dimensional convolutional network to construct a complete model for predicting compound-protein interactions. Furthermore we apply an explanation technique, Grad-CAM, to visualize the contribution of each amino acid into the prediction.Experiments using different datasets show the improvement of our model compared to other GCN-based methods and a sequence based method, DeepDTA, in predicting compound-protein interactions. Each prediction made by the model is also explainable and can be used to identify critical residues mediating the interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4286489736,"To understand which factors affect how willing people are to share their personal information to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, and compare them to factors that affect other public health behaviors.We analyze data from three pre-registered online experiments conducted over eight months during the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States (April 3 2020 -November 25, 2020). Our primary analysis tests whether support for data sharing and intention to practice protective behavior increase in response to relationship-centered messages about prosociality, disease spread, and financial hardship. We then conduct a secondary correlational analysis to compare the demographic and attitudinal factors associated with willingness to share data, protective behavior, and intent to get vaccinated. Our sample (N = 650) is representative to socio-demographic characteristics of the U.S. population.We find the altruistic condition increased respondents' willingness to share data. In our correlational analysis, we find interactive effects of political ID and socio-demographic traits on likelihood to share data. In contrast, we found health behavior was most strongly associated with political ID, and intent to vaccinate was more associated with socio-demographic traits.Our findings suggest that some public health messaging, even when it is not about data sharing or privacy, may increase public willingness to share data. We also find the role of socio-demographic factors in moderating the effect of political party ID varies by public health behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4286490395,"Rapidly developing technology for large scale neural recordings has allowed researchers to measure the activity of hundreds to thousands of neurons at single cell resolution in vivo. Neural decoding analyses are a widely used tool used for investigating what information is represented in this complex, high-dimensional neural population activity. Most population decoding methods assume that correlated activity between neurons has been estimated accurately. In practice, this requires large amounts of data, both across observations and across neurons. Unfortunately, most experiments are fundamentally constrained by practical variables that limit the number of times the neural population can be observed under a single stimulus and/or behavior condition. Therefore, new analytical tools are required to study neural population coding while taking into account these limitations. Here, we present a simple and interpretable method for dimensionality reduction that allows neural decoding metrics to be calculated reliably, even when experimental trial numbers are limited. We illustrate the method using simulations and compare its performance to standard approaches for dimensionality reduction and decoding by applying it to single-unit electrophysiological data collected from auditory cortex."
https://openalex.org/W4286491848,"Google Trends (GT) is an online tool designed for searching for changes over time. We assessed its use for evaluating changes in the timing of cherry flowering phenology, which is of intense interest to Japanese people. We examined the relationship between time-series of relative search volume (RSV: relative change in search requests over time obtained from the GT access engine) and cherry flowering information published on websites (as ground truth) in relation to three famous ancient cherry trees. The time-series of RSV showed an annual bell-shaped seasonal variability, and the dates of the maximum RSV tended to correspond to the dates of full bloom. Our results suggest that GT allows monitoring of multiple famous cherry flowering sites where we cannot obtain long-term flowering data to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of cherry flowering phenology."
https://openalex.org/W4286495807,"Introduction The clinical significance of bone marrow (BM) metastasis in prostate cancer as well as impact on oncological prognosis is unclear. We aim to assess the prevalence and clinical outcomes of BM metastasis at initial presentation of metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC). Patients and methods Retrospective chart review of newly diagnosed metastatic CSPC patients was performed with collection of clinicopathologic and radiologic characteristics. Descriptive univariate and multivariate analysis was performed as well as survival measures (OS and PFS), which was done using the Kaplan-Meier survival and the Log-rank test. Results 189 patients were eligible, of which, eleven patients (6%) had biopsy proven BM involvement at diagnosis. There was a trend to poorer PFS and OS in patients with BM involvement but not statistically significant; however, factors that correlated with inferior PFS and OS in the multivariate analysis included ECOG PS, ALP, and Hb. Conclusion BM metastasis in prostate cancer may lead to poorer survival. Clinical features including poor performance status, anemia, and elevated ALP, could guide bone marrow biopsies in the future to diagnose bone marrow metastasis at an earlier stage."
https://openalex.org/W4286496584,"This paper dissects the potential of state-of-the-art computational analysis to promote the investigation of government's administrative decisions and politics. The Executive Branch generates massive amounts of textual data comprising daily decisions in several levels and stages of the law and decree-making processes. The use of automated text analysis to explore this data based on the substantive interests of scholars runs into computational challenges. Computational methods have been applied to texts from the Legislative and Judicial Branches; however, there barely are suitable taxonomies to automate the classification and analysis of the Executive's administrative decrees. To solve this problem, we put forward a computational framework to analyze the Brazilian administrative decrees from 2000 to 2019. Our strategy to uncover the contents and patterns of the presidential decree-making is developed in three main steps. First, we conduct an unsupervised text analysis through the LDA algorithm for topic modeling. Second, building upon the LDA results, we propose two taxonomies for the classification of decrees: (a) the ministerial coauthorship of the decrees to map policy areas and (b) the decrees' fields of law based on a tagging system provided by the Brazilian Senate. Using these taxonomies, we compare the performance of three supervised text classification algorithms: SVM, Convolutional Neural Network, and Hierarchical Attention Network, achieving F1-scores of up to 80% when automatically classifying decrees. Third, we analyze the network generated by links between decrees through centrality and clustering approaches, distinguishing a set of administrative decisions related to the president's priorities in the economic policy area. Our findings confirm the potential of our computational framework to explore N-large datasets, advance exploratory studies, and generate testable propositions in different research areas. They advance the monitoring of Brazil's administrative decree-making process that is shaped by the president's priorities and by the interplay among cabinet members."
https://openalex.org/W4286497141,"Compared with traditional manufacturing enterprises, intelligent manufacturing enterprises pay more attention to the investment of knowledge capital and technological capital. Taking 258 intelligent manufacturing listed companies in China from 2015 to 2020 as research samples, the paper selects the material capital, human capital, knowledge capital and technological capital of enterprises as the input variables of Cobb-Douglas production function. Considering that enterprises are often affected by spatial correlation, stochastic frontier panel model, spatial lag stochastic frontier panel model and dynamic spatial lag stochastic frontier panel model are constructed to measure capital allocation efficiencies of enterprises. The results show that all the factor capitals in the three models have a significant positive impact on enterprises' performance, and the dual lag effect of time and space is significant. Moreover, it is more reasonable to use the dynamic spatial lag stochastic frontier panel model to estimate the parameters and measure capital allocation efficiencies. The development of intelligent manufacturing industry has significant space-time spillover effect among provinces. About 52.98% of intelligent manufacturing enterprises have high capital allocation efficiencies, but 12.04% still need to further optimize capital allocation. The gap between the actual performance of the sample enterprises and efficiency frontier is mainly due to technical ineffectiveness. From a regional perspective, the top ten enterprises with high capital allocation efficiencies are all in the eastern region, but the average of capital allocation efficiency is the highest in the western region, followed by the eastern and central regions."
https://openalex.org/W4286497612,"Purpose To determine the prevalence and risk factors for pterygium in geographically diverse regions of India. Methods A population-based, cross-sectional multicentric study was conducted in adults aged ≥40 years in plains, hilly and coastal regions of India. All participants underwent a detailed questionnaire-based assessment for sun exposure, usage of sun protective measures, exposure to indoor smoke, and smoking. Detailed ocular and systemic examinations were performed. Pterygium was diagnosed and graded clinically by slit-lamp examination. Association of pterygium with sociodemographic, ophthalmological, and systemic parameters was assessed. Physical environmental parameters for the study period were estimated. Results Of the 12,021 eligible subjects, 9735 (81% response rate) participated in the study. The prevalence of pterygium in any eye was 13.2% (95% CI: 12.5%-13.9%), and bilateral pterygium was 6.7% (95% CI: 6.2–7.2). The prevalence increased with age (&lt;0.001) irrespective of sex and was highest in those aged 60–69 years (15.8%). The prevalence was highest in coastal (20.3%), followed by plains (11.2%) and hilly regions (9.1%). On multi-logistic regression, pterygium was positively associated with coastal location (P&lt;0.001), illiteracy (P = 0.037), increasing lifetime sun exposure (P&lt;0.001), and negatively associated with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 (P = 0.009). Conclusion Pterygium prevalence is high in the rural Indian population. The association of pterygium with several potentially modifiable risk factors reflects its multifactorial etiology and provides targets for preventive measures."

Quantitative gait parameters analysis provides valuable information about fine gait alterations. Objectives To analyse change of gait parameters in patients with early PD at the stage of hemiparkinsonism and after 1 year of follow up, taking into account clinical asymmetry. Methods Consecutive early PD outpatients with strictly unilateral motor features underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessment at the study entry and after 1 year of follow up. Gait was assessed with GAITRite walkway using dual-task methodology. Spatiotemporal gait parameters (step time and length, swing time and double support time) and their coefficients of variation (CV), gait velocity and heel-to-heel base support were evaluated. Results We included 42 PD patients with disease duration of 1.3 years (±1.13). Progression of motor and non-motor symptoms, without significant cognitive worsening, was observed after 1 year of follow up. Significant shortening of the swing time, prolongation of the double support and increase of their CVs were observed during all task conditions similarly for most parameters on symptomatic and asymptomatic bodysides, except for CV for the swing time under the combined task. Conclusion Alterations of the swing time and double support time are already present even at the asymptomatic body side, and progress similarly, or even at faster pace, at this side, despite dopaminergic treatment These parameters deserve further investigation in larger, prospective studies to address their potential to serve as markers of progression in interventional disease modifying trials with early PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W4286498647,"Disgust is an aversive reaction protecting an organism from disease. People differ in how prone they are to experiencing it, and this fluctuates depending on how safe the environment is. Previous research has shown that the recognition and processing of disgusting words depends not on the word's disgust per se but rather on individual sensitivity to disgust. However, the influence of dynamically changing disgust on language comprehension has not yet been researched. In a series of studies, we investigated whether the media's portrayal of COVID-19 will affect subsequent language processing via changes in disgust. The participants were exposed to news headlines either depicting COVID-19 as a threat or downplaying it, and then rated single words for disgust and valence (Experiment 1; N = 83) or made a lexical decision (Experiment 2; N = 86). The headline type affected only word ratings and not lexical decisions, but political ideology and disgust proneness affected both. More liberal participants assigned higher disgust ratings after the headlines discounted the threat of COVID-19, whereas more conservative participants did so after the headlines emphasized it. We explain the results through the politicization and polarization of the pandemic. Further, political ideology was more predictive of reaction times in Experiment 2 than disgust proneness. High conservatism correlated with longer reaction times for disgusting and negative words, and the opposite was true for low conservatism. The results suggest that disgust proneness and political ideology dynamically interact with perceived environmental safety and have a measurable effect on language processing. Importantly, they also suggest that the media's stance on the pandemic and the political framing of the issue may affect the public response by increasing or decreasing our disgust."
https://openalex.org/W4286209851,"Blue Compact Dwarfs (BCDs) are low-luminosity (M$_{K} > -21$ mag), metal-poor ($\frac{1}{50}$ $\le Z/Z_{\odot} \le\frac{1}{2}$), centrally concentrated galaxies with bright clumps of star-formation. Cosmological surface brightness dimming and small size limit their detection at high redshifts, making their formation process difficult to observe. Observations of BCDs are needed at intermediate redshifts, where they are still young enough to show their formative stages, particularly in the outer regions where cosmic gas accretion should drive evolution. Here, we report the discovery of excess far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission in the outer regions of 11 BCDs in the GOODS-South field at redshifts between 0.1 and 0.24, corresponding to look back times of 1.3 - 2.8 Gyr in standard cosmology. These observations were made by the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on AstroSat. For ten BCDs, the radial profiles of intrinsic FUV emission, corrected for the instrument point spread function, have larger scale-lengths than their optical counterparts observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Such shallow FUV profiles suggest extended star-formation in cosmically accreting disks. Clumpy structure in the FUV also suggests the outer FUV disks are gravitationally unstable. Dynamical friction on the clumps drives them inward at an average rate exceeding $10^6~M_{\odot}$Gyr$^{-1}$."
https://openalex.org/W4286489396,"The reopening of college and university campuses was seen as presenting a high risk for transmission of COVID-19. Thus, these institutions faced with a new public health challenge never heretofore faced on this scale. To magnify the problem, they needed to rapidly develop and implement re-opening plans in an environment filled with uncertainty and for a population that was significantly less likely to observe COVID-19 mitigation behaviors. In response, within three weeks of opening, as part of its COVID-19 public health strategy, a West Coast university created and trained a public health workforce comprised of 282 undergraduates tasked with encouraging compliance with COVID-19 mitigating healthy behaviors.This paper describes the use and outcomes of a practicum framework to quickly create a university-based public health workforce. It addresses two questions: (1) Using a practicum framework, what are important considerations in designing and building a public health workforce for a university campus? and (2) What are the benefits to the workforce in terms of public health education and professional growth?Program administrative data were used to describe the workforce and their learning outcomes.The majority of students indicated that through the practicum, they learned new skills/developed new attitudes (71.7%) and became aware of their own strengths and opportunities for professional growth (73.7%). The types of new skills and attitudes learned included communication (49.2%), conflict management (20.4%), time management (7.5%), and open-mindedness/less judgmental attitude (14.6%). In terms of public health, they gained an understanding of infectious disease prevention (40.9%) that is multi-disciplinary (20.5%), and involves a community effort (36.8%).These findings demonstrate an effective way of rapidly addressing public health concerns that allowed for on the job training and opportunities for young adults to learn and grow. The practicum framework allowed the expeditious development of a public health workforce that ensured a fit between student interests and the role. This led to high retention with the majority of students continuing into the winter quarter. Only 5% of students reported not being satisfied with their position. None of the students contracted job-related COVID-19. The role gave students a sense of purpose during the pandemic's uncertain times that helped to protect them from the negative effects of stress. The practicum structure and support fostered a safe environment in which students were able to feel part of the larger community while gaining valuable work experience and skills and serve their community."
https://openalex.org/W4286489813,"As educational institutions begin a school year following a year and a half of disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, risk analysis can help to support decision-making for resuming in-person instructional operation by providing estimates of the relative risk reduction due to different interventions. In particular, a simulation-based risk analysis approach enables scenario evaluation and comparison to guide decision making and action prioritization under uncertainty. We develop a simulation model to characterize the risks and uncertainties associated with infections resulting from aerosol exposure in in-person classes. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to model a semester of courses in a real college with approximately 11,000 students embedded within a larger university. To have practical impact, risk cannot focus on only infections as the end point of interest, we estimate the risks of infection, hospitalizations, and deaths of students and faculty in the college. We incorporate uncertainties in disease transmission, the impact of policies such as masking and facility interventions, and variables outside of the college’s control such as population-level disease and immunity prevalence. We show in our example application that universal use of masks that block 40% of aerosols and the installation of near-ceiling, fan-mounted UVC systems both have the potential to lead to substantial risk reductions and that these effects can be modeled at the individual room level. These results exemplify how such simulation-based risk analysis can inform decision making and prioritization under great uncertainty."
https://openalex.org/W4286491044,"Background Almost 200 million children worldwide are either undernourished or overweight. Only a few studies have addressed the effect of variation in nutritional status on vaccine response. We previously demonstrated an association between stunting and an increased post-vaccination 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) response. In this prospective study, we assessed to what extent metabolic hormones may be a modifier in the association between nutritional status and PCV13 response. Methods Venezuelan children aged 6 weeks to 59 months were vaccinated with a primary series of PCV13. Nutritional status and serum levels of leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin were measured upon vaccination and their combined effect on serum post-vaccination antibody concentrations was assessed by generalized estimating equations multivariable regression analysis. Results A total of 210 children were included, of whom 80 were stunted, 81 had a normal weight and 49 were overweight. Overweight children had lower post-vaccination antibody concentrations than normal weight children (regression coefficient -1.15, 95% CI -2.22 –-0.072). Additionally, there was a significant adiponectin-nutritional status interaction. In stunted children, higher adiponectin serum concentrations were associated with lower post-PCV13 antibody concentrations (regression coefficient -0.19, 95% CI -0.24 –-0.14) while the opposite was seen in overweight children (regression coefficient 0.14, 95% CI 0.049–0.22). Conclusion Metabolic hormones, in particular adiponectin, may modify the effect of nutritional status on pneumococcal vaccine response. These findings emphasize the importance of further research to better understand the immunometabolic pathways underlying vaccine response and enable a future of optimal personalized vaccination schedules."

However, its optimum parameters and the neuroimaging mechanism are still of uncertainty. In order to simulate a study setting as close to real world as possible, the present study introduces a new orthogonally-designed protocol, consisting of the rTMS intervention with four key parameters (stimulating site, frequency, intensity and pulse number) and three different levels in each one, and aims to investigate the optimum parameters and the brain activity and connectivity in default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), central executive network (CEN) following rTMS intervention to post-stroke cognition impairment (PSCI). Methods A single-center, orthogonally-designed, triple-blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted and forty-five PSCI patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of nine active rTMS groups based on four rTMS paraments: stimulating site, frequency, intensity and pulse number. Neuropsychological, activities of daily living, quality of life and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evaluations were be performed pre-, post- and 3 months after rTMS. Discussion This study evaluates the optimum parameters of rTMS for patients with post-stroke cognition impairment and explores the alteration of neural function in DMN, DAN, CEN brain network. These results would facilitate the standardized application of rTMS in cognition impairment rehabilitation."

However, little information exists on COVID-19-related experiences among individuals with a SUD. We examined whether individuals with a SUD differ from other individuals with regard to COVID-19 testing, susceptibility, and employment-related vulnerability.We used data from a U.S. nationally representative survey (n = 1,208). Using logistic regressions, we examined whether individuals with SUDs differ from other individuals regarding underlying health conditions, COVID-19 testing, access to paid sick leave, and loss of employment. Data were collected in late May-early June, 2020.Four percent of participants reported that a healthcare professional had told them they had a SUD. We found that, compared to those without SUDs, respondents with SUDs had higher odds of having lost their job due to the pandemic (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]:5.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]:2.28-11.74). Among individuals who were employed prior to the pandemic, people with SUDs had lower odds of having paid sick leave (AOR:0.26, 95% CI:0.09-0.74).Our study indicates that individuals with SUDs could be disproportionately affected by COVID-19 economically, which might worsen SUD and racial/ethnic health disparities."
https://openalex.org/W4286491837,"The Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) comprises rapidly growing mycobacteria and has received increasing attention recently, with an increasing number of associated infections reported worldwide. However, the clinical features of MABC pulmonary disease (MABC-PD), especially in terms of the chest computed tomography (CT) findings, are not fully understood. Thus, this retrospective, cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the clinical background and chest high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings of MABC-PD in comparison with those of Mycobacterium avium complex PD (MAC-PD). Accordingly, 36 patients with MABC-PD and 65 patients with MAC-PD (defined according to the American Thoracic Society criteria), who were newly diagnosed at four major hospitals in Okinawa (Japan) between January 2012 and December 2017, were analyzed. With respect to their clinical background, only cardiovascular diseases were significantly more common in patients with MABC-PD than in those with MAC-PD (38.9% vs. 18.5%, p = 0.0245). HRCT revealed a significantly higher incidence of low attenuation in patients with MABC-PD than in those with MAC-PD (63.9% vs. 10.8%, p<0.0001). On analyzing only never-smokers (20 and 47 patients with MABC-PD and MAC-PD, respectively), this significant difference remained (65.0% vs. 8.5%, p<0.0001), suggesting MABC infection itself caused low attenuation. In terms of the distribution of abnormal shadows, the involvement of the right lower, left upper, and left lower lobes was more common in patients with MABC-PD than in those with MAC-PD. Furthermore, the mean number of involved lung lobes was significantly higher in patients with MABC-PD than in those with MAC-PD (5.6 vs. 4.7, p<0.001). Although further studies are needed, we assume that the aforementioned radiological features of MABC-PD are due to the high virulence of MABC."
https://openalex.org/W4286493086,"Introduction Globally, childhood mortality is an important public health concern. In Ghana, both diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are among the top five causes of morbidity and mortality among children under five years old (CU5). Yet, there is a paucity of studies on the comorbidity of diarrhoea and ARIs in CU5 in Ghana. Aim This study sought to examine factors associated with comorbidity of diarrhoea and ARIs among CU5 in Ghana. Methods The Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) 2014 was used for this study. A total of 932 CU5 who had at least one morbidity were included in the study. Binary logistic regression was used to predict the factors associated with comorbidity among CU5. Results The prevalence of comorbidity of diarrhoea and ARI among CU5 was 11%. Factors including unimproved source of water, unimproved main floor material, age of child, and initiation of breastmilk were significantly associated with comorbidity of diarrhea and ARI. Improved source of water (AOR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.22–0.78; p = 0.01) reduces the likelihood of having comorbidity than unimproved source of water. Children aged 36–47 months were less likely (AOR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.14–0.93; p = 0.04) to have comorbidity than those aged 48–59 months. Also, improved floor materials (AOR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.22–0.95; p = 0.03) reduces the likelihood of having comorbidity than unimproved floor materials. Children breastfed within the first day of birth were more likely (AOR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.01–0.2.72; p = 0.04) to have comorbidity than those breastfed immediately after birth. Conclusion Policymakers and health practitioners should consider risk factors such as age of child, initiation of breastfeeding, unimproved floor material, and unimproved water supply in the design of interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with comorbidity of diarrhoea and ARI among CU5."
https://openalex.org/W4286495463,"As automated driving technology continues to develop, studies are being conducted to develop various scenarios for assessing the functional safety, failure safety, and mobility of automated vehicles (AVs). As the commercialization of AVs progresses, it is necessary to develop a set of test scenarios for new car assessment programs (NCAPs), so as to provide information on the safety and reliability of AVs to consumers. To provide valuable information regarding newly emerged AVs to consumers who are willing to purchase them, it is necessary to derive specific and well-defined test scenarios based on the safety-in-use. Accordingly, to apply NCAPs to AVs, this study established test scenarios targeting freeways where AVs were expected to be commercialized. To this end, based on freeway traffic accident data and opinions of traffic safety and AV experts, we derived possible dangerous situations when an AV is maintaining a lane on a freeway. Functional scenarios were defined based on the derived dangerous situations. The priority of the defined functional scenarios was set using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Accordingly, this study presents a logical and concrete scenario construction methodology for deriving the ranges and values of test parameters for functional scenarios."

We investigated their clinical characteristics, outcomes, and relationship with body fat deposition and muscle mass.The case group included asymptomatic 137 individuals with ""elevated AFP level"" (R772) diagnostic code from 2009 to 2018 in a tertiary hospital. The control group enrolled 274 age- and sex-matched patients with <5 cm hepatic hemangiomas. Hepatic, visceral, and psoas muscle adiposity and psoas muscle index (PMI) were measured in the subgroups of 45 cases and 90 controls with pre-contrast computed tomography (CT) images.The case group (mean age 47.5 years, male 35.8%) showed higher AFP levels (10.3 vs 2.5 ng/mL, p<0.001) and total bilirubin (0.8 vs 0.7 mg/dL, p<0.001), but a lower body mass index (22.2 vs 23.3 kg/m2, p = 0.011) and alanine aminotransferase levels (17.0 vs 19.0 IU/L, p = 0.047) than the controls. During 13 months of median follow-up, there was no cancer or liver disease development. The AFP levels were stable. In the subgroups with CT images, cases showed a lower proportion of hepatic steatosis (4.4% vs 18.9%, p = 0.023), higher psoas muscle attenuation (48.2 vs 43.8 Hounsfield units, p<0.001) and higher PMI (5.7 vs 4.2 cm2/m2, p<0.001) than the controls.Elevated AFP levels in asymptomatic individuals may play a role in expressing a protective phenotype against hepatic steatosis, myosteatosis, and sarcopenia. AFP levels in patients with elevated AFP were stable during follow-up without liver injury or cancer development. Interaction between AFP expression and steatosis warrants further study."
https://openalex.org/W4286497586,"Hypertension or hypotension prevails as a comorbidity in patients with heart failure (HF). Although blood pressure (BP) is an important factor in managing the mortality of HF, the molecular mechanisms of changes in BP have not been clearly understood in cases of HF. We and others have demonstrated that a loss in PRDM16 causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, leading to HF. We aimed to determine whether BP is altered in mice that experience cardiac loss of Prdm16 and identify the underlying mechanism of BP-associated changes. BP decreased significantly only in female mice with a cardiac-null mutation of Prdm16 compared with controls, by an invasive protocol under anesthesia and by telemetric method during conscious, unrestrained status. Mice with a cardiac loss of Prdm16 had higher heart-to-body weight ratios and upregulated atrial natriuretic peptide, suggesting cardiac hypertrophy. Plasma aldosterone-to-renin activity ratios and plasma sodium levels decreased in Prdm16 -deficient mice versus control. By RNA-seq and in subsequent functional analyses, Prdm16 -null hearts were enriched in factors that regulate BP, including Adra1a , Nos1 , Nppa , and Nppb . The inhibition of nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) reverted the decrease in BP in cardiac-specific Prdm16 knockout mice. Mice with cardiac deficiency of Prdm16 present with hypotension and cardiac hypertrophy. Further, our findings suggest that the increased expression of NOS1 causes hypotension in mice with a cardiac-null mutation of Prdm16 . These results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of hypotension in subjects with HF and contribute to our understanding of how hypotension develops in patients with HF."

The quadratic inference functions in myopic regret-regression (QIF-MRr) can be used to estimate the parameters of the mean response at each visit, conditional on previous states and actions. Singularity issues may arise during computation when estimating the parameters in ODTR using QIF-MRr due to multicollinearity. Hence, the ridge penalty was introduced in rQIF-MRr to tackle the issues. A simulation study and an application to anticoagulation dataset were conducted to investigate the model’s performance in parameter estimation. The results show that estimations using rQIF-MRr are more efficient than the QIF-MRr."

However, the mechanism by which pregnancy at old age reduces the race performance of the offspring is unknown. Here, two hypotheses were posited: 1) Foals born to older mares are more likely to have muscular, skeletal, and cognitive disadvantages (direct effects). 2) Foals born to older mares are more likely to be affected by non-physiological factors correlating with the mare’s age, such as the quality of sires (e.g. low-quality sires are likely to be chosen as partners of older broodmares). To test these hypotheses, the effect of the broodmare’s age on the offspring’s racing performance was examined, while controlling for the effects of the stallion’s quality, age, and ID, offspring’s sex, trainer, and the location of the training center. Information of racehorses registered to the Japan Racing Association were collected from the Japan Bloodhorse Breeders’ Association website. Overall, results showed that the racing performance of horses born from older mares was lower than that of horses born from younger mares. However, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) indicated that the quality of sires was significantly associated with the offspring’s racing performance, rather than the broodmare’s age itself. Furthermore, the age of broodmares was negatively correlated with the quality of sires, although the variance inflation factor was low. Therefore, the effect of maternal aging was negligible or only limited, and rather, the sire’s quality had an important influence on the offspring’s racing performance. Low quality sires, or cheap stallions in other words, are likely to be chosen as partners of older blood-mares, which may have reproductive risks such as lower fertility and higher rate of miscarriages. The present study suggests that the conventional belief that racehorses born from older mares show lower performance may not always be accurate."
