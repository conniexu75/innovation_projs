https://openalex.org/W2019508559,"Productive infection of human T lymphocytes by HIV-1 is dependent upon proliferation of the infected cell. Nonproliferating quiescent T cells can be infected by HIV-1 and harbor the virus in an inactive state until subsequent mitogenic stimulation. We use a modification of the polymerase chain reaction method, which is both sensitive and quantitative, to demonstrate that HIV-1 DNA synthesis is initiated in infected quiescent T cells at levels comparable with those of activated T cells. However, unlike that of activated T cells, the viral genome is not completely reverse transcribed in quiescent cells. Although this viral DNA structure can persist in quiescent cells as a latent form, it is labile. We discuss the lability of this HIV-1 DNA structure in relation to a ""self-restricting persistent infection"" by HIV-1 and propose that this may explain the low percentage of infected cells in the circulation of AIDS patients."

https://openalex.org/W1986672594,"The alpha chain of the human histocompatibility antigen HLA-G was identified as an array of five 37- to 39-kilodalton isoforms by the use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Both cell-associated and secreted HLA-G antigens are prominent in first trimester villous cytotrophoblasts and are greatly reduced in third trimester cytotrophoblasts. Allelic variation was not detected, an indication that HLA-G is not obviously polymorphic in cytotrophoblasts. Among the following choriocarcinoma cell lines studied, HLA-G is expressed in JEG but not in Jar or BeWo. Expression of endogenous HLA-G genes has not been found in normal lymphoid cells. Thus, HLA-G is subject to both cell type-specific and developmental regulation and is expressed in early gestation human cytotrophoblasts."

https://openalex.org/W2098329073,"A crude rat liver mitochondrial fraction that was capable of the rapid, linked synthesis of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) labeled from [3-3H] serine has been fractionated. PtdSer synthase, PtdEtn methyltransferase, and CDP-choline:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase activities were present in the crude mitochondrial preparation but were absent from highly purified mitochondria and could be attributed to the presence of a membrane fraction, X. Thus, previous claims of the mitochondrial location of some of these enzymes might be explained by the presence of fraction X in the mitochondrial preparation. Fraction X had many similarities to microsomes except that it sedimented with mitochondria (at 10,000 x g). However, the specific activities of PtdSer synthase and glucose-6-phosphate phosphatase in fraction X were almost twice that of microsomes, and the specific activities of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase and NADPH:cytochrome c reductase in fraction X were much lower than in microsomes. The marker enzymes for mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, lysosomes, and peroxisomes all had low activities in fraction X. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed distinct differences, as well as similarities, among the proteins of fraction X, microsomes, and rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The combined mitochondria-fraction X membranes can synthesize PtdSer, PtdEtn, and PtdCho from serine. Thus, fraction X in combination with mitochondria might be responsible for the observed compartmentalization of a serine-labeled pool of phospholipids previously identified (Vance, J. E., and Vance, D. E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4486-4491) and might be involved in the transfer of lipids between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2026452824,"The mechanism by which erythropoietin controls mammalian erythrocyte production is unknown. Labeling experiments in vitro with [3H]thymidine demonstrated DNA cleavage in erythroid progenitor cells that was accompanied by DNA repair and synthesis. Erythropoietin reduced DNA cleavage by a factor of 2.6. In the absence of erythropoietin, erythroid progenitor cells accumulated DNA cleavage fragments characteristic of those found in programmed cell death (apoptosis) by 2 to 4 hours and began dying by 16 hours. In the presence of erythropoietin, the progenitor cells survived and differentiated into reticulocytes. Thus, apoptosis is a major component of normal erythropoiesis, and erythropoietin controls erythrocyte production by retarding DNA breakdown and preventing apoptosis in erythroid progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2088639594,"The eukaryotic upstream binding factor (UBF), recognizes the ribosomal RNA gene promoter and activates transcription mediated by RNA polymerase I through cooperative interactions with the species-specific factor, SL1. Isolation of complementary DNA clones and sequence analysis reveals similarities between DNA binding domains of human UBF (hUBF) and high mobility group (HMG) protein 1. Expression, cellular localization and in vitro transcription studies establish that cloned hUBF encodes a nucleolar factor that binds specifically to the upstream control element and core of the rRNA gene promoter to activate transcription in a binding site-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2040859404,"The organization of the visual cortex has been considered to be highly stable in adult mammals. However, 5° to 10° lesions of the retina in the contralateral eye markedly altered the systematic representations of the retina in primary and secondary visual cortex when matched inputs from the ipsilateral eye were also removed. Cortical neurons that normally have receptive fields in the lesioned region of the retina acquired new receptive fields in portions of the retina surrounding the lesions. The capacity for such changes may be important for normal adjustments of sensory systems to environmental contingencies and for recoveries from brain damage."
https://openalex.org/W2061846866,"Coat protein gp120 from the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) increased intracellular free calcium and injured rodent retinal ganglion cells and hippocampal neurons in culture. Highly purified recombinant gp120 envelope protein produced these effects in a dose-dependent fashion at picomolar concentrations. Immunoprecipitation with antibody to gp120, but not with control immunoglobulin-containing serum, depleted solutions of the viral envelope protein and also prevented both the rise in intracellular calcium and neuronal toxicity. The gp120-induced increase in intracellular calcium was abrogated by transiently lowering extracellular calcium or by adding the dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist nimodipine (100 nM). Calcium channel antagonists also prevented gp120-induced neuronal injury. In addition, intracellular stores appeared to contribute substantially to the increase in calcium elicited by gp120. Since increases in intracellular calcium have been associated with neurotoxicity, it is possible that an injurious effect of gp120 on neurons might be related to this mechanism and that treatment with calcium channel antagonists may prove useful in mitigating HIV-1-related neuronal injury."
https://openalex.org/W1968745068,"Measurements at the Jungfraujoch High Mountain Station (Swiss Alps, 47 degrees N, 3576 meters above sea level) indicate that there has been a slight increase of about 1 percent per year in the flux of solar ultraviolet-B radiation (290 to 330 nanometers) since 1981. A Robertson-Berger detector was used to measure solar erythemal radiation. The increase can be related to a long-term ozone depletion."
https://openalex.org/W1975045802,"The full-length cDNA for a transcriptional activator, DBP, that binds to the D site of the albumin promoter has been cloned. DBP belongs to a family of related transcription factors including Fos, Jun, CREB, and C/EBP, which share a conserved basic domain. However, unlike most other members of this family, DBP does not contain a ""leucine zipper"" structure. Among several rat tissues tested, significant levels of its protein are only observed in liver; yet, with the exception of testis, DBP mRNA is present in all of the examined tissues. DBP as well as its mRNA accumulate to significant levels only in adult animals. During chemically induced liver regeneration, DBP expression is rapidly down-regulated, suggesting that DBP may be involved in the proliferation control of hepatocytes. This cell growth-dependent expression of DBP, in contrast to its tissue specificity, appears to be controlled at the level of mRNA accumulation."

https://openalex.org/W2023887263,"Tandem mass spectrometry has been used to obtain information related to portions of the primary sequence for an intact protein, bovine ribonuclease A. Multiply charged molecular ions, generated by electrospray ionization, were collisionally dissociated at low energies in a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer to yield singly and multiply charged fragment ions that can be assigned to the known sequence of the protein. Dissociation of the highly charged molecular ions resulted in pairs of complementary product ions. The higher order (gas-phase) protein structure affects the dissociation processes, as observed in comparisons of tandem mass spectra of the native and disulfide-reduced forms of ribonuclease A."
https://openalex.org/W1568949465,"Current data indicate that cell adhesion to laminin, the major basement membrane glycoprotein, is mediated by specific integrins, a family of adhesion receptors. In addition, most cell types express a complement of high affinity non-integrin laminin binding proteins (LBPs). Despite considerable effort, the function of these LBPs has not been elucidated. We report here that the major non-integrin LBP of murine macrophages exhibits an Mr of 35,000 and is expressed on the cell surface. Protein microsequencing data revealed that this protein is identical to carbohydrate binding protein 35. This murine galactose-specific lectin is the macrophage antigen Mac-2. Thus, these data suggest that the non-integrin LBPs may contribute to laminin adhesion by a mechanism involving protein-carbohydrate interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2063836127,"Light-dependent expression of rbcS, the gene encoding the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, which is the key enzyme involved in carbon fixation in higher plants, is regulated at the transcriptional level. Sequence analysis of the gene has uncovered a conserved GT motif in the -150 to -100 region of many rbcS promoters. This motif serves as the binding site of a nuclear factor, designated GT-1. Analysis of site-specific mutants of pea rbcS-3A promoter demonstrated that GT-1 binding in vitro is correlated with light-responsive expression of the rbcS promoter in transgenic plants. However, it is not known whether factors other than GT-1 might also be required for activation of transcription by light. A synthetic tetramer of box II (TGTGTGGTTAATATG), the GT-1 binding site located between -152 to -138 of the rbcS-3A promoter, inserted upstream of a truncated cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter is sufficient to confer expression in leaves of transgenic tobacco. This expression occurs principally in chloroplast-containing cells, is induced by light, and is correlated with the ability of box II to bind GT-1 in vitro. The data show that the binding site for GT-1 is likely to be a part of the molecular light switch for rbcS activation."
https://openalex.org/W1524025855,"Active eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography, using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that reacts with the highly conserved heptapeptide repeat of the largest subunit. This mAb (designated SWG16) was conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose and used to purify RNAP II from wheat germ and calf thymus. The subunit composition of the immunoaffinity-purified enzyme was essentially the same as RNAP II purified by conventional chromatography except that it contained only the form with the unproteolyzed largest subunit. Active enzyme could be eluted from the SWG16-Sepharose, at pH 7.9, with combinations of low molecular weight polyols and nonchaotropic salts. The superior eluting procedure used combinations of ethylene glycol (30-40%) and ammonium sulfate (0.5-0.75 M). Active enzyme also could be eluted with a synthetic peptide containing four repeats of the heptapeptide; however, the peptide was not as effective as the polyol and salt combinations for eluting the enzyme. This mAb should be useful for purifying RNAP II from many eukaryotic species. Because the elution of enzyme from the immunoadsorbent seems to be dependent upon the presence of a polyol, this antibody is referred to as a mAb. A procedure that helps to identify a polyol-responsive mAb and to optimize the eluting conditions is described. Polyol-responsive mAbs might have broad applicability to the purification of many labile enzymes by immunoaffinity chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1510205119,"A new enzyme, phenylacetyl-CoA ligase (AMP-forming) (PA-CoA ligase, EC 6.2.1-) involved in the catabolism of phenylacetic acid (PAA) in Pseudomonas putida is described and characterized. PA-CoA ligase was specifically induced by PAA when P. putida was grown in a chemically defined medium in which phenylacetic acid was the sole carbon source. Hydroxyl, methyl-phenylacetyl derivatives, and other PAA close structural molecules did not induce the synthesis of this enzyme and neither did acetic, butyric, succinic, nor fatty acids (greater than C5 atoms carbon length). PA-CoA ligase requires ATP, CoA, PAA, and MgCl2 for its activity. The maximal rate of catalysis was achieved in 50 mM HCl/Tris buffer, pH 8.2, at 30 degrees C and under these conditions, the Km calculated for ATP, CoA, and PAA were 9.7, 1.0, and 16.5 mM, respectively. The enzyme is inhibited by some divalent cations (Cu2+, Zn2+, and Hg2+) and by the sulfhydryl reagents N-ethylmaleimide, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and p-chloromercuribenzoate. PA-CoA ligase was purified to homogeneity (513-fold). It runs as a single polypeptide in 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and has a molecular mass of 48 +/- 1 kDa. PA-CoA ligase does not use as substrate either 3-hydroxyphenylacetic, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic, or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acids and shows a substrate specificity different from other acyl-CoA-activating enzymes. The enzyme is detected in P. putida from the early logarithmic phase of growth and is repressed by glucose, suggesting that PA-CoA ligase is a specific enzyme involved in the utilization of PAA as energy source."
https://openalex.org/W1590684642,"The factors necessary to dissociate iron from transferrin in endocytic vesicles and to mobilize the iron across the vesicle membrane were studied in a preparation of endocytic vesicles markedly enriched in transferrin-transferrin receptor complexes isolated from rabbit reticulocytes. Vesicles were prepared with essentially fully saturated transferrin by incubating the reticulocytes with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone prior to incubation with 59Fe, 125I-transferrin with or without fluorescein isothiocyanate labeling. Initiation of acidification by the addition of ATP was sufficient to achieve dissociation of 59Fe from transferrin with a rate constant of 0.054 +/- 0.06 s-1. Mobilization of 59Fe out of the vesicles required, besides ATP, the addition of a reductant with 1 mM ascorbate, allowing approximately 60% mobilization at 10 min with a rate constant of 0.0038 +/- 0.0006 s-1. An NADH:ferricyanide reductase activity could be demonstrated in the vesicles with an activity of 7.1 x 10(-9) mol of NADH reduced per min/mg of vesicle protein. Both dissociation and mobilization were inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone, and monensin. Mobilization, but not dissociation, was inhibited by the permeant Fe(II) chelator alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl. The Fe(III) chelators deferoxamine, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and apotransferrin did not promote mobilization of dissociated iron in the absence of a reductant. This study establishes the basis for the cellular incorporation of iron through the endocytic pathway in which the endocytic vesicle membrane utilizes, in a sequential way, an acidification system, an iron reduction system, and an Fe(II) transporter system."
https://openalex.org/W2027813307,"Abdominal segmentation of the Drosophila embryo requires the activities of the gap genes Krüppel (Kr), knirps (kni), and tailless (tll). They control the expression of the pair-rule gene hairy (h) by activating or repressing independent cis-acting units that generate individual stripes. Kr activates stripe 5 and represses stripe 6, kni activates stripe 6 and represses stripe 7, and tll activates stripe 7. Kr and kni proteins bind strongly to h control units that generate stripes in areas of low concentration of the respective gap gene products and weakly to those that generate stripes in areas of high gap gene expression. These results indicate that Kr and kni proteins form overlapping concentration gradients that generate the periodic pair-rule expression pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1519773895,"Collagen II, the major component of cartilage, is synthesized primarily by chondrocytes and by certain cells in the eye. Previously, we have studied the regulatory regions of the collagen II gene by DNA transfection assays (Horton, W., Miyashita, T., Kohno, K., and Yamada, Y. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 8864-8868). These studies show that both the promoter and an enhancer sequence in the first intron are required for high transcriptional activity in chondrocytes. These elements do not show significant activity in cells which do not synthesize collagen II, such as in muscle cells and fibroblasts. In this report, we have constructed plasmids containing various deletions of the promoter of the collagen II gene, fused to a reporter gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and transfected them into both chick embryonic fibroblasts and HeLa cells. We have found that silencer elements in the collagen II promoter region reduce CAT activity 11-fold in fibroblasts, while not affecting the enhancer-mediated transcription in chondrocytes. Deletions in the promoter showed that most of the silencing activity was localized in two sites, between -360 and -460 base pairs and between -620 and -700 base pairs. Furthermore, a fragment containing these two sequences in a thymidine kinase promoter CAT construct reduced the activity of the promoter in an orientation independent fashion. Sequence analysis revealed that the two silencer regions are homologous and contain consensus motifs for silencer elements found in other genes. Gel retardation experiments showed that nuclear factors from HeLa cells bind specifically to a DNA fragment containing the silencer, whereas chondrocyte nuclear extracts did not show any activity. Thus, our study indicates that the expression of the collagen II gene is controlled by both negative and positive elements to ensure that the gene is only expressed in suitable cells."
https://openalex.org/W1556608266,"Ferritin messenger RNA has been shown to be translationally inactivated by the binding of a cytosolic protein to a 28-nucleotide iron-responsive element (IRE) located in the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA. This interaction has been studied using quantitative receptor-ligand binding methods with gel retardation and nitrocellulose filter binding assays for the separation of bound complex from free RNA. In competition assays the entire 5'-untranslated region and the isolated IRE bound identically. The specificity of the RNA binding was studied using IRE variants. Two IREs from transferrin receptor mRNA and several variants with single base substitutions in the stem or loop had similar affinities. RNAs which could not form a stem-loop structure bound 1000-fold less well. These studies demonstrate the importance of the RNA conformation and the relative insensitivity of binding to much of the primary sequence. Saturation assays with increasing concentrations of 32P-IRE resulted in a binding hyperbola characteristic of mass action binding to a single class of sites with a KD = 0.09 nM. At 37 degrees C the dissociation rate is 0.04 min-1 (t 1/2 = 17 min). This rate is fast enough to account for the shift of ferritin RNA from the ribonucleoprotein pool to polysomes after rats are injected with iron. Determination of the concentration of the repressor requires accounting for three interconverting pools: free active repressor, mRNA-bound protein, and inactive (low affinity) repressor. Rat liver cytosol has a concentration of free active repressor of about 1 pmol/mg protein. Protein bound to endogenous mRNA can be measured by pretreatment with micrococcal nuclease or by separation with DEAE-Sepharose chromatography; it is present at a level similar to that of the free active protein. Inclusion of high levels of thiol reductants in the binding incubations reduces the inactive or low affinity repressor, forming unstably activated protein which has the same KD as the endogenous active protein; this inactive or low affinity protein is 2-4 times more abundant. A mechanism for iron regulation is proposed which accounts for the kinetics, the multiple protein pools, and the characteristics of the protein in these pools."
https://openalex.org/W1553219390,"Creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) isoenzymes play a central role in energy transduction. Nuclear genes encode creatine kinase subunits from muscle, brain, and mitochondria (MtCK). We have recently isolated a cDNA clone encoding MtCK from a human placental library which is expressed in many human tissues (Haas, R. C., Korenfeld, C., Zhang, Z., Perryman, B., Roman, D., and Strauss, A. W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2890-2897). With nontranslated and coding region probes, we demonstrated by RNA blot analysis that the MtCK mRNA in sarcomeric muscle is distinct from this placenta-derived, ubiquitous MtCK cDNA. To compare these different mRNAs, a MtCK cDNA clone was isolated from a human heart library and characterized by complete nucleotide sequence analysis. The chemically determined NH2-terminal 26 residues of purified human heart MtCK protein are identical to those predicted from this sarcomeric MtCK cDNA. The human sarcomeric and ubiquitous cDNAs share 73% nucleotide and 80% predicted amino acid sequence identities, but have less than 66% identity with the cytosolic creatine kinases. The sarcomeric MtCK cDNA encodes a 419-amino acid protein which contains a 39-residue transit peptide essential for mitochondrial import. Primer extension analysis predicts a 348-base pair 5'-nontranslated region. RNA blot analysis demonstrates that heart-derived MtCK is sarcomere-specific, but the ubiquitous MtCK mRNA is expressed in most tissues. Thus, separate nuclear genes encode two closely related, tissue-specific isoenzymes of MtCK. Our finding that multiple genes encode different mitochondrial protein isoenzymes is rare."
https://openalex.org/W1966801664,"Formation of the nervous system requires that neuronal growth cones follow specific paths and then stop at recognition signals, sensed at the growth cone's leading edge. We used antibody-coated gold particles viewed by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy to observe the distribution and movement of two cell surface molecules, N-CAM and the 2A1 antigen, on growth cones of cultured cortical neurons. Gold particles are occassionally transported forward at 1–2 μm/s to the leading edge where they are trapped but continue to move. Concentration at the edge persists after cytochalasin D treatment or ATP depletion, but active movements to and along edges cease. We also observed a novel outward movement of small cytoplasmic aggregates at 1.8 μm/s in filopodia. We suggest that active forward transport and trapping involve reversible attachment of antigens to and transport along cytoskeletal elements localized to edges of growth cones."
https://openalex.org/W1565114828,"We have prepared a high buoyant density proteoglycan fraction from the vitreous humor of 13-day-old chick embryos. Using immunoblot analysis coupled with chondroitinase digestion, we demonstrate that the purified preparation is composed predominantly of type IX collagen-like chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with an alpha 1(IX) chain Mr approximately 23,000 shorter than the known alpha 1 in cartilage type IX. Also different from cartilage type IX is the size of the chondroitin sulfate chain attached to the alpha 2(IX) polypeptide; its Mr is approximately 350,000 indicating that it is approximately 10 times larger in vitreous humor than in cartilage. Examination of vitreous bodies at different developmental stages indicates that a transition occurs in the size of alpha 1(IX) in a well defined temporal pattern; at about stage 31, a cartilage-type alpha 1(IX) of Mr 84,000 is the predominant species, whereas at stage 36 and thereafter, a Mr 61,000 species appears with a concomitant disappearance of the Mr 84,000 species. Immunostaining for type IX collagen followed by electron microscopic observation of 13-day-old chick embryo vitreous humor reveals a regular D-periodic arrangement of vitreous type IX collagen proteoglycan along thin fibrils. It seems possible that the chondroitin sulfate chains of extraordinarily high viscosity and high molecular weight may extend away from the fibrils, thus contributing to structural as well as functional properties of this unique matrix."

https://openalex.org/W1562244032,"Apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 mRNA is produced by in vivo RNA editing which involves a C----U conversion of the first base of the codon CAA for Gln-2153, changing it to UAA, an in-frame stop codon. We have reproduced the editing reaction in vitro using nuclear extracts. Efficient RNA editing was demonstrated by using apoB mRNA segments as substrate or in a coupled transcription-editing reaction using apoB minigenes as template. ApoB minigenes were constructed by ligating the adenovirus major late promoter to a fragment of apoB-100 DNA containing the editing site and used for the transcription-editing reaction. We defined the sequence specificity of the editing reaction using site-specific single and multiple base mutants constructed by the polymerase chain reaction. Among 22 different mutant apoB-100 minigene constructs containing mutations in the bases immediately flanking the edited C-6666, 20 were edited in the coupled transcription-editing reaction. The results suggest a relatively lax sequence specificity for apoB mRNA editing. Our observation may have important implications for apoB-48 biogenesis as well as for the editing process as a general biologic regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1534327410,"Analyses of catalytic properties and inhibitor binding were conducted to investigate the molecular basis of active site function of human acid beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.45) expressed from normal and Gaucher disease Type 1 alleles. Comparative studies were conducted with enzymes expressed from natural (spleen and fibroblasts) alleles or from mutagenized cDNAs in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using the baculovirus expression system. Mutant cDNAs containing Thr43 to Lys43 (beta-GlcThr43----Lys) and Asp358 to Glu358 (beta-GlcAsp358----Glu) substitutions and two cDNAs containing Ashkenazi Jewish Gaucher disease Type 1 mutations, Arg120 to Gln120 (beta-GlcArg120----Gln) and Asn370 to Ser370 (beta-GlcAsn370----Ser) were expressed and the gene products characterized by enzymatic, immunologic, and inhibitor studies. Genotypes at the acid beta-glucosidase locus in selected Gaucher disease Type 1 patients were determined by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization of amplified genomic DNA. Compared with normal, recombinant or natural enzymes expressed from beta-GlcAsn370----Ser alleles had about 2-5-fold decreased specific activity based on CRIM (cross-reacting immunologic material). The beta-GlcArg120----Gln cDNA expressed catalytically inactive CRIM in Sf9; consistent with the 9-fold decreased CRIM-specific activity of the natural enzyme from a beta-GlcArg120----Gln/beta-GlcAsn370----Ser genetic compound. The beta-GlcAsp358----Glu cDNA expressed catalytically inactive CRIM in Sf9 cells. The presence of natural or recombinant enzyme expressed from beta-GlcAsn370----Ser alleles was sufficient to confer 3-5-fold increased IC50 values for deoxynojirimycin, glucosylsphingosine, and N-alkyl-glucosylamine derivatives. Progress curves for inhibition by the slow-tight binding N-alkyl-glucosylamines indicated that the beta-Glc-Asn370----Ser mutation did not alter a conformational change induced by these reaction intermediate analogues. These results provide evidence that the beta-GlcArg120----Gln and beta-GlcAsn370----Ser mutations found in Gaucher disease Type 1 patient genomes are the molecular bases of the enzymatic dysfunction. In addition, the region including Arg120 and that encompassing Asp358 and Asn370 contain residues critical to active site formation or participation in the catalytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1594538340,"Intravascular clot formation, localized to the neoplasm, is an early component of the vascular response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/cachectin. Fibrin is closely associated with the endothelial cell surface, and multiple microthromboses lead to reduced blood flow in the tumor. We have identified a tumor-derived mediator which enhances endothelial procoagulant activity and the cellular response to TNF using cultured cells derived from a murine methylcholanthrene A (meth A)-induced fibrosarcoma as a model system. A heat-stable protease K-sensitive polypeptide, Mr approximately 44,000 on nonreduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr approximately 56,000 reduced), was purified approximately 500,000-fold from serum-free culture supernatants of meth A cells by sequential Q-Sepharose, Mono S, reversed phase, and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Based on immunologic criteria, biologic activity, and other molecular properties, meth A factor appears to be distinct from other cytokines and growth factors. Purified meth A factor induced transcription of the tissue factor gene and expression of procoagulant activity by cultured human endothelium (half-maximal effect for the latter at approximately 6-8 pM). Furthermore, co-incubation of endothelium with meth A factor together with TNF enhanced induction of tissue factor in a more than additive manner. These data indicate that certain tumors elaborate an apparently unique molecule which can alter hemostatic properties of the vessel wall, potentially modulating reactivity of the tumor vasculature to host response mediators."
https://openalex.org/W1485500229,"A method to purify the phytochrome photoreceptor from the unicellular green alga Mesotaenium caldariorum is presented. Preparative scale formation of algal protoplasts and controlled osmotic cell lysis have permitted separation of intact organelles from the phytochrome-enriched soluble protein fraction. We have utilized the observation that red light-absorbing (Pr) and far-red light-absorbing (Pfr) forms of phytochrome are differentially retained on an anion exchange matrix to purify M. caldariorum phytochrome to apparent homogeneity. M. caldariorum phytochrome preparations with A650/A280 ratios greater than 0.78 exhibit a single 120-kDa band on silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblot analyses using a cross-reactive pea phytochrome monoclonal antibody reveal that 1) the 120-kDa band represents the full-length polypeptide, 2) phytochrome is predominantly localized in the algal cytoplasm, and 3) there are 150,000-250,000 phytochrome molecules/cell. Steric exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography analysis under nondenaturing conditions indicates that M. caldariorum phytochrome has an apparent mass of 355 kDa. The absorption maxima for Pr and Pfr are 650 and 722 nm, respectively. Both are blue-shifted compared with those of phytochromes from dark-grown angiosperm tissue. The molar absorption coefficient for Pr at 650 nm is 86,800 +/- 2800 liter mol-1 cm-1, which is lower than that of higher plant phytochromes. The significance of the similarities and differences of the molecular properties of phytochromes from M. caldariorum and higher plant sources is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1560954467,"In previous investigations, cell fusion was found to silence either the endogenous rat growth hormone (GH) gene or a transfected rat GH gene promoter, implying that repression plays a role in regulation of this gene. To search the rat GH gene promoter for repressor sequences, a series of 5'-deleted GH-CAT constructs was analyzed by transient expression in GH3 rat pituitary cells. Deletion of either a distal region between positions -307/-244 or a proximal sequence between -169/-152 increased CAT enzymatic activity by 3-4-fold. Since the action of the proximal repressor element (PRE) at -169/-152 was serum-independent, and the element is located between two strong positive elements, the PRE and its cognate binding proteins were further analyzed. A 5-base pair sequence centered at -163 is critical for PRE repressor activity, since mutation of this sequence in GH-CAT constructs yielded 6-11-fold increases in expression in GH3 cells. Although the PRE is adjacent to the GH thyroid hormone (T3) response region, they are distinct elements, since the PRE mutation has little effect on the T3 response of GH-CAT constructs. Nuclear extracts of 10 cell lines were searched by DNA mobility shift for protein(s) binding specifically to a double-stranded PRE probe. No such protein was detected in any of four rodent pituitary cell lines or three human cell lines. However, three different rodent non-pituitary cell lines yielded a common shifted band, corresponding to a DNA sequence-specific PRE-binding protein (PREB). Similar analysis with the coding strand of the PRE detected no shifted band in any of these cell lines. However, the PRE noncoding strand yielded a common shifted band in all of the cell lines, corresponding to a ubiquitous, strand-specific, single-stranded PRE-binding protein (ssPREB). Mutation of the PRE permitted ssPREB binding to the coding strand, implying that the wild-type coding strand somehow excludes ssPREB binding. That PREB and ssPREB are distinct proteins was confirmed by the inability of their DNA binding sites to cross-compete binding of the proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1507239910,"Functional characterization of the 5'-regulatory region of the human factor IX gene was carried out by a series of gene dissection analyses. The region extending from -175 to -274 of the 5' end flanking sequence is required for the expression of this gene. Within this region, sequence elements AGCCACT at -238 and TCAAAT at -187 were assigned as the functional CAAT box and TATA box, respectively. The transcription initiation site was found to be at -150 for the factor IX chloramphenicol acetyltransferase chimeric gene. A negative regulatory (silencer) activity was located in the region spanning from 1.4 to 1.7 kilobases upstream of the promoter region. This region contains a short sequence element (ATCCTCTCC) known to have such activity. A strong promoter on the opposite strand was also located about 500 base pairs upstream of the promoter. The expression of factor IX gene was highly liver specific, as assessed by Northern blot analysis. Short sequence elements (TGGACC and CTTTGGACT) homologous to the known liver-specific elements were located in the vicinity of the defined promoter region."
https://openalex.org/W1544341472,"A previously studied species of ubiquitin-protein ligase contains specific sites for the binding of basic (Type I) and bulky hydrophobic (Type II) NH2-terminal amino acid residues of protein substrates. We now describe another enzyme that ligates ubiquitin specifically to proteins that have NH2-terminal residues other than the above two categories (Type III substrates). The new species of ligase, that we call E3 beta, is separable from the formerly described ligase (termed E3 alpha) by affinity chromatography on protein substrate columns. E3 beta was partially purified from extracts of rabbit reticulocytes and was shown to be required for the breakdown of Type III proteins. Apart from its different substrate specificity, it resembles E3 alpha in some physical properties, in a requirement for ubiquitin carrier protein (E2) for conjugate formation, and in its action to ligate multiple ubiquitin units to the substrate protein. The denatured derivative of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease is a specific substrate for E3 alpha, while that of ribonuclease S-protein is a good substrate for E3 beta. Since S-protein is formed by the removal from ribonuclease of NH2-terminal S-peptide, it is suggested that E3 beta interacts with an NH2-terminal determinant exposed in ribonuclease S-protein."
https://openalex.org/W1579835890,"Primer recognition proteins (PRP) are cofactors of DNA polymerase alpha and may have a role in lagging strand DNA replication. Purified PRP from HeLa cells and human placenta are composed of two subunits of 36,000 (PRP 1) and 41,000 (PRP 2) daltons. Upon tryptic digestion, amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides, and homology search against a protein sequence data base, we have identified PRP 2 to be the glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). The activities of PRP and PGK increase coordinately in the PRP purification procedure. PRP activity is inhibited by the PGK substrate 3-phosphoglycerate and the competitive inhibitor of substrate binding, DL-alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate. 5'-p-Fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine, which inactivates PGK by binding to the nucleotide binding site, also inhibits PRP. For PRP activity, the two substrate binding sites of PGK are necessary in addition to the as yet unidentified PRP 1 polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1489113213,"We examined the role of cholesterol in altering the activity of the microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme, cholesterol-NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase). Liposomes were used to deliver cholesterol to hepatic microsomes. Formation of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol was quantitated by isotope dilution/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. As the liposomal cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio increased, 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity increased, whereas the activity of another microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme, ethylmorphine N-demethylase, decreased. To determine if the degree of stimulation was affected by the endogenous activity (without liposomes), microsomes, from rats fed chow alone or chow containing cholestyramine, taurocholate, or cholesterol were challenged with cholesterol-enriched liposomes. The degree of stimulation was dependent upon the endogenous activity: cholestyramine-fed much greater than cholesterol = chow control greater than taurocholate-fed. To determine if cholesterol stimulates 7 alpha-hydroxylase by increasing membrane viscosity, microsomes were incubated with liposomes having the same cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio as microsomes, but different viscosities. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (high viscosity) liposomes increased microsomal viscosity and decreased 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. In contrast, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (low viscosity) liposomes decreased microsomal viscosity and increased enzyme activity. Since greater viscosity inhibits 7 alpha-hydroxylase, cholesterol cannot stimulate the enzyme by increasing membrane viscosity. The data suggest that cholesterol stimulates production of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol by providing substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1505385827,"The Fe-protein and the MoFe-protein of the Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase complex can be chemically cross-linked by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (Willing, A., Georgiadis, M.M., Rees, D. C., and Howard, J. B. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8499-8503). In this reaction, one of the identical subunits of the Fe-protein dimer is linked by an isopeptide bond to each beta-subunit of the MoFe-protein tetramer. The reaction has been found to be highly specific with greater than 85% of amino acid residues Glu-112 (Fe-protein) and Lys-399 (MoFe-protein) cross-linked to each other. Although Glu-112 is located in a highly conserved amino acid sequence, it is found in only half of the known Fe-protein sequences. Likewise, Lys-399 is not a conserved residue in the MoFe-protein. Glu-112 appears to be part of an anionic cluster of nine carboxylic acids which is located between the proposed thiol ligands for the Fe:S center. In contrast, the basic residue cluster which includes Lys-399 has been found in only in the Azotobacter MoFe-protein. Thus, this crosslinking reaction either is unique to Azotobacter nitrogenase or must involve other residues in the MoFe-protein of other species. Because Lys-399 and Glu-112 form a specific cross-link, it is probable that they are part of the interaction site leading to productive complex formation. This information should be useful for the model building of the complex from the crystallographic structures of the individual components."
https://openalex.org/W1480492790,"Procarboxypeptidases are the remaining major digestive zymogens the activation process of which remains unsolved. Here it is shown that in the tryptic activation of monomeric procarboxypeptidase A from porcine pancreas, the generation of carboxypeptidase A (CPA) activity parallels the limited proteolysis of the 94-residue activation segment. This degradation proceeds from the COOH-terminal end of the molecule, and CPA itself makes an important and unexpected contribution by excising the COOH-terminal arginine residue of the released primary activation fragment. Successive cleavages at some of the peptide bonds of the activation segment nearest to the COOH terminus were found to be of prime importance in eliciting CPA activity, particularly those involving the carbonyl groups of Arg94 and Gly93 which were first cleaved. It is also shown that the rate of activation does not depend directly upon the generation of CPA-alpha and its conversion to CPA-beta."
https://openalex.org/W1600852755,"We have studied a Drosophila gene that encodes multiple neuropeptides related to Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (FMRFamide). Using a combination of genomic sequencing, Northern blot analysis, primer extensions, and nuclease protection assays, we have described its organization and expression. The results indicate that this Drosophila neuropeptide gene contains two exons separated by an intron of approximately 2.5 kilobase pairs, and that its expression is limited to a single predominant RNA species of approximately 1.7 kilobases. The FMRFamide gene contains a 5' untranslated region that is 106 nucleotides long and is encoded in its entirety by exon I. The open reading frame (encoding a 347-amino acid neuropeptide precursor) begins with the first nucleotide of exon II."
https://openalex.org/W1532861921,"One potential biosynthetic route to the prostaglandins involves the participation of lipoxygenase and allene oxide synthase enzymes, giving a hydroxylated allene oxide, which then might cyclize to form prostaglandin A or a close analogue. We have tested a model of this type of transformation using 8-hydroxy-15S-hydroperoxy eicosanoids as substrates for the dehydrase (allene oxide synthase) in flaxseed. Four of these substrates, each with a 9E,11Z,13E-conjugated triene, gave an observable rate of reaction. The two derived from eicosapentaenoic acid reacted more rapidly than the corresponding arachidonic acid analogues. Also, the 8S-hydroxy-15S-hydroperoxy diastereomers reacted more rapidly than their 8R-hydroxy analogues. Products were characterized by high pressure liquid chromatography, UV, gas chromatography-mass specrometry, 1H NMR, and CD. Reaction of the (8S)-hydroxy-(15S)-hydroperoxy-eicosapentaenoic acid gave two alpha-ketols [8S),15-dihydroxy-14-oxoeicosa-5Z,9E,11Z,17Z+ ++-tetraenoic acid and the corresponding 11E isomer in a 2:1 ratio), together with four prostaglandin A3 analogues which differed in the configurations of the side chains. Oxygen 18 labeling fully supported the intermediacy of an allene oxide in the biosynthesis. The corresponding 8R substrate was converted to the enantiomers of these products plus three 13-hydroxy-14,15-epoxy derivatives. The arachidonate analogues formed the epoxy-hydroxy derivatives, the alpha-ketols, and two prostaglandin A2 analogues with trans configuration of the side chains. These results demonstrate (i) a feasible route of metabolism of lipoxygenase products to hydroxy allene oxide, (ii) the potential for the resulting allene oxide to cyclize to a prostaglandin A analogue, and (iii) the marked influence of the hydroxyl configuration of the rate of reaction and resulting profile of products. Some of these reactions may occur in a natural pathway of prostanoid biosynthesis in corals and other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1486472321,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) elicits a wide variety of responses in target cells by binding to cell surface receptors, but the signal transduced from these receptors in unclear. We examined the role of two different second messenger systems in the regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor, type 2 (PAI-2) induction by TNF in SK-MEL-109 melanoma cells. Synthesis of PAI-2 and transcription of its mRNA could be induced by a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol myristate acetate. In addition, induction of PAI-2 synthesis by TNF was blocked by two PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride. The inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, N-[2-(methylamino)-ethyl]-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide dihydrochloride, was much less effective in decreasing PAI-2 synthesis. Staurosporine and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride also inhibited both TNF- and phorbol myristate acetate-induced PAI-2 mRNA accumulation. We measured the binding of 3H-labeled phorbol dibutyrate to membrane and cytosol fractions of TNF-treated SK-MEL-109 cells and found a transient redistribution of 3H-labeled phorbol dibutyrate binding from cytosol to membrane fractions in response to TNF. In contrast to the positive regulation by PKC in promoting TNF-induced PAI-2 synthesis cAMP inhibited this response. Pretreatment of cells with agents that raise intracellular cAMP levels completely abolished TNF-induced PAI-2 synthesis. Addition of cAMP-elevating agents during TNF induction could also block PAI-2 synthesis. PAI-2 mRNA accumulation in response to TNF was inhibited, but not completely abolished, by cAMP-elevating agents, suggesting that cAMP also exerted its inhibitory effect at the translation level. The positive regulation of a TNF response by PKC and its negative modulation by cAMP may provide a means for intracellular coordination of signals from interacting extracellular factors in regulating TNF responses in different target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1578401300,"The differentiation of chicken endochondral chondrocyte can be induced in vitro by transferring to suspension culture dedifferentiated chondrocytes grown as adherent cells. During the differentiation process, the synthesis of type I collagen is repressed while the genes encoding type II, IX, and X collagens are gradually activated. The changes in the steady-state levels of the mRNAs for type I, IX, and X collagens were shown to be fully accounted for by proportional modifications in the rates of specific gene transcription (Castagnola, P., Dozin, B., Moro, G., and Cancedda, R. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 106, 461-467). In the present report, we demonstrate that the cellular accumulation of type II collagen mRNA in differentiating chondrocyte is regulated not only at the transcription level but also through a stabilization of the RNA transcript as shown by the enhanced half-life of the mRNA in differentiated cells treated with actinomycin D. We also give evidence that this additional mechanism: 1) is specific for type II collagen, 2) does not occur at an early stage of differentiation when type II collagen mRNA starts accumulating, 3) affects only the cytoplasmic form of the RNA transcript."
