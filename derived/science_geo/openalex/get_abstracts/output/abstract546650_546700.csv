https://openalex.org/W2172653884,"Exosomes regulate cell behavior by binding to and delivering their cargo to target cells; however, the mechanisms mediating exosome-cell interactions are poorly understood. Heparan sulfates on target cell surfaces can act as receptors for exosome uptake, but the ligand for heparan sulfate on exosomes has not been identified. Using exosomes isolated from myeloma cell lines and from myeloma patients, we identify exosomal fibronectin as a key heparan sulfate-binding ligand and mediator of exosome-cell interactions. We discovered that heparan sulfate plays a dual role in exosome-cell interaction; heparan sulfate on exosomes captures fibronectin, and on target cells it acts as a receptor for fibronectin. Removal of heparan sulfate from the exosome surface releases fibronectin and dramatically inhibits exosome-target cell interaction. Antibody specific for the Hep-II heparin-binding domain of fibronectin blocks exosome interaction with tumor cells or with marrow stromal cells. Regarding exosome function, fibronectin-mediated binding of exosomes to myeloma cells activated p38 and pERK signaling and expression of downstream target genes DKK1 and MMP-9, two molecules that promote myeloma progression. Antibody against fibronectin inhibited the ability of myeloma-derived exosomes to stimulate endothelial cell invasion. Heparin or heparin mimetics including Roneparstat, a modified heparin in phase I trials in myeloma patients, significantly inhibited exosome-cell interactions. These studies provide the first evidence that fibronectin binding to heparan sulfate mediates exosome-cell interactions, revealing a fundamental mechanism important for exosome-mediated cross-talk within tumor microenvironments. Moreover, these results imply that therapeutic disruption of fibronectin-heparan sulfate interactions will negatively impact myeloma tumor growth and progression."

Each tumor and its surrounding parenchyma were segmented semi-automatically in 3-D. A total of 85 imaging features were extracted from the two regions, including morphologic, densitometric, and statistical texture measures of enhancement. A small subset of optimal features was selected using an efficient sequential forward floating search algorithm. To distinguish triple-negative cancers from other subtypes, we built predictive models based on support vector machines. Their classification performance was assessed with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) using cross-validation.Imaging features based on the tumor region achieved an AUC of 0.782 in differentiating triple-negative cancers from others, in line with the current state of the art. When background parenchymal enhancement features were included, the AUC increased significantly to 0.878 (p<0.01). Similar improvements were seen in nearly all subtype classification tasks undertaken. Notably, amongst the most discriminating features for predicting triple-negative cancers were textures of background parenchymal enhancement.Considering the tumor as well as its surrounding parenchyma on DCE-MRI for radiomic image phenotyping provides useful information for identifying triple-negative breast cancers. Heterogeneity of background parenchymal enhancement, characterized by quantitative texture features on DCE-MRI, adds value to such differentiation models as they are strongly associated with the triple-negative subtype. Prospective validation studies are warranted to confirm these findings and determine potential implications."
https://openalex.org/W2235215170,"Technology advances can revolutionize Precision Forestry by providing accurate and fine forest information at tree level. This paper addresses the question of how and particularly when Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) should be used in order to efficiently discriminate deciduous tree species. The goal of this research is to determine when is the best time window to achieve an optimal species discrimination. A time series of high resolution UAS imagery was collected to cover the growing season from leaf flush to leaf fall. Full benefit was taken of the temporal resolution of UAS acquisition, one of the most promising features of small drones. The disparity in forest tree phenology is at the maximum during early spring and late autumn. But the phenology state that optimized the classification result is the one that minimizes the spectral variation within tree species groups and, at the same time, maximizes the phenologic differences between species. Sunlit tree crowns (5 deciduous species groups) were classified using a Random Forest approach for monotemporal, two-date and three-date combinations. The end of leaf flushing was the most efficient single-date time window. Multitemporal datasets definitely improve the overall classification accuracy. But single-date high resolution orthophotomosaics, acquired on optimal time-windows, result in a very good classification accuracy (overall out of bag error of 16%)."
https://openalex.org/W2178183718,"Pgp is functional on the plasma membrane and lysosomal membrane. Lysosomal-Pgp can pump substrates into the organelle, thereby trapping certain chemotherapeutics (e.g. doxorubicin; DOX). This mechanism serves as a “safe house” to protect cells against cytotoxic drugs. Interestingly, in contrast to DOX, lysosomal sequestration of the novel anti-tumor agent and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) substrate, di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT), induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization. This mechanism of lysosomal-Pgp utilization enhances cytotoxicity to multidrug-resistant cells. Consequently, Dp44mT has greater anti-tumor activity in drug-resistant relative to non-Pgp-expressing tumors. Interestingly, stressors in the tumor microenvironment trigger endocytosis for cell signaling to assist cell survival. Hence, this investigation examined how glucose variation-induced stress regulated early endosome and lysosome formation via endocytosis of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the impact of glucose variation-induced stress on resistance to DOX was compared with Dp44mT and its structurally related analogue, di-2-pyridylketone 4-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (DpC). These studies showed that glucose variation-induced stress-stimulated formation of early endosomes and lysosomes. In fact, through the process of fluid-phase endocytosis, Pgp was redistributed from the plasma membrane to the lysosomal membrane via early endosome formation. This lysosomal-Pgp actively transported the Pgp substrate, DOX, into the lysosome where it became trapped as a result of protonation at pH 5. Due to increased lysosomal DOX trapping, Pgp-expressing cells became more resistant to DOX. In contrast, cytotoxicity of Dp44mT and DpC was potentiated due to more lysosomes containing functional Pgp under glucose-induced stress. These thiosemicarbazones increased lysosomal membrane permeabilization and cell death. This mechanism has critical implications for drug-targeting in multidrug-resistant tumors where a stressful micro-environment exists. Pgp is functional on the plasma membrane and lysosomal membrane.

Johnston P.G. Molecular mechanisms of drug resistance.J. Pathol. 2005; 205: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). The most characterized mechanism of MDR involves increased drug efflux through the up-regulation of trans-membrane pumps (3Eckford P.D. Sharom F.J. ABC efflux pump-based resistance to chemotherapy drugs.Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 2989-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). These transporters actively transport chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cell, resulting in a drug-resistant phenotype (4Sharom F.J. Multidrug resistance protein: p-glycoprotein.Drug Transporters. John Wiley & Sons, New York2006: 223-262Google Scholar). Notably, P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is the most consistently overexpressed and the most studied ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein involved in the development of MDR cancers (5Milane L. Duan Z. Amiji M.

Ling V. Multidrug resistance in cancer.Sci. Am. 1989; 260: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that Pgp not only functions to efflux drugs out of the cell when present on the plasma membrane but also serves a functional intracellular role in the lysosomal membrane to induce resistance (7Yamagishi T. Sahni S. Sharp D.M. Arvind A. Jansson P.J. Richardson D.R. P-glycoprotein mediates drug resistance via a novel mechanism involving lysosomal sequestration.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 31761-31771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this case, lysosomal membrane Pgp transports substrates into the organelle, which then acts as a “safe house” to prevent cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, such as doxorubicin (DOX; Fig. 1Ai), reaching their intracellular targets, e.g. the nucleus (7Yamagishi T.

Due to the ionization properties of DOX, the agent becomes trapped in this organelle as a result of its protonation at lysosomal pH (i.e. pH 5) (7Yamagishi T. Sahni S. Sharp D.M. Arvind A.

Interestingly, there have been reports of several drugs that are more effective against MDR cells than their drug-sensitive counterparts (8Ludwig J.A. Szakács G. Martin S.E. Chu B.F. Cardarelli C.

One such agent, namely the thiosemicarbazone, di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT; Fig. 1Aii), a Pgp substrate, has been shown to utilize Pgp on the lysosomal membrane to increase its transport and accumulation in this organelle, resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity (12Jansson P.J.

In contrast to other Pgp substrates, such as DOX, Dp44mT is transported by Pgp into the lysosome and, instead of being safely stored, potently reacts with copper to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that, in turn, cause lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and apoptosis (12Jansson P.J.

Hence, in the case of Dp44mT, cells overexpressing Pgp, i.e. MDR cells, become more sensitive to its cytotoxic activity, leading to the ability of this agent to overcome resistance (12Jansson P.J.

Furthermore, Dp44mT and the structurally similar thiosemicarbazone, di-2-pyridylketone 4-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (DpC; Fig. 1Aiii), have demonstrated marked anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activity in vitro and in vivo (15Lovejoy D.B.

Notably, DpC is expected to enter clinical trials by the end of 2016. Recent studies have demonstrated that tumor cell stress stimuli, such as glucose starvation, increase the expression of plasma membrane Pgp through both mitochondrial electron transport chain-derived and NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX4)-induced oxidative signaling (21Seebacher N.A. Richardson D.R. Jansson P.J. Glucose modulation induces reactive oxygen species and increases P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance to chemotherapeutics.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2015; 172: 2557-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Significantly, it has also been shown that redox-related stress can lead to increased receptor-mediated endocytosis for initiation of signaling pathways (22Li Q. Harraz M.M. Zhou W. Zhang L.N. Ding W. Zhang Y. Eggleston T. Yeaman C. Banfi B. Engelhardt J.F. Nox2 and Rac1 regulate H2O2-dependent recruitment of TRAF6 to endosomal interleukin-1 receptor complexes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In fact, endocytosis is a major physiological routing pathway that is known to facilitate the internalization of multiple membrane-bound proteins e.g. receptor-tyrosine kinases, transferrin receptors, and growth factor receptors, into endosomes and lysosomes (23Iacopetta B.J.

Endocytosis of receptor-tyrosine kinases.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a017459Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). For example, stress-induced heat shock protein 70 has been linked to increased endocytosis of the plasma membrane in order to accelerate uptake of proteins through internalization of their ligand-receptor complex, such as the transferrin-transferrin receptor 1 complex (27Vega V.L. Charles W. De Maio A. A new feature of the stress response: increase in endocytosis mediated by Hsp70.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2010; 15: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hence, endocytosis is important to consider as a mediator of protein redistribution from the cell surface to intracellular organelles that occurs as a protective response under stress stimuli. Understanding the effects of stress on processes such as endocytosis-induced drug resistance is important as tumor cells exist in a stressful micro-environment, where vital nutrients, such as glucose and oxygen, are under considerable flux leading to stress and cell death (28Pelicano H. Martin D.S. Xu R.H. Huang P. Glycolysis inhibition for anticancer treatment.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4633-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 29Annibaldi A. Widmann C. Glucose metabolism in cancer cells.Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2010; 13: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar30Junttila M.R. de Sauvage F.J. Influence of tumour micro-environment heterogeneity on therapeutic response.Nature. 2013; 501: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). As a consequence of these stress stimuli, cancer cells are constantly adapting their metabolism to the tumor micro-environment (31Wek R.C. Staschke K.A. How do tumours adapt to nutrient stress?.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1946-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Herein, we report for the first time that glucose variation-induced stress, due to high or low levels of this nutrient, can cause Pgp redistribution from the plasma membrane to the lysosome. This event results in increased formation of lysosomes with active membrane-bound Pgp that can sequester drug substrates to regulate intracellular drug resistance. Indeed, glucose-induced stress imparted via low or high glucose levels was found to increase the number of lysosomes by a process consistent with fluid-phase endocytosis of the plasma membrane. It was established that these newly formed lysosomes had active Pgp that pumped cytosolic substrates into the organelle. This led to decreased cellular cytotoxicity of DOX due to safe house storage of this drug within the lysosome. In contrast, this mechanism potentiates the activity of redox active thiosemicarbazones through LMP in Pgp-expressing cells via the ability of these latter agents to utilize Pgp for lysosomal sequestration. Therefore, translocation of Pgp to the lysosome in the stressful tumor micro-environment is an important consideration for cancer treatment and in particular for new cytotoxic drugs targeting the lysosomal compartment. All cell lines were routinely maintained in DMEM ([d-glucose] = 25 mm; herein referred to as “normal glucose”; Life Technologies) (21Seebacher N.A. Richardson D.R. Jansson P.J. Glucose modulation induces reactive oxygen species and increases P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance to chemotherapeutics.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2015; 172: 2557-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). At the time of treatment, media were replaced with glucose-free DMEM (-d-glucose, 0 mm; herein referred to as “low glucose”; Life Technologies) or this medium supplemented with d-glucose (final [glucose] = 50 mm; herein referred to as “high glucose”; Life Technologies). Medium for growing KBV1 cells was supplemented with vinblastine (1 μg/ml) for maintenance of a full MDR-phenotype (32Shen D.W. Cardarelli C. Hwang J. Cornwell M. Richert N. Ishii S. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Multiple drug-resistant human KB carcinoma cells independently selected for high-level resistance to colchicine, adriamycin, or vinblastine show changes in expression of specific proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7762-7770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary studies demonstrated that due to the fact that the cells used in this study were routinely cultured using standard growth medium containing glucose at 25 mm, they had become adapted to these conditions. Indeed, the higher and lower concentrations of glucose implemented (i.e. 50 mm and 0 mm, respectively) were essential in order to observe the glucose-induced stress response. Hence, this culture model simulates the relative hypo- and hyperglycemic conditions experienced in vivo. Studies were also performed in an attempt to adapt the cells to lower glucose concentrations (<20 mm) by prolonged incubations at these levels. However, these experiments were unsuccessful and led to a significant decrease in cellular viability (not shown). Cellular proliferation was assessed using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays, which were validated by viable cell counts using standard procedures (33Richardson D.R.

Cells were treated with glucose (0, 25, or 50 mm) for 2 h at 37 °C before and for the duration of the experiment. Cells were incubated with serial dilutions of DOX for 72 h at 37 °C or thiosemicarbazones (i.e. Dp44mT or DpC) for 24 h at 37 °C. Studies were performed in the presence or absence of the Pgp inhibitor, Elacridar (Ela; 0.2 μm), which was added 30 min before the drug treatments and was present for the duration of the experiment. Membrane and whole cell protein extractions as well as Western blotting were performed using standard procedures (34Zhong D. Liu X. Khuri F.R. Sun S.-Y. Vertino P.M. Zhou W.

Membranes were probed using mouse anti-Pgp (catalog #P7965, 1:5000, Sigma), mouse anti-HIF-1α (catalog #610958; 1:400, BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-EEA1 (catalog #ab2900; 1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or rabbit anti-lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2; catalog #ab37024; 1:1000, Abcam). Incubations were performed overnight at 4 °C followed by an appropriate secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (catalog #A4416, 1:10,000, Sigma) or goat anti-rabbit (catalog #A6154, 1:10,000) from Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Mouse anti-β-actin (catalog #A5441; 1:5000, Sigma) was used as a protein-loading control. Human apotransferrin (Sigma) was labeled with iron nitrilotriacetate in the presence of excess bicarbonate to produce holotransferrin (35Richardson D.R. Baker E. The uptake of iron and transferrin by the human malignant melanoma cell.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1053: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Holo-transferrin was then covalently labeled with 125I (Na125I, catalog #NEZ033A; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by the iodine monochloride method, as previously described (36Richardson D. Baker E.

To measure the uptake of transferrin by KBV1 cells, cells were treated for 2 h with 0, 25, or 50 mm glucose in DMEM media. This was then replaced with new media of the same respective glucose concentration, with the radiolabel added. At the end of the radiolabel incubation time points, the plates were placed on ice, the medium aspirated, and the cells washed four times with ice-cold PBS. The amount of radioactivity internalized by the cells was assessed with a gamma counter after incubation of cells with Pronase (1 mg/ml; Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C to separate membrane-bound and internalized 125I-transferrin (35Richardson D.R.

Cells were co-incubated for 2 h with Alex Fluor® 488-holo-transferrin (catalog #T-13342, 25 μm, Life Technologies) or Alex Fluor® 488-Dextran (catalog #D22910, 10 μm, Life Technologies) and the glucose treatment (0, 25, or 50 mm). At the end of the incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS followed by fixation with paraformaldehyde. Pro-gold anti-fade DAPI (Life Technologies) was used to mount coverslips. Images were captured with a Plan-APOCHROMT 63×/0.4 oil differential interference contrast objective using a fluorescence microscope equipped with an AxioCam camera (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using green (495-nm excitation/516-nm emission) and red (577-nm excitation/592-nm emission) fluorescence. The DAPI-stained nucleus was captured using blue (358-nm excitation/461-nm emission) fluorescence. Immunofluorescence was performed using a 16-h/4 °C incubation with anti-EEA1 (catalog #ab2900, 1:100, Abcam), anti-LAMP2 (catalog #ab37024, 1:100, Abcam), anti-cathepsin D (catalog #ab6313, 1:500, Abcam), FITC-conjugated Pgp antibody (catalog #557002, 1:5, BD Biosciences), and/or with DOX (catalog #09040050, 100 μm, Pfizer) followed by an incubation of 16 h at 4 °C with an Alexa Fluor® 594- or Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated secondary antibody (catalog #11012/11008, 1:1000, Life Technologies). Notably, DOX is inherently fluorescent and as such does not require detection using a secondary antibody (7Yamagishi T. Sahni S. Sharp D.M. Arvind A. Jansson P.J. Richardson D.R.

Z-stack images were captured with a 63× objective using a fluorescence microscope equipped with an AxioCam camera (Zeiss) or a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope using green (488-nm excitation/516-nm emission) and red (577-nm excitation/592-nm emission) fluorescence. The DAPI-stained nucleus was captured using blue (405-nm excitation/461-nm emission) fluorescence. Deconvolution analysis was performed on z-stacked images to allow for Manders co-localization analysis (n > 4) (38Dunn K.W. Kamocka M.M. McDonald J.H. A practical guide to evaluating colocalization in biological microscopy.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 300: C723-C742Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). The lysosomal stain, LysoTracker® Green (Life Technologies), was used to determine if DOX localizes to lysosomes. Cells were incubated with glucose treatments for 2 h at 37 °C. For the final 40 min, DOX (100 μm), LysoTracker® Green (75 nm), and Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (10 μm; BD Biosciences) were added. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Staining of the cells was detected using the microscope/software above with a LD Plan-NEOFLUAR 40×/0.6 Ph2 Korr objective. The lysosomotropic agent acridine orange (AO; Sigma) dye has a high specificity for lysosomes (39Canonico P.G. Bird J.W. The use of acridine orange as a lysosomal marker in rat skeletal muscle.J.

Notably, AO is well known to cross into the acidic compartment of intact lysosomes, becoming protonated to emit in the red fluorescence range (39Canonico P.G. Bird J.W. The use of acridine orange as a lysosomal marker in rat skeletal muscle.J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with glucose (0, 25, or 50 mm) for 2 h at 37 °C before and for the duration of the experiment. Cells were subsequently incubated with AO (2.5 μg/ml) for 12 min at 37 °C, then washed twice with media and incubated with Cu[Dp44mT] (25 μm) or Cu[DpC] (10 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Treatments were also performed in the presence or absence of the Pgp inhibitor, Ela (0.2 μm), added for 30 min at 37 °C before AO treatment and also during thiosemicarbazone treatment. Cells were then washed twice with media and visualized at 40× for green (495-nm excitation/516-nm emission) and red (577-nm excitation/592-nm emission) fluorescence using a fluorescence microscope equipped with an AxioCam camera (Zeiss).

https://openalex.org/W2177615587,"PB1-F2 is a small accessory protein encoded by an alternative open reading frame in PB1 segments of most influenza A virus. PB1-F2 is involved in virulence by inducing mitochondria-mediated immune cells apoptosis, increasing inflammation, and enhancing predisposition to secondary bacterial infections. Using biophysical approaches we characterized membrane disruptive activity of the full-length PB1-F2 (90 amino acids), its N-terminal domain (52 amino acids), expressed by currently circulating H1N1 viruses, and its C-terminal domain (38 amino acids). Both full-length and N-terminal domain of PB1-F2 are soluble at pH values ≤6, whereas the C-terminal fragment was found soluble only at pH ≤ 3. All three peptides are intrinsically disordered. At pH ≥ 7, the C-terminal part of PB1-F2 spontaneously switches to amyloid oligomers, whereas full-length and the N-terminal domain of PB1-F2 aggregate to amorphous structures. When incubated with anionic liposomes at pH 5, full-length and the C-terminal part of PB1-F2 assemble into amyloid structures and disrupt membrane at nanomolar concentrations. PB1-F2 and its C-terminal exhibit no significant antimicrobial activity. When added in the culture medium of mammalian cells, PB1-F2 amorphous aggregates show no cytotoxicity, whereas PB1-F2 pre-assembled into amyloid oligomers or fragmented nanoscaled fibrils was highly cytotoxic. Furthermore, the formation of PB1-F2 amyloid oligomers in infected cells was directly reflected by membrane disruption and cell death as observed in U937 and A549 cells. Altogether our results demonstrate that membrane-lytic activity of PB1-F2 is closely linked to supramolecular organization of the protein.

The determinism of IAV-mediated pathogenicity is complex and involves several viral proteins as HA, PB1, NS1, PA-X, and PB1-F2. PB1-F2 is translated from an alternative +1 open reading frame of the PB1 segment (7Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P.

Likewise, PB1-F2 can disturb the inner membrane of mitochondria, which induces apoptosis. Other functions of PB1-F2 have been also reported: PB1-F2 co-localizes in the nucleus of infected epithelial cells and up-regulates viral polymerase activity (19Mazur I. Anhlan D. Mitzner D.

To further understand the interaction of PB1-F2 with cellular membranes, we investigated PB1-F2 domains involved in binding to membrane bilayers and characterized the PB1-F2 conformational change and self-association occurring upon membrane binding. We demonstrate that cytotoxicity of PB1-F2 from extracellular medium strongly depends on protein structural organization. Finally, we showed that lytic activity of PB1-F2 assembled into amyloid structures contributes to cell membrane damaging upon IAV infection. PB1-F2 protein of A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) influenza virus was expressed and purified as described previously (27Chevalier C. Al Bazzal A. Vidic J. Février V. Bourdieu C. Bouguyon E. Le Goffic R.

Briefly, the gene encoding either the full-length PB1-F2(1–90) protein or N-terminal domain of PB1-F2(1–52) (Nter) were cloned into the pET 22b+ expression vector (Novagen) to express His6-tagged protein versions. Transformed competent BL-21 Rosetta cells (Stratagene) were incubated with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-B-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. After cell lysis and solubilization in 8 m urea buffer, the recombinant PB1-F2-His proteins were purified from inclusion bodies on a Hitrap-IMAC column using the AKTA Purifier-100 FPLC chromatographic system (GE Healthcare). Fractions collected containing PB1-F2-His proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a 120-ml Sepharose Superdex 200 column. Urea was removed on a G25 desalting column equilibrated with 5 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5). PB1-F2-His proteins were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. The C-terminal domain of PB1-F2(53–90) (pCter) was custom made by Proteogenix (France). Prior to analysis lyophilized protein powder was dissolved in adequate buffer and its concentration was determined by measuring optical density at 280 nm using extinction coefficient deduced from its composition of 28,990, 5,500, and 4,833 m−1 cm−1 for PB1-F2(1–90), PB1-F2(1–52), and PB1-F2(53–90), respectively. Phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (AL). Sodium acetate buffers (pH 3–6), phosphate buffers (pH 7–10), and triethylammonium acetate (pH 5) were of analytical grade. Reagents for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis were obtained from Invitrogen (France). Other reagents were purchased from Sigma (France). Lipids (10 mg) were solubilized in chloroform and their dry films were obtained by chloroform evaporation under a stream of nitrogen. The lipid film was then hydrated with 10 ml of 5 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5), and gently vortex and sonicated for a few minutes. The liposomes formed were freeze/thawed three times in liquid nitrogen (vortex between every defrosting) and subsequently extruded through a polycarbonate membrane filter (MILLIPORE 0.1 μm) to obtain large unilamellar liposomes (LUVs) of 100-nm diameter. For the leakage measurements, solid lipid films were hydrated with a 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) containing 35 mm calcein (calcein disodium salt, Fluka). After three freeze/thaw cycles, the suspensions were extruded as described above. Non-entrapped dye was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5). Calcein efflux measurements were performed on a Tecan microplate reader. The ability of different PB1-F2 proteins to permeabilize liposomes was monitored by the decrease in fluorescent intensity after the addition of proteins at the desired concentration to a 160-μl suspension of 0.01 mg/ml of liposomes in the sodium acetate buffer containing Co2+ ions (quencher). Calcein fluorescence emission at 528 nm was recorded continuously upon excitation 492 nm. To normalize the fluorescence intensity, the maximum quenching was obtained by the addition of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. All runs were done at least in triplicate and were found to be in close agreement. An aliquot of liposomes (0.5 mg/ml) of different lipid compositions was incubated with PB1-F2 (10 μm) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) for 24 h at 4 °C. Vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C (Beckman TL-100). The supernatant and pellets were separated and assayed for PB1-F2 by SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie Blue gel staining. Far-UV (180–260 nm) circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter using 1-mm path length quartz cell. Spectra were collected at a scanning rate of 100 nm/min, with a bandwidth of 1.0 nm and a resolution of 100 mdeg, and corrected for the contribution of the buffer. Measurements were done at 20 °C. Each spectrum was an average of 8–16 scans. CD spectra were analyzed and quantified using the DicroWeb software. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed on a Nano series Zetasizer (Malvern, UK) using a helium-neon laser wavelength of 633 nm and detection angle of 173°. The scattering intensity data were processed using the instrumental software to obtain the hydrodynamic diameter (RH) and the size distribution of particles in each sample. RH of the particles was estimated from the autocorrelation function, using the Cumulants method. A total of 10 scans with an overall duration of 5 min were obtained for each sample. All measurements were done at 20 °C. Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen, France) and Bacillus subtilis 168 strain (kindly supplied by Sandrine Auger, INRA, France) were grown overnight at 37 °C in 50 ml of Luria broth (LB) without antibiotics. The saturated cultures were diluted in fresh LB medium to reach an absorbance of 0.1 at 600 nm. Disposable sterile spectroscopic cuvettes were used to set up the experimental conditions in triplicate with each condition. 150 μl of various concentrations of the full-length or C-terminal PB1-F2 in PBS (pH 7.4) was added into the cuvette, before the addition of 700 μl of bacterial cell suspension (850 μl total volumes). Final monomer equivalent PB1-F2 concentrations were 0.5, 1, 5, and 20 μm. In mocks the protein solutions were replaced with PBS to account for the dilution of LB. All assays were performed in triplicate. After setting up cuvettes, an initial absorbance reading at 600 nm was recorded after which cuvettes were placed in a 37 °C incubator and removed at 30 min, 1 h 30, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, and 24 h for absorbance readings. A549 cells (human alveolar epithelial cells, American Type Culture Collection) were routinely cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM; Sigma) containing 0.2% NaHCO3 (Sigma), MEM amino acids (Gibco), MEM vitamins (Gibco), 2 ml of glutamine, 100 IU/ml of penicillin, 100 μg ml−1 of streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The human promonocytic cell line U937 purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) was propagated and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, according to the American Type Culture Collection recommendations. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. A549 cells were plated at a density of 30,000 cells per well on 96-well plates in 100 μl of fresh medium. After 24 h completed medium was exchanged with 100 μl of MEM without serum. Aliquots of solutions containing amyloid or non-amyloid protein aggregates formed in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) were added to the cell media at 0.1–20 μm final concentrations (monomer unit equivalents). After 24 h incubation, 20 μl of a freshly prepared stock MTT solution in PBS was added to the cells (MTT final concentration, 0.8 mg/ml) and incubated for a further 1 h. Then, the cell layer was dried and MTT formazan was suspended in 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide. Absorbance values were assessed at 560 nm and corrected for a background signal by subtracting the signal measured at 670 nm. Cell survival was quantified and expressed as % of cells treated only with PBS (mock). For infections, A549 and U937 cells were washed with serum-free medium and incubated with wild-type A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) virus or the virus knocked out for PB1-F2 expression (ΔF2) at 1 multiplicity of infection for 1 h at 37 °C. Infected cells were then incubated at 37 °C in complete medium until collection. Cell death was quantified by acridine orange followed by cytometry analysis (BD LSRFortessa, BD Bioscience) with the 488-nm laser line and the FITC (530/30) channel. Cell death was quantified by acridine orange followed by cytometry analysis (BD LSRFortessa, BD Bioscience, USA) with the 488-nm laser line and the FITC (530/30) channel. Collected cells were washed two times in PBS, then resuspended in MEM containing acridine orange (0.1 μg/ml) and incubated for 10 min in the dark. Stained cells were collected, washed two times with PBS, and then fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. For analysis, the fixed cells were collected and resuspended in PBS. For microscopy observations, A459 cells incubated overnight with different aggregated PB1-F2 preparations were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were observed with an Axio Observer fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using a ×40 objective. Images were acquired and processed using AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss). To investigate the interaction between lipid vesicles and PB1-F2, negatively charged asolectin liposomes (0.1 mg/ml of total lipids) were prepared in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5). Liposomes were incubated with 50 μm full-length PB1-F2 at room temperature for 5 min. Then, 10 μl of the lipid-protein sample were adsorbed onto formvar/carbon-coated 200-mesh copper grids (Agar Scientific). After deposition of the suspension, grids were washed twice for 1 min with PBS, and negatively stained by floating on a 10-μl drop of 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate (Sigma) for 1 min. The grids were air-dried before observation under a Philips EM12 electron microscope at 80 kV exciting voltage. To visualize IAV-infected cells, U937 cells were infected with wild-type or ΔF2 virus at 5 multiplicity of infection for 1 h at 37 °C and harvested 24 h post-infection. Cultured cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then contrasted with 0.5% Oolong Tea Extract in sodium cacodylate buffer and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide containing 1.5% potassium cyanoferrate, gradually dehydrated in ethanol (30 to 100%), and substituted gradually in a mixture of propylene oxide-epon and embedded in Epon (Delta Microscopy, Labège, France). Thin sections (70 nm) were collected onto 200-mesh cooper grids, and conterstained with lead citrate. Grids were examined with Hitachi HT7700 electron microscope operated at 80 kV (Elexience, France). Images were acquired with a charge-coupled device camera (AMT). A commercial dimension 3100 AFM (Vecco Instruments) was used for topographical characterization of the samples. All measurements were performed at the tapping mode using a rectangular silicon AFM tip. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of at least three separate experiments and statistical analyses were performed using the unpaired Student's t test. Analyses were done with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). The significance level was defined as: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001. We first sought to determine the aggregation state and secondary structure of PB1-F2 at various pH values. Full-length PB1-F2, Nter, and pCter were not soluble at physiological pH. PB1-F2 is a positively charged protein, as are its N- and C-terminal domains (theoretical pI 10.21, 8.1, and 11.85, respectively). This suggests that basic and neutral pH values may favor protein self-associations, whereas acid pH will decrease electrostatic attractions between molecules and impede protein aggregations. To verify this, we applied DLS measurements to determine protein hydrodynamic diameters (RH) in buffer solutions of pH ranging from pH 3 to 10 (Fig. 1A). The sizes obtained fro"

This work presents support vector machine and artificial neural network’s modelling for grapevine varietal classification from in-field leaf spectroscopy. Modelling was attempted at two scales: site-specific and a global scale. Spectral measurements were obtained on the near-infrared (NIR) spectral range between 1600 to 2400 nm under field conditions in a non-destructive way using a portable spectrophotometer. For the site specific approach, spectra were collected from the adaxial side of 400 individual leaves of 20 grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) varieties one week after veraison. For the global model, two additional sets of spectra were collected one week before harvest from two different vineyards in another vintage, each one consisting on 48 measurement from individual leaves of six varieties. Several combinations of spectra scatter correction and smoothing filtering were studied. For the training of the models, support vector machines and artificial neural networks were employed using the pre-processed spectra as input and the varieties as the classes of the models. The results from the pre-processing study showed that there was no influence whether using scatter correction or not. Also, a second-degree derivative with a window size of 5 Savitzky-Golay filtering yielded the highest outcomes. For the site-specific model, with 20 classes, the best results from the classifiers thrown an overall score of 87.25% of correctly classified samples. These results were compared under the same conditions with a model trained using partial least squares discriminant analysis, which showed a worse performance in every case. For the global model, a 6-class dataset involving samples from three different vineyards, two years and leaves monitored at post-veraison and harvest was also built up, reaching a 77.08% of correctly classified samples. The outcomes obtained demonstrate the capability of using a reliable method for fast, in-field, non-destructive grapevine varietal classification that could be very useful in viticulture and wine industry, either global or site-specific."
https://openalex.org/W2180050213,"HIV invades the brain early after infection; however, its interactions with the cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remain poorly understood. Our goal was to evaluate the role of occludin, one of the tight junction proteins that regulate BBB functions in HIV infection of BBB pericytes. We provide evidence that occludin levels largely control the metabolic responses of human pericytes to HIV. Occludin in BBB pericytes decreased by 10% during the first 48 h after HIV infection, correlating with increased nuclear translocation of the gene repressor C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP)-1 and NFκB-p65 activation. These changes were associated with decreased expression and activation of the class III histone deacetylase sirtuin (SIRT)-1. Occludin levels recovered 96 h after infection, restoring SIRT-1 and reducing HIV transcription to 20% of its highest values. We characterized occludin biochemically as a novel NADH oxidase that controls the expression and activation of SIRT-1. The inverse correlation between occludin and HIV transcription was then replicated in human primary macrophages and differentiated monocytic U937 cells, in which occludin silencing resulted in 75 and 250% increased viral transcription, respectively. Our work shows that occludin has previously unsuspected metabolic properties and is a target of HIV infection, opening the possibility of designing novel pharmacological approaches to control HIV transcription.—Castro, V., Bertrand, L., Luethen, M., Dabrowski, S., Lombardi, J., Morgan, L., Sharova, N., Stevenson, M., Blasig, I.

https://openalex.org/W2175008736,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is mediated primarily by autoreactive T cells. However, evidence suggesting the involvement of humoral immunity in brain diseases has increased interest in the role of B cells and their products during MS pathogenesis. The major survival factor for B cells, BAFF has been shown to play a role in several autoimmune conditions. Elevated BAFF levels have been reported in MS animal model and during MS relapse in patients. Moreover, disease-modifying treatments (DMT) reportedly influence blood BAFF levels in MS patients, but the significance of these changes remains unclear. The present study addresses how blood BAFF levels are associated with the clinical course of relapsing-remitting MS and the effectiveness of DMT and short-term steroid treatment. During a prospective longitudinal follow-up of 2.3 years, BAFF was measured in the blood of 170 MS patients in the stable phase and within 186 relapses. BAFF levels were significantly higher in MS patients compared to healthy controls. However, stable MS patients without relapses exhibited significantly higher BAFF levels than relapsing patients. Treatment with interferon-β and immunosuppressants raised BAFF blood levels. Interestingly, a similar effect was not seen in patients treated with glatiramer acetate. Short-term treatment with high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone did not significantly alter plasma BAFF levels in 65% of relapsing-remitting MS patients. BAFF were correlated weakly but significantly with monocyte and basophil counts, but not with other blood cell types (neutrophils, lymphocytes, or eosinophils) or inflammatory biomarkers. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that higher blood BAFF levels may reflect a more stable and effective MS treatment outcome. These results challenge hypotheses suggesting that elevated blood BAFF levels are associated with more severe disease presentation and could explain the recent failure of pharmaceutical trials targeting BAFF with soluble receptor for MS treatment."

Although the pathogenic role of these fibrils has not been completely established, increasing evidence suggests off-pathway aggregation as a source of toxic/detoxicating deposits that still remains to be targeted. The present work is a step toward the development of off-pathway modulators using the same amyloid-specific dyes as those conventionally employed to screen amyloid inhibitors. We identified a series of kinetic signatures revealing the quantitative importance of off-pathway aggregation relative to amyloid fibrillization; these include non-linear semilog plots of amyloid progress curves, highly variable end point signals, and half-life coordinates weakly influenced by concentration. Molecules that attenuate/intensify the magnitude of these signals are considered promising off-pathway inhibitors/promoters. An illustrative example shows that amyloid deposits of lysozyme are only the tip of an iceberg hiding a crowd of insoluble aggregates. Thoroughly validated using advanced microscopy techniques and complementary measurements of dynamic light scattering, CD, and soluble protein depletion, the new analytical tools are compatible with the high-throughput methods currently employed in drug discovery.

In this study we investigated the effect of RNA editing on human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression because the AhR transcript potentially forms double-stranded structures, which are targets of ADAR enzymes. In human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived Huh-7 cells, the ADAR1 knockdown reduced the RNA editing levels in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the AhR transcript and increased the AhR protein levels. The ADAR1 knockdown enhanced the ligand-mediated induction of CYP1A1, a gene downstream of AhR. We investigated the possibility that A-to-I RNA editing creates miRNA targeting sites in the AhR mRNA and found that the miR-378-dependent down-regulation of AhR was abolished by ADAR1 knockdown. These results indicated that the ADAR1-mediated down-regulation of AhR could be attributed to the creation of a miR-378 recognition site in the AhR 3′-UTR. The interindividual differences in the RNA editing levels within the AhR 3′-UTR in a panel of 32 human liver samples were relatively small, whereas the differences in ADAR1 expression were large (220-fold). In the human liver samples a significant inverse association was observed between the miR-378 and AhR protein levels, suggesting that the RNA-editing-dependent down-regulation of AhR by miR-378 contributes to the variability in the constitutive hepatic expression of AhR.

https://openalex.org/W2285425146,"A diversity of tools is available for identification of variants from genome sequence data. Given the current complexity of incorporating external software into a genome analysis infrastructure, a tendency exists to rely on the results from a single tool alone. The quality of the output variant calls is highly variable however, depending on factors such as sequence library quality as well as the choice of short-read aligner, variant caller, and variant caller filtering strategy. Here we present a two-part study first using the high quality 'genome in a bottle' reference set to demonstrate the significant impact the choice of aligner, variant caller, and variant caller filtering strategy has on overall variant call quality and further how certain variant callers outperform others with increased sample contamination, an important consideration when analyzing sequenced cancer samples. This analysis confirms previous work showing that combining variant calls of multiple tools results in the best quality resultant variant set, for either specificity or sensitivity, depending on whether the intersection or union, of all variant calls is used respectively. Second, we analyze a melanoma cell line derived from a control lymphocyte sample to determine whether software choices affect the detection of clinically important melanoma risk-factor variants finding that only one of the three such variants is unanimously detected under all conditions. Finally, we describe a cogent strategy for implementing a clinical variant detection pipeline; a strategy that requires careful software selection, variant caller filtering optimizing, and combined variant calls in order to effectively minimize false negative variants. While implementing such features represents an increase in complexity and computation the results offer indisputable improvements in data quality."

We used PI-4P probes and mass analysis to determine how OSBP controls the availability of PI-4P for this metabolic pathway. Treatment of fibroblasts or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with 25OH caused a 50–70% reduction in Golgi-associated immunoreactive PI-4P that correlated with Golgi localization of OSBP. In contrast, 25OH caused an OSBP-dependent enrichment in Golgi PI-4P that was detected with a pleckstrin homology domain probe. The cellular mass of phosphatidylinositol monophosphates and Golgi PI-4P measured with an unbiased PI-4P probe (P4M) was unaffected by 25OH and OSBP silencing, indicating that OSBP shifts the distribution of PI-4P upon localization to ER-Golgi contact sites. The PI-4P and sterol binding activities of OSBP were both required for 25OH activation of sphingomyelin synthesis, suggesting that 25OH must be exchanged for PI-4P to be concentrated at contact sites.

https://openalex.org/W2172762528,"Antibodies with conformational specificity are important for detecting and interfering with polypeptide aggregation linked to several human disorders. We are developing a motif-grafting approach for designing lead antibody candidates specific for amyloid-forming polypeptides such as the Alzheimer peptide (Aβ). This approach involves grafting amyloidogenic peptide segments into the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of single-domain (VH) antibodies. Here we have investigated the impact of polar mutations inserted at the edges of a large hydrophobic Aβ42 peptide segment (Aβ residues 17–42) in CDR3 on the solubility and conformational specificity of the corresponding VH domains. We find that VH expression and solubility are strongly enhanced by introducing multiple negatively charged or asparagine residues at the edges of CDR3, whereas other polar mutations are less effective (glutamine and serine) or ineffective (threonine, lysine, and arginine). Moreover, Aβ VH domains with negatively charged CDR3 mutations show significant preference for recognizing Aβ fibrils relative to Aβ monomers, whereas the same VH domains with other polar CDR3 mutations recognize both Aβ conformers. We observe similar behavior for a VH domain grafted with a large hydrophobic peptide from islet amyloid polypeptide (residues 8–37) that contains negatively charged mutations at the edges of CDR3. These findings highlight the sensitivity of antibody binding and solubility to residues at the edges of CDRs, and provide guidelines for designing other grafted antibody fragments with hydrophobic binding loops."
https://openalex.org/W2264152599,"Levansucrase catalyzes the synthesis of fructose polymers through the transfer of fructosyl units from sucrose to a growing fructan chain. Levanase activity of Bacillus subtilis levansucrase has been described since the very first publications dealing with the mechanism of levan synthesis. However, there is a lack of qualitative and quantitative evidence regarding the importance of the intrinsic levan hydrolysis of B. subtilis levansucrase and its role in the levan synthesis process. Particularly, little attention has been paid to the long-term hydrolysis products, including its participation in the final levan molecules distribution. Here, we explored the hydrolytic and transferase activity of the B. subtilis levansucrase (SacB) when levans produced by the same enzyme are used as substrate. We found that levan is hydrolyzed through a first order exo-type mechanism, which is limited to a conversion extent of around 30% when all polymer molecules reach a structure no longer suitable to SacB hydrolysis. To characterize the reaction, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) was employed and the evolution of the hydrolysis products profile followed by HPLC, GPC and HPAEC-PAD. The ITC measurements revealed a second step, taking place at the end of the reaction, most probably resulting from disproportionation of accumulated fructo-oligosaccharides. As levanase, levansucrase may use levan as substrate and, through a fructosyl-enzyme complex, behave as a hydrolytic enzyme or as a transferase, as demonstrated when glucose and fructose are added as acceptors. These reactions result in a wide variety of oligosaccharides that are also suitable acceptors for fructo-oligosaccharide synthesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that SacB in the presence of levan and glucose, through blastose and sucrose synthesis, results in the same fructooligosaccharides profile as that observed in sucrose reactions. We conclude that SacB has an intrinsic levanase activity that contributes to the final levan profile in reactions with sucrose as substrate."

The present study investigates the in vitro short-term response of human undifferentiated cells on three magnesium alloys and high-purity magnesium (Mg).The degradation parameters of magnesium-silver (Mg2Ag), magnesium-gadolinium (Mg10Gd) and magnesium-rare-earth (Mg4Y3RE) alloys were analysed after 1, 2, and 3 days of incubation in cell culture medium under cell culture condition. Changes in cell viability and cell adhesion were evaluated by culturing human umbilical cord perivascular cells on corroded Mg materials to examine how the degradation influences the cellular development.The pH and osmolality of the medium increased with increasing degradation rate and it was found to be most pronounced for Mg4Y3RE alloy. The biological observations showed that HUCPV exhibited a more homogeneous cell growth on Mg alloys compared to high-purity Mg, where they showed a clustered morphology. Moreover, cells exhibited a slightly higher density on Mg2Ag and Mg10Gd in comparison to Mg4Y3RE, due to the lower alkalinisation and osmolality of the incubation medium. However, cells grown on Mg10Gd and Mg4Y3RE generated more developed and healthy cellular structures that allowed them to better adhere to the surface. This can be attributable to a more stable and homogeneous degradation of the outer surface with respect to the incubation time."

However, little is known about differences between AN diagnostic subtypes [restricting (AN-R) and binge/purging (AN-BP)] and weekly changes in BC during refeeding treatment. Therefore, the main objectives of our study were twofold: 1) to assess the changes in BC throughout nutritional treatment in an AN sample and 2) to analyze predictors of BC changes during treatment, as well as predictors of treatment outcome. The whole sample comprised 261 participants [118 adult females with AN (70 AN-R vs. 48 AN-BP), and 143 healthy controls]. BC was measured weekly during 15 weeks of day-hospital treatment using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Assessment measures also included the Eating Disorders Inventory-2, as well as a number of other clinical indices. Overall, the results showed that AN-R and AN-BP patients statistically differed in all BC measures at admission. However, no significant time×group interaction was found for almost all BC parameters. Significant time×group interactions were only found for basal metabolic rate (p = .041) and body mass index (BMI) (p = .035). Multiple regression models showed that the best predictors of pre-post changes in BC parameters (namely fat-free mass, muscular mass, total body water and BMI) were the baseline values of BC parameters. Stepwise predictive logistic regressions showed that only BMI and age were significantly associated with outcome, but not with the percentage of body fat. In conclusion, these data suggest that although AN patients tended to restore all BC parameters during nutritional treatment, only AN-BP patients obtained the same fat mass values as healthy controls. Put succinctly, the best predictors of changes in BC were baseline BC values, which did not, however, seem to influence treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2227865671,"Transthyretin V30M (ATTR V30M) amyloidosis is a phenotypically diverse disease with symptoms ranging from predominant neuropathy to exclusive cardiac manifestations. The aims of this study were to determine the dispersion of the two types of fibrils found in Swedish ATTR V30M patients -Type A consisting of a mixture of truncated and full length ATTR fibrils and type B fibrils consisting of full length fibrils, and to estimate the severity of cardiac dysfunction in relation to fibril composition and sex.Echocardiographic data were analysed in 107 Swedish ATTR V30M patients with their fibril composition determined as either type A or type B. Measurements of left ventricular (LV) dimensions and evaluation of systolic and diastolic function including speckle tracking derived strain were performed. Patients were grouped according to fibril type and sex. Multivariate linear regression was utilised to determine factors of significant impact on LV thickness.There was no significant difference in proportions of the two types of fibrils between men and women. In patients with type A fibrils, women had significantly lower median septal (p = 0.007) and posterior wall thicknesses (p = 0.010), lower median LV mass indexed to height (p = 0.008), and higher septal strain (p = 0.037), as compared to males. These differences were not apparent in patients with type B fibrils. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that fibril type, sex and age all had significant impact on LV septal thickness.This study demonstrates a clear difference between sexes in the severity of amyloid heart disease in ATTR V30M amyloidosis patients. Even though type A fibrils were associated with more advanced amyloid heart disease compared to type B, women with type A fibrils generally developed less cardiac infiltration than men. The differences may explain the better outcome for liver transplanted late-onset female patients compared to males."
https://openalex.org/W2178033743,"Skeletal muscle atrophy, the most prominent phenotypic feature of cancer cachexia, is often observed in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Magnolol (M) extracted from Magnolia officinalis exhibits several pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. In this study, we investigated whether magnolol supplementation protects against the development of cachexia symptoms in bladder cancer-bearing mice undergoing chemotherapy. Combined treatment of magnolol with chemotherapeutic drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin (TGCM) or gemcitabine (TGM), markedly attenuates the body weight loss and skeletal muscle atrophy compared with conventional chemotherapy (TGC). The antiatrophic effect of magnolol may be associated with inhibition of myostatin and activin A formation, as well as FoxO3 transcriptional activity resulting from Akt activation, thereby suppressing ubiquitin ligases MuRF-1 and MAFbx/atrogin-1 expression, as well as proteasomal enzyme activity. Notably, magnolol-induced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production and related protein synthesis may also contribute to its protective effects. The decreased food intake, and intestinal injury and dysfunction observed in the mice of TGC group were significantly improved in the TGCM and TGM groups. Moreover, the increased inflammatory responses evidenced by elevation of proinflammatory cytokine formation and NF-κB activation occurred in the atrophying muscle of TGC group were markedly inhibited in mice of combined treatment with magnolol. In summary, these findings support that magnolol is a promising chemopreventive supplement for preventing chemotherapy-induced skeletal muscle atrophy associated with cancer cachexia by suppressing muscle protein degradation, and inflammatory responses, as well as increasing IGF-1-mediated protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2180167462,"Autism spectrum traits exist on a continuum and are more common in males than in females, but the basis for this sex difference is unclear. To this end, the present study draws on the extreme male brain theory, investigating the relationship between sex difference and the default mode network (DMN), both known to be associated with autism spectrum traits. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out in 42 females (mean age ± standard deviation, 22.4 ± 4.2 years) and 43 males (mean age ± standard deviation, 23.8 ± 3.9 years) with typical development. Using a combination of different analyses (viz., independent component analysis (ICA), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and seed-based analyses), we examined sex differences in the DMN and the relationship to autism spectrum traits as measured by autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) scores. We found significant differences between female and male subjects in DMN brain regions, with seed-based analysis revealing a significant negative correlation between default-mode resting state functional connectivity of the anterior medial prefrontal cortex seed (aMPFC) and AQ scores in males. However, there were no relationships between DMN sex differences and autism spectrum traits in females. Our findings may provide important insight into the skewed balance of functional connectivity in males compared to females that could serve as a potential biomarker of the degree of autism spectrum traits in line with the extreme male brain theory."
https://openalex.org/W2174724620,"Three-dimensional (3D) localization-based super-resolution microscopy (SR) requires correction of aberrations to accurately represent 3D structure. Here we show how a depth-dependent lateral shift in the apparent position of a fluorescent point source, which we term `wobble`, results in warped 3D SR images and provide a software tool to correct this distortion. This system-specific, lateral shift is typically > 80 nm across an axial range of ~ 1 μm. A theoretical analysis based on phase retrieval data from our microscope suggests that the wobble is caused by non-rotationally symmetric phase and amplitude aberrations in the microscope’s pupil function. We then apply our correction to the bacterial cytoskeletal protein FtsZ in live bacteria and demonstrate that the corrected data more accurately represent the true shape of this vertically-oriented ring-like structure. We also include this correction method in a registration procedure for dual-color, 3D SR data and show that it improves target registration error (TRE) at the axial limits over an imaging depth of 1 μm, yielding TRE values of < 20 nm. This work highlights the importance of correcting aberrations in 3D SR to achieve high fidelity between the measurements and the sample."
https://openalex.org/W2230632332,"The synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes is a complex, energetically demanding process requiring the aid of numerous non-ribosomal factors, such as the PeBoW complex. The mammalian PeBoW complex, composed of Pes1, Bop1, and WDR12, is essential for the processing of the 32S preribosomal RNA. Previous work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that release of the homologous proteins in this complex (Nop7, Erb1, and Ytm1, respectively) from preribosomal particles requires Rea1 (midasin or MDN1 in humans), a large dynein-like protein. Midasin contains a C-terminal metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) domain that interacts with the N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain of Ytm1/WDR12 as well as the UBL domain of Rsa4/Nle1 in a later step in the ribosome maturation pathway. Here we present the crystal structure of the UBL domain of the WDR12 homologue from S. cerevisiae at 1.7 Å resolution and demonstrate that human midasin binds to WDR12 as well as Nle1 through their respective UBL domains. Midasin contains a well conserved extension region upstream of the MIDAS domain required for binding WDR12 and Nle1, and the interaction is dependent upon metal ion coordination because removal of the metal or mutation of residues that coordinate the metal ion diminishes the interaction. Mammalian WDR12 displays prominent nucleolar localization that is dependent upon active ribosomal RNA transcription. Based upon these results, we propose that release of the PeBoW complex and subsequent release of Nle1 by midasin is a well conserved step in the ribosome maturation pathway in both yeast and mammalian cells.

The aim of this study was to clarify whether specific athletic training also affects somatosensory Nogo potentials related to the inhibition of movements. The Nogo potentials were recorded at nine cortical electrode positions (Fz, Cz, Pz, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3 and P4) in 12 baseball players (baseball group) and in 12 athletes in sports, such as track and field events and swimming, that do not require response inhibition, such as batting for training or performance (sports group). The Nogo potentials and Go/Nogo reaction times (Go/Nogo RTs) were measured under a somatosensory Go/Nogo paradigm in which subjects were instructed to rapidly push a button in response to stimulus presentation. The Nogo potentials were obtained by subtracting the Go trial from the Nogo trial. The peak Nogo-N2 was significantly shorter in the baseball group than that in the sports group. In addition, the amplitude of Nogo-N2 in the frontal area was significantly larger in the baseball group than that in the sports group. There was a significant positive correlation between the latency of Nogo-N2 and Go/Nogo RT. Moreover, there were significant correlations between the Go/Nogo RT and both the amplitude of Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3 (i.e., amplitude of the Nogo-potentials increases with shorter RT). Specific athletic training regimens may induce neuroplastic alterations in sensorimotor inhibitory processes."
https://openalex.org/W2279555593,"Supplying adequate amounts of soil N for plant growth during the growing season and across large agricultural fields is a challenge for conservational agricultural systems with cover crops. Knowledge about cover crop effects on N comes mostly from small, flat research plots and performance of cover crops across topographically diverse agricultural land is poorly understood. Our objective was to assess effects of both leguminous (red clover) and non-leguminous (winter rye) cover crops on potentially mineralizable N (PMN) and [Formula: see text] levels across a topographically diverse landscape. We studied conventional, low-input, and organic managements in corn-soybean-wheat rotation. The rotations of low-input and organic managements included rye and red clover cover crops. The managements were implemented in twenty large undulating fields in Southwest Michigan starting from 2006. The data collection and analysis were conducted during three growing seasons of 2011, 2012 and 2013. Observational micro-plots with and without cover crops were laid within each field on three contrasting topographical positions of depression, slope and summit. Soil samples were collected 4-5 times during each growing season and analyzed for [Formula: see text] and PMN. The results showed that all three managements were similar in their temporal and spatial distributions of NO3-N. Red clover cover crop increased [Formula: see text] by 35% on depression, 20% on slope and 32% on summit positions. Rye cover crop had a significant 15% negative effect on [Formula: see text] in topographical depressions but not in slope and summit positions. The magnitude of the cover crop effects on soil mineral nitrogen across topographically diverse fields was associated with the amount of cover crop growth and residue production. The results emphasize the potential environmental and economic benefits that can be generated by implementing site-specific topography-driven cover crop management in row-crop agricultural systems."
https://openalex.org/W2268801575,"SHANK-associated RH domain interactor (SHARPIN) inhibits integrins through interaction with the integrin α-subunit. In addition, SHARPIN enhances nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activity as a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). However, it is currently unclear how regulation of these seemingly different roles is coordinated. Here, we show that SHARPIN binds integrin and LUBAC in a mutually exclusive manner. We map the integrin binding site on SHARPIN to the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, the same domain implicated in SHARPIN interaction with LUBAC component RNF31 (ring finger protein 31), and identify two SHARPIN residues (V267, L276) required for both integrin and RNF31 regulation. Accordingly, the integrin α-tail is capable of competing with RNF31 for SHARPIN binding in vitro. Importantly, the full SHARPIN RNF31-binding site contains residues (F263A/I272A) that are dispensable for SHARPIN-integrin interaction. Importantly, disrupting SHARPIN interaction with integrin or RNF31 abolishes SHARPIN-mediated regulation of integrin or NF-κB activity, respectively. Altogether these data suggest that the roles of SHARPIN in inhibiting integrin activity and supporting linear ubiquitination are (molecularly) distinct."
https://openalex.org/W2173616671,"Neutrophil cytosolic factor 4 (NCF4) is component of the nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate oxidase complex, a key factor in biochemical pathways and innate immune responses. In this study, splice variants and functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of NCF4 were identified to determine the variability and association of the gene with susceptibility to bovine mastitis characterized by inflammation. A novel splice variant, designated as NCF4-TV and characterized by the retention of a 48 bp sequence in intron 9, was detected in the mammary gland tissues of infected cows. The expression of the NCF4-reference main transcript in the mastitic mammary tissues was higher than that in normal tissues. A novel SNP, g.18174 A>G, was also found in the retained 48 bp region of intron 9. To determine whether NCF4-TV could be due to the g.18174 A>G mutation, we constructed two mini-gene expression vectors with the wild-type or mutant NCF4 g.18174 A>G fragment. The vectors were then transiently transfected into 293T cells, and alternative splicing of NCF4 was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing. Mini-gene splicing assay demonstrated that the aberrantly spliced NCF4-TV with 48 bp retained fragment in intron 9 could be due to g.18174 A>G, which was associated with milk somatic count score and increased risk of mastitis infection in cows. NCF4 expression was also regulated by alternative splicing. This study proposes that NCF4 splice variants generated by functional SNP are important risk factors for mastitis susceptibility in dairy cows."
https://openalex.org/W2284446314,"Gossypol, a polyphenol compound produced by cotton plant, has proven reproductive toxicity, but the effects of gossypol on sheep ovaries are unknown. This study was aimed to determine the in vitro and in vivo effects of gossypol on the ovarian follicles of sheep. This trial was divided into two experiments. In the first one, we used twelve non-pregnant, nulliparous, Santa Inês crossbred ewes, which were randomly distributed into two equal groups and fed diets with and without cottonseed cake. Feed was offered at 1.5% of the animal's body weight for 63 days. The concentrations of total and free gossypol in the cottonseed cake were 3.28 mg/g and 0.11 mg/g, respectively. Throughout the trial period, no animal showed clinical signs of toxicity and no effects on body weight were observed. However, there was a significantly lower number of viable ovarian follicles (20.6%) and higher number of atretic follicles (79.4%) in the gossypol-fed sheep compared to the control (85.1 and 34.9%, respectively). These findings were observed at all stages of follicular development. In the second experiment, eight ovaries from slaughterhouse were cultured with different concentrations of gossypol acetic acid (0, 5, 10 and 20 μg/mL) for 24 hours or seven days. The in vitro action of gossypol resulted in a significant decrease in viable ovarian follicles, especially the primary and transition follicles, and a significant increase in the number of atretic follicles after 24 hours of culture. These follicles were greatly affected when cultured with gossypol for seven days. It is concluded that gossypol present in cotton seeds directly acts on ovarian follicles in sheep to increase atresia."
https://openalex.org/W2180229389,"Objective Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is a common condition, especially in childhood. The extent to which it occurs concurrently with or independently from allergic rhinitis (AR) has not been well described. Aim To examine the inter-relationship between rhinitis and conjunctivitis and the epidemiological risk factors for these conditions in a rural UK population. Methods Cross-sectional study of rural school children (aged 5–11 years). Parental questionnaires were used to diagnose allergic outcomes (including conjunctivitis, rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis), and to collect data on atopic history, demographic and environmental exposures. Odds ratios of allergic outcome by exposure were examined adjusted for age, sex, breastfeeding, family history of allergy, number of older and younger siblings. Results Prevalence of conjunctivitis was 17.5%, rhinitis 15.1% and rhinoconjunctivitis 13.0%. Seasonality of symptoms varied by condition: 64.7% of those with conjunctivitis had seasonal symptoms (April-Sept only), 46.7% of those with rhinitis and 92.2% of those with rhinoconjunctivitis. Living on a farm consistently reduced the risk of conjunctivitis (odds ratio 0.47, 95%CI 0.29–0.79, p = 0.004), rhinitis (OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.33–1.01, p = 0.05) and rhinoconjunctivitis (OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.32–1.03, p = 0.06). Exposure to farm animals (particularly in early life), current consumption of unpasteurised milk and playing in a barn or stable significantly reduced the risk of all three conditions. Conclusion More children had parent-reported conjunctivitis than rhinitis. The majority of children with either condition also reported symptoms with the other condition. Farmers’ children have less eye and/or nasal symptoms. A number of farming variables linked with the farm microbial environment are likely to be mediating the protective effect."

https://openalex.org/W2277164145,"Numerous reports have demonstrated a tumor inhibitory effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). However, the molecular mechanisms modulating this phenomenon are in part poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence of a novel antitumoral mechanism of the PUFA arachidonic acid (AA). In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that AA treatment decreased tumor growth and metastasis and increased apoptosis. Molecular analysis of this effect showed significantly reduced expression of a subset of antiapoptotic proteins, including BCL2, BFL1/A1, and 4-1BB, in AA-treated cells. We demonstrated that down-regulation of the transcription factor glioma-associated protein 1 (GLI1) in AA-treated cells is the underlying mechanism controlling BCL2, BFL1/A1, and 4-1BB expression. Using luciferase reporters, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and expression studies, we found that GLI1 binds to the promoter of these antiapoptotic molecules and regulates their expression and promoter activity. We provide evidence that AA-induced apoptosis and down-regulation of antiapoptotic genes can be inhibited by overexpressing GLI1 in AA-sensitive cells. Conversely, inhibition of GLI1 mimics AA treatments, leading to decreased tumor growth, cell viability, and expression of antiapoptotic molecules. Further characterization showed that AA represses GLI1 expression by stimulating nuclear translocation of NFATc1, which then binds the GLI1 promoter and represses its transcription. AA was shown to increase reactive oxygen species. Treatment with antioxidants impaired the AA-induced apoptosis and down-regulation of GLI1 and NFATc1 activation, indicating that NFATc1 activation and GLI1 repression require the generation of reactive oxygen species.

The cytotoxic effects of PUFAs have been suggested to occur in part due to alterations in reactive oxygen species, changes in cell membrane fluidity or conversion of PUFAs to highly bioactive metabolites such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and/or altered expression of genes that regulate apoptotic cell death (6Wang W.

However, the molecular pathways by which PUFAs regulate cell death in cancer cells are poorly understood. Here, using the PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) in vitro and in vivo, we define a novel mechanism underlying the tumor inhibitory function of this fatty acid. AA is a member of the ω-6 family, derived by successive elongation and desaturation from the essential fatty acid linoleic acid (LA), the major PUFA of cell membranes present at the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids. Direct cell supplementation with AA has cytotoxic activity and decreases cell viability in different tumor cell types, including cervical, hepatic, and pancreatic (23Das U.N. Madhavi N.

The Gli code: an information nexus regulating cell fate, stemness and cancer.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 438-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), as a target of AA signaling in cancer cells. GLI1 is a member of the GLI family of C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors. It plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis, contributing to the development of tumors in the prostate, lung, pancreas, and breast (27Kasper M. Regl G. Frischauf A.M. Aberger F.

We show that AA down-regulates GLI1 expression through the modulation of its promoter in an NFATc1-dependent manner. Finally, the blockade of GLI1 results in decreased expression of prosurvival target genes (BCL2, BFL1/A1, and 4-1BB), leading to increased cell death both in vivo and in vitro. Together, these findings define a novel signaling cascade controlling cancer cell survival and help to delineate the mechanisms underlying AA antitumoral properties.

For fatty acid treatments, AA, palmitoleic acid (PA), and LA (Nu-Chek Prep, Inc., Elysian, MN) were dissolved in absolute ethanol to an initial dilution of 100 mg/ml. The dilution was prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere and then stored at −80 °C. For all fatty acid treatments, we used 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the cell culture media as a fatty acid carrier. To avoid any issues with the use of FBS, we ran parallel experiments using 0.5 and 1% BSA as a carrier. Both protocols show similar biological effects (data not shown). For some of the experiments, a general caspase (CASP) inhibitor, Q-VD-OPH (SM Biochemicals LLC, Yorba Linda, CA), was used at a final concentration of 20 μm and added at the beginning of the cell culture process. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and l-glutathione (both from Sigma-Aldrich) were used at final concentration of 500 μm. Cyclosporin A (CsA) and ionomycin (both from Sigma-Aldrich) were used for some of the expression and reporter assays at a concentration of 1 and 0.5 μm, respectively. Cell viability was determined by a colorimetric and fluorometric technique using resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich). In each assay, 5 × 104 PANC1 cells/well or 7.5 × 104 MCF7 cells/well were plated in 96-well plates and cultured in their respective media. The following day cells were treated with different concentrations of AA (5, 20, 40, or 60 μg/ml) or the corresponding control vehicle. Twenty-four hours later, resazurin solution was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and the fluorescent signal was measured at 560 nm excitation/590 nm emission wavelengths in an FL X800 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). In some viability experiments, cells were treated with 20 μm GANT61 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX) or 20 μm Glabrescione B (kindly provided by Drs. Motta and Di Marcotulio, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy) for 48 h. In the in vivo studies, apoptosis was determined by the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method in which paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were used for the specific detection and quantification of apoptotic cells within a cell population using the DeadEndTM Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega, Madison, WI) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Images were obtained using an Axio Observer epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). For the in vitro studies, apoptosis was determined by DNA fluorescent labeling with Hoechst 33258 (32Zermati Y. Mouhamad S. Stergiou L. Besse B. Galluzzi L. Boehrer S. Pauleau A.L. Rosselli F.

After 24 h of AA treatment or 48 h with GANT61 or Glabrescione B, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with 500 μl of PBS solution and 500 μl of 3:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid for 5 min. Five hundred microliters of 3:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid was then added for 10 min. The medium was removed, and 1 ml of PBS plus Hoechst 33258 dye was added at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before being examined under a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop epifluorescence microscope, Carl Zeiss AG). In addition, the Apo-ONE homogeneous CASP3/7 assay (Promega) was performed. Cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. After treatment, 100 μl of Apo-ONE CASP3/7 reagent was added to each well containing 100 μl of cells in culture and incubated at room temperature for 6 h.

The GLI-luciferase reporter containing eight consecutive GLI binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene (GLI-LUC) was kindly provided by Dr. Chi-chung Hui (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Human BFL1/A1, 4-1BB, and GLI1 promoter reporter constructs were a gift from Drs. Gelinas (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ), Kang (College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea), and Aberger (University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria), respectively. Human BCL2 promoter containing the −1428 to −799 bp upstream of exon1 was cloned using standard DNA recombinant protocols. Mutations of GLI binding sites in wild type promoters were performed as follows. For BCL2 promoter, the GLI1 canonical binding sequence from −1125 to −1123 bp was changed from CAC to AAA using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and the following primers: GGCAAAGGTGGAGACCTTTAGGAGAAAAAAACCCCAGCGTTAGGACGGTGGGCC (sense) and GGCCCACCGTCCTAACGCTGGGGTTTTTTTTCTCCTAAAGGTCTCCACCTTTGCC (antisense). For BFL1/A1 promoter mutants, two core sequences of the GLI binding sites spanning from −5 to −3 bp and +27 to +29 bp were changed from CAC to AAA using the Q5 site-directed kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and the following set of primers: TTCACATTCCAAACAGCAATCTACAAG (sense) and ATGGTACAACCCCTGTGAAAATG (antisense) and CTAATTTCTCAAAATCCTGCATTTAAGAC (sense) and AATCCTTGTAGATTGCTGTTTG (antisense), respectively. For the 4-1BB promoter, the core sequence of the GLI binding site that goes from −12 to −10 bp was changed from CAC to AAA using the primer CCCGCCCCTGGCTGAGTaaaCGCACTCCTG (sense), the site spanning 510–512 bp was changed from CCC to AAA using the primer TGGTACTGCAAAGTACCTATGAAAGTCAAAAAAAGTTCTTGCTATTGTTATTTCTGC, and the site from 806 to 808 bp was changed from CAG to AAA using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) and the primer CTTTTGCAGAGTGACATTTGTGAGACAAACTAATTTGATTAAAATTCTCTTGGAATC (sense). In all cases, mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, and changes were verified by sequencing. PANC1 and MCF7 cells were transfected with X-tremeGENE HP (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, 5 × 104 and 7 × 105 cells were seeded per well in 12-well plates and 100-mm dishes, respectively. For luciferase assays, 2 μg of GLI1, GLI-LUC, BCL2, BFL1/A1, and 4-1BB promoter reporter vectors were used. For transfection of multiple constructs, 10 μg of DNA were used, consisting of 1 μg of promoter reporters and 9 μg of the expression vectors GLI1 and NFATc1. In GLI1 knockdown experiments, 10 μg of shGLI1 or control vector were transfected for 72 h. In the knockdown experiments where GLI1 and NFATc1 siRNAs (FlexiTube siRNA, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) were used along with a non-targeting siRNA negative control (Allstars Negative Control siRNA, Qiagen), cells were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) to a final concentration of 100 nm siRNA and harvested 48 h after transfection. In rescue experiments, PANC1 cells were transfected with 10 μg of GLI1 expression construct or empty vector. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were treated with AA at 60 μg/ml for 6 h. Then RNA was extracted to determine the expression of BCL2, BFL1/A1, and 4-1BB. Cells were grown and transfected as indicated above. For the assays, cells were plated in triplicate at 5 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates in the corresponding medium. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with AA, and then samples were harvested and prepared for luciferase assays in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). The total protein of samples in each well was quantitated using the Bio-Rad protein assay, and luciferase readouts were normalized to protein content. Relative luciferase activity represents luciferase/protein concentration readouts normalized to control group within each experiment (36Lo Ré A.E. Fernández-Barrena M.G. Almada L.L. Mills L.D.

Amplification was performed using the C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). Each RNA level was normalized by comparison with the corresponding housekeeping RNA level in the same sample. The results were calculated following the 2ΔCt method. ChIP was conducted following a modified version of the Magna ChIP kit protocol (EMD Millipore, Bedford, MA). Briefly, PANC1 cells (7 × 106) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde directly into the medium for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed and scraped with PBS, collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in cell lysis buffer, and incubated on ice for 15 min. The pellet was then resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer and sheared to fragment DNA to ∼700 bp. Samples were then immunoprecipitated using a GLI1 antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), NFATc1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), normal rabbit IgG (EMD Millipore), or normal mouse IgG (EMD Millipore) overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Following immunoprecipitation, cross-links were removed, and immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using spin columns and subsequently amplified by PCR. PCR was performed using a primer set to amplify a 350-bp region of the GLI1 promoter containing a potential NFATc1 binding site (sense, AGCAGTATAGGGTCCCTCAAG; antisense, CGCGAGAAGCGCAAACT) and primer sets to amplify BCL2, BFL1/A1, and 4-1BB promoters containing potential GLI1 binding sites as follows: BCL2: sense, ACACACGTCTGCGAGTGTGAATGT; antisense, TCCCTCTGTCCCTAACACCTTT; BFL1/A1: sense, GAGTATCTGTTGGGTGTATACCTATG; antisense, GATGATACATGGAGGCTGGTGGAA; 4-1BB: sense, ATCTGTGACACATCCTGACAGTAGA; antisense, ACATGTGGAAAGACCTCCCTGTTC; sense; GAACAGGGAGGTCTTTCCACATGT; antisense, TGATGAAATCTGGCACAGGTATGAT. PCR products were visualized using a 2% agarose gel. For the transient ChIP assay, PANC1 cells (1 × 106) were grown overnight in 100-mm dishes and then transfected with 3 μg of the BCL2, 4-1BB, or BFL1/A1 promoter reporter vectors with WT or mutant GLI1 biding sites using X-tremeGENE HP. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde and harvested, and chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. Antibodies used in the procedure include anti-GLI1 (Novus) and anti-rabbit IgG (EMD Millipore). The resulting DNA was analyzed by real time PCRs with the same set of primers described previously. Quantitative SYBR PCR was performed in triplicate for each sample using the C1000 Thermal Cycler. Results are represented as -fold of enrichment where each antibody signal was relative to its respective input and then normalized to the non-immune IgG control signal.

https://openalex.org/W2265575562,"CRISPR-Cas systems, which obstruct both viral infection and incorporation of mobile genetic elements by horizontal transfer, are a specific immune response common to prokaryotes. Antiviral protection by CRISPR-Cas comes at a cost, as horizontally-acquired genes may increase fitness and provide rapid adaptation to habitat change. To date, investigations into the prevalence of CRISPR have primarily focused on pathogenic and clinical bacteria, while less is known about CRISPR dynamics in commensal and environmental species. We designed PCR primers and coupled these with DNA sequencing of products to detect and characterize the presence of cas1, a universal CRISPR-associated gene and proxy for the Type II CRISPR1-Cas system, in environmental and non-clinical Enterococcus isolates. CRISPR1-cas1 was detected in approximately 33% of the 275 strains examined, and differences in CRISPR1 carriage between species was significant. Incidence of cas1 in E. hirae was 73%, nearly three times that of E. faecalis (23.6%) and 10 times more frequent than in E. durans (7.1%). Also, this is the first report of CRISPR1 presence in E. durans, as well as in the plant-associated species E. casseliflavus and E. sulfureus. Significant differences in CRISPR1-cas1 incidence among Enterococcus species support the hypothesis that there is a tradeoff between protection and adaptability. The differences in the habitats of enterococcal species may exert varying selective pressure that results in a species-dependent distribution of CRISPR-Cas systems."
https://openalex.org/W2178518700,"Juvenile hormones have attracted attention as safe and selective targets for the design and development of environmentally friendly and biorational insecticides. In the juvenile hormone III biosynthetic pathway, the enzyme farnesol dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of farnesol to farnesal. In this study, farnesol dehydrogenase was extracted from Polygonum minus leaves and purified 204-fold to apparent homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography using DEAE-Toyopearl, SP-Toyopearl, and Super-Q Toyopearl, followed by three successive purifications by gel filtration chromatography on a TSK-gel GS3000SW. The enzyme is a heterodimer comprised of subunits with molecular masses of 65 kDa and 70 kDa. The optimum temperature and pH were 35°C and pH 9.5, respectively. Activity was inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, metal-chelating agents and heavy metal ions. The enzyme utilized both NAD+ and NADP+ as coenzymes with Km values of 0.74 mM and 40 mM, respectively. Trans, trans-farnesol was the preferred substrate for the P. minus farnesol dehydrogenase. Geometrical isomers of trans, trans-farnesol, cis, trans-farnesol and cis, cis-farnesol were also oxidized by the enzyme with lower activity. The Km values for trans, trans-farnesol, cis, trans-farnesol and cis, cis-farnesol appeared to be 0.17 mM, 0.33 mM and 0.42 mM, respectively. The amino acid sequences of 4 tryptic peptides of the enzyme were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS spectrometry, and showed no significant similarity to those of previously reported farnesol dehydrogenases. These results suggest that the purified enzyme is a novel NAD(P)+-dependent farnesol dehydrogenase. The purification and characterization established in the current study will serve as a basis to provide new information for recombinant production of the enzyme. Therefore, recombinant farnesol dehydrogenase may provide a useful molecular tool in manipulating juvenile hormone biosynthesis to generate transgenic plants for pest control."
https://openalex.org/W2174417194,"The transmembrane domain (TMD) of the syndecans, a family of transmembrane heparin sulfate proteoglycans, is involved in forming homo- and heterodimers and oligomers that transmit signaling events. Recently, we reported that the unique phenylalanine in TMD positively regulates intramolecular interactions of syndecan-2. Besides the unique phenylalanine, syndecan-2 contains a conserved phenylalanine (SDC2-Phe-169) that is present in all syndecan TMDs, but its function has not been determined. We therefore investigated the structural role of SDC2-Phe-169 in syndecan TMDs. Replacement of SDC2-Phe-169 by tyrosine (S2F169Y) did not affect SDS-resistant homodimer formation but significantly reduced SDS-resistant heterodimer formation between syndecan-2 and -4, suggesting that SDC2-Phe-169 is involved in the heterodimerization/oligomerization of syndecans. Similarly, in an in vitro binding assay, a syndecan-2 mutant (S2(F169Y)) showed a significantly reduced interaction with syndecan-4. FRET assays showed that heteromolecular interactions between syndecan-2 and -4 were reduced in HEK293T cells transfected with S2(F169Y) compared with syndecan-2. Moreover, S2(F169Y) reduced downstream reactions mediated by the heterodimerization of syndecan-2 and -4, including Rac activity, cell migration, membrane localization of PKCα, and focal adhesion formation. The conserved phenylalanine in syndecan-1 and -3 also showed heterodimeric interaction with syndecan-2 and -4. Taken together, these findings suggest that the conserved phenylalanine in the TMD of syndecans is crucial in regulating heteromeric interactions of syndecans.

Integral membrane receptors consist of an extracellular domain that binds specific ligands, a transmembrane domain (TMD) 2The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; REF, rat embryonic fibroblast;CFP, cyan fluorescenceprotein; PBD, PAK1bindingdomain; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. that transmits signals in response to ligand binding, and a cytoplasmic domain to which the signals are transmitted by the TMD and that is thereby activated, resulting in a conformational change that causes binding or induction of enzymatic activity inside the cell (1Heldin C.H.

The TMD is therefore critically important in transmitting signals from the external environment to the inside of the cell, with many recent investigations exploring the mechanism by which TMD interactions regulate cell signaling (2Schlessinger J.

Most investigations of TMD interactions have analyzed homo-oligomerization in vitro and in vivo, with fewer to date assessing heterotypic TMD associations. One of the most investigated examples of hetero-oligomerization in biology involves the family of EGF receptors, also called the ErbB family (11Muthuswamy S.K. Gilman M. Brugge J.S.

Although only four ErbB family members have been identified to date, ErbB1 (EGF receptor), ErbB2 (HER2, Neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4), they have been shown to form 28 homo- and heterodimers (12Roskoski Jr., R. The ErbB/HER family of protein-tyrosine kinases and cancer.Pharmacol. Res. 2014; 79: 34-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). These combinations are thought to result in diverse cellular signals and to be associated with several types of diseases and cancers (12Roskoski Jr., R.

Except for ErbB3, the TMDs of ErbB family members contain two GXXXG-like motifs that are critical in the formation of homo- or hetero-oligomers of these proteins by stabilizing the interactions of transmembrane helices (14Mendrola J.M.

Syndecans are a family of transmembrane heparin sulfate proteoglycans consisting of four members: syndecan-1, -2, -3, and -4. Each of these heparin sulfate proteoglycans consists of an extracellular domain, a cytoplasmic domain, and a single TMD containing the GXXXG motif (16Tkachenko E. Rhodes J.M. Simons M.

In addition, the GXXXG motif-mediated interactions of syndecans are important in regulating syndecan functions in cells (17Choi S. Lee E. Kwon S. Park H. Yi J.Y. Kim S. Han I.O. Yun Y. Oh E.S.

Furthermore, we have reported recently that the hetero-oligomerization between syndecan-2 and -4 reduces the activities mediated by these proteins (19Choi Y. Kwon M.J. Lim Y. Yun J.H. Lee W. Oh E.S.

However, although previous findings have shown that the expression patterns of individual syndecans are regulated differently in individual cells and tissue types (20Carey D.J.

Studies have shown that interactions of the aromatic amino acids (e.g. phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) are critical not only for the assembly of soluble proteins like amyloid fibrils but also for the assembly of the TMDs of membrane proteins (22Pallitto M.M.

Experiments using a randomized TMD library and expression in bacteria have shown that the presence of aromatic residues resulted in strong and stable self-interactions of TMDs (25Ridder A. Skupjen P.

Shai Y. Specificity in transmembrane helix-helix interactions mediated by aromatic residues.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19753-19761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We found that a unique phenylalanine present in the TMD of syndecan-2 participates in the strong and stable SDS-resistant dimerization of syndecan-2 and regulates syndecan-2-related functions (27Kwon M.J. Choi Y. Yun J.H. Lee W. Han I.O. Oh E.S.

Chem. 2015; 290: 5772-5782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition to this unique phenylalanine, the syndecan-2 TMD contains an additional phenylalanine near the GXXXG motif, suggesting that the latter phenylalanine residue may have functional roles. This study therefore analyzed the role of the conserved phenylalanine in TMDs in the heterodimerization/oligomerization of syndecans and assessed the mechanism by which this TMD-mediated heterodimerization/oligomerization regulates syndecan functions.

Rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs) were maintained in α-modified Eagle's medium (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS (GE Healthcare Hyclone) and gentamycin (50 μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). HCT116 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5a medium (Welgene, Daegu, Korea). HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient transfections were carried out using Vivamagic (Vivagen, Seongnam, Korea) as described in the provided protocol. The extracellular and transmembrane domains (amino acids 151–179) of rat syndecan-2 were linked with the cytoplasmic domain of human PDGF receptor (amino acids 557–1107) to generate the chimeric protein 2eTPC. Single point mutants in the TMDs of syndecan-2 or -4 (i.e. S2(F167Y), S2(F169Y), S2(F172Y), and S4(F164Y)) were constructed by commercial gene synthesis (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea). The chimeras or point mutants were inserted into the N-terminal HA-tagging pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells (6.0 × 105 cells/well), REFs (8.0 × 104 cells/well), and HCT116 cells (1.0 × 106 cells/well) were plated on 6-well plates, incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and then transfected with the generated expression vectors as described in the Vivagen protocol. The SDC3-YFP and SDC3-CFP constructs were provided by Prof. Heikki Rauvala (Neuroscience Center, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland) (29Hienola A. Tumova S. Kulesskiy E. Rauvala H. N-syndecan deficiency impairs neural migration in brain.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Rat syndecan-2, syndecan-4, or single point mutant cDNA was ligated into the provided expression vector. HEK293T cells were transfected with cDNAs described earlier and imaged on a Leica TCS SP8 inverted microscope. All images were analyzed with Leica software (LAS X). Acceptor photobleaching was carried out for the evaluation of FRET efficiencies. Briefly, cells co-transfected with either syndecan-2 and -4 wild-type or mutant syndecan-2 and -4 were plated onto coverslips, fixed for 5 min in 3.5% (w/v) formaldehyde, and washed with PBS, and then the slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized with a HCX PL APO ×100 objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.40) using a 458-nm argon laser light and HyD detector (462–510 nm) for cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) excitation and emission and a 514-nm argon laser and HyD detector (518–580 nm) for YFP excitation and emission. Prebleach CFP and YFP images were collected simultaneously following excitation at 458 and 514 nm for CFP and YFP, respectively. The regions were selected automatically using Leica LAS X software (one or two bleached region(s) per cell). Selected regions were irradiated with a 514-nm laser (100% intensity, 80 iterations) to bleach YFP. Post-bleach CFP and YFP images were collected simultaneously. The FRET efficiency was calculated as 100 × [(Dpost − Dpre) / Dpost], where Dpost is the post-bleaching fluorescence intensity of CFP, and Dpre is the pre-bleaching fluorescence intensity of CFP. This calculation was performed using the FRET AB program of the Leica LAS X software package. Photobleaching was performed in 8∼15 cells/experiment, 10 regions of interest were analyzed for each image, and at least five images were quantified per experiment. Cultures were washed twice with PBS, and the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm NaF, and 2 μm Na3VO4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 m at 4 °C, denatured with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose blotting membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Signals were detected by an Odyssey CLx imager and analyzed by Image Studio Lite software (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The cDNAs encoding the full-length rat syndecan-2 or -4 core proteins, the single point mutants (S2(F167Y), S2(F169Y), S2(F172Y), and S4(F164Y)), rat syndecan-1 core proteins, and the point mutants (S1(F269Y), S1(F269Y,C272F), and S1(C272F)), and rat syndecan-3 core proteins were synthesized by PCR and subcloned into the His-tagging expression vector pET32a+ (Novagen, Madison, WI). The expression of fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 was induced by incubation with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 16 h. The E. coli cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitor mixture, with sonication on ice for 1 m. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 m 4 °C, and the supernatants containing His-syndecan fusion proteins were applied to Ni-NTA agarose columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Each column was washed three times with lysis buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, and the bound proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The cDNAs encoding rat syndecan-2 and -4 without extracellular domain (2eTC and 4eTC) were synthesized by PCR and subcloned into the GST expression vector pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). These constructs were used to transform E. coli DH5α, and the expression of GST fusion proteins was induced by incubation with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. The fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-agarose beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) as described previously (17Choi S. Lee E. Kwon S. Park H. Yi J.Y. Kim S. Han I.O. Yun Y. Oh E.S. Transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization is crucial for the functions of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4.J. Biol.

Cultures were washed twice with PBS, and the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm NaF, and 2 μm Na3VO4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 m at 4 °C, denatured with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose blotting membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Signals were detected by an Odyssey CLx imager and analyzed by Image Studio Lite software (LI-COR Biosciences). Fibronectin was diluted in serum-free medium (10 μg/ml), added to the plates, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plates were then washed with PBS and blocked with 0.2% heat-inactivated BSA for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells transfected with the indicated cDNAs were incubated for additional 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 5 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, and incubated with anti-paxillin. The slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Transfected REF cells were harvested with 5 mm EDTA and 5% FBS in PBS, washed twice with PBS, aliquoted, and incubated separately with SDC2 antibodies. After incubation for 16 h at 4 °C, cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and stained with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Abclone, Seoul, Korea). After 1 h of incubation in the dark, cells were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in PBS. Fluorescence was then measured by flow cytometry using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with CellQuestPro software (BD Biosciences). The lower surface of Transwell inserts (Costar) was coated with gelatin (10 μg/ml), and the membranes were allowed to dry for 1 h at room temperature. The Transwell inserts were assembled into a 24-well plate, and the lower chamber was filled with Μ medium containing 5% FBS. Cells (7 × 105) were added to each upper chamber, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 16 h. Migrated cells were stained with 0.6% hematoxylin and 0.5% eosin and counted. GST-PAK-PBD binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (31Hecker T.P. Grammer J.R. Gillespie G.Y. Stewart Jr., J. Gladson C.L. Focal adhesion kinase enhances signaling through the Shc/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in anaplastic astrocytoma tumor biopsy samples.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2699-2707PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the p21-binding domain of PAK1 (PBD) was expressed in E. coli as a GST-PAK-PBD fusion protein and purified using glutathione-agarose beads. The glutathione-agarose bead-bound GST-PBD was washed with lysis buffer three times and mixed with transfected HCT116 cell lysates of equal volume and concentration for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and bound rac1 proteins were detected by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against rac1. Total RNA extracted from transfected cells was used as a template for the reverse transcriptase reaction. Aliquots of cDNA were amplified using the following primers: rat SDC2, 5′-ATGCGGGTACGAGCCACGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGGAGCAGCACTAGTGAGG-3′ (reverse); rat SDC4, 5′-ATGGCGCCTGTCTGCCTGTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTGCCCTGGGAAGTGCTGG-3′ (reverse); and β-actin, 5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3′ (reverse). After an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, we performed 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. The reaction products were analyzed in 1% agarose gels. Data are presented as the means from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001 was considered statistically significant. We have reported previously that syndecan-2 and -4 formed SDS-resistant heterodimers through the GXXXG motif in their TMDs (19Choi Y. Kwon M.J. Lim Y. Yun J.H. Lee W. Oh E.S. Trans-regulation of syndecan functions by hetero-oligomerization.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 16943-16953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and that the unique phenylalanine (Phe-167) on the TMD of syndecan-2 strengthened its homodimerization (27Kwon M.J. Choi Y. Yun J.H. Lee W. Han I.O. Oh E.S. A unique phenylalanine in the transmembrane domain strengthens homodimerization of the syndecan-2 transmembrane domain and functionally regulates syndecan-2.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 5772-5782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition to Phe-167, the syndecan-2 TMD contains additional phenylalanines near the GXXXG motif. In particular, Phe-169 is conserved in all syndecan family members, as Phe-269 in syndecan-1, Phe-399 in syndecan-3, and Phe-164 in syndecan-4 (Fig. 1A). To assess the functional role of this residue, we analyzed its involvement in the regulation of SDS-resistant dimerization, a characteristic of syndecan family members. When Phe-167 was replaced by tyrosine (S2(F167Y); Fig. 1B, bottom panel), SDS-resistant homodimer syndecan-2 formation was reduced markedly. However, replacement of Phe-169 (S2(F169Y)) or Phe-172 (S2(F172Y)) by tyrosine did not affect SDS-resistant formation of syndecan-2 dimers (Fig. 1B, bottom panel), suggesting that Phe-169 is not involved in regulating the homodimeric interaction of the syndecan-2 TMD. Because this TMD also mediates heteromeric interactions of syndecans, we investigated whether Phe-169 could regulate SDS-resistant heterodimer formation. Consistent with a previous report (19Choi Y. Kwon M.J. Lim Y. Yun J.H. Lee W. Oh E.S. Trans-regulation of syndecan functions by hetero-oligomerization.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 16943-16953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we found that wild-type syndecan-2 (SDC2) and a syndecan-4 mutant (4eTC) formed SDS-resistant heterodimers, whereas the S2(F169Y) mutant showed reduced SDS-resistant heterodimer formation with 4eTC compared with the S2(F172Y) mutant or SDC2 wild type (Fig. 1C). Because S2(F172Y) did not show this effect, these finding suggest a specific role for Phe-169 in TMD-mediated heteromeric interactions between syndecan TMDs. Syndecan-4 substitution mutants (S4(F164Y)) in which the conserved phenylalanine was replaced by tyrosine consistently showed reduced SDS-resistant heterodimer formation with syndecan-2 (2eTC) (Fig. 1D). Quantitative results showed that heterodimer formation by the syndecan-2 (S2(F169Y)) and syndecan-4 (S4(F164Y)) substitution mutants was reduced compared with wild-type syndecan-2 and -4 (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results indicate that Phe-169 is involved in regulating syndecan-2-mediated intermolecular interactions with other syndecans and that the conserved phenylalanine on syndecan TMDs is critical for the formation of SDS-resistant syndecan heterodimers. To assess the involvement of Phe-169 of the syndecan-2 TMD in heteromolecular interactions with the syndecan-4 TMD, either wild-type syndecan-2 or the S2(F169Y) mutant were mixed with different amounts of 4eTC, analyzed by SDS-PAGE following Coomassie Blue staining, and compared with SDS-resistant heterodimer formation abilities. Compared with syndecan-2, the S2(F169Y) mutant showed reduced SDS-resistant heterodimer formation with 4eTC (Fig. 2A). To further investigate whether the conserved Phe-169 in the syndecan-2 TMD mediated the intermolecular interaction w"

We have observed that a large group of proteins showing increased ubiquitylation in the proteasome mutant at low temperature is comprised by reverses suppressor of Ty-phenotype 5 (Rsp5)-regulated plasma membrane proteins. Analysis of internalization and degradation of plasma membrane proteins at low temperature showed that the proteasome becomes determinant for this process, whereas, at 30 °C, the proteasome is dispensable. Moreover, our observations indicate that proteasomes have increased capacity to interact with lysine 63-polyubiquitylated proteins during low temperature in vivo. These unanticipated observations indicate that, during cold response, there is a proteolytic cellular reprogramming in which the proteasome acquires a role in the endocytic-vacuolar pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2261903356,"System xc(-) is a heteromeric amino acid cystine/glutamate antiporter that is constitutively expressed by cells of the CNS, where it functions in the maintenance of intracellular glutathione and extracellular glutamate levels. We recently determined that the cytokine, IL-1β, increases the activity of system xc(-) in CNS astrocytes secondary to an up-regulation of its substrate-specific light chain, xCT, and that this occurs, in part, at the level of transcription. However, an in silico analysis of the murine xCT 3'-UTR identified numerous copies of adenine- and uridine-rich elements, raising the possibility that undefined trans-acting factors governing mRNA stability and translation may also contribute to xCT expression. Here we show that IL-1β increases the level of mRNA encoding xCT in primary cultures of astrocytes isolated from mouse cortex in association with an increase in xCT mRNA half-life. Additionally, IL-1β induces HuR translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. RNA immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that HuR binds directly to the 3'-UTR of xCT in an IL-1β-dependent manner. Knockdown of endogenous HuR protein abrogates the IL-1β-mediated increase in xCT mRNA half-life, whereas overexpression of HuR in unstimulated primary mouse astrocytes doubles the half-life of constitutive xCT mRNA. This latter effect is accompanied by an increase in xCT protein levels, as well as a functional increase in system xc(-) activity. Altogether, these data support a critical role for HuR in mediating the IL-1β-induced stabilization of astrocyte xCT mRNA."

Typical broad-spectrum sources necessitate the use of mechanical filter switching, which introduces delays between acquisition of different fluorescence channels, impeding the interpretation and quantification of highly dynamic processes. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), however, allow modulation of excitation light in microseconds. Here we provide a step-by-step protocol to enable any scientist to build a research-grade LED illuminator for live cell microscopy, even without prior experience with electronics or optics. We quantify and compare components, discuss our design considerations, and demonstrate the performance of our LED illuminator by imaging axonal transport of herpes virus particles with high temporal resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2181081826,"The use of Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) in conjunction with Artificial Neural Network software NeuroDeveloper™ was examined for the rapid identification and classification of Listeria species and serotyping of Listeria monocytogenes. A spectral library was created for 245 strains of Listeria spp. to give a biochemical fingerprint from which identification of unknown samples were made. This technology was able to accurately distinguish the Listeria species with 99.03% accuracy. Eleven serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes including 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b were identified with 96.58% accuracy. In addition, motile and non-motile forms of Listeria were used to create a more robust model for identification. FT-IR coupled with NeuroDeveloper™ appear to be a more accurate and economic choice for rapid identification of pathogenic Listeria spp. than current methods."
https://openalex.org/W2181220151,"Newborn neurons are generated throughout life in two neurogenic regions, the subventricular zone and the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Stimulation of adult neurogenesis is considered as an attractive endogenous repair mechanism to treat different neurological disorders. Although tremendous progress has been made in our understanding of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, important questions remain unanswered, regarding the identity and the behavior of neural stem cells in the dentate gyrus. We previously showed that conditional Cre-Flex lentiviral vectors can be used to label neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and to track the migration of their progeny with non-invasive bioluminescence imaging. Here, we applied these Cre-Flex lentiviral vectors to study neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus with bioluminescence imaging and histological techniques. Stereotactic injection of the Cre-Flex vectors into the dentate gyrus of transgenic Nestin-Cre mice resulted in specific labeling of the nestin-positive neural stem cells. The labeled cell population could be detected with bioluminescence imaging until 9 months post injection, but no significant increase in the number of labeled cells over time was observed with this imaging technique. Nevertheless, the specific labeling of the nestin-positive neural stem cells, combined with histological analysis at different time points, allowed detailed analysis of their neurogenic potential. This long-term fate mapping revealed that a stable pool of labeled nestin-positive neural stem cells continuously contributes to the generation of newborn neurons in the mouse brain until 9 months post injection. In conclusion, the Cre-Flex technology is a valuable tool to address remaining questions regarding neural stem cell identity and behavior in the dentate gyrus."
https://openalex.org/W2258667459,"NatB is an N-terminal acetyltransferase consisting of a catalytic Nat5 subunit and an auxiliary Mdm20 subunit. In yeast, NatB acetylates N-terminal methionines of proteins during de novo protein synthesis and also regulates actin remodeling through N-terminal acetylation of tropomyosin (Trpm), which stabilizes the actin cytoskeleton by interacting with actin. However, in mammalian cells, the biological functions of the Mdm20 and Nat5 subunits are not well understood. In the present study, we show for the first time that Mdm20-knockdown (KD), but not Nat5-KD, in HEK293 and HeLa cells suppresses not only cell growth, but also cellular motility. Although stress fibers were formed in Mdm20-KD cells, and not in control or Nat5-KD cells, the localization of Trpm did not coincide with the formation of stress fibers in Mdm20-KD cells. Notably, knockdown of Mdm20 reduced the expression of Rictor, an mTORC2 complex component, through post-translational regulation. Additionally, PKCαS657 phosphorylation, which regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, was also reduced in Mdm20-KD cells. Our data also suggest that FoxO1 phosphorylation is regulated by the Mdm20-mTORC2-Akt pathway in response to serum starvation and insulin stimulation. Taken together, the present findings suggest that Mdm20 acts as a novel regulator of Rictor, thereby controlling mTORC2 activity, and leading to the activation of PKCαS657 and FoxO1."
https://openalex.org/W2276432595,"It is well known that several metals, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and vanadium, can mimic the effects of estrogens (metallo-estrogens). Nevertheless, there are only a few studies that have assessed the effects of toxic metals on the female genital tract and, in particular, endometrial tissue. In this context, we measured the concentrations of several trace elements in human endometrial tissue samples from individuals with hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma and in normal tissues. Hyperplasic endometrial tissue has a 4-fold higher concentration of mercury than normal tissue. Mercury can affect both the AhR and ROS signaling pathways. Thus, we investigated the possible toxic effects of mercury by in vitro studies. We found that mercury increases oxidative stress (increased HO1 and NQO1 mRNA levels) and alters the cytoskeleton in the human endometrial Ishikawa cell line and to a lesser extent, in the ""less-differentiated"" human endometrial Hec-1b cells. The results might help to explain a potential link between this metal and the occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia."

AMSH interacts with signal transducing adapter molecule (STAM) 1 or 2, which enhances the activity of AMSH through an unknown mechanism. This stimulation is dependent on the ubiquitin-interacting motif of STAM. Here we investigate the specific mechanism of AMSH stimulation by STAM proteins and the role of the STAM Vps27/Hrs/STAM domain. We show that, in the presence of STAM, the length of the ubiquitin chains affects the apparent cleavage rate. Through measurement of the chain cleavage kinetics, we found that, although the kcat of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain cleavage was comparable for di- and tri-ubiquitin, the Km value was lower for tri-ubiquitin. This increased affinity for longer chains was dependent on the Vps27/Hrs/STAM domain of STAM and required that the substrate ubiquitin chain contain homogenous Lys63-linkages. In addition, STAM directed AMSH cleavage toward the distal isopeptide bond in tri-ubiquitin chains. Finally, we generated a structural model of AMSH-STAM to show how the complex binds Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains and cleaves at the distal end.

https://openalex.org/W2265018792,"Objectives UmbiFlow™ is a mobile-connected Doppler device that utilises a continuous waveform to measure resistance in the umbilical artery. The main aim of this pilot study was to determine whether the use of UmbiFlow™ for umbilical artery Doppler in patients with a suspected decreased symphysis fundal (SF) growth could safely lead to a decreased number of patients requiring referral to a more specialised level of care. A secondary aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of UmbiFlow™ Doppler as a screening tool for concealed placental insufficiency in late bookers by using a single screening cut-off value that will be abnormal for any gestation >28 weeks. Methods The cohort comprised two groups of patients: The first group included all follow-up patients with suspected intra-uterine growth restriction (a decreased symphysis-fundus measurement based on serial assessment) who underwent on-site UmbiFlow™Doppler testing performed by the midwife directly after the clinical examination. The second group included late bookers, where gestation was uncertain; but estimated >28 weeks based on clinical grounds. This group was comprised of unselected patients who report to antenatal care late for the first time and received an UmbiFlow™Doppler test for concealed placental insufficiency. Results UmbiFlow™Doppler could reduce the number of false referrals to hospital by 55%. A single UmbiFlow™Doppler test in late bookers appeared to identify a group of women at moderate risk of lower birth weight babies."

We evaluated the effectiveness of the A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal influenza vaccines (TIV) used during the 2009 mass vaccination campaign in Manitoba (Canada) in preventing P&I hospitalization. Methods A population-based record-linkage nested case-control study. Cases (N = 1,812) were persons hospitalized with influenza (ICD-10:J09-J11) or pneumonia (ICD-10:J12-J18) during the study period. Age-, gender- and area of residence-matched controls (N = 7,915) were randomly sampled from Manitoba’s Population Registry. Information on receipt of A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine and TIV was obtained from the Manitoba Immunization Monitoring System, a province-wide vaccine registry. Results Overall, the adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was 27% (95%CI 13–39%) effective against P&I hospitalization ≥ 14 days following administration. Effectiveness seemed lower among older (≥ 65 years) adults (10%; −16–30%), particularly when compared to under-5 children (58%; 30–75%). The number-needed-to-vaccinate to prevent 1 P&I admission was lowest among <4 year-olds (928) and ≥65 years (1,721). VE against hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 was 70% (39–85%) overall and (91%; 62–98%) ≥ 14 days following vaccination. Discussion Our data suggest that the adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was effective in preventing about 55–60% of P&I hospitalizations among children and younger adults who were at much higher risk of infection. Unfortunately, the vaccine was less effective among 65 or older adults. Despite that the vaccine still had a significant population-based impact especially among the very young (<5) and the older (≥ 65 years)."
https://openalex.org/W2274589034,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most prevalent autosomal recessive disease in the Caucasian population. A cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator knockout (CFTR-/-) pig that displays most of the features of the human CF disease has been recently developed. However, CFTR-/- pigs presents a 100% prevalence of meconium ileus that leads to death in the first hours after birth, requiring a rapid diagnosis and surgical intervention to relieve intestinal obstruction. Identification of CFTR-/- piglets is usually performed by PCR genotyping, a procedure that lasts between 4 to 6 h. Here, we aimed to develop a procedure for rapid identification of CFTR-/- piglets that will allow placing them under intensive care soon after birth and immediately proceeding with the surgical correction.Male and female CFTR+/- pigs were crossed and the progeny was examined by computed tomography (CT) scan to detect the presence of meconium ileus and facilitate a rapid post-natal surgical intervention. Genotype was confirmed by PCR. CT scan presented a 94.4% sensitivity to diagnose CFTR-/- piglets. Diagnosis by CT scan reduced the birth-to-surgery time from a minimum of 10 h down to a minimum of 2.5 h and increased the survival of CFTR-/- piglets to a maximum of 13 days post-surgery as opposed to just 66 h after later surgery.CT scan imaging of meconium ileus is an accurate method for rapid identification of CFTR-/- piglets. Early CT detection of meconium ileus may help to extend the lifespan of CFTR-/- piglets and, thus, improve experimental research on CF, still an incurable disease."
https://openalex.org/W2173101058,"Forest buffers are a primary tool used to protect wetland-dependent wildlife. Though implemented widely, buffer efficacy is untested for most amphibian species. Consequently, it remains unclear whether buffers are sufficient for maintaining amphibian populations and if so, how wide buffers should be. We present evidence from a six-year, landscape-scale experiment testing the impacts of clearcutting, buffer width, and hydroperiod on body size and condition and biomass of breeding adults for two amphibian species at 11 vernal pools in the northeastern United States. We randomly assigned treatments (i.e., reference, 100m buffer, 30m buffer) across pools, clearcut to create buffers, and captured all spotted salamanders and wood frogs. Clearcuts strongly and negatively impacted size, condition, and biomass, but wider buffers mitigated effect magnitude and duration. Among recaptured individuals, for example, 30m-treatment salamanders were predicted to be about 9.5 mm shorter than, while 100m-treatment salamanders did not differ in length from, reference-treatment salamanders. Similarly, among recaptured frogs, mean length in the 30m treatment was predicted to decrease by about 1 mm/year, while in the 100m and reference treatments, length was time-invariant. Some, but not all, metrics recovered with time. For example, female new-captured and recaptured salamanders were predicted, respectively and on average, to weigh 4.5 and 7 g less in the 30m versus reference treatment right after the cut. While recaptured-female mass was predicted to recover by 9.5 years post-cut, new-captured-female mass did not recover. Hydroperiod was an important mediator: in the 100m treatment, cutting predominately affected pools that were stressed hydrologically. Overall, salamanders and female frogs were impacted more than male frogs. Our results highlight the importance of individualized metrics like body size, which can reveal sublethal effects and illuminate mechanisms by which habitat disturbance impacts wildlife populations. Individualized metrics thus provide critical insights that complement species occurrence and abundance-based population assessments."

Aims The objective of this study was to assess the attitudes toward placebo-controlled clinical trials among patients with schizophrenia in Japan. Method Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited patients (n = 251) aged 47.7±13.2 (mean±SD) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were admitted to six psychiatric hospitals from December 2013 to March 2014. We employed a 14-item questionnaire specifically developed to survey patients' attitudes toward placebo-controlled clinical trials. Results The results indicated that 33% of the patients would be willing to participate in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. Expectations for improvement of disease, a guarantee of hospital treatment continuation, and encouragement by family or friends were associated with the willingness to participate in such trials, whereas a belief of additional time required for medical examinations was associated with non-participation. Conclusions Fewer than half of the respondents stated that they would be willing to participate in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Therefore, interpreting the results from placebo-controlled clinical trials could be negatively affected by selection bias."

As a result, it does not conform to actual situation and the test data is not convincing enough. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a novel method which simulates the real mechanical conditions and ensures the gravity is parallel to the fabric plane. This method applied a low-cost Kinect Sensor device to capture the 3-dimensional (3D) drape profile, thus we obtained the drape degree parameters and aesthetic parameters by 3D reconstruction and image processing and analysis techniques. The experiment was conducted on our self-devised drape-testing instrument by choosing different kinds of weave structure fabrics as our testing samples and the results were compared with those of traditional method and subjective evaluation. Through regression and correlation analysis we found that this novel testing method was significantly correlated with the traditional and subjective evaluation method. We achieved a new, non-contact 3D measurement method for drape testing, namely unidirectional fabric drape testing method. This method is more suitable for evaluating drape behavior because it is more in line with actual mechanical conditions of draped fabrics and has a well consistency with the requirements of visual and aesthetic style of fabrics."
https://openalex.org/W2177337328,"Eucolaspis Sharp 1886 is a New Zealand native leaf beetle genus (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Eumolpinae) with poorly described species and a complex taxonomy. Many economically important fruit crops are severely damaged by these beetles. Uncertain species taxonomy of Eucolaspis is leaving any biological research, as well as pest management, tenuous. We used morphometrics, mitochondrial DNA and male genitalia to study phylogenetic and geographic diversity of Eucolaspis in New Zealand. Freshly collected beetles from several locations across their distribution range, as well as identified voucher specimens from major museum collections were examined to test the current classification. We also considered phylogenetic relationships among New Zealand and global Eumolpinae (Coleoptera: Chyrosomelidae). We demonstrate that most of the morphological information used previously to define New Zealand Eucolaspis species is insufficient. At the same time, we show that a combination of morphological and genetic evidence supports the existence of just 3 mainland Eucolaspis lineages (putative species), and not 5 or 15, as previously reported. In addition, there may be another closely related lineage (putative species) on an offshore location (Three Kings Islands, NZ). The cladistic structure among the lineages, conferred through mitochondrial DNA data, was well supported by differences in male genitalia. We found that only a single species (lineage) infests fruit orchards in Hawke’s Bay region of New Zealand. Species-host plant associations vary among different regions."
https://openalex.org/W2178644739,"The assessment of the effectiveness of a treatment in a clinical trial, depends on calculating p-values. However, p-values are only indirect and partial indicators of a genuine effect. Particularly in situations where publication bias is very likely, assessment using a p-value of 0.05 may not be sufficiently cautious. In other situations it seems reasonable to believe that assessment based on p-values may be unduly conservative. Assessments could be improved by using prior information. This implies using a Bayesian approach to take account of prior probability. However, the use of prior information in the form of expert opinion can allow bias. A method is given here that applies to assessments already included or likely to be included in the Cochrane Collaboration, excluding those reviews concerning new drugs. This method uses prior information and a Bayesian approach, but the prior information comes not from expert opinion but simply from the distribution of effectiveness apparent in a random sample of summary statistics in the Cochrane Collaboration. The method takes certain types of summary statistics and their confidence intervals and with the help of a graph, translates this into probabilities that the treatments being trialled are effective."
