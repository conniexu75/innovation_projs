https://openalex.org/W3082748483,"A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 pandemic in humans, recently emerged and has exported in more than 200 countries as a result of rapid spread. In this study, we have made an attempt to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 genome reported from 13 different countries, identification of mutations in major coronavirus proteins of these different SARS-CoV-2 genomes and compared with SARS-CoV. These thirteen complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed high identity (>99%) to each other, while they shared 82% identity with SARS-CoV. Here, we performed a very systematic mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different geographical locations, which enabled us to identify numerous unique features of this viral genome. This includes several important country-specific unique mutations in the major proteins of SARS-CoV-2 namely, replicase polyprotein, spike glycoprotein, envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein. Indian strain showed mutation in spike glycoprotein at R408I and in replicase polyprotein at I671T, P2144S and A2798V,. While the spike protein of Spain & South Korea carried F797C and S221W mutation, respectively. Likewise, several important country specific mutations were analyzed. The effect of mutations of these major proteins were also investigated using various in silico approaches. Main protease (Mpro), the therapeutic target protein of SARS with maximum reported inhibitors, was thoroughly investigated and the effect of mutation on the binding affinity and structural dynamics of Mpro was studied. It was found that the R60C mutation in Mpro affects the protein dynamics, thereby, affecting the binding of inhibitor within its active site. The implications of mutation on structural characteristics were determined. The information provided in this manuscript holds great potential in further scientific research towards the design of potential vaccine candidates/small molecular inhibitor against COVID19."
https://openalex.org/W3083360362,"Background Mutations in STK11 (STK11m) and frequently co-occurring KRAS mutations (KRASm/STK11m) are associated with poor survival in metastatic NSCLC (mNSCLC) immuno-oncology trials. There are limited data regarding the prognostic significance of these mutations in a real-world setting. Methods This retrospective cohort study analyzed de-identified electronic medical records from the Flatiron Clinico-Genomic database to identify patients with mNSCLC who had initiated first-line immunotherapy (IO; alone or in combination) or chemotherapy under routine care between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2017. The primary objectives were to assess the prevalence of STK11m and KRASm/STK11m and to determine associations of these mutations with overall and progression-free survival (OS, PFS). Results Of 2407 patients with mNSCLC, STK11m and KRASm/STK11m were present in 13.6% and 6.5% of patients, respectively. Worse OS outcomes were observed in patients with STK11m versus STK11wt mNSCLC receiving IO (first-line, HR [95% CI], 1.4 [0.9–2.3; p = 0.1]; second-line [subset of first-line cohort], HR, 1.6 [1.3–2.0; p = 0.0002]) or chemotherapy (first-line, HR, 1.4 [1.2–1.6; p < 0.0001]); PFS outcomes showed similar trends. KRASm/STK11m double mutations were associated with worse OS and PFS outcomes versus KRASwt/STK11wt with IO and chemotherapy, similar to the single mutation (STK11m vs STK11wt) findings. Conclusions This large observational genomic study among patients receiving routine care highlights the negative prognostic impact of STK11m in patients with mNSCLC treated with IO or chemotherapy. These results complement previous clinical trial data and provide further evidence in the real world of a patient population that would benefit from new treatment options."
https://openalex.org/W3082374074,"The psychological impacts of the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic are widely documented. In India, a family-centric society with a high population density and extreme social stratification, the impact of the lockdown might vary across diverse social groups. However, the patterning in the psychological impact of the lockdown among LGBT adults and persons known to be at higher risk of the complications of Covid-19 (such as persons with comorbidities or a history of mental illness) is not known in the Indian context. We used mixed methods (online survey, n = 282 and in-depth interviews, n = 14) to investigate whether the psychological influence of the lockdown was different across these groups of Indian adults. We fitted linear and logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Thematic analysis helped us identify emergent themes in our qualitative narratives. Anxiety was found to be higher among LGBT adults (β = 2.44, CI: 0.58, 4.31), the high-risk group (persons with comorbidities) (β = 2.20, CI:0.36, 4.05), and those with a history of depression/loneliness (β = 3.89, CI:2.34, 5.44). Persons belonging to the LGBT group reported a greater usage of pornography than the heterosexuals (β = 2.72, CI: 0.09, 5.36) during the lockdown. Qualitative findings suggested that LGBT adults likely used pornography and masturbation to cope with the lockdown, given the limited physical access to sexual partners in a society that stigmatizes homosexuality. Moreover, both qualitative and quantitative study findings suggested that greater frequency of calling family members during lockdown could strengthen social relationships and increase social empathy. The study thereby urgently calls for the attention of policymakers to take sensitive and inclusive health-related decisions for the marginalized and the vulnerable, both during and after the crisis."
https://openalex.org/W3083627967,"Quercetin is a yellow pigment that is found in many common dietary plants, and that protects against oxidative stress, inflammation, and arteriosclerosis. It has also been suggested to prolong the lifespan of, and enhance heat-stress tolerance in nematodes; thus, the present study investigated its effects on both the nematode life- and health span by assessing its capacity to promote nematode motility after aging and/or heat stress, as well as the mechanisms underlying these effects. The results of the conducted analyses showed that quercetin feeding prolonged lifespan, suppressed age-related motility retardation, improved motility recovery after heat stress, and decreased the production of both intercellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in the analysed Caenorhabditis elegans strains, likely by modulating the insulin-like signalling (ILS) pathway and p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In particular, the transcription factors DAF-16 and SKN-1 were found to mediate the observed quercetin-induced effects, consistent with their previously demonstrated roles as regulators of aging. Furthermore, we demonstrated, for the first time, that quercetin induced heat-stress tolerance in C. elegans by modulating HSF-1 expression and/or activity. Thus, the present study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms by which quercetin inhibit aging and enhance heat-stress tolerance via ILS and MAPK pathway in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W3083042828,"Background Adolescence is a vulnerable period for experiencing poor sleep health. Growing studies have demonstrated lifestyle behaviors including physical activity (PA), screen time (SCT), and sedentary behaviors (SED) as the potential factors associated with sleep health in adolescents; yet, the evidence is inconclusive and the directionality of temporal associations across school days are not well understood. This study examined the day-to-day bidirectional associations of lifestyle behaviors with sleep health parameters in adolescents. Methods A total of 263 adolescents (58% boys) in 6th - 8th grades wore an accelerometer for 24-hour across the three consecutive school days and completed recording SCT in time-diary and answering sleep quality (SQ) questions for each day. Sleep-wake patterns as well as time spent in moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) and SED were objectively quantified from the wrist-worn accelerometry data across the two segments of the day (during and after school hours). Mixed model analyses were conducted to test bidirectional associations between lifestyle factors and sleep health parameters in each temporal direction across the days. Additionally, indirect associations across the days were tested using an autoregressive cross-lagged model analysis in the framework of path analysis. Results MVPA minutes in a day did not predict sleep health parameters that night. The bidirectional associations were partially observed between SED and sleep health, but the significance and direction of the associations largely varied by the time segment of a day as well as types of sleep health parameters. Additionally, greater SCT during the day was associated with lower SQ that night (b = -0.010; P = .018), and greater SQ was associated with greater MVPA during school hours (b = 6.45; P = .028) and lower SED after school hours (b = -39.85; P = .029) the next day. Lastly, there were significant indirect associations of SCT with sleep health parameters across the days indicating multi-day lagged effects of SCT on sleep health the later nights. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of lowering SCT for better sleep health in adolescents during school days. Additionally, perceived SQ is shown to be a potential significant predictor promoting healthy behaviors the next day independent of sleep-wake patterns. Further studies are warranted to confirm the observed temporal associations between SCT, SQ, and behavioral outcomes in this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W3083327215,"Early sexual activity, often defined as initiation before the age of 16, is a risk behaviour associated with negative health outcomes in adulthood. The objective of this study was to explore links between early sexual activity and individual and contextual characteristics in Canadian youth, and whether these differ for girls and boys.Data were from the 2018 Canadian Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey administered in classrooms across Canada to students in grades 6 to 10 (ages 11 to 16). The sample includes the 7882 students in grades 9 and 10 who were asked about sexual activity. Individual and contextual measures used included emotional well-being, socioeconomic status, participation in team sports, body image, social media use, family structure, and family support. Descriptive data overall and separately for girls and boys are presented, followed by Poisson regression models to estimate relative risks and associated 95% confidence intervals for strength of associations between characteristics and early sexual activity. Models were adjusted for clustering by school using generalised estimating equations.Overall, contextual factors i.e. disrupted family structure or low family support were the characteristics most strongly associated with early sexual activity. Among boys there was an incremental and strong relationship between hours spent in organised sport and early sexual activity. Among girls, poorer body image, lower socioeconomic status, and higher social media use aligned most strongly with early sexual activity.Persistent gender stereotypes appear to underlie differences in individual and contextual factors associated with adolescents' sexual behaviour. Findings from this exploratory analysis may be of benefit to subsequent researchers, policy makers and those who care for youth."
https://openalex.org/W3083586734,"Background Olympic weightlifting requires technical skills, explosive power, strength, and coordination. Weightlifters can be competitive within a range of morphological characteristics due to competition body weight classes. To date no studies have examined when sex differences arise in weightlifting and the impact of body mass on performances at different ages. Objectives To examine when sex-related differences emerge, to quantify the influence of body mass on performances at different ages, and to estimate the age at peak performance. Methods Competitions results from USA Weightlifting National Championships, Youth, Junior, and Senior from 2014 to 2019 were collected for weightlifters aged 6 to 30. Results At age 10 the median total weight lifted was 51kg and 54kg, respectively, for girls and boys. From age 10 to 12 a gender gap emerges with a sex difference of 11.7% at age 14 at 55kg body mass. At age 25 the sex-related performance difference is smaller for lighter athletes (23.6% at 69kg body mass) and larger for heavier athletes (29.9% at 81kg body mass). The median peak age for men is 26.5 years (95% CI: 25.7, 27.3) and for women 25.9 years (95% CI: 24.7, 27.3). Conclusion We quantified the impact of body weight and age and sex differences for youth and young adults, ages 6 to 30 years old, participating in national level Olympic weightlifting competitions in the United States. Body weight at younger ages has less impact on performance compared to older ages, and boys and girls perform similarly. When reaching the ages typically associated with the onset of puberty, boys’ performances rapidly increase and the gap between genders widens. Women achieve peak performance at a similar age than men. Such results may help to establish progression trajectories for talented athletes and inform coaches, athletes and national governing bodies."
https://openalex.org/W3083206194,"Vitamin E acetate (VEA) is strongly linked to the outbreak of electronic-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). It has been proposed that VEA decomposition to ketene–a respiratory poison that damages lungs at low ppm levels–may play a role in EVALI. However, there is no information available on the temperature at which VEA decomposes and how this correlates with the vaping process. We have studied the temperature-dependent kinetics of VEA decomposition using quantum chemical and statistical mechanical modelling techniques, developing a chemical kinetic model of the vaping process. This model predicts that, under typical vaping conditions, the use of VEA contaminated e-cigarette products is unlikely to produce ketene at harmful levels. However, at the high temperatures encountered at low e-cigarette product levels, which produce ‘dry hits’, ketene concentrations are predicted to reach acutely toxic levels in the lungs (as high as 30 ppm). We therefore hypothesize that dry hit vaping of e-cigarette products containing VEA contributes to EVALI."
https://openalex.org/W3083163521,"Organizational effectiveness is contingent upon employees' contributions; however, the role of employee voice behavior as a critical component of employees' contribution to the organization has not been sufficiently acknowledged. Based on proactive behavior theory, we present a model to investigate employee voice behavior as an underlying mechanism in the relationship between supervisor delegation and perceived workplace inclusion. Using the SEM (structural equation modeling) method, we test our model's hypotheses with data from 271 employee-supervisor questionnaires administered in state-owned enterprises in the telecommunications industry. The results show that supervisor delegation is positively related to employees' promotive and prohibitive voice behavior. Promotive voice significantly influences perceived workplace inclusion, but prohibitive voice behavior was not found to have any impact on perceived workplace inclusion. Moreover, both dimensions of voice behavior, i.e., promotive and prohibitive voice behavior, significantly mediate the relationship between supervisor delegation and perceived workplace inclusion."
https://openalex.org/W3082713909,"In the face of the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals on the frontline are in urgent need of frequent updates in the accomplishment of their practice. Hence, clinicians started to search for prompt, valid information on sources that are parallel to academic journals. Aim of this work is to investigate the extent of this phenomenon. We administered an anonymous online cross-sectional survey to 645 Italian clinicians. Target of the survey were all medical figures potentially involved in the management of COVID-19 cases. 369 questionnaires were returned. 19.5% (n = 72) of respondents were younger than 30 years-old; 49,3% (n = 182) worked in Infectious Diseases, Internal Medicine or Respiratory Medicine departments, 11.5% (n = 42) in Intensive Care Unit and 7.4% (n = 27) were general practitioner. 70% (n = 261) of respondents reported that their use of social media to seek medical information increased during the pandemic. 39.3% (n = 145) consistently consulted Facebook groups and 53.1% (n = 196) Whatsapp chats. 47% (n = 174) of respondents reported that information shared on social media had a consistent impact on their daily practice. In the present study, we found no difference in social media usage between age groups or medical specialties. Given the urgent need for scientific update during the present pandemic, these findings may help understanding how clinicians access new evidences and implement them in their daily practice."
https://openalex.org/W3083361230,"Background Healthcare experiences associated with perceived racial/ethnic discrimination among patients are poorly understood. Objective Identify domains of patient dissatisfaction associated with perceived racial/ethnic discrimination among patients with pain. Design Semi-structured telephone surveys completed in 2013–2015. Participants White, African American, and Latino participants who reported receiving pain management from 25 Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers. Main measures Surveys included open-ended questions about healthcare satisfaction/dissatisfaction and a measure of perceived racial/ethnic-based discrimination while seeking VA healthcare. Binary indicators for ten qualitative domains of dissatisfaction were derived from open-ended questions. We used multilevel models to identify dissatisfaction domains associated with perceived discrimination, adjusting for patient characteristics and site. Within domains associated with discrimination, we identified the most frequent codes and examined whether patients primarily referenced clinical or non-clinical staff in their experiences. Key results Overall, 622 participants (30.4% White, 37.8% African American, 31.8% Latino; 57.4% female; mean age = 53.4) reported a median discrimination score of 1.0 (IQR: 1.0–1.3) on a scale of 1 to 5; 233 (37.5%) perceived any racial/ethnic discrimination in healthcare. Individually, 7 of 10 qualitative domains were significantly associated with perceived discrimination: dissatisfaction with care quality, facilities, continuity of care, interactions with staff, staff demeanor, unresolved pain, and pharmacy services (ps<0.005). In combined models stratified by racial/ethnic group, 3 domains remained statistically significant: poor interactions for Latinos (adjOR = 5.24, 95% CI = 2.28–12.06), negative demeanor for African Americans (adjOR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.45–5.50), and unresolved pain for Whites (adjOR = 6.23, 95% CI = 2.39–16.28). Clinical staff were referenced more often than non-clinical staff for all domains (interactions: 51% vs. 30%; demeanor: 46% vs. 15%; unresolved pain: 18% vs. 1%, respectively). Conclusion Negative interpersonal experiences and unresolved pain are strong correlates of perceived racial/ethnic discrimination among patients with pain. Future studies should test whether interventions targeting these domains reduce patient perceptions of racial/ethnic discrimination in healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W3083151649,"The MITF, TFEB, TFE3 and TFEC (MiT-TFE) proteins belong to the basic helix-loop-helix family of leucine zipper transcription factors. MITF is crucial for melanocyte development and differentiation, and has been termed a lineage-specific oncogene in melanoma. The three related proteins MITF, TFEB and TFE3 have been shown to be involved in the biogenesis and function of lysosomes and autophagosomes, regulating cellular clearance pathways. Here we investigated the cross-regulatory relationship of MITF and TFEB in melanoma cells. Like MITF, the TFEB and TFE3 genes are expressed in melanoma cells as well as in melanoma tumors, albeit at lower levels. We show that the MITF and TFEB proteins, but not TFE3, directly affect each other's mRNA and protein expression. In addition, the subcellular localization of MITF and TFEB is subject to regulation by the mTOR signaling pathway, which impacts their cross-regulatory relationship at the transcriptional level. Our work shows that the relationship between MITF and TFEB is multifaceted and that the cross-regulatory interactions of these factors need to be taken into account when considering pathways regulated by these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3083216106,"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) is a primary astrocytopathy driven by antibodies directed against the aquaporin-4 water channel located at the end-feet of the astrocyte. Although blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is considered one of the key steps for the development and lesion formation, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of human immunoglobulins from NMOSD patients (NMO-IgG) on BBB properties.Freshly isolated brain microvessels (IBMs) from rat brains were used as a study model. At first, analysis of the secretome profile from IBMs exposed to purified NMO-IgG, to healthy donor IgG (Control-IgG), or non-treated, was performed. Second, tight junction (TJ) proteins expression in fresh IBMs and primary cultures of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) was analysed by Western blotting (Wb) after exposition to NMO-IgG and Control-IgG. Finally, functional BBB properties were investigated evaluating the presence of rat-IgG in tissue lysate from brain using Wb in the rat-model, and the passage of NMO-IgG and sucrose in a bicameral model.We found that NMO-IgG induces functional and morphological BBB changes, including: 1) increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines production (CXCL-10 [IP-10], IL-6, IL-1RA, IL-1β and CXCL-3) in IBMs when exposed to NMO-IgG; 2) decrease of Claudin-5 levels by 25.6% after treatment of fresh IBMs by NMO-IgG compared to Control-IgG (p = 0.002), and similarly, decrease of Claudin-5 by at least 20% when BMEC were cultured with NMO-IgG from five different patients; 3) a higher level of rat-IgG accumulated in periventricular regions of NMO-rats compared to Control-rats and an increase in the permeability of BBB after NMO-IgG treatment in the bicameral model.Human NMO-IgG induces both structural and functional alterations of BBB properties, suggesting a direct role of NMO-IgG on modulation of BBB permeability in NMOSD."
https://openalex.org/W3083360821,"Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) often leads to significant functional loss in patients and poses a challenge to physicians since treatment options for improving functional outcomes are limited. Recent studies suggest that erythropoietin and glucocoticoids have beneficial effects as mediators of neuro-regenerative processes. We hypothesized that combination treatment with erythropoietin and glucocoticoids would have a synergistic effect on functional outcome after PNI.Sciatic nerve crush injury was simulated in ten-week-old male C57BL/6 mice. The mice were divided into four groups according to the type of drugs administered (control, erythropoietin, dexamethasone, and erythropoietin with dexamethasone). Motor functional recovery was monitored by walking track analysis at serial time points up to 28 days after injury. Morphological analysis of the nerve was performed by immunofluorescent staining for neurofilament (NF) heavy chain and myelin protein zero (P0) in cross-sectional and whole-mount nerve preparations. Additionally, morphological analysis of the muscle was performed by Hematoxylin and eosin staining.Combination treatment with erythropoietin and dexamethasone significantly improved the sciatic functional index at 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after injury. Fluorescence microscopy of cross sectional nerve revealed that the combination treatment increased the ratio of P0/NF-expressing axons. Furthermore, confocal microscopy of the whole-mount nerve revealed that the combination treatment increased the fluorescence intensity of P0 expression. The cross-sectional area and minimum Feret's diameter of the muscle fibers were significantly larger in the mice which received combination treatment than those in the controls.Our results demonstrated that combination treatment with erythropoietin and dexamethasone accelerates functional recovery and reduces neurogenic muscle atrophy caused by PNI in mice, which may be attributed to the preservation of myelin and Schwann cell re-myelination. These findings may provide practical therapeutic options for patients with acute PNI."
https://openalex.org/W3083657958,"An effective and pain-free killing method is required to achieve the goal of euthanasia, a “good death”. Overdose of sodium pentobarbital (PB) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection is a widely accepted technique in laboratory rats, but questions remain regarding pain associated with administration. As PB rapidly causes sedation and loss of consciousness, most studies have relied on indirect evidence of pain. The objective of this study was to assess pain associated with IP PB using an appropriate vehicle control. Adult male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) and female Wistar rats (N = 84) were block randomised by sex and strain to receive one of three treatments: 1) 800 mg/kg PB (pH 11), 2) saline or 3) vehicle controls (pH 11 or 12.5). Behavior (Rat Grimace Scale (RGS), writhing, back arching) was evaluated at baseline, before loss of righting reflex (LORR, PB group), and at 80s, 151s and 10 min post-injection (PI; saline and vehicle control groups). In the PB group, mean time to LORR was 78 ± 7.9 seconds. In the vehicle control groups, RGS scores were increased at 151s PI (SD: p = 0.0002, 95%CI 0.73 to 0.20) from baseline, as was relative frequency of writhing (SD: p < 0.0001; Wistar; p = 0.0004). RGS scores remained elevated 10 mins PI (SD: p = 0.0005, 95%CI 0.71 to 0.18; Wistar: p = 0.0234, 95%CI 0.91 to 0.07) but the relative frequency of writhing did not (p > 0.999). The RGS scores and the relative frequency of writhing remained low in the PB and saline groups (p > 0.05). These results show that, vehicle controls for IP PB result in signs associated with pain, pain may not be experienced following IP PB when LORR occurs quickly, and that the effects of PB limit behavioral pain assessments."
https://openalex.org/W3083295052,"The carbonate system in two contrasting fjords, Rivers Inlet and Bute Inlet, on the coast of British Columbia, Canada, was evaluated to characterize the mechanisms driving carbonate chemistry dynamics and assess the impact of anthropogenic carbon. Differences in the character of deep water exchange between these fjords were inferred from their degree of exposure to continental shelf water and their salinity relationships with total alkalinity and total dissolved inorganic carbon, which determined seawater buffering capacity. Seawater buffering capacity differed between fjords and resulted in distinct carbonate system characteristics with implications on calcium carbonate saturation states and sensitivity to increasing anthropogenic carbon inputs. Saturation states of both aragonite and calcite mineral phases of calcium carbonate were seasonally at or below saturation throughout the entire water column in Bute Inlet, while only aragonite was seasonally under-saturated in portions of the water column in Rivers Inlet. The mean annual saturation states of aragonite in Rivers Inlet and calcite in Bute Inlet deep water layers have declined to below saturation within the last several decades due to anthropogenic carbon accumulation, and similar declines to undersaturation are projected in their surface layers as anthropogenic carbon continues to accumulate. This study demonstrates that the degree of fjord water exposure to open shelf water influences the uptake and sensitivity to anthropogenic carbon through processes affecting seawater buffering capacity, and that reduced uptake but greater sensitivity occurs where distance to ocean source waters and freshwater dilution are greater."
https://openalex.org/W3083295901,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) is caused by mutations in the dysferlin gene, resulting in non-functional dysferlin, a key protein found in muscle membrane. Treatment options available for patients are chiefly palliative in nature and focus on maintaining ambulation. Our hypothesis is that galectin-1 (Gal-1), a soluble carbohydrate binding protein, increases membrane repair capacity and myogenic potential of dysferlin-deficient muscle cells and muscle fibers. To test this hypothesis, we used recombinant human galectin-1 (rHsGal-1) to treat dysferlin-deficient models. We show that rHsGal-1 treatments of 48 h-72 h promotes myogenic maturation as indicated through improvements in size, myotube alignment, myoblast migration, and membrane repair capacity in dysferlin-deficient myotubes and myofibers. Furthermore, increased membrane repair capacity of dysferlin-deficient myotubes, independent of increased myogenic maturation is apparent and co-localizes on the membrane of myotubes after a brief 10min treatment with labeled rHsGal-1. We show the carbohydrate recognition domain of Gal-1 is necessary for observed membrane repair. Improvements in membrane repair after only a 10 min rHsGal-1treatment suggest mechanical stabilization of the membrane due to interaction with glycosylated membrane bound, ECM or yet to be identified ligands through the CDR domain of Gal-1. rHsGal-1 shows calcium-independent membrane repair in dysferlin-deficient and wild-type myotubes and myofibers. Together our novel results reveal Gal-1 mediates disease pathologies through both changes in integral myogenic protein expression and mechanical membrane stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W3083354814,"Data on the association between alcohol consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have accumulated, but little has been reported about this association in terms of lean T2DM. The present study analyzed 10-year longitudinal data to investigate the association between alcohol consumption and T2DM risk among lean individuals. This prospective study included 2,366 male and female Koreans aged 40–69 years who were free of DM and had a body mass index (BMI) <23 kg/m2 during the baseline period between 2001 and 2012. Information on alcohol consumption, BMI, and incident cases of T2DM were identified by interviews and health examinations. To analyze the association between alcohol consumption and T2DM risk, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used. Alcohol drinkers consuming at least 16 g/day of alcohol (2 units/day) who maintained a BMI <23 kg/m2 over 10 years had a significantly higher T2DM risk even after controlling for BMI and potential risk factors. Compared with lifetime abstainers, multivariate hazard ratios (HR) [95% confidence interval] of T2DM were 1.74 [1.02, 2.95] for 16–30 g/day, 2.09 [1.16, 3.77] for 31–60 g/day, and 1.94 [1.07, 3.51] for >60g/day among alcohol drinkers. No protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption <16 g/day on T2DM risk was observed. Age, parental history of DM, and physical inactivity were also significant risk factors for lean T2DM. Alcohol consumption of at least 2 units/day increased T2DM risk among lean individuals. Abstaining from alcohol and physical activity may be beneficial for the prevention of lean T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W3083536309,"Electrowetting-on-dielectric is a decent technique to manipulate discrete volumes of liquid in form of droplets. In the last decade, electrowetting-on-dielectric systems, also called digital microfluidic systems, became more frequently used for a variety of applications because of their high flexibility and reconfigurability. Thus, one design can be adapted to different assays by only reprogramming. However, this flexibility can only be useful if the entire system is portable and easy to use. This paper presents the development of a portable, stand-alone digital microfluidic system based on a Linux-based operating system running on a Raspberry Pi, which is unique. We present ""PortaDrop"" exhibiting the following key features: (1) an ""all-in-one box"" approach, (2) a user-friendly, self-explaining graphical user interface and easy handling, (3) the ability of integrated electrochemical measurements, (4) the ease to implement additional lab equipment via Universal Serial Bus and the General Purpose Interface Bus as well as (5) a standardized experiment documentation. We propose that PortaDrop can be used to carry out experiments in different applications, where small sample volumes in the nanoliter to picoliter range need to be handled an analyzed automatically. As a first application, we present a protocol, where a droplet is consequently exchanged by droplets of another medium using passive dispensing. The exchange is monitored by electrical impedance spectroscopy. It is the first time, the media exchange caused by passive dispensing is characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Summarizing, PortaDrop allows easy combination of fluid handling by means of electrowetting and additional sensing."
https://openalex.org/W3083610128,"The theory of evolution is one of the greatest scientific achievements in the intellectual history of humankind, yet it is still contentious within certain social groups. Despite being as robust and evidence-based as any other notable scientific theory, some people show a strong reluctance to accept it. In this study, we used the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE) and Knowledge of Evolution Exam (KEE) questionnaires with university students from four academic degree programs (Chemistry, English, History, and Biology) of ten universities from Spain to measure, respectively, acceptance and knowledge of evolutionary theory among third-year undergraduate students (nMATE = 978; nKEE = 981). Results show that acceptance of evolution is relatively high (87.2%), whereas knowledge of the theory is moderate (5.4 out of 10) although there are differences across degrees (Biology>Chemistry>History>English), and even among various universities (ranging from 4.71 to 5.81). Statistical analysis reveals that knowledge of evolutionary theory among Biology students is partially explained by the relative weight of evolutionary themes within the curriculum, suggesting that an increase in the number of hours dedicated to this topic could have a direct influence on students’ knowledge of it. We also found that religion may have a significant—although relatively small—negative influence on evolutionary theory acceptance. The moderate knowledge of evolution in our undergraduate students, together with the potential problem of acceptance in certain groups, suggests the need for a revision of the evolutionary concepts in the teaching curricula of our students since primary school."

Conventionally used methods for sample preparation are invasive, irreversible, require skill and expensive equipment, and are time and labor consuming. This study demonstrates a method to obtain in vivo surface information of plant leaves by imaging replicas with SEM that is rapid and non-invasive. Dental putty was applied to the leaves for 5 minutes and then removed. Replicas were then imaged with SEM and compared to fresh leaves, and leaves that were processed conventionally by chemical fixation, dehydration and critical point drying. The surface structure of leaves was well preserved on the replicas. The outline of epidermal as well as guard cells could be clearly distinguished enabling determination of stomatal density. Comparison of the dimensions of guard cells revealed that replicas did not differ from fresh leaves, while conventional sample preparation induced strong shrinkage (-40% in length and -38% in width) of the cells when compared to guard cells on fresh leaves. Tilting the replicas enabled clear measurement of stomatal aperture dimensions. Summing up, the major advantages of this method are that it is inexpensive, non-toxic, simple to apply, can be performed in the field, and that results on stomatal density and in vivo stomatal dimensions in 3D can be obtained in a few minutes."
https://openalex.org/W3083557055,"Background Attaining the recommended level of adequacy of the infant’s diet remains a serious challenge in most developing countries. Complementary foods, particularly in developing countries, are inadequate in quality and quantity that can result in adverse health and nutrition consequences in infants. This could be not only because of lack of food but also associated with caregiver’s poor knowledge, harmful cultural norms and behaviors on infant feeding. The promotion of optimal complementary feeding through behavior change interventions is a global health priority. However, many of the interventions targeted only mothers/caregivers of infants, and studies that engaged other family members are limited worldwide. Moreover, such interventions are scarce in developing countries, including Ethiopia. This trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of complementary feeding behavior change communication delivered through community-level actors on the dietary adequacy of infants. Methods We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural communities of West Gojjam Zone, Northwest Ethiopia. Trial participants in the intervention clusters received complementary feeding behavior change communication for 9 months whereas those in the control clusters received only the usual care. Trained women development army leaders delivered the intervention. A pre-tested, structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Generalized estimating equations regression analyses adjusted for baseline covariates and clustering were used to test the intervention effects. Results The intervention showed positive statistically significant effects on the consumption of dairy products [RR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.04–3.13], eggs [RR = 3; 95% CI: 1.35–6.56], vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables [RR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.17–6.1], other fruits and vegetables [RR = 5; 95% CI: 2.49–10.58] and animal-source foods [RR = 2; 95% CI: 1.39–2.87]. The proportions of infants who achieved minimum dietary diversity [RR = 3; 95% CI: 1.34, 7.39], minimum meal frequency [RR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.37–4.29], and minimum acceptable diet [RR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.13–7.23] were significantly higher in the intervention as compared to control groups. Conclusions Complementary feeding behavior change communication delivered through community-level actors significantly improved the dietary adequacy of infants.

https://openalex.org/W3083636485,"To monitor the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), methods for interpretation of susceptibility phenotypes of bacteria are needed. Reference limits to declare resistance are generally based on or dominated by data from human bacterial isolates and may not reflect clinical relevance or wild type (WT) populations in livestock or other hosts.We compared the observed prevalence of AMR using standard and bespoke interpretations based on clinical breakpoints or epidemiological cut-offs (ECOFF) using gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria from sheep as exemplars. Isolates were obtained from a cross-sectional study in three lowland sheep flocks in Scotland, and from a longitudinal study in one flock in Norway. S. aureus (n = 101) was predominantly isolated from milk or mammary glands whilst E. coli (n = 103) was mostly isolated from faecal samples. Disc diffusion testing was used to determine inhibition zone diameters, which were interpreted using either clinical breakpoints or ECOFF, which distinguish the bacterial wild type population from bacteria with acquired or mutational resistance to the compound of interest (non-wild type). Standard ECOFF values were considered as well as sheep-specific values calculated from the data using Normalized Resistance Interpretation (NRI) methodology.The prevalence of AMR as measured based on clinical breakpoints was low, e.g. 4.0% for penicillin resistance in S. aureus. Estimation of AMR prevalence based on standard ECOFFs was hampered by lack of relevant reference values. In addition, standard ECOFFS, which are predominantly based on human data, bisected the normal distribution of inhibition zone diameters for several compounds in our analysis of sheep isolates. This contravenes recommendations for ECOFF setting based on NRI methodology and may lead to high apparent AMR prevalence. Using bespoke ECOFF values based on NRI, S. aureus showed non-wild type for less than 4% of isolates across 13 compounds, and ca. 13% non-wild type for amoxicillin and ampicillin, while E. coli showed non-wild type for less than 3% of isolates across 12 compounds, and ca. 13% non-wild type for tetracyclines and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.The apparent prevalence of AMR in bacteria isolated from sheep is highly dependent on interpretation criteria. The sheep industry may want to establish bespoke cut-off values for AMR monitoring to avoid the use of cut-offs developed for other host species. The latter could lead to high apparent prevalence of resistance, including to critically important antimicrobial classes such as 4th generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, suggesting an AMR problem that may not actually exist."
https://openalex.org/W3083084320,"A bite from a La Crosse virus (LACV) infected Aedes mosquito can cause La Crosse encephalitis (LACE), which is a neuro-invasive disease that disproportionately affects children under the age of 16 in Southern Appalachia. The three vectors for LACV are Aedes albopictus (Skuse), Ae. japonicus (Theobald), and Ae. triseriatus (Say). Localized maps of the geographic distribution of vectors are practical tools for mosquito management personnel to target areas with high mosquito abundance. This study hypothesized that LACV vectors have unique species-specific spatial and temporal clusters. To test this, 44 sites were identified in Knox County, Tennessee for their land use/type. At each site, host-seeking mosquitoes were collected approximately every other week from May-October 2018. Spatial clusters of host-seeking mosquito collections for each of the three mosquito species were investigated using Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic, specifying a retrospective space-time Bernoulli model. Most vector clusters were identified in south-central Knox County while the seasonality of clusters varied by mosquito species. Clusters of Ae. albopictus were observed throughout the entire study period while clusters of Ae. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus only occurred May-June. The findings indicate that the relative abundance of LACV vectors were more abundant in south-central Knox County compared to the rest of the county. Of interest, these clusters spatially overlapped with previous LACE diagnosed cases. These findings are useful in guiding decisions on targeted mosquito control in Knox County and may be applied to other counties within Southern Appalachia."
https://openalex.org/W3083299166,"Introduction Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians living in remote locations suffer disproportionately from chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Defining the temporospatial epidemiology of the disease—and assessing the ability of local clinicians to deliver optimal care—is crucial to improving patient outcomes in these settings. Methods The demographic, laboratory and radiology findings in all patients diagnosed with CHB after 1990, and presently residing in remote Far North Queensland (FNQ), tropical Australia, were correlated with their management and clinical course. Results Of the 602 patients, 514 (85%) identified as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, 417 (69%) of whom had Torres Strait Islander heritage. Among the 514 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, there were only 61 (12%) born after universal postnatal vaccination was introduced in 1985. Community CHB prevalence varied significantly across the region from 7/1707 (0.4%) in western Cape York to 55/806 (6.8%) in the Eastern Torres Strait Islands. Although 240/602 (40%) are engaged in care, with 65 (27%) meeting criteria for antiviral therapy, only 43 (66%) were receiving this treatment. Among 537 with complete data, 32 (6%) were cirrhotic, of whom 15 (47%) were engaged in care and 10 (33%) were receiving antiviral therapy. Only 64/251 (26%) in whom national guidelines would recommend hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance are receiving screening, however, only 20 patients have been diagnosed with HCC since 1999. Conclusion Vaccination has had a dramatic effect on CHB prevalence in FNQ in only a generation. However, although engagement in care is the highest in Australia, this is not translating into initiation of antiviral therapy in all those that should be receiving it, increasing their risk of developing cirrhosis and HCC. New strategies are necessary to improve the care of Indigenous Australians living with CHB to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this preventable disease."
https://openalex.org/W3083326324,"Background Polyamines are involved in a wide variety of biological processes including a marked effect on the structure and function of DNA. During our study on the interaction of polyamines with DNA, we found that K+ enhanced in vitro gene expression in the presence of polyamine more strongly than Na+. Thus, we sought to clarify the physico-chemical mechanism underlying this marked difference between the effects of K+ and Na+. Principal findings It was found that K+ enhanced gene expression in the presence of spermidine, SPD(3+), much more strongly than Na+, through in vitro experiments with a Luciferase assay on cell extracts. Single-DNA observation by fluorescence microscopy showed that Na+ prevents the folding transition of DNA into a compact state more strongly than K+. 1H NMR measurement revealed that Na+ inhibits the binding of SPD to DNA more strongly than K+. Thus, SPD binds to DNA more favorably in K+-rich medium than in Na+-rich medium, which leads to favorable conditions for RNA polymerase to access DNA by decreasing the negative charge. Conclusion and significance We found that Na+ and K+ exhibit markedly different effects through competitive binding with a cationic polyamine, SPD, to DNA, which causes a large difference in the higher-order structure of genomic DNA. It is concluded that the larger favorable effect of Na+ than K+ on in vitro gene expression observed in this study is well attributable to the significant difference between Na+ and K+ on the competitive binding inducing conformational transition of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W3083416429,"Less than 10 percent of the more than one million people vulnerable to HIV are using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Practitioners are critical to ensuring the delivery of PrEP across care settings. In this study, we target a group of prescribers focused on providing HIV care and seeking up-to-date information about HIV. We assessed their experiences prescribing PrEP, whether these experiences differed by clinical specialty, and examined associations between willingness to prescribe PrEP as a ""best first step"" and different hypothetical prescribing scenarios.Between March and May 2015, we circulated a paper survey to 954 participants ((652 of whom met our inclusion criteria of being independent prescribers and 519 of those (80%) responded to the survey)) at continuing medical education advanced-level HIV courses in five locations across the US on practitioner practices and preferences of PrEP. We employed multivariable logistic regression analysis for binary and collapsed ordinal outcomes.Among this highly motivated group of practitioners, only 54% reported ever prescribing PrEP. Internal medicine practitioners were 1.6 times more likely than infectious disease practitioners to have prescribed PrEP (95% CI: 0.99-2.60, p = .0524) and age, years of training, and sex were significantly associated with prescribing experience. Based on clinical vignettes describing different hypothetical prescribing scenarios, practitioners who viewed PrEP as the first clinical step for persons who inject drugs (PWID) were twice as likely to have also considered PrEP as the first clinical option for safer conception, and vice-a-versa (95% CI: 1.4-3.2, p < .001). Practitioners considering PrEP as the first preventive option for MSM were nearly six times as likely to also consider PrEP as the first clinical step for PWID, and vice-a-versa (95% CI: 2.28-13.56, p = .0002).Our findings indicate that even among a subset of HIV-focused practitioners, PrEP prescribing is not routine. This group of practitioners could be an optimal group to engage individuals that could most benefit from PrEP."
https://openalex.org/W3083045696,"Albeit uncommon, hydrothorax is an important complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Due to paucity of evidence for optimal treatment, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of computed tomographic (CT) peritoneography and surgical intervention involving video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for hydrothorax in a retrospective cohort of patients who underwent PD in Japan.Of the 982 patients who underwent PD from six centers in Japan between 2007 and 2019, 25 (2.5%) with diagnosed hydrothorax were enrolled in this study. PD withdrawal rates were compared between patients who underwent VATS for diaphragm repair (surgical group) and those who did not (non-surgical group) using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.The surgical and non-surgical groups comprised a total of 11 (44%) and 14 (56%) patients, respectively. Following hydrothorax diagnosis by thoracentesis and detection of penetrated sites on the diaphragm using CT peritoneography, VATS was performed at a median time of 31 days (interquartile range [IQR], 20-96 days). During follow-up (median, 26 months; IQR, 10-51 months), 9 (64.3%) and 2 (18.2%) patients in the non-surgical and surgical groups, respectively, withdrew from PD (P = 0.021). There were no surgery-related complications or hydrothorax relapse in the surgical group.This study demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of CT peritoneography and VATS for hydrothorax. This approach may be useful in hydrothorax cases to avoid early drop out of PD and continue PD in the long term. Further studies are warranted to confirm these results."
https://openalex.org/W3083251214,"Self-medication and antibiotic utilization without healthcare oversight may lead to delayed appropriate treatment, transmission of communicable infections, untoward adverse events, and contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Previous data suggest people obtain over-the-counter (OTC) animal antibiotics for their personal use. This study examined the availability of OTC fish antibiotics online and the documented intent for self-medication. The authors conducted a web-based cross-sectional study using Google search engine to identify vendor websites selling fish antibiotics in the United States. Vendor websites were included if product information, consumer reviews, and comments were publicly available. Nine fish antibiotics were chosen due to their possibility of having consequences to human misuse. The cost and availability of fish antibiotics was recorded. The proportion of reviews and comments related to human consumption was calculated. Consumer review traffic based on ""likes"" and ""dislikes"" received was compared between human- and non-human consumption-related reviews. Selected fish antibiotics were purchased and evaluated for physical appearance and compared to FDA-approved available equivalents. We found 24 website vendors with online ordering available for OTC fish antibiotics. Cost varied significantly by antibiotic and quantity ranging from USD $8.99 to $119.99. There were 2,288 reviews documented for the 9 selected antibiotics being sold. Among consumer reviews, 2.4% were potentially associated with human consumption. Human consumption-related reviews constituted 30.2% of all ""likes"" received and 37.5% of all ""dislikes"" received. Human consumption-related reviews received an average of 9.2 likes compared to 0.52 likes for non-human consumption-related reviews. The 8 fish antibiotics purchased were consistent with FDA-approved equivalents in physical appearance. Although infrequent, antibiotics intended for fish use are being purchased online without a prescription for self-medication to circumvent professional medical care. Reviews related to human consumption generate significant online traffic compared to reviews unrelated to human consumption."
https://openalex.org/W3083068018,"K. pneumoniae was known as a nosocomial infection that causes human diseases. It is considered as one of the food-borne pathogens as it causes septicemia and diarrhea in humans. This study aims to characterize K. pneumoniae strains isolated from ready to eat processed meat phenotypically and genetically. Three hundred and fifty ready to eat processed meat (Luncheon-meat) samples were collected. Forty-four (12.6%) K. pneumoniae strains were isolated and bio-typed, where the majority were identified to belong to biotype B1. K1 and K2 serotypes were detected and strains were classified as hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae (HVKP) and classic K. pneumoniae (CKP) (26 and 18 isolates, respectively). The isolates were resistant to several classes of β-lactam antibiotics, ceftazidim and cefotaxime (95.5%), cefoxitin (93.2%), ertapenem (90.9%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (86.4%). They were classified as extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC or carbapenemase-producers phenotypically. Eighteen β-lactamase genes were investigated by PCR. The most prominent genes were SHV (63.6%), TEM (52.2%), CTX-M15 (50%), AMPC (47.7%), CIT-M (45.5%) and VIM (43.2%). Co-detection of β-lactam resistance genes revealed 42 gene profiles. Twenty-four isolates had the complete efflux system (AcrAB-ToƖC). Besides, Integrons (I, II, III) were detected in 20 isolates. Molecular typing by ERIC-PCR showed high genetic diversity between isolates as 34 different patterns were identified. Overall, this study confirmed the hazards posed by the presence of multiple resistance genes in the same isolate and this should not be undervalued. Besides, the horizontal transfer of plasmid harboring resistance genes between isolates in food represents potential health risks for consumers in Egypt and so the control and inhibition plans are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3083260903,"Source apportionment of potentially toxic elements in soils is a critical step for devising soil sustainable management strategies. However, misjudgment or imprecision can occur when traditional statistical methods are applied to identify and apportion the sources. The main objective of the study was to develop a robust approach composed of the absolute principal component score/multiple linear regression (APCS/MLR) receptor model, positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model and geostatistics to identify and apportion sources of soil potentially toxic elements in typical industrial and mining city, eastern China. APCS/MLR and PMF were applied to provide robust factors with contribution rates. The geostatistics coupled with the variography and kriging methods was used to present factors derived from these two receptor models. The results indicated that mean concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn exceeded the local background levels. Based on multivariate receptor models and geostatistics, we determined four sources of eight potentially toxic elements including natural source (parent material), agricultural practices, pollutant emissions (industrial, mining and traffic) and the atmospheric deposition of coal combustion, which accounted for 68%, 12%, 12% and 9% of the observed potentially toxic element concentrations, respectively. This study provides a reliable and robust approach for potentially toxic elements source apportionment in this particular industrial and mining city with a clear potential for future application in other regions."

This study investigated differences in the response to hyperoxic exposure between neonatal and adult mouse lungs using metabolomics analysis with capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE- TOFMS).Neonatal and adult mice were exposed to 21% or 95% O2 for four days. Subsequently, lung tissue samples were collected and analyzed by CE-TOFMS. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme activity was determined using a microplate assay kit. PDH kinase (Pdk) 1, Pdk2, Pdk3, and Pdk4 mRNA expression levels were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Pdk4 protein expression was quantified by Western blotting and Pdk4 protein localization was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.Levels of 3-phosphoglyceric acid, 2-phosphoglyceric acid, phosphoenolpyruvic acid, and lactic acid were significantly elevated in the lungs of hyperoxia-exposed versus normoxia-exposed adult mice, whereas no significant differences were observed with hyperoxia exposure in neonatal mice. PDH activity was reduced in the lungs of adult mice only. Pdk4 mRNA expression levels after hyperoxic exposure were significantly elevated in adult mice compared with that in neonatal mice. Conversely, gene expression levels of Pdk1, Pdk2, and Pdk3 did not differ after hyperoxic exposure in either neonatal or adult mice. Pdk4 protein levels were also significantly increased in adult mouse lungs exposed to hyperoxia and were localized mainly to the epithelium of terminal bronchiole.Specific metabolites associated with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were altered after hyperoxia exposure in the lungs of adult mice, but not in neonates, which was likely a result of reduced PDH activity due to Pdk4 mRNA upregulation under hyperoxia."

The research results show that the harmfulness of the degree value priority attack in the technical cooperation innovation network of new energy vehicles is stronger than the weighted degree value priority attack and random attack, and the attacks of the State Grid and other hub nodes have an important impact on the network invulnerability. During the network optimization process of three types of connection preferences, the ""weak""-""weak"" connection is the best connection mode given the situation of an unweighted network without considering the weight of the connected edge. However, the ""strong""-""weak"" connection is the best mode given the situation of a weighted network considering the weight of the connected edge. In addition, compared with the weighted network situation, the ""strong""-""weak"" connection has better network optimization results given the situation of an unweighted network. Finally, we propose counter measures and suggestions to promote the innovation network invulnerability capabilities of technical cooperation in new energy vehicles."

Here, we assess the effect of exchanging dietary fat source from butterfat to extra virgin olive oil on the progression of an already existing diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed a liquid butterfat-, fructose- and cholesterol-rich diet (BFC, 25E% from butterfat) or control diet (C, 12%E from soybean oil) for 13 weeks. In week 9, fat sources of some BFC- and C-fed mice were switched either to 25E% or 12E% olive oil (OFC and CO). Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed, and markers of liver damage and glucose metabolism were assessed. After 6 weeks of feeding, BFC-fed mice had developed marked signs of insulin resistance, which progressed to week 12 being not affected by the exchange of fat sources. Liver damage was similar between BFC- and OFC-fed mice. Markers of lipid metabolism and lipid peroxidation in liver and of insulin signaling in liver and muscle were also similarly altered in BFC- and OFC-fed mice. Taken together, our data suggest that exchanging butterfat with extra virgin olive oil has no effect on the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and glucose tolerance in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3083469306,"In a clinical decision support system, the purpose of case-based reasoning is to help clinicians make convenient decisions for diagnoses or interventional gestures. Past experience, which is represented by a case-base of previous patients, is exploited to solve similar current problems using four steps—retrieve, reuse, revise, and retain. The proposed case-based reasoning has been focused on transcatheter aortic valve implantation to respond to clinical issues pertaining vascular access and prosthesis choices. The computation of a relevant similarity measure is an essential processing step employed to obtain a set of retrieved cases from a case-base. A hierarchical similarity measure that is based on a clinical decision tree is proposed to better integrate the clinical knowledge, especially in terms of case representation, case selection and attributes weighting. A case-base of 138 patients is used to evaluate the case-based reasoning performance, and retrieve- and reuse-based criteria have been considered. The sensitivity for the vascular access and the prosthesis choice is found to 0.88 and 0.94, respectively, with the use of the hierarchical similarity measure as opposed to 0.53 and 0.79 for the standard similarity measure. Ninety percent of the suggested solutions are correctly classified for the proposed metric when four cases are retrieved. Using a dedicated similarity measure, with relevant and weighted attributes selected through a clinical decision tree, the set of retrieved cases, and consequently, the decision suggested by the case-based reasoning are substantially improved over state-of-the-art similarity measures."
https://openalex.org/W3083123471,"Objective In this exploratory longitudinal study we assessed cognitive development in a community sample of infants born into predominantly low-income families from two different urban sites, to identify family and community factors that may associate with outcomes by 1 year of age. Method Infant-mother dyads (n = 109) were recruited in Boston and Los Angeles community pediatric practices. Infant cognition was measured using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning when the infant was aged 2, 6, 9, and 12 months. Longitudinal linear mixed effects modeling and linear regression models explored potential predictors of cognitive outcomes. Results Cognitive scores were lower than the reference population mean at both 6 and 12 months. There were site differences in demographics and cognitive performance. Maternal education predicted expressive language in Boston, and speaking Spanish and lower rates of community poverty were associated with greater increases in overall cognition in Los Angeles. Conclusion This exploratory study identified a number of drivers of child development that are both shared across cohorts and unique to specific community samples. Factors influencing heterogeneity within and across populations both may be important contributors to prevention and intervention in supporting healthy development among children."
https://openalex.org/W3083195933,"Prostate cancer (PCa) cells become castrate-resistant after initial tumor regression following castration-based lowering of testosterone (T). De-novo intra-tumoral steroid synthesis is a suggested biological mechanism of castration resistant PCa, but the regulators are unknown. Testicular T production is controlled by the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR). To elucidate the influence of LHCGR on PCa development the presence and effects of LHCGR in PCa and whether LHCGR in serum holds prognostic information in PCa patients is investigated. LHCGR expression was investigated by RT-PCR, WB, IHC, qPCR in PCa cell lines and prostatic tissue. Steroid production was measured in media from cell lines with LC-MS/MS and expression of steroidogenic enzymes with qPCR. Serum LHCGR (sLHCGR) was measured with ELISA in PCa patients (N = 157). Presence of LHCGR was established in prostatic tissue and PCa cell lines. Cell proliferation increased by 1.29-fold in LNCaP (P = 0.007) and 1.33-fold in PC-3 cells (P = 0.0007), when stimulated by luteinizing hormone. Choriogonadotropin stimulation decreased proliferation 0.93-fold in DU145 cells (P = 0.05), but none of the treatments altered steroid metabolite secretion. Low sLHCGR concentration was associated with a higher risk of biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy (HR = 3.05, P = 0.06) and castration resistance (HR = 6.92, P = 0.004) compared to high sLHCGR concentration. LHCGR is expressed in PCa and may exert a growth regulatory role in PCa derived cell lines. A potential prognostic role of sLHCGR for determining recurrence risk in PCa patients is found in this pilot study but needs verification in larger cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W3083212956,"Setting Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a traditional surgical modification of the female genitalia comprising all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for cultural or nontherapeutic reasons. It can be harmful and violates girls’ and women’s human rights. FGM is a worldwide problem but mainly practiced in Africa. FGM is still widely practiced in Ethiopia despite being made a criminal offence in 2004. Objective Using data from three Ethiopian Demographic Health Surveys (EDHS) conducted in 2000, 2005 and 2016 the objective was to assess changes in prevalence of FGM and associated factors among women of reproductive age and their daughters. Methods EDHS datasets for the three surveys included data on FGM prevalence and socio-demographic factors. After weighting, the data were analysed using frequencies, proportions and the chi square test for trend. Categorical variables associated with FGM in 2016 were compared using OpenEpi and presented as prevalence ratios (Pr) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Levels of significance were set at 5% (P<0.05). Results There was overall decline in FGM prevalence (from 79.9% to 74.3% to 65.2%, P<0.001), especially in younger women aged 15-19 years, and in the proportion of women who believed that the practice should continue (from 59.7% to 28.3% to 17.5%, P<0.001). There was also a decreasing trend of FGM in the daughters of the mothers who were interviewed, with prevalence significantly lower in mothers who had not themselves undergone FGM. Most (88.3%) women with FGM had the surgery as a child with the procedure mainly performed by a traditional circumciser (87.3%). Factors associated with higher FGM prevalence and lack of progress over the sixteen years included living in certain regions, especially Somali where FGM prevalence remained consistently >95%, lack of school education, coming from rural areas and living in less wealthy households. Conclusion Although progress has been slow, the prevalence of FGM in Ethiopia has declined over time. Recommendations to quicken the trajectory of decline targeting integrated interventions to high prevalence areas focusing on mothers, fathers, youngsters, religious leaders and schools and ensuring that all girls receive some form of education."
https://openalex.org/W3083229487,"Almost all children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have experienced challenging behavior, including disruptive and aggressive behavior symptoms to both themselves and others. In conjunction with appropriate strategic parenting, challenging behavior can be prevented by empowering children's sociality and optimizing their environment. However, a means of measuring such parenting has yet to appear. This study developed the Parental Self-Efficacy Scale for Preventing Challenging Behaviors in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (PASEC) and evaluated its reliability and validity.Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 1,344 parents of children with ASD at all 521 child development support centers in Japan. Confirmed construct validity of the PASEC was determined using confirmatory factor analysis. Internal consistency of the PASEC was calculated using Cronbach's alpha. The self-efficacy subscale of the Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC) was administered to assess criterion-related validity of the PASEC.In total, 260 parents provided valid responses. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified six items from two factors: empowerment of children's sociality and optimization of children's environment. The final model showed goodness-of-fit index, 0.981; adjusted goodness-of-fit index, 0.944; comparative fit index, 0.999; and root mean square error of approximation, 0.019. Cronbach's alpha for the entire PASEC was 0.82; that for each factor was above 0.70. The correlation coefficient between the self-efficacy subscale of the PSOC and the entire PASEC was r = 0.52 (P <0.001).The PASEC demonstrated adequate reliability and validity to assess parents' self-efficacy for preventing challenging behavior for children with ASD. That scale can help prevent challenging behavior; it can contribute to improving the mental health of parents and children with ASD as well as to primary prevention of child maltreatment and abuse."

GO classification and KEGG pathway analysis documented that some of the upregulated differentially expressed proteins were implicated in the regulation of serine/threonine protein phosphatase activity, abscisic acid-activated signaling, removal of superoxide radicals, and the response to oxidative stress and defense responses. Western blot analysis indicated that nystose promotes the growth of primary rice roots by increasing the level of RSOsPR10, and the cold stress-induced change in RSOsPR10levelis regulated by jasmonate, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid signaling pathways in rice roots. Furthermore, OsMKK4-dependentmitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades may be involved in the nystose-induced cold tolerance of primary rice roots. Together, these results indicate that nystose acts as an immunostimulator of the response to cold stress by multiple signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3083566607,"Background Obesity is often associated with inflammation in adipose tissue (AT) with release of mediators of atherogenesis. We postulated that it would be feasible to collect sufficient abdominal AT to quantify changes in a broad array of adaptive and innate mononuclear white cells in obese non-diabetic adults in response to a dipeptidyl protease inhibitor (DPP4i), known to inhibit activation of immune white cells. Methods Adults 18–55 years-of-age were screened for abdominal obesity and insulin resistance or impaired glucose tolerance but without known inflammatory conditions. Twenty-one eligible participants consented for study and were randomized 3:1 to receive sitagliptin (DPP4i) at 100mg or matching placebo daily for 28 days. Abdominal AT collected by percutaneous biopsy and peripheral blood mononuclear cell fractions were evaluated before and after treatment; plasma was stored for batch testing. Results Highly sensitive C-reactive protein, a global marker of inflammation, was not elevated in the study population. Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) type 3 (ILC-3) in abdominal AT decreased with active treatment compared with placebo (p = 0.04). Other immune white cells in AT and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fractions did not change with treatment compared to placebo (p>0.05); although ILC-2 declined in PBMCs (p = 0.007) in the sitagliptin treatment group. Two circulating biomarkers of atherogenesis, interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and sCD40L declined in plasma (p = 0.02 and p = 0.07, respectively) in the active treatment group, providing indirect validation of a net reduction in inflammation. Conclusions In this pilot study, two cell types of the innate lymphoid system, ILC-3 in AT and ILC-2 PBMCs declined during treatment and as did circulating biomarkers of atherogenesis. Changes in other immune cells were not demonstrable. The study showed that sufficient abdominal AT could be obtained to quantify white cells of both innate and adaptive immunity and to demonstrate changes during therapy with an immune inhibitor.

https://openalex.org/W3083717866,"Purpose To derive and validate a concise prediction model estimating the 10-year risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in China. Methods A total of 11494 subjects from the China Health and Nutrition Survey recorded from 2004 to 2015 were analyzed and only 6023 participants were enrolled in this study. Four logistic models were analyzed using the derivation cohort. Methods of calibration and discrimination were used for the validation cohort. Results In the derivation cohort, 257 patients were identified from a total of 4498 cases. In the validation cohort, 92 patients were identified from a total of 1525 cases. Four models performed nicely for both calibration and discrimination. The AUC in the derivation cohort for models A, B, C and D were 0.788 (0.761–0.816), 0.807 (0.780–0.834), 0.905 (0.879–0.932) and 0.882 (0.853–0.912), respectively. The Youden index for models A, B, C and D were 1.46, 1.48, 1.67 and 1.65, respectively. Model C showed the highest sensitivity and model D showed the highest specificity. Conclusion Models A and B were non-invasive and can be used to identify high-risk patients for broad screening. Models C and D may be used to provide more accurate assessments of diabetes risk. Furthermore, model C showed the best performance for predicting T2DM risk and identifying individuals who are in need of interventions, current approach improvement and additional follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3083757360,"Phenotypic switches are associated with alterations in the cell’s gene expression profile and are vital to many aspects of biology. Previous studies have identified local motifs of the genetic regulatory network that could underlie such switches. Recent advancements allowed the study of networks at the global, many-gene, level; however, the relationship between the local and global scales in giving rise to phenotypic switches remains elusive. In this work, we studied the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) using a gene regulatory network model. This model supports two clusters of stable steady-states identified with the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, and a range of intermediate less stable hybrid states, whose importance in cancer has been recently highlighted. Using an array of network perturbations and quantifying the resulting landscape, we investigated how features of the network at different levels give rise to these landscape properties. We found that local connectivity patterns affect the landscape in a mostly incremental manner; in particular, a specific previously identified double-negative feedback motif is not required when embedded in the full network, because the landscape is maintained at a global level. Nevertheless, despite the distributed nature of the switch, it is possible to find combinations of a few local changes that disrupt it. At the level of network architecture, we identified a crucial role for peripheral genes that act as incoming signals to the network in creating clusters of states. Such incoming signals are a signature of modularity and are expected to appear also in other biological networks. Hybrid states between epithelial and mesenchymal arise in the model due to barriers in the interaction between genes, causing hysteresis at all connections. Our results suggest emergent switches can neither be pinpointed to local motifs, nor do they arise as typical properties of random network ensembles. Rather, they arise through an interplay between the nature of local interactions, and the core-periphery structure induced by the modularity of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2964838272,"Diversity as well as temporal and spatial changes of the proportional abundances of different antibiotics (cycling, mixing or combinations thereof) have been hypothesised to be an effective administrative control strategy in hospitals to reduce the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in nosocomial or community-acquired infections. However, a rigorous assessment of the efficacy of these control strategies is lacking. The main purpose here is to present a mathematical framework for the assessment of control stategies from a processual stance. To this end, we adopt diverse measures of heterogeneity and diversity of proportional abundances based on the concept of entropy from other fields and adapt them to the needs in assessing the impact of variations in antibiotic consumption on antibiotic resistance. Thereby, we derive a family of diversity measures whose members exhibit different degrees of complexity. Most important, we extent these measures such that they account for the assessment of temporal changes in heterogeneity including otherwise undetected diversity-invariant permutations of antibiotics consumption and prevalence of resistant pathogens. We apply a correlation analysis for the assessment of associations between changes of heterogeneities on the antibiotics and on the pathogen side. As a showcase, which serves as a proof-of-principle, we apply the derived methods to records of antibiotic consumption and prevalence of antibiotic-resistant germs from University Hospital Dresden (cf. supplement ""DiebnerEtAl_Data-Supplement""). Besides the quantification of heterogeneities of antibiotics consumption and antibiotic resistance, we show that a reduction of prevalence of antibiotic-resistant germs correlates with a temporal change of similarity with respect to the first observation of antibiotics consumption, although heterogeneity remains approximately constant. Although an interventional study is pending, our mathematical framework turns out to be a viable concept for the assessment and optimisation of control strategies intended to reduce antibiotic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3083228712,"Objective We aimed to evaluate the effects of combining the Simplified-Acute-Physiology-Score (SAPS) 2 or the SAPS 3 with Interleukin-6 (IL-6) or Procalcitonin (PCT) or C-Reactive Protein (CRP) concentrations for predicting in-hospital mortality. Material and methods This retrospective study was conducted in an interdisciplinary 22-bed intensive care unit (ICU) at a German university hospital. Within an 18-month period, SAPS 2 and SAPS 3 were calculated for 514 critically ill patients that were admitted to the internal medicine department. To evaluate discrimination performance, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) and the 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for each score, exclusively or in combination with IL-6 or PCT or CRP. DeLong test was used to compare different AUROCs. Results The SAPS 2 exhibited a better discrimination performance than SAPS 3 with AUROCs of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76–0.86) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.66–0.78), respectively. Overall, combination of the SAPS 2 with IL-6 showed the best discrimination performance (AUROC 0.82; 95% CI, 0.77–0.87), albeit not significantly different from SAPS2. IL-6 performed better than PCT and CRP with AUROCs of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.69–0.81), 0.72 (95% CI, 0.66–0.77) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.59–0.72), respectively. Performance of the SAPS 3 improved significantly when combined with IL-6 (AUROC 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69–0.81) or PCT (AUROC 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67–0.78). Conclusions Our analysis provided evidence that the risk stratification performance of the SAPS 3 and, to a lesser degree, also of the SAPS 2 can increase when combined with IL-6. A more accurate detection of aberrant or dysregulated systemic immunological responses (by IL-6) may explain the higher performance achieved by SAPS 3 + IL-6 vs. SAPS 3. Thus, implementation of IL-6 in critical care scores can improve prediction outcomes, especially in patients experiencing acute inflammatory conditions; however, statistical results may vary across hospital types and/or patient populations with different case mix."
https://openalex.org/W3083523258,"Paratuberculosis (pTB), also known as Johne's disease (JD), is a contagious, chronic, and granulomatous inflammatory disease of the intestines of ruminants which is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection, resulting in billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide. Since, currently, no effective cure is available for MAP infection, it is important to explore the genetic variants that affect the host MAP susceptibility. The aim of this study was to analyze a potential association between EDN2 synonymous gene mutations (rs110287192, rs109651404 and rs136707411), that modifies susceptibility to pTB. EDN2 rs110287192, rs109651404 and rs136707411 mutations were genotyped in 68 infected and 753 healthy animals from East Anatolian Red crossbred, Anatolian Black crossbred and Holstein breed cattle by using Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. For pTB status, serum antibody levels S/P ≥ 1.0 were assessed in carriers of the different EDN2 genotypes. EDN2 rs110287192 mutation showed a significant association with bovine pTB (adj. p < 0.05). For rs110287192 locus, the odd ratios for GG and TG genotypes versus TT genotypes were 1.73; (95% CI = 0.34-8.59) and 0.53 (95% CI = 0.12-2.37) respectively, which indicated that proportion of TG heterozygotes were significantly higher in control animals as compared to pTB animals. On the other hand, while rs136707411 mutation showed a suggestive association with pTB status in the examined cattle population (nominal p < 0.05); no association was detected between rs109651404 genotypes and pTB status. Selecting animals against rs110287192-GG genotype may decrease the risk of pTB in cattle of the Bos taurus taurus subspecies."
https://openalex.org/W3083615842,"This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the influence of haplotypes, alpha-gene status and UGTA1 polymorphism on the severity of sickle cell disease in children.This cross-sectional study was conducted between 2012 and 2014 at the Cayenne Hospital, in French Guiana. Acute clinical complications were grouped into (i) severe SCD defined by the presence of stroke and/or abnormal-transcranial Doppler (TCD), (ii) moderate SCD defined by the presence of at least three annual events requiring hospitalization and/or at least one acute chest syndrome, (iii) no severe SCD (in the absence of the precited events).Among the 86 patients, 33.7% were female with a median age of 10 years (range: 6-12 years). The vast majority of patients had SCA (HbSS) phenotype (74.4%; n = 64). The severe haplotype was found in 40% of patients. 30% were BEN/BEN. Analysis of α-globin gene deletions revealed that 32 patients (37.2%) were heterozygous (loss of 2 genes in 2 cases and loss of 1 gene in 30 cases) for α-thalassemia (3.7 kb deletion). Homozygous (TA) n TA7/7 was found in 24 (28%). In the multivariate analysis, the factors associated with the severity of sickle cell disease were the first vaso-occlusive crisis before one year of age (OR 25, [95% CI = 6.0-107.0], p<0.001) and a baseline MCV >80 fL (OR 0.20 [95% CI = 0.04-0.96], p = 0.04). The area of the ROC curve was 0.90.Prospective studies with greater statistical power would provide more knowledge on the relationship between UGT1A1 mutations and the clinical and hematological manifestations of SCA."
https://openalex.org/W3083190172,"Unmanned vehicles need to make a comprehensive perception of the surrounding environmental information during driving. Perception of automotive information is of significance. In the field of automotive perception, the sterevision of car-detection plays a vital role and sterevision can calculate the length, width, and height of a car, making the car more specific. However, under the existing technology, it is impossible to obtain accurate detection in a complex environment by relying on a single sensor. Therefore, it is particularly important to study the complex sensing technology based on multi-sensor fusion. Recently, with the development of deep learning in the field of vision, a mobile sensor-fusion method based on deep learning is proposed and applied in this paper--Mobile Deep Sensor Fusion Model (MDSFM). The content of this article is as follows. It does a data processing that projects 3D data to 2D data, which can form a dataset suitable for the model, thereby training data more efficiently. In the modules of LiDAR, it uses a revised squeezeNet structure to lighten the model and reduce parameters. In the modules of cameras, it uses the improved design of detecting module in R-CNN with a Mobile Spatial Attention Module (MSAM). In the fused part, it uses a dual-view deep fusing structure. And then it selects images from the KITTI's datasets for validation to test this model. Compared with other recognized methods, it shows that our model has a fairly good performance. Finally, it implements a ROS program on the experimental car and our model is in good condition. The result shows that it can improve performance of detecting easy cars significantly through MDSFM. It increases the quality of the detected data and improves the generalized ability of car-detection model. It improves contextual relevance and preserves background information. It remains stable in driverless environments. It is applied in the realistic scenario and proves that the model has a good practical value."
https://openalex.org/W3083285333,"Non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a plausible complication in brain tumor patients. Frequent use of corticosteroid therapy, chemotherapy, and oxidative stress for managing brain tumors may be associated with the development of ONFH. However, there is little knowledge on the prevalence and risk factors of ONFH from brain tumor. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of ONFH in patients with primary brain tumors.This retrospective cohort study included data from consecutive patients between December 2005 and August 2016 from a tertiary university hospital in South Korea. A total of 73 cases of ONFH were identified among 10,674 primary brain tumor patients. After excluding subjects (25 out of 73) with missing data, history of alcohol consumption or smoking, history of femoral bone trauma or surgery, comorbidities such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sickle cell disease, cancer patients other than brain tumor, and previous diagnosis of contralateral ONFH, we performed a 1:2 propensity score-matched, case-control study (ONFH group, 48; control group, 96). Risk factors of ONFH in primary brain tumor were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.The prevalence of ONFH in patients with surgical resection of primary brain tumor was 683.9 per 100,000 persons (73 of 10,674). In this cohort, 55 of 74 patients (74.3%) underwent THA for ONFH treatment. We found that diabetes was an independent factor associated with an increased risk of ONFH in primary brain tumor patients (OR = 7.201, 95% CI, 1.349-38.453, p = 0.021). There was a significant difference in univariate analysis, including panhypopituitarism (OR = 4.394, 95% CI, 1.794-11.008, p = 0.002), supratentorial location of brain tumor (OR = 2.616, 95% CI, 1.245-5.499, p = 0.011), and chemotherapy (OR = 2.867, 95% CI, 1.018-8.069, p = 0.046).This study demonstrated that the prevalence of ONFH after surgical resection of primary brain tumor was 0.68%. Diabetes was an independent risk factor for developing ONFH, whereas corticosteroid dose was not. Routine screening for brain tumor-associated ONFH is not recommended; however, a high index of clinical suspicion in these patients at risk may allow for early intervention and preservation of the joints."
