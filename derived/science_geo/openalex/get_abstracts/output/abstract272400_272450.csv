https://openalex.org/W2018691623,"The (1014) cleavage plane of calcite has been investigated by atomic force microscopy in water at room temperature. True lateral atomic-scale resolution was achieved; the atomic-scale periodicities as well as the expected relative positions of the atoms within each unit cell were obtained. Along monoatomic step lines, atomic-scale kinks, representing point-like defects, were resolved. Attractive forces on the order of 10(-11) newton acting between single atomic sites on the sample and the front atoms of the tip were directly measured and provided the highest, most reliable resolution on a flat, well-ordered surface."

The main features of this technique are briefly outlined, and applications to a series of problems in transition metal chemistry and carbon cluster chemistry are described. Examples in transition metal chemistry include state-selective reactivity, excited state deactivation, and state-selective ligand binding energies. For clusters, ion chromatography was used to determine the structure of pure carbon cluster ions as a function of size from C(4) to C(84). The results indicate that carbon grows first in linear chains, transforms to monocyclic planar rings at about C(10), and forms new families of planar bi-, tri-, and tetracyclic rings at C(20), C(30), and C(40), respectively. Fullerenes, which mysteriously appear at C(30) and dominate by C(50), are generated by heating the planar ring systems above an isomerization barrier rather than by growth of graphite precursors."

Surface exchange measurements can be difficult to obtain yet are important to understand physical processes, assess environmental and global change impacts, and develop robust parameterizations of atmospheric processes. The physics and turbulent structure of the atmospheric boundary layer are reviewed as they contribute to dry surface exchange rates (fluxes). Micrometeorological, budget, and enclosure techniques used to measure or estimate surface fluxes are described, along with their respective advantages and limitations. Various measurement issues (such as site characteristics, sampling considerations, sensor attributes, and flow distortion) impact on the ability to obtain representative surface-based and airborne flux data."
https://openalex.org/W2090793396,"The synthesis of poly(phenylcarbyne), one of a class of carbon-based random network polymers, is reported. The network backbone of this polymer is composed of tetrahedrally hybridized carbon atoms, each bearing one phenyl substituent and linking, by means of three carbon-carbon single bonds, into a three-dimensional random network of fused rings. This atomic-level carbon network backbone confers unusual properties on the polymer, including facile thermal decomposition, which yields diamond or diamond-like carbon phases at atmospheric pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2095291177,"The independent elastic constants of an upper mantle mineral, San Carlos olivine [(Mg(1.8)Fe(0.2))SiO(4)], were measured from 0 to 12.5 gigapascals. Evidence is offered in support of the proposition that the explicit temperature dependence of the bulk modulus is small over the range of temperatures and pressures thought to prevail above the 400-kilometer discontinuity, and thus the data can be extrapolated to estimate the properties of olivine under mantle conditions at a depth of 400 kilometers. In the absence of high-temperature data at high pressures, estimates are made of the properties of olivine under mantle conditions to a depth of 400 kilometers. In contrast with low-pressure laboratory data, the predicted covariance of shear and compressional velocities as a function of temperature nearly matches the seismically estimated value for the lower mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2031084388,"The solid-state phase transformation from 1,6-di(N-carbazolyl)-2-4-hexadiyne (DCHD) diacetylene monomer to polymer has been studied dynamically by low-dose selected area electron diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy. The total exposure required to induce polymerization is five orders of magnitude smaller than the critical dose for electron beam damage. The phase transformation is quasi-homogeneous, with the lattice parameters changing continuously as a function of beam dose. Characteristic streaking that develops in the selected area electron diffraction patterns in the [200] reciprocal directions during the intermediate stages of the transformation provides information about the defect-mediated mechanisms of this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2071134121,"The generalizations that fusion would be safer than fission, involve no dangerous radioactive materials, and rely on a cheap and plentiful fuel are potentially true. But it is pointed out that the type of fusion machine that the U.S. program is developing will deliver only some of these advantages. A gap is developing between what the fusion program appears to promise and what it is most likely to deliver. Fusion power would not be infinitely abundant, because the present reactors rely on a fuel cycle that must have lithium, and lithium is not particularly more abundant than the /sup 238/U that would fuel the breeder reactor. Fusion power would not be free of radioactive gases because the lithium would be used to breed tritium--a gas more benign than fission products but one that is hard to contain. The fusion reactor would not be free of waste disposal problems, even though the ''spent fuel'' would be nonradioactive, because the burning of the fuel would produce approximately four times as many neutrons as a fission reactor, and such a neutron flux would make all the structural materials of the reactor intensely radioactive--one estimate of the waste disposal problem is at least 250more » tons of material every year from each reactor. Finally, fusion power would not be cheap. The greatest potential advantages of fusion occur with advanced fuel cycles which include deuterium with deuterium; deuterium with helium-3; helium-3 with helium-3; and hydrogen with boron. Fusion with these fuels could be a clean process, but most research is directed toward fusion of deuterium and tritium. The funding of the program in the U.S. has seen the magnetic fusion budget exploding from $38 million in 1973 to $279 million in 1977. A second article will clarify the properties of various types of fusion reactors. (MCW)« less"

I have been able to interpret this literally, for if you extend these horizons far enough, what do you arrive at but the subject of this lecture, the shape of the Earth? It is a subject which has been revolutionized in the past five years by analysis of the orbits of artificial satellites: the two years from 1958 to 1960 saw more progress than the previous 200 years, and since 1960 the pace of progress has shown no sign of slackening."
https://openalex.org/W1969426663,"The arctic mirage is a phenomenon that is common in higher latitudes. It occurs under conditions of pronounced temperature inversion, which impart to the air a refractive capability that may equal or exceed the curvature of the earth. Manifestations of the arctic mirage, though largely forgotten in modern times, are described in the earliest accounts of North Atlantic discovery."

https://openalex.org/W2045895895,"Crystal defects and chemical reactions occurring at scales beyond the resolution of light microscopes have major effects on the chemical and physical properties of rocks and minerals. High-resolution imaging, diffraction, and chemical analysis in the transmission electron microscope have become important methods for exploring mineral defect structures and reaction mechanisms and for studying the distribution of phases resulting from reactions. These techniques have shown that structural disorder is common in some rock-forming minerals but rare in others. They have also established mechanisms by which many reactions occur at the atomic cluster scale. These data thus provide an atomistic basis for understanding the kinetics of geological reactions. Furthermore, apparent major-element, minor-element, and trace-element chemistry of minerals can be influenced by submicroscopic inclusions or intergrowths, which commonly form as products of solid-state reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2036673398,A survey is presented of the current understanding of dark matter invoked by astrophysical theory and cosmology. Einstein's equivalence principle asserts that local measurements cannot distinguish a system at rest in a gravitational field from one that is in uniform acceleration in empty space. Recent test-methods for the equivalence principle are presently discussed as bases for testing of dark matter scenarios involving the long-range forces between either baryonic or nonbaryonic dark matter and ordinary matter.

https://openalex.org/W2014835062,"The potential implications of energy cost and availability for new housing design over the rest of the century are examined. The discussion is based on the premise that the rise in the price of fuels relative to that of labor and materials is focusing the attention of home builders and home buyers on total life-cycle costs. This shift in emphasis from first-cost, short-term, and speculative factors to the energy conservation technologies stimulated by life-cycle cost analyses portends a number of major physical changes in new residences over the next few decades. This thesis is developed by looking first at the housing market, the historical influences of certain building practices, and fuel price changes in recent years. Attention is directed primarily to single-family detached dwellings including mobile homes, single-family attached homes, townhouses, garden apartments, and low-rise housing units. Next, major design parameters related to energy are examined in the context of a simplified life-cycle cost model, with numerical examples. The constraints imposed by existing technology, building and occupancy practices, and energy costs on total life-cycle costs are examined for their implications to future housing design practices. Then, the technological opportunities for energy conservation as a design consideration are discussed, with anmore » emphasis on identifying the extent to which many design parameters related to energy will change in the next few decades. Finally, the question of the implications of energy conservation on new housing design, ownership, and operation and on the identification of several specific research and policy issues is examined. 26 references.
