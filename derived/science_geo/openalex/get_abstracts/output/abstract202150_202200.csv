https://openalex.org/W1992663222,"THE division of a yeast cell by budding gives rise to two cells which are identifiable, that is, the mother cell from which the bud arose, and the daughter cell which developed from the bud. The wall of the daughter cell presumably is synthesized de novo while that of the mother cell retains all or at least part of its identity through the division—an example of linear inheritance1. That the wall of the mother cell is not reformed is evidenced by the accumulation of scars associated with each budding event2. Electron micrographs3–5 reveal a scar area that is approximately 1 per cent of the surface area of the cells. If, as indicated by Barton2, a bud is never formed at the site of a scar, then it is possible that the life-span of individual cells would be limited by depletion of available budding sites. Barton observed one cell to bud 23 times but did not observe a cessation of budding. Other progressive changes also might limit the number of divisions that a single cell can complete. This report describes an experiment designed to determine the life-span of single yeast cells and includes consideration of possible mechanisms for life-span limitation."

Under certain conditions, cell-free extracts of leukæmic organs also produced parotid gland tumours, sarcomas and other neoplasms3–5. Tissue culture extracts and extracts of tumour tissues6–10 have given rise to leukæmias and other tumours in rats and hamsters, following injection into the newly born animal."

A protein from electric tissue has now been obtained in solution; there is striking parallelism between the ability of this protein to bind acetylcholine analogs and the effects of such analogs on electrical manifestations of intact electroplax."

Glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, melezitose, eight di- or tri-saccharides and nine higher oligosaccharides were detected by paper chromatography, and fifteen spots of them contained ketose."

This activity can be inhibited by anti-CRM sera. It is suggested that CRM in such mutants represents a damaged tryptophan synthetase lacking the capacity to react with l-serine."

https://openalex.org/W2000174016,Resting barley seeds stored under oxygen at a pressure of 100 lb/in.(2) for 4 and 6 weeks exhibit a significant number of chromosome aberrations and mutations. The amount of cytogenetic damage increases with length of storage. The frequencies and types of changes are similar to those induced by 500 r to 1000 r of x-rays.

https://openalex.org/W2018844457,"DURING routine blood-group examination of healthy persons, one of the blood samples tested was found to exhibit unusual properties. The potent anti-A and anti-B test sera used agglutinated the erythrocytes quite well, whereas the serum of this AB blood (subgroup A2B) reacted weakly at room temperature with B cells. The irregular agglutinin was no more active at 37° C. and reacted better at 4° C. (titre 8) than at 20° C. No auto-agglutination was observed. At 4° C. the serum agglutinated all of 15 B but neither 20 A nor 15 O cells samples simultaneously tested. The B specificity of this agglutinin was confirmed by absorption experiments with B erythrocytes and with purified blood group B substance. The B specificity of the agglutinogen in Mrs. Br.'s cells was ascertained by studying the action of several A and AB sera on them; the agglutinating action of A sera did not occur after absorption by normal B cells or purified B substance. The ‘Br.’ cells significantly absorbed the anti-B agglutinin in normal A sera, but less, however, than did A2B cells used as control, and released it after elution more completely than did these A2B cells. The ‘Br.’ cells were agglutinated by anti-H eel serum nearly as well as group O cells. The ‘Br.’ saliva inhibited the anti-A agglutinin at a high dilution, and the anti-B and anti-H agglutinins when more concentrated. Its inhibitory action on anti-H was not weaker than that of an A2 control."

This fraction could absorb the agglutinating and mouse protecting antibodies from B. suis antisera. Since similar absorptions could be carried out, although less effectively, with whole bacteria, the insoluble material was assumed to be situated on the cellular surface and tentatively regarded as part of the cell wall."

The reaction involves the apparent formation of pyrroles when the compounds are allowed to react with acetonylacetone. The pyrroles yield colored complexes on coupling with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde.

The ester (Matheson) was crystallized from benzene–petroleum ether, m.p. 96.5–98° C. Chymotrypsin was from Worthington, salt free, lot CD 576–81. The kinetics of hydrolysis were studied in water at 25°, with magnetic stirring, in the pH range 7.0–7.95 with trishydroxymethylaminomethane (3.3 × 10−3 M) or phosphate (8.3 × 10−3 and 1.6 × 10−2 M) buffers. Runs were carried out with a Beckman model G pH meter, 0.1 N sodium hydroxide being added from a Gilmont micro pipette-burette to maintain the pH, or, at high enzyme concentrations, with a pH-stat, radiometer titrator and automatic burette delivering 0.4 N sodium hydroxide."

https://openalex.org/W2049930017,"A RECENT histological study1 of the changes that occur in human bronchial epithelium has confirmed in part earlier American findings2 and shown that considerable proliferation may occur in the cells of the basal layer without any other histological abnormality. As it seemed possible that some of these changes might be related to the development of bronchial cancer, a histochemical investigation has been begun. Since this work was not concerned with the distribution of free lipids, formalin-fixed tissue embedded in paraffin was used. The most striking result has been the very marked increase in the content or availability of lipid, probably bound phospholipid3, as shown by colouring with sudan black and staining by the acid hæmatein method4. This effect was strongest in the nuclei of the basal cells and was particularly well seen in the condition known as basal cell hyperplasia. In contrast, scarcely any lipid could be demonstrated in the cells of foci of established squamous metaplasia."
