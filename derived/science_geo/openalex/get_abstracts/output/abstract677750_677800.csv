https://openalex.org/W3184042735,"Emotion recognition is known to change with age, but associations between the change and brain atrophy are not well understood. In the current study atrophied brain regions associated with emotion recognition were investigated in elderly and younger participants. Group comparison showed no difference in emotion recognition score, while the score was associated with years of education, not age. We measured the gray matter volume of 18 regions of interest including the bilateral precuneus, supramarginal gyrus, orbital gyrus, straight gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, inferior frontal gyrus, insular cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, which have been associated with social function and emotion recognition. Brain reductions were observed in elderly group except left inferior frontal gyrus, left straight gyrus, right orbital gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, and right supramarginal gyrus. Path analysis was performed using the following variables: age, years of education, emotion recognition score, and the 5 regions that were not different between the groups. The analysis revealed that years of education were associated with volumes of the right orbital gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, and right supramarginal gyrus. Furthermore, the right supramarginal gyrus volume was associated with the emotion recognition score. These results suggest that the amount of education received contributes to maintain the right supramarginal gyrus volume, and indirectly affects emotion recognition ability."
https://openalex.org/W3183949861,"Context Patients on maintenance dialysis are more susceptible to COVID-19 and its severe form. We studied the mortality and associated risks of COVID-19 infection in dialysis patients in the state of Qatar. Methods This was an observational, analytical, retrospective, nationwide study. We included all adult patients on maintenance dialysis therapy who tested positive for COVID-19 (PCR assay of the nasopharyngeal swab) during the period from February 1, 2020, to July 19, 2020. Our primary outcome was to study the mortality of COVID-19 in dialysis patients in Qatar and risk factors associated with it. Our secondary objectives were to study incidence and severity of COVID-19 in dialysis patients and comparing outcomes between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. Patient demographics and clinical features were collected from a national electronic medical record. Univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate potential risk factors for mortality in our cohort. Results 76 out of 1064 dialysis patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (age 56±13.6, 56 hemodialysis and 20 peritoneal dialysis, 56 males). During the study period, 7.1% of all dialysis patients contracted COVID-19. Male dialysis patients had double the incidence of COVID-19 than females (9% versus 4.5% respectively; p&lt;0.01). The most common symptoms on presentation were fever (57.9%), cough (56.6%), and shortness of breath (25%). Pneumonia was diagnosed in 72% of dialysis patients with COVID-19. High severity manifested as 25% of patients requiring admission to the intensive care unit, 18.4% had ARDS, 17.1% required mechanical ventilation, and 14.5% required inotropes. The mean length of hospital stay was 19.2 ± -12 days. Mortality due to COVID-19 among our dialysis cohort was 15%. Univariate Cox regression analysis for risk factors associated with COVID-19-related death in dialysis patients showed significant increases in risks with age (OR 1.077, CI 95%(1.018–1.139), p = 0.01), CHF and COPD (both same OR 8.974, CI 95% (1.039–77.5), p = 0.046), history of DVT (OR 5.762, CI 95% (1.227–27.057), p = 0.026), Atrial fibrillation (OR 7.285, CI 95%(2.029–26.150), p = 0.002), hypoxia (OR: 16.6; CI 95%(3.574–77.715), p = &lt;0.001), ICU admission (HR30.8, CI 95% (3.9–241.2), p = 0.001), Mechanical ventilation (HR 50.07 CI 95% (6.4–391.2)), p&lt;0.001) and using inotropes(HR 19.17, CI 95% (11.57–718.5), p&lt;0.001). In a multivariate analysis, only ICU admission was found to be significantly associated with death [OR = 32.8 (3.5–305.4), p = 0.002)]. Conclusion This is the first study to be conducted at a national level in Qatar exploring COVID-19 in a dialysis population. Dialysis patients had a high incidence of COVID-19 infection and related mortality compared to previous reports of the general population in the state of Qatar (7.1% versus 4% and 15% versus 0.15% respectively). We also observed a strong association between death related to COVID-19 infection in dialysis patients and admission to ICU."
https://openalex.org/W3185028374,"There is no agreement which outcomes should be measured when investigating interventions for periodontal diseases. It is difficult to compare or combine studies with different outcomes; resulting in research wastage and uncertainty for patients and healthcare professionals.Develop a core outcome set (COS) relevant to key stakeholders for use in effectiveness trials investigating prevention and management of periodontal diseases.Mixed method study involving literature review; online Delphi Study; and face-to-face consensus meeting.Key stakeholders: patients, dentists, hygienist/therapists, periodontists, researchers.The literature review identified 37 unique outcomes. Delphi round 1: 20 patients and 51 dental professional and researchers prioritised 25 and suggested an additional 11 outcomes. Delphi round 2: from the resulting 36 outcomes, 13 patients and 39 dental professionals and researchers prioritised 22 outcomes. A face-to-face consensus meeting was hosted in Dundee, Scotland by an independent chair. Eight patients and six dental professional and researchers participated. The final COS contains: Probing depths, Quality of life, Quantified levels of gingivitis, Quantified levels of plaque, Tooth loss.Implementation of this COS will ensure the results of future effectiveness trials for periodontal diseases are more relevant to patients and dental professionals, reducing research wastage. This could reduce uncertainty for patients and dental professionals by ensuring the evidence used to inform their choices is meaningful to them. It could also strengthen the quality and certainty of the evidence about the relative effectiveness of interventions.COMET Database: http://www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/265?result=true."
https://openalex.org/W3121478726,"Since 2017, Uganda has been implementing five differentiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery models to improve the quality of HIV care and to achieve health-system efficiencies. Community-based models include Community Client-Led ART Delivery and Community Drug Distribution Points. Facility-based models include Fast Track Drug Refill, Facility Based Group and Facility Based Individual Management. We set out to assess the extent of uptake of these ART delivery models and to describe barriers to uptake of either facility-based or community-based models.Between December 2019 and February 2020, we conducted a mixed-methods study entailing a cross-sectional health facility survey (n = 116) and in-depth interviews (n = 16) with ART clinic managers in ten case-study facilities as well as six focus group discussions (56 participants) with patients enrolled in differentiated ART models. Facilities were selected based on the 10 geographic sub-regions of Uganda. Statistical analyses were performed in STATA (v13) while qualitative data were analysed by thematic approach.Most facilities 63 (57%) commenced implementation of differentiated ART delivery in 2018. Fast Track Drug Delivery was the most common facility-based model (implemented in 100 or 86% of health facilities). Community Client-Led ART Delivery was the most popular community model (63/116 or 54%). Community Drug Distribution Points had the lowest uptake with only 33 (24.88%) facilities implementing them. By ownership-type, for-profit facilities reported the lowest uptake of differentiated ART models. Barriers to enrolment in community-based models include HIV-related stigma and low enrolment of adult males in community models.To the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting national coverage of differentiated ART delivery models in Uganda. Overall, there has been a higher uptake of facility-based models. Interventions for enhancing the uptake of differentiated ART models in for-profit facilities are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3183533344,"Autologous vascular grafts are widely used in revascularization surgeries for small caliber targets. However, the availability of autologous conduits might be limited due to prior surgeries or the quality of vessels. Xenogeneic decellularized vascular grafts from animals can potentially be a substitute of autologous vascular grafts. Decellularization with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is reported to highly preserve extracellular matrix (ECM), creating feasible conditions for recellularization and vascular remodeling after implantation. In the present study, we conducted xenogeneic implantation of HHP-decellularized bovine vascular grafts from dorsalis pedis arteries to porcine carotid arteries and posteriorly evaluated graft patency, ECM preservation and recellularization. Avoiding damage of the luminal surface of the grafts from drying significantly during the surgical procedure increased the graft patency at 4 weeks after implantation (P = 0.0079). After the technical improvement, all grafts (N = 5) were patent with mild stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia at 4 weeks after implantation. Neither aneurysmal change nor massive thrombosis was observed, even without administration of anticoagulants nor anti-platelet agents. Elastica van Gieson and Sirius-red stainings revealed fair preservation of ECM proteins including elastin and collagen after implantation. The luminal surface of the grafts were thoroughly covered with von Willebrand factor-positive endothelium. Scanning electron microscopy of the luminal surface of implanted grafts exhibited a cobblestone-like endothelial cell layer which is similar to native vascular endothelium. Recellularization of the tunica media with alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive smooth muscle cells was partly observed. Thus, we confirmed that HHP-decellularized grafts are feasible for xenogeneic implantation accompanied by recellularization by recipient cells."
https://openalex.org/W3186563782,"Neglected tropical zoonotic diseases (NTZDs) continue to have a major effect on the health of humans and animals. In this study, a one health approach was used to prioritize and rank neglected tropical zoonotic diseases at the regional and zonal levels in Tigray National Regional State, Ethiopia. For prioritization of NTZDs a cross-sectional study through a structured questionnaire was administered to 313 health experts from human and animal health sectors. In addition, focus group discussions (FGD) were held with purposively selected key informants. Descriptive, and Multivariable analysis was applied to report the results and a ranked list of diseases was developed at the zonal and regional level. In the region, 8 of the 12 World Health Organization listed NTZDs were considered major diseases including anthrax, brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, taeniasis, leishmaniasis, rabies, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths. Considering the zoonotic and socioeconomic importance of the diseases at the regional level, rabies ranked 1stwhereas anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, and brucellosis were ranked from 2nd to 5th, respectively. The FGD result also supported the prioritization result. The Multivariable analysis showed a statistically significant difference in the zonal distribution of anthrax (р = 0.009, OR = 1.16), taeniasis (p<0.001, OR = 0.82), leishmaniasis (p<0.001, OR = 1.91), rabies (p = 0.020, OR = 0.79) and soil-transmitted helminths (p = 0.007, OR = 0.87) but not for brucellosis (p = 0.585), bovine tuberculosis (p = 0.505), and schistosomiasis (p = 0.421). Anthrax (p<0.001, OR = 26.68), brucellosis (p<0.001, OR = 13.18), and taeniasis (p<0.001, OR = 6.17) were considered as the major zoonotic diseases by veterinary practitioners than human health practitioners whereas, leishmaniasis was recognized as a major health challenge by human health professionals. Understanding the priority diseases in the region is supportive for informed decision-making and prioritizes the limited resources to use. Furthermore, strengthening the collaboration between human and animal health professions is important to control the diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3184079044,"For sustainable function, each pancreatic islet β cell maintains thousands of insulin secretory granules (SGs) at all times. Glucose stimulation induces the secretion of a small portion of these SGs and simultaneously boosts SG biosynthesis to sustain this stock. The failure of these processes, often induced by sustained high-insulin output, results in type 2 diabetes. Intriguingly, young insulin SGs are more likely secreted during glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) for unknown reasons, while older SGs tend to lose releasability and be degraded. Here, we examine the roles of microtubule (MT) and Gαo-signaling in regulating the preferential secretion of young versus old SGs. We show that both MT-destabilization and Gαo inactivation results in more SGs localization near plasma membrane (PM) despite higher levels of GSIS and reduced SG biosynthesis. Intriguingly, MT-destabilization or Gαo-inactivation results in higher secretion probabilities of older SGs, while combining both having additive effects on boosting GSIS. Lastly, Gαo inactivation does not detectably destabilize the β-cell MT network. These findings suggest that Gαo and MT can modulate the preferential release of younger insulin SGs via largely parallel pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3185610810,"Sarcopenia is intricately related to aging associated diseases, such as neuropsychiatric disorders, oral status, and chronic diseases. Dementia and depression are interconnected and also related to sarcopenia. The preliminary shift from robust to sarcopenia (i.e., pre-sarcopenia) is an important albeit underdiscussed stage and is the focus of this study. Identifying factors associated with pre-sarcopenia may lead to sarcopenia prevention. To separately examine the effects of dementia and depression on pre-sarcopenia/sarcopenia, we conducted multiple analyses. This cross-sectional study used health checkup data from a rural Japanese island. The participants were aged 60 years and above, and the data included muscle mass, gait speed, handgrip strength, oral status (teeth and denture), chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension), dementia (cognitive assessment for dementia, iPad Version), and depression (self-rating depression scale). A total of 753 older adult participants were divided into the sarcopenia (n = 30), pre-sarcopenia (n = 125), and robust (n = 598) groups. An ordered logit regression analysis indicated that age and depression were positively correlated with sarcopenia, while hypertension was negatively associated with it. A multiple logistic regression analysis between the robust and pre-sarcopenia groups showed significant associations between the same three variables. Depression was associated with pre-sarcopenia, but not dementia. There was also a significant association between hypertension and pre-sarcopenia. Further research is needed to reveal whether the management of these factors can prevent sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W3186700857,"Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are thought to be strictly postsynaptic within the retina. They carry visual signals from the eye to the brain, but do not make chemical synapses onto other retinal neurons. Nevertheless, they form gap junctions with other RGCs and amacrine cells, providing possibilities for RGC signals to feed back into the inner retina. Here we identified such feedback circuitry in the salamander and mouse retinas. First, using biologically inspired circuit models, we found mutual inhibition among RGCs of the same type. We then experimentally determined that this effect is mediated by gap junctions with amacrine cells. Finally, we found that this negative feedback lowers RGC visual response gain without affecting feature selectivity. The principal neurons of the retina therefore participate in a recurrent circuit much as those in other brain areas, not being a mere collector of retinal signals, but are actively involved in visual computations."
https://openalex.org/W3156971819,"Heterogeneity in the distribution of nutrients and oxygen gradients during biofilm growth gives rise to changes in phenotype. There has been long term interest in identifying spatial differences during biofilm development including clues that identify chemical heterogeneity. Laser ablation sample transfer (LAST) allows site-specific sampling combined with label free proteomics to distinguish radially and axially resolved proteomes for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Specifically, differential protein abundances on oxic vs. anoxic regions of a biofilm were observed by combining LAST with bottom up proteomics. This study reveals a more active metabolism in the anoxic region of the biofilm with respect to the oxic region for this clinical strain of P. aeruginosa, despite this organism being considered an aerobe by nature. Protein abundance data related to cellular acclimations to chemical gradients include identification of glucose catabolizing proteins, high abundance of proteins from arginine and polyamine metabolism, and proteins that could also support virulence and environmental stress mediation in the anoxic region. Finally, the LAST methodology requires only a few mm2 of biofilm area to identify hundreds of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3183397972,"Artificial light can be used as a management tool to increase milk yield in dairy production. However, little is known about how cows respond to the spectral composition of light. The aim of this study was to investigate how dairy cows respond to artificial achromatic and chromatic lights. A tie-stall barn equipped with light-emitting diode (LED) light fixtures was used to create the controlled experimental light environments. Two experiments were conducted, both using dairy cows of Swedish Red and light mixtures with red, blue or white light. In experiment I, the response to light of increasing intensity on pupil size was evaluated in five pregnant non-lactating cows. In experiment II 16h of achromatic and chromatic daylight in combination with dim, achromatic night light, was tested on pregnant lactating cows during five weeks to observe long term effects on milk production, activity and circadian rhythms. Particular focus was given to possible carry over effects of blue light during the day on activity at night since this has been demonstrated in humans. Increasing intensity of white and blue light affected pupil size (P<0.001), but there was no effect on pupil size with increased intensity of red light. Milk yield was maintained throughout experiment II, and plasma melatonin was higher during dim night light than in daylight for all treatments (P<0.001). In conclusion, our results show that LED fixtures emitting red light driving the ipRGCs indirectly via ML-cones, blue light stimulating both S-cones and ipRGCs directly and a mixture of wavelengths (white light) exert similar effects on milk yield and activity in tied-up dairy cows. This suggests that the spectral composition of LED lighting in a barn is secondary to duration and intensity."
https://openalex.org/W3183621246,"The Hodgkin-Huxley model, decades after its first presentation, is still a reference model in neuroscience as it has successfully reproduced the electrophysiological activity of many organisms. The primary signal in the model represents the membrane potential of a neuron. A simple representation of this signal is presented in this paper. The new proposal is an adapted Frequency Modulated Möbius multicomponent model defined as a signal plus error model in which the signal is decomposed as a sum of waves. The main strengths of the method are the simple parametric formulation, the interpretability and flexibility of the parameters that describe and discriminate the waveforms, the estimators' identifiability and accuracy, and the robustness against noise. The approach is validated with a broad simulation experiment of Hodgkin-Huxley signals and real data from squid giant axons. Interesting differences between simulated and real data emerge from the comparison of the parameter configurations. Furthermore, the potential of the FMM parameters to predict Hodgkin-Huxley model parameters is shown using different Machine Learning methods. Finally, promising contributions of the approach in Spike Sorting and cell-type classification are detailed."
https://openalex.org/W3184193523,"According to the official rules of the International Tennis Federation, players have to serve alternately from two different positions: the deuce (right, D) and the ad court (left, AD) side. This study aimed to compare body and ball kinematics of flat serves from both service sides.In a controlled, semi-court laboratory setting, 14 elite male junior players served eight flat first serves to a target field directed to the receiver's body from both service positions in a matched and counterbalanced order. An 8-camera-Vicon-System was used to capture the 3D-landmark trajectories.The mean service velocity was found to be similar on both sides (D: 151.4 ± 19.8 vs. AD: 150.5 ± 19.4 km/h), while multiple characteristics of the serve and ball kinematics differed significantly (p < .05). At starting, the front-foot angle relative to the baseline (D: 39.7±17.6° vs. AD: 31.1±17.4°) and lateral distance between the feet (D: 16.3 ± 12.9 cm vs. AD: 26.2 ± 11.9 cm) were significantly different. During the service, upper torso range of motion from maximum clockwise rotation until impact was significantly greater on the deuce court (D: 130.5 ± 19.8° vs. AD: 126.7 ± 21.1°). This was especially pronounced in foot-back technique players. Further, differences in the lateral ball impact location (D: 30.0 ± 24.1 cm vs. AD: 10.3 ± 23.3 cm) were observed.Changing the service side affects the serve and ball kinematics in elite junior tennis players. Our results underline biomechanical differences regarding the starting position (feet and upper torso) as well as the movement and ball kinematics which could be relevant for skill acquisition, injury prevention and performance enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W3184486320,"In this technologically developed scenario, many organizations in developing countries including Pakistan have expanded the enthusiasm for understanding and creating an encouraging administrative and managerial environment. Numerous organizations are struggling for structural changes by deserting the old-fashioned organizational management style and implementing an empowering leadership where leaders give more authority to subordinates in decision making and responsibilities with the aim to increase organizational productivity. Therefore, the study examined the leadership empowering behaviour as a predictor of employees' psychological well-being of the educational institutions at secondary level in Kohat Division, Pakistan. A total sample of 564 secondary school teachers (male n = 379; female n = 185) was carefully chosen through a stratified random sampling technique. In this study, a non-experimental predictive correlational design was adopted. In order to collect data from the participants, two different standardized research tools i.e., the Leader Empowering Behaviour Questionnaire and Ryff's Psychological Well-being Scale were used. After the collection of data, it was analyzed on the basis of mean, standard deviation, Pearson's product-moment correlation, and multiple linear regression model. In conclusion, the study confirmed a significant positive correlation between leadership empowering behaviour and employees' psychological well-being. Leadership empowering behaviours predict employees' psychological well-being positively. Therefore, it was recommended that empowering behaviour might be adopted by the school leaders to improve the employees' psychological well-being for better organizational productivity."

The current study is conducted on Sambhar Salt Lake, the largest inland saline Ramsar, site of India, contributing to 9.86% of total salt production. The lake is under threat due to illegal salt pan encroachment, losing brine worth 300 million USD. The objective was to identify the key drivers that affect the lake at a landscape level. Geospatial modelling was conducted for 96 years (1963-2059) at a decadal scale, integrating ground data (birds-soil-water). Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification was conducted using CORONA aerial imagery of 1963, along with Landsat imageries, using supervised classification for 1972, 1981, 1992, 2009, and 2019, and future prediction for 2029, 2039, 2049, and 2059. Further, images were classified into 8 classes that include the Aravali hills, barren land, saline soil, salt crust, salt pans, wetland, settlement, and vegetation. Past trends show a reduction of wetland from 30.7 to 3.4% at a constant rate (4.23%) to saline soil, which subsequently seemed to increase by 9.3%, increasing thereby the barren land by 4.2%; salt pans by 6.6%, and settlement by 1.2% till 2019. Future predictions show loss of 40% wetland and 120% of saline soil and net increase in 30% vegetation, 40% settlement, 10% salt pan, 5% barren land, and a net loss of 20%, each by Aravali hills and salt crust. Additionally, the ground result shows its alteration and reduction of migratory birds from 3 million to 3000. In the light of UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030), restoration strategies are suggested; if delayed, more restoration capital may be required than its revenue generation."
https://openalex.org/W3186201766,"Heart rate variability (hrv) is a physiological phenomenon of the variation in the length of the time interval between consecutive heartbeats. In many cases it could be an indicator of the development of pathological states. The classical approach to the analysis of hrv includes time domain methods and frequency domain methods. However, attempts are still being made to define new and more effective hrv assessment tools. Persistent homology is a novel data analysis tool developed in the recent decades that is rooted at algebraic topology. The Topological Data Analysis (TDA) approach focuses on examining the shape of the data in terms of connectedness and holes, and has recently proved to be very effective in various fields of research. In this paper we propose the use of persistent homology to the hrv analysis. We recall selected topological descriptors used in the literature and we introduce some new topological descriptors that reflect the specificity of hrv, and we discuss their relation to the standard hrv measures. In particular, we show that this novel approach provides a collection of indices that might be at least as useful as the classical parameters in differentiating between series of beat-to-beat intervals (RR-intervals) in healthy subjects and patients suffering from a stroke episode."
https://openalex.org/W3186296562,"Transcultural self-efficacy is a nurse's perception of his or her own ability to accomplish activities effectively for culturally diverse clients. This self-efficacy may be affected by different factors, either positively or negatively. Quality care can be improved significantly when nurses provide patient-centered care that considers cultural background of the patients. Thus, this study aimed to assess perceived transcultural self-efficacy and its associated factors among nurses working at Jimma Medical Center.Facility-based cross-sectional study with both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection was conducted among 244 nurses and 10 key informants from 20 May to 20 June 2020. Bivariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with transcultural self-efficacy. Qualitative data were coded and analyzed thematically. Quantitative results were integrated with qualitative results.A total of 236 nurses participated in the study making the response rate 96.7%. The mean transcultural self-efficacy score was 2.89 ± 0.59. Sex, work experience, intercultural communication, cultural sensitivity, interpersonal communication, and cultural motivation were significantly associated with transcultural self-efficacy. Ten in-depth interviews were conducted and the findings of qualitative data yielded four major themes.The level of perceived transcultural self-efficacy was moderate among nurses. Transcultural self-efficacy of nurses varies with several factors including sex, experience, intercultural communication, cultural sensitivity, interpersonal communication, and cultural motivation. This calls for the need to offer transcultural nursing training for nurses."
https://openalex.org/W3186716526,"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is treated mainly by hemodialysis, however, hemodialysis is associated with frequent complications, some of them involve the increased intracranial pressure. In this context, monitoring the intracranial pressure of these patients may lead to a better understanding of how intracranial pressure morphology varies with hemodialysis. This study aimed to follow-up patients with ESRD by monitoring intracranial pressure before and after hemodialysis sessions using a noninvasive method. We followed-up 42 patients with ESRD in hemodialysis, for six months. Noninvasive intracranial pressure monitoring data were obtained through analysis of intracranial pressure waveform morphology, this information was uploaded to Brain4care® cloud algorithm for analysis. The cloud automatically sends a report containing intracranial pressure parameters. In total, 4881 data points were collected during the six months of follow-up. The intracranial pressure parameters (time to peak and P2/P1 ratio) were significantly higher in predialysis when compared to postdialysis for the three weekly sessions and throughout the follow-up period (p<0.01) data showed general improvement in brain compliance after the hemodialysis session. Furthermore, intracranial pressure parameters were significantly higher in the first weekly hemodialysis session (p<0.05). In conclusion, there were significant differences between pre and postdialysis intracranial pressure in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis. Additionally, the pattern of the intracranial pressure alterations was consistent over time suggesting that hemodialysis can improve time to peak and P2/P1 ratio which may reflect in brain compliance."
https://openalex.org/W3183958339,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) success has led people to live longer with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) and thus be exposed to increasing risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Hypertension (HTN), the biggest contributor to CVD burden, is a growing concern among PLWH. The current report describes the prevalence and predictors of HTN among PLWH in care in Cameroon.This cross-sectional study included all PLWH aged 20 years and above who received care between 2016 and 2019 at one of the three Central Africa International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (CA-IeDEA) sites in Cameroon (Bamenda, Limbe, and Yaoundé). HTN was defined as blood pressure (BP) ≥140/90 mm Hg or self-reported use of antihypertensive medication. Logistic regressions models examined the relationship between HTN and clinical characteristics, and HIV-related factors.Among 9,839 eligible PLWH, 66.2% were women and 25.0% had prevalent HTN [age-standardized prevalence 23.9% (95% CI: 22.2-25.6)], among whom 28 (1.1%) were on BP lowering treatment, and 6 of those (21.4%) were at target BP levels. Median age (47.4 vs. 40.5 years), self-reported duration of HIV infection (5.1 vs 2.8 years years), duration of ART exposure (4.7 vs 2.3 years), and CD4 count (408 vs 359 cell/mm3) were higher in hypertensives than non-hypertensives (all p<0.001). Age and body mass index (BMI) were independently associated with higher prevalent HTN risk. PLWH starting ART had a 30% lower risk of prevalent HTN, but this advantage disappeared after a cumulative 2-year exposure to ART. There was no significant association between other HIV predictive characteristics and HTN.About a quarter of these Cameroonian PLWH had HTN, driven among others by age and adiposity. Appropriate integration of HIV and NCDs services is needed to improve early detection, treatment and control of common comorbid NCD risk factors like hypertension and safeguard cardiovascular health in PLWH."
https://openalex.org/W3184294074,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) is an important opportunistic pathogenic bacterium of dogs that also occasionally colonize and infect humans. However, whether MRSP can adapt to human hosts is not clear and whole genome sequences of MRSP from humans are still limited. Genomic comparative analyses of 3 couples of isolates from dogs (n = 3) and humans (n = 3) belonging to ST45, ST112, and ST181, the dominant clones in Thailand were conducted to determine the degree of similarities between human and animal MRSP of a same ST. Among eight prophages, three prophages associated with the leucocidins genes (lukF/S-I), φVB88-Pro1, φVB16-Pro1 and φAP20-Pro1, were distributed in the human MRSPs, while their remnants, φAH18-Pro1, were located in the dog MRSPs. A novel composite pathogenicity island, named SpPI-181, containing two integrase genes was identified in the ST181 isolates. The distribution of the integrase genes of the eight prophages and SpPI-181 was also analysed by PCR in 77 additional MRSP isolates belonging to different STs. The PCR screen revealed diversity in prophage carriage, especially in ST45 isolates. Prophage φAK9-Pro1 was only observed in ST112 isolates from dogs and SpPI-181 was found associated with ST181 clonal lineage. Among the 3 couple of isolates, ST45 strains showed the highest number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in their core genomes (3,612 SNPs). The genomic diversity of ST45 isolates suggested a high level of adaptation that may lead to different host colonization of successful clones. This finding provided data on the genomic differences of MRSP associated with colonization and adaption to different hosts."

This research examined the association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and elder abuse among older adults aged 60 years and over in Malaysia.Cross sectional data were collected via face-to-face interview from June to August 2019.Eight government community health clinics in Kuala Pilah, a district in Negeri Sembilan state approximately 100km from Malaysian capital city Kuala Lumpur.Older adults aged 60 years and above (N = 1984; Mean age 69.2, range 60-93 years) attending all eight government health clinics in the district were recruited for a face-to-face interview about health and well-being.The Adverse Childhood Experience International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ) and the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) were utilized to estimate childhood adversity and elder abuse respectively.Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between the number of cumulative ACEs and elder abuse. Compared to older adults with no self-reported adversity, those reporting three ACEs (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.84,3.87) or four or more ACEs (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.16, 2.48) had higher risk of any elder abuse occurrence since age 60 years. The effect was most prominent for financial and psychological elder abuse. The associations persisted in multivariate logistic regression models after adjusting for sociodemographic and health factors.Early life adversities were significantly associated with victimization of older adults. Social and emotional support to address elder abuse should recognize that, for some men and women, there is a possibility that vulnerability to maltreatment persisted throughout their life course."
https://openalex.org/W3185141333,"In Bangladesh, riverbank erosion is a major problem that regularly displaces millions of people and affects their mental health every year.The primary objective is to explore the effects of riverbank erosion on mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and stress in Bangladesh.We conducted a household survey from August 2019 to November 2019 on randomly selected adult respondents from Rajbari District located along the Ganges River and Tangail District located along the Brahmaputra River. The respondents were divided into two groups: exposed and non-exposed to riverbank erosion. All participants were asked to complete self-reported questionnaires on the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, and other socio-demographic, economic and riverbanks erosion-related factors. We performed Chi-squared test and multiple logistic regression analysis to explore the significant risk factors (P<0.05) of mental illness (depression, anxiety and stress).We surveyed 611 households, of whom 410 were from Rajbari and 201 were from Tangail. Among 611 respondents, 509 (83.31%) were exposed by riverbank erosion whereas 102 (16.69%) were non-exposed. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress (DAS) was 38.30%, 76.60%, 32.41%, respectively, and they were significantly higher among the exposed group than the non-exposed group (depression: 45.19% versus 3.92%, P<0.001; anxiety: 82.71% versus 46.08%, P<0.001; stress: 38.11% versus 3.92%, P<0.001). The respondents exposed to river erosion were respectively 8.28, 2.26 and 5.09 times more likely to develop DAS disorder compared to their non-exposed counterparts (ORD = 8.28, 95% CI = 2.75-24.89; ORA = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.31-3.88; ORS = 5.09, 95% CI = 1.64-15.76). Females and those who lost their houses and displaced, were more likely to have DAS disorder compared to their respective counterparts.The exposed people were more likely to experience mental health problem and demand some social safety net programs with special focus on female and those who lost houses and displaced."
https://openalex.org/W3185784383,"Non-native plant invasions, changes in fire regime, and increasing drought stress all pose important threats to biodiverse mediterranean-climate shrublands. These factors can also interact, with fire and drought potentially creating opportunities for non-native species to establish dominance before native shrubs recover. We carried out post-fire demographic monitoring of the common native shrub Artemisia californica in a southern California sage scrub fragment for 7 years, including several with very low rainfall. Experimental removals of non-native plants were included for the first 4 years. We quantified A. californica post-fire crown resprouting and seedling emergence, and tested effects of precipitation, non-native plants, and their interactions on seedling and adult survival. Only 7 A. californica were confirmed as resprouts; almost all individuals established after the fire from seedlings, with 90% of emergence occurring in the second growing year after fire (spring 2015). Higher spring precipitation increased both adult and seedling survival. Non-native grasses and forbs rapidly recolonized control plots, but the removal treatment reduced non-native cover by nearly 60%. For seedlings, non-native removal reduced the probability of dropping leaves by start of summer drought and increased survival both directly and through positive interactions with rainfall. Non-native removal also reduced mortality in smaller adult plants. By 2020, mean A. californica canopy area was nearly four times greater in non-native removal plots. These findings reinforce the high vulnerability of sage scrub habitat to post-fire loss of shrub cover and potential type conversion, particularly with increasing drought frequency and in stands and species with limited crown resprouting. Yet they also illustrate the potential for targeted management of non-natives immediately after fire to promote recovery of native shrubs in this increasingly endangered community."
https://openalex.org/W3186731157,"Anecdotal evidence suggests that spontaneous alcoholic fermentation of grape juice is becoming a more popular option in global wine production. Wines produced from the same grape juice by inoculation or spontaneous fermentation usually present distinct chemical and sensorial profiles. Inoculation has been associated with more similar end-products, a loss of typicity, and lower aroma complexity, and it has been suggested that this may be linked to suppression of the local or regional wine microbial ecosystems responsible for spontaneous fermentations. However, whether inoculated fermentations of different juices from different regions really end up with a narrower, less diverse chemical profile than those of spontaneously fermented juices has never been properly investigated. To address this question, we used grape juice from three different varieties, Grüner Veltliner (white), Zweigelt (red), and Pinot noir (red), originating from different regions in Austria to compare spontaneous and single active dry yeast strains inoculated fermentations of the same grape samples. The chemical analysis covered primary metabolites such as glycerol, ethanol and organic acids, and volatile secondary metabolites, including more than 40 major and minor esters, as well as higher alcohols and volatile fatty acids, allowing an in depth statistical evaluation of differences between fermentation strategies. The fungal (mainly yeast) communities throughout fermentations were monitored using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. The data provide evidence that inoculation with single active dry yeast strains limits the diversity of the chemical fingerprints. The fungal community profiles clearly show that inoculation had an effect on fermentation dynamics and resulted in chemically less diverse wines."
https://openalex.org/W3184080691,"Nowadays, the idea of firms’ atomization is rejected and companies are perceived as entities embedded in inter-organizational relationships and their configurations, including dyads and networks. The relational view in strategic management thus prompts research on a firm’s relational strategy. This paper taps this gap considering links between strategic choices and attributes of a company’s inter-organizational relationships, as well as the outcomes achieved by collaboration with different groups of stakeholders. We test the model based on research carried out on a representative sample of 400 enterprises operating in Poland and on international markets. The results of structural equation modeling show that 1) the outcomes of collaboration reflect market benefits and are dependent on the durability of the inter-organizational relationships and the heterogeneity of the supply chain relationships, 2) durability as an attribute of the relational strategy depends on the choice of how to create and appropriate value, and 3) in turn, the attribute of heterogeneity of the relational strategy depends on what type of partners are selected. Thereby, we deliver managerial implications on how to create a relational strategy to achieve a relational rent and better a company’s market position."
https://openalex.org/W3183336986,"People with Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 have a greatly increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is in part because of triplication of a chromosome 21 gene, APP. This gene encodes amyloid precursor protein, which is cleaved to form amyloid-β that accumulates in the brains of people who have AD. Recent experimental results demonstrate that a gene or genes on chromosome 21, other than APP, when triplicated significantly accelerate amyloid-β pathology in a transgenic mouse model of amyloid-β deposition. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that cysteine cathepsin activity influences APP cleavage and amyloid-β accumulation. Located on human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) is an endogenous inhibitor of cathepsin proteases, CYSTATIN B (CSTB) which is proposed to regulate cysteine cathepsin activity in vivo. Here we determined if three copies of the mouse gene Cstb is sufficient to modulate amyloid-β accumulation and cathepsin activity in a transgenic APP mouse model. Duplication of Cstb resulted in an increase in transcriptional and translational levels of Cstb in the mouse cortex but had no effect on the deposition of insoluble amyloid-β plaques or the levels of soluble or insoluble amyloid-β42, amyloid-β40, or amyloid-β38 in 6-month old mice. In addition, the increased CSTB did not alter the activity of cathepsin B enzyme in the cortex of 3-month or 6-month old mice. These results indicate that the single-gene duplication of Cstb is insufficient to elicit a disease-modifying phenotype in the dupCstb x tgAPP mice, underscoring the complexity of the genetic basis of AD-DS and the importance of multiple gene interactions in disease."

In this paper, we investigated fearful facial expressions recognition, as a behavioural means to assess psychological functioning. From May 15th, 2020 to January 30th, 2021, we enrolled sixty Italian individuals admitted in multiple Italian COVID-19 post-intensive care units. The detection and recognition of fearful facial expressions were assessed through an experimental task grounded on an attentional mechanism (i.e., the redundant target effect). According to the results, our participants showed an altered behaviour in detecting and recognizing fearful expressions. Specifically, their performance was in disagreement with the expected behavioural effect. Our study suggested altered processing of fearful expressions in individuals who survived the COVID-19 infectious. Such a difficulty might represent a crucial sign of psychological distress and it should be addressed in tailored psychological interventions in rehabilitative settings and after discharge."

Methods The efficiency, spatiotemporal disparity pattern, spatial correlation and evolutionary trend of the coordinated development of rural public health services of 29 regions in China from 2004 to 2018 were analyzed using efficiency and spatial analysis methods such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), kernel density estimation and Moran’s Ⅰ analysis. Result Nowadays, there are problems of unbalanced and insufficient development between the fields and regions in the development of rural public health services in China. The development level of rural public health services in various regions shows a distribution pattern that the service efficiency is “high in the middle”, “middle in the east” and “low in the west”, indicating a spatial cluster effect."
https://openalex.org/W3183908478,"We hypothesized that automated assessment of brain volumes on MRI can predict presence of cerebrospinal fluid abnormal ß-amyloid42 and Tau protein levels and thus serve as a useful screening test for possible Alzheimer's disease. 113 participants ranging from cognitively healthy to Alzheimer's disease underwent MRI exams to obtain measurements of hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, precuneus, parietal cortex, and occipital lobe volumes. A non-exclusive subset (n = 107) consented to lumbar punctures to obtain cerebrospinal fluid for ß-amyloid42 and Tau protein assessment including cognitively health (n = 75), mild cognitively impaired (n = 22), and Alzheimer's disease (n = 10). After adjustment for false discovery rate, ß-amyloid42 was significantly associated with volumes in the hippocampus (p = 0.043), prefrontal cortex (p = 0.010), precuneus (p = 0.024), and the posterior cingulate (p = 0.002). No association between Tau levels and regional brain volume survived multiple test correction. Secondary analysis was performed to determine associations between MRI brain volumes and CSF protein levels to neuropsychological impairment. A non-exclusive subset (n = 96) including cognitively healthy (n = 72), mild cognitively impaired (n = 21), and Alzheimer's disease (n = 3) participants underwent Stroop Interference and Boston Naming neuropsychological testing. A higher score on the Boston Naming Test was optimally predicted in a selective regression model by greater hippocampus volume (p = 0.002), a higher ratio of ß-amyloid42 to Tau protein levels (p < 0.001), greater posterior cingulate volume (p = 0.0193), age (p = 0.0271), and a higher education level (p = 0.002). A better performance on the Stroop Interference Test was optimally predicted by greater hippocampus volume (p = 0.0003) and a higher education level (p < 0.001). Lastly, impaired cognitive status (mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease) was optimally predicted in a selective regression model by a worse performance on the Stroop Interference Test (p < 0.001), a worse performance on the Boston Naming Test (p < 0.001), along with lower prefrontal cortex volume (p = 0.002) and lower hippocampus volume (p = 0.007)."
https://openalex.org/W3184528074,"The aim of the current study was to investigate the relation between reticulorumen contractions and monitored cow behaviors. A purpose-built pressure measuring device was used and shown to be capable of detecting the known contraction patterns in the reticulorumen of four rumen-fistulated cows. Reticular pressure data was used to build a random forest algorithm, a learning algorithm based on a combination of decision trees, to detect rumination and other cow behaviors. In addition, we developed a peak-detection algorithm for rumination based on visual inspection of patterns in reticular pressure. Cow behaviors, differentiated in ruminating, eating, drinking, sleeping and ‘other’, as scored from video observation, were used to develop and test the algorithms. The results demonstrated that rumination of a cow can be detected by measuring pressure differences in the reticulum using either the random forest algorithm or the peak-detection algorithm. The random forest algorithm showed very robust performances for detecting rumination with an accuracy of 0.98, a sensitivity of 0.95 and a specificity of 0.99. The peak-detection algorithm could detect rumination robustly, with an accuracy of 0.92, a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 0.90. In addition, we provide proof of principle that a random forest algorithm can also detect eating, drinking and sleeping behavior from the same data with performances above 0.90 for all measures. The measurement device used in this study needed rumen-fistulated cows, but the results indicate that behavior detection using algorithms based on only measurements in the reticulum is feasible. This is promising as it may allow future wireless sensor techniques in the reticulum to continuously monitor a range of important behaviors of cows."
https://openalex.org/W3185572639,"Comprehensive characterizations of bladder cancer (BCa) have established molecular phenotype classes with distinct alterations and survival trends. Extending these studies within the tyrosine kinase (TK) family to identify disease drivers could improve our use of TK inhibitors to treat specific patient groups or individuals. We examined the expression distribution of TKs as a class (n = 89) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) muscle invasive BCa data set (n &gt;400). Patient profiles of potentially oncogenic alterations (overexpression and/or amplification) clustered TKs into 3 groups; alterations of group 1 and 3 TKs were associated with significantly worse patient survival relative to those without alterations. Many TK pathways induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which promotes tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Overexpression and/or amplification among 9 EMT transcriptional activators occurred in 43% of TCGA cases. Co-occurring alterations of TKs and EMT transcriptional activators involved most group 1 TKs; 24% of these events were associated with significantly worse patient survival. Co-occurring alterations of receptor TKs and their cognate ligands occurred in 16% of TCGA cases and several BCa-derived cell lines. Suppression of GAS6, MST1 or CSF1, or their respective receptors (AXL, MST1R and CSF1R), in BCa cell lines was associated with decreased receptor activation, cell migration, cell proliferation and anchorage independent cell growth. These studies reveal the patterns and prevalence of potentially oncogenic TK pathway-related alterations in BCa and identify specific alterations associated with reduced BCa patient survival. Detection of these features in BCa patients could better inform TK inhibitor use and improve clinical outcomes."

This study aimed to characterize the transient, local action of rHuPH20 in the subcutaneous (SC) space using focused biodistribution and dye dispersion studies conducted in mice.To evaluate the biodistribution of rHuPH20, mice were intradermally administered rHuPH20 (80 U). The enzymatic activity of rHuPH20 was analyzed in the skin, lymph nodes, and plasma. Animal model sensitivity was determined by intravenous administration of rHuPH20 (80 U) to the tail vein. To evaluate local dispersion, mice received an intradermal injection of rHuPH20 followed by an intradermal injection of Trypan Blue dye at a contralateral site 45 minutes later. Dye dispersion was measured using a digital caliper.After intradermal rHuPH20 injection, enzymatic activity was detected within the skin near the injection site with levels decreasing rapidly after 15 minutes. There was no clear evidence of systemic exposure after administration of rHuPH20, and no discernible rHuPH20 activity was observed in lymph or plasma as a function of time after dosing. In the dye dispersion study, delivery of rHuPH20 at one site did not impact dye dispersion at a distal skin site.These observations support the classification of rHuPH20 as a transiently active and locally acting permeation enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W3186728321,"China is currently designing a regional economic layout for high-quality urban development, shifting its focus from the primary stage of beautifying cities to the next stage of profound urbanization aiming at strengthening industry. This is of high importance given that the urbanization rate of permanent residents by the end of 2019 was 60.60%, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. In the face of various factors such as the need to economize the intensive use of resources, urban stock development, and the need for urban constructions to maintain harmony with the surrounding ecosystem, regeneration has emerged as an efficient means to repurpose old residential districts. It conforms to the policy of stock planning and is one of the important methods to ensure the sustainable development of a city. Prioritizing the right attributes in renovation is one of the critical steps in the regeneration of old residential districts-instead of merely focusing on their selection and scoring by experts, more attention should be paid to the resident satisfaction (or the lack thereof) arising from them. Therefore, in this study, we have proposed a collaborative approach that requires communities to prioritize the appropriate aspects in urban renewal. This study employed the three-factor theory of customer satisfaction, to investigate the five attributes namely geographical location, infrastructure, traffic, residential management, and living facilities, of satisfaction and dissatisfaction of residents in the old city. This includes 327 samples based on the residents of Yanta old town in Xi'an. The asymmetric impact-performance analysis technique was used to explore, and quantify the asymmetric relationship between the attributes of old residential districts, and residents' satisfaction. The results proved that attributes were divided into three: excitement factors, performance, and basic factors, based on the asymmetric influence of attributes on residents' satisfaction. Residential management was into excitement factors, living facilities were categorized into basic factors, and the remaining three attributes were categorized into performance factors. The satisfaction of the residents regarding the renovation was maximized by comprehensively considering the performance of given attributes, adjusting the improvement strategies of each attribute, and further determining the focus of the renovation of the old residential districts. Simultaneously, it helped planners make more rational choices in urban renewal and sustainable development."

Intrahospital transfers may impact MRSA acquisition risk experienced by patients. In this study, we investigated ward characteristics and connectivity that are associated with MRSA acquisition.We analysed electronic medical records on patient transfers and MRSA screening of in-patients at an acute-care tertiary hospital in Singapore to investigate whether ward characteristics and connectivity within a network of in-patient wards were associated with MRSA acquisition rates over a period of four years.Most patient transfers concentrated in a stable core network of wards. Factors associated with increased rate of MRSA acquisition were MRSA prevalence among patients transferred from other wards (rate ratio (RR): 7.74 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.88, 15.44], additional 5 percentage point), critical care ward (RR: 1.72 [95% CI: 1.09, 2.70]) and presence of MRSA cohorting beds (RR: 1.39 [95% CI: 1.03, 1.90]. Oncology ward (RR: 0.66 [95% CI: 0.46, 0.94]) (compared to medical ward), and median length of stay (RR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.55, 0.90], additional 1.5 days) were associated with lower acquisition rates. In addition, we found evidence of interaction between MRSA prevalence among patients transferred from other wards and weighted in-degree although the latter was not associated with MRSA acquisition after controlling for confounders.Wards with higher MRSA prevalence among patients transferred from other wards were more likely to have higher MRSA acquisition rate. Its effect further increased in wards receiving greater number of patients. In addition, critical care ward, presence of MRSA cohorting beds, ward specialty, and median length of stay were associated with MRSA acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W3183389955,"Nanoparticles have the potential to increase the efficacy of anticancer drugs whilst reducing off-target side effects. However, there remain uncertainties regarding the cellular uptake kinetics of nanoparticles which could have implications for nanoparticle design and delivery. Polymersomes are nanoparticle candidates for cancer therapy which encapsulate chemotherapy drugs. Here we develop a mathematical model to simulate the uptake of polymersomes via endocytosis, a process by which polymersomes bind to the cell surface before becoming internalised by the cell where they then break down, releasing their contents which could include chemotherapy drugs. We focus on two in vitro configurations relevant to the testing and development of cancer therapies: a well-mixed culture model and a tumour spheroid setup. Our mathematical model of the well-mixed culture model comprises a set of coupled ordinary differential equations for the unbound and bound polymersomes and associated binding dynamics. Using a singular perturbation analysis we identify an optimal number of ligands on the polymersome surface which maximises internalised polymersomes and thus intracellular chemotherapy drug concentration. In our mathematical model of the spheroid, a multiphase system of partial differential equations is developed to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of bound and unbound polymersomes via advection and diffusion, alongside oxygen, tumour growth, cell proliferation and viability. Consistent with experimental observations, the model predicts the evolution of oxygen gradients leading to a necrotic core. We investigate the impact of two different internalisation functions on spheroid growth, a constant and a bond dependent function. It was found that the constant function yields faster uptake and therefore chemotherapy delivery. We also show how various parameters, such as spheroid permeability, lead to travelling wave or steady-state solutions."
https://openalex.org/W3183790900,"Background Despite the high prevalence of anxiety among chronic stroke survivors and evidence of its negative effects on postural control in healthy subjects, it is unclear whether anxiety also affects postural control in these patients. Recent evidence of improved postural control of healthy subjects by distracting the attention using an external focus (EF) or cognitive task, raises the question of whether similar benefits would be observed in stroke survivors. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the effects of anxiety and distracting the attention on postural control of chronic stroke survivors in terms of both postural sway measures and neuromuscular regulation. Methods Postural sway measures and ankle muscle activity of chronic stroke survivors with the high and low level of anxiety (HA-stroke (n = 17), and LA-stroke (n = 17), respectively) and age-, sex-, height-, and weight-matched healthy subjects (n = 17) were assessed while standing on rigid and foam surfaces under following conditions: baseline, internal focus (IF), EF, simple and hard cognitive tasks (SC and HC, respectively). Results Stroke survivors, particularly HA-stroke participants, showed greater postural sway measures (i.e. postural instability) and enhanced co-contraction of ankle muscles (i.e. stiffening of the neuromuscular system) compared with healthy subjects. As opposed to baseline and IF conditions, postural instability and neuromuscular stiffening significantly reduced in EF condition and decreased more in cognitive task conditions, particularly HC condition. Conclusions The results suggest that anxiety enhances stroke-induced postural instability promoting improper neuromuscular control of posture with stiffening strategy, which can be alleviated by EF and cognitive tasks."

Patients were divided into those who received only volatile anesthesia (volatile group) and those who received only propofol TIVA (TIVA group). The incidence of MACE and potential confounding variables were compared separately in a univariate logistic model and subsequently by multivariate logistic regression.Among the 2576 cases in ESRD patients, 1374 were in the TIVA group and 1202 were in the volatile group. The multivariate analysis included 12 factors, including the anesthesia method, of which five factors were significant. Factors that were associated with a significantly lower MACE risk included preoperative chloride concentration (OR: 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99), baseline SBP (OR: 0.98; 95% CI, 0.98-0.99), and propofol TIVA (OR: 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22-0.60).We inferred that the anesthetic method associated with the postoperative outcome in patients with ESRD."
https://openalex.org/W3185616112,"Use of dental services in childhood, especially preventive care, is associated with many important oral health outcomes throughout life. The Andersen behavioral model of healthcare utilization posits that predisposing characteristics, enabling resources, and need factors predict utilization in oral and other healthcare domains. Inequities that produce lower utilization of dental services in north-central Appalachia have been documented in comparison to the USA generally. Additionally, within Appalachia, there are disparities, such as those across different states related to varying public policies and resources supporting healthcare. Predictors of dental utilization in Appalachia have been a focus in adults, but less so in children. The aim of the current study was to understand predictors of dental utilization in children in north-central Appalachia in order to inform future research about how to intervene to address these disparities. In this study, there were 1,178 children, ages 1 through 10 years, from selected representative counties in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, along with a parent/caregiver, who were part of the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia (COHRA1) cohort. Use of dental services by their child was indicated by parents/caregivers, who also reported on sociodemographic, dental care-related anxiety and fear, and values and attitudes associated with oral healthcare. Results indicated that use of professional dental services by children was related to child age, dental anxiety and fear, and parental oral health values and attitudes. Older children in this age group, those who evidenced more dental care-related anxiety and fear, and whose parent/caregiver placed higher value on oral health and healthcare for themselves, were more likely to have had a dental visit in the past year."
https://openalex.org/W3185912253,"Aberrant NF-κB signaling fuels tumor growth in multiple human cancer types including both hematologic and solid malignancies. Chronic elevated alternative NF-κB signaling can be modeled in transgenic mice upon activation of a conditional NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) allele lacking the regulatory TRAF3 binding domain (NT3). Here, we report that expression of NT3 in the mesenchymal lineage with Osterix (Osx/Sp7)-Cre or Fibroblast-Specific Protein 1 (FSP1)-Cre caused subcutaneous, soft tissue tumors. These tumors displayed significantly shorter latency and a greater multiple incidence rate in Fsp1-Cre;NT3 compared to Osx-Cre;NT3 mice, regardless of sex. Histological assessment revealed poorly differentiated solid tumors with some spindled patterns, as well as robust RelB immunostaining, confirming activation of alternative NF-κB. Even though NT3 expression also occurs in the osteolineage in Osx-Cre;NT3 mice, we observed no bony lesions. The staining profiles and pattern of Cre expression in the two lines pointed to a mesenchymal tumor origin. Immunohistochemistry revealed that these tumors stain strongly for alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), although vimentin staining was uniform only in Osx-Cre;NT3 tumors. Negative CD45 and S100 immunostains precluded hematopoietic and melanocytic origins, respectively, while positive staining for cytokeratin 19 (CK19), typically associated with epithelia, was found in subpopulations of both tumors. Principal component, differential expression, and gene ontology analyses revealed that NT3 tumors are distinct from normal mesenchymal tissues and are enriched for NF-κB related biological processes. We conclude that constitutive activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway in the mesenchymal lineage drives spontaneous sarcoma and provides a novel mouse model for NF-κB related sarcomas."
https://openalex.org/W3186328690,"Biological invasions can massively disrupt ecosystems, but evolutionary and ecological adjustments may modify the magnitude of that impact through time. Such post-colonisation shifts can change priorities for management. We quantified the abundance of two species of giant monitor lizards, and of the availability of their mammalian prey, across 45 sites distributed across the entire invasion trajectory of the cane toad ( Rhinella marina ) in Australia. One varanid species ( Varanus panoptes from tropical Australia) showed dramatic population collapse with toad invasion, with no sign of recovery at most (but not all) sites that toads had occupied for up to 80 years. In contrast, abundance of the other species ( Varanus varius from eastern-coastal Australia) was largely unaffected by toad invasion. That difference might reflect availability of alternative food sources in eastern-coastal areas, perhaps exacerbated by the widespread prior collapse of populations of small mammals across tropical (but not eastern) Australia. According to this hypothesis, the impact of cane toads on apex predators has been exacerbated and prolonged by a scarcity of alternative prey. More generally, multiple anthropogenically-induced changes to natural ecosystems may have synergistic effects, intensifying the impacts beyond that expected from either threat in isolation."
https://openalex.org/W3183306958,"This study examines Taiwanese investment in Mainland China as it is an important part of cross-strait economic cooperation. Using sample data from Taiwanese-listed electronic information enterprises in Mainland China (1990-2016), this study combines ArcGIS spatial visualization and case analysis to investigate their value chain organization models and spatiotemporal evolution regularity. The results show that the value chain of the electronic information industry for Taiwanese investments in Mainland China has three models: vertical integration, modularization in production sharing, and production extension. Vertical integration is the main production organization model of these Taiwanese listed electronic information enterprises, expanding from single production to the entire manufacturing value chain, followed by sales, and finally R&D. This model is still in use in the Western Taiwan Straits Economic Zone, whereas the other four Taiwanese investment agglomerations, namely the Bohai Economic Rim, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Western Delta Economic Circle, began to expand to both ends of the production link, particularly to the sales link. High-value -added enterprises adopting production sharing models began to show a trend of expansion to inland cities, and enterprises adopting the manufacturing-sales model (a production expansion model) had the widest distribution. Finally, at the city level, the value chain fragmentation structure of Taiwanese and developed countries' cross-border (multinational) enterprises in Mainland China were consistent, that is, they matched the Chinese city hierarchy; at the regional level, however, the Western Delta Economic Circle pioneered to become a hub for Taiwanese electronic to information enterprises set up their R&D and sales links in Mainland China. Investigating chain-alike spatiotemporal expansion of Taiwanese investment in Mainland China is important for the integration and development of the value chain, production network, and enterprise spatial organization theories."

However, the role of affective modulation is not clear. The present study aimed to systematically examine the pain modulating effects of stimuli varying in affect and social content including personal relevance using subjective report and psychophysiological measures of facial and autonomic activity.Twenty-nine women underwent a tonic heat pain paradigm with simultaneous picture viewing to investigate the influence of their partners' faces with a neutral facial expression compared to strangers' happy, angry and neutral facial expressions on pain intensity and accompanying psychophysiological parameters (facial activity: corrugator muscle activity, autonomic activity: skin conductance level, heart rate). In addition to perceived partner support and relationship characteristics, the contribution of the affective value (valence, arousal) of the partner faces to the observed pain modulation was examined.Partner and happy faces reduced self-reported pain intensity and corrugator activity, the latter being lowest when viewing partner faces as compared to all other picture categories. As corrugator activity is indexing stimulus unpleasantness and a core feature of the facial pain expression, this physiological pattern matches well with the subjective ratings. Neutral objects, neutral and angry faces had no effect on pain self-report, although angry faces were rated as highly negative. Partner faces also led to increased skin conductance, being an index of motivational activation, and heart rate deceleration, possibly reflecting increased sensory intake. Partner-related pain modulation was primarily related to perceived arousal of the partner's picture, i.e., the intensity of the activation of approach motivation, and pain-related catastrophizing.Our results are partially consistent with emotional pain control models, especially regarding the modulatory influence of valence. Within the context of socially adaptive behavior, they particularly underline the social signal value of emotion and attachment figures. Clinically, our results imply that just looking at pictures of one's partner when undergoing acute painful procedures can have a robust hypoalgesic effect."

Due to the large student population, the schools can be a safe and secure environment during disasters, in addition to maintaining their performance after. Given the role and importance of the schools, the impact of culture and environment on resilience, without any indigenous and comprehensive tool for measuring the resilience in Iran, the study aimed to design and psychometrically evaluate the measurement tools.This study was conducted using a mixed-method sequential explanatory approach. The research was conducted in two main phases of production on items based on hybrid model and the psychometric evaluation of the tool. The second phase included validity (formal, content and construction) and reliability (multiplex internal similarity, consistency and reliability).The integration of systematic and qualitative steps resulted in entering 91 items into the pool of items. After formal and content validity, 73 items remained and 44 were omitted in exploratory factor analysis. A questionnaire with 5 factors explained 52.08% of total variance. Finally, after the confirmatory factor analysis, the questionnaire was extracted with 29 questions and 5 factors including ""functional"", ""architectural"", ""equipment"", ""education"" and ""safety"". Internal similarity and stability in all factors were evaluated as good.The result showed that the 29-item questionnaire of school resilience in emergencies and disasters is valid and reliable, that can be used to evaluate school resilience. On the other hand, the questionnaire on assessment of school resilience in disasters enables intervention to improve its capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3185181555,"Among various treatment options for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), surgical therapy is the most invasive. As Switzerland has the highest transurethral prostatectomy rate among OECD countries, we assessed the regional variation in prostate surgery for BPH and explored potential determinants of variation.We conducted a population-based analysis using discharge data for men aged ≥40 years with transurethral or simple prostatectomy from all Swiss hospitals during 2013-2018. After excluding patients with genitourinary/prostate cancer, we derived hospital service areas (HSAs) by analyzing patient flows. We calculated age-standardized mean procedure rates and variation indices (extremal quotient [EQ] and systematic component of variation [SCV]). We estimated the reduction in variance across HSAs of prostatectomy rates in multilevel regression models, with incremental adjustment for age, regional cultural and socioeconomic factors, disease burden, density of urologists, and the time since urologists' graduation.Overall, 44,253 prostatectomies (42,710 transurethral and 1543 simple) from 44 HSAs were analyzed. The mean age-standardized prostate surgery rate was 314 (range 166-500) per 100,000 men aged ≥40 years per year. The EQ was 3.01 and the SCV 5.53, indicating a high regional variation. In multivariate models, men aged 75-79 years had an 11.6-fold higher prostatectomy rate than those aged 50-54 years. French/Italian language areas had a 21% lower rate than Swiss German speaking areas. Socioeconomic factors, disease burden, and density of urologist/time since graduation were not associated with prostatectomy rates. After full adjustment, 80% of the variance in prostate surgery across HSAs remained unexplained.We found a remarkably high regional variation in prostate surgery rates for BPH within Switzerland."
https://openalex.org/W3185303409,"Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is the most powerful endogenous cardioprotective form of cellular adaptation. However, the inhibitory or augmenting mechanism underlying cardioprotection via IPC remains largely unknown. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) is a cytokine-inducible potent negative feedback regulator of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Here, we aimed to determine whether cardiac SOCS3 deficiency and IPC would synergistically reduce infarct size after myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. We evaluated STAT3 activation and SOCS3 induction after ischemic conditioning (IC) using western blot analysis and real-time PCR, and found that myocardial IC alone transiently activated myocardial STAT3 and correspondingly induced SOCS3 expression in wild-type mice. Compared with wild-type mice, cardiac-specific SOCS3 knockout (SOCS3-CKO) mice showed significantly greater and more sustained IC-induced STAT3 activation. Following ischemia reperfusion, IPC substantially reduced myocardial infarct size and significantly enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation in SOCS3-CKO mice compared to in wild-type mice. Real-time PCR array analysis revealed that SOCS3-CKO mice after IC exhibited significantly increased expressions of several anti-apoptotic genes and SAFE pathway-related genes. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis revealed that myocardial IC alone rapidly induced expression of the STAT3-activating cytokine erythropoietin in the kidney at 1 h post-IC. We also found that the circulating erythropoietin level was promptly increased at 1 h after myocardial IC. Myocardial SOCS3 deficiency and IPC exert synergistic effects in the prevention of myocardial injury after ischemia reperfusion. Our present results suggest that myocardial SOCS3 is a potent inhibitor of IPC-induced cardioprotection, and that myocardial SOCS3 inhibition augment IPC-mediated cardioprotection during ischemia reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W3186316092,"Recently developed direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been groundbreaking for their high efficacy across disease genotypes and lack of severe side effects. This study uses a cost-of-illness (COI) approach to estimate the net value conferred by this class of drugs using the cost and efficacy of one of these novel drug combinations, sofosbuvir and velpatasvir (SOF/VEL), recently licensed for generic manufacture in India. This study considers COI of lifetime earnings lost by patients and potential secondarily infected individuals due to disability and premature death from HCV infection. Expected net benefits of treatment are substantial for non-cirrhotic (NC) and compensated cirrhotic (CC) patients (ranging from 5,98,003 INR for NC women to 1,05,25,504 INR for CC men). Increased earnings are not sufficient to fully offset cost of treatment for decompensated cirrhotic individuals but treatment may still be justified on the basis of the intrinsic value of health improvements and other treatment benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3186342388,"Working in partnership with Indigenous communities in South Australia, we aimed to develop, pilot test and estimate utility scores for health states relating to cervical cancer screening, precancer, and invasive cervical cancer and precancer/cancer treatment among Indigenous women.Development and pilot testing of hypothetical cervical cancer health states, specifically through the lens of being an Indigenous Australian woman, was done with an Indigenous Reference Group in conjunction with five female Indigenous community members. Six health states were developed. These included: (1) Screened: cytology normal; (2) human papillomaviruses (HPV) positive with cytology normal; (3) low grade cytology (LSIL);(4) high grade cytology (HSIL); (5) early stage cervical cancer and; (6) later stage cervical cancer. Utility scores were calculated using a two-stage standard gamble approach among a large cohort of Indigenous Australian women taking part in a broader study involving oral HPV infection. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the rank, percentage of respondents with a utility = 1 (perfect health) and utility score of each health state was summarised. Mean (SD) and medians and inter-quartile range (IQR) over 12 months and lifetime duration were calculated. Potential differences by age and residential location were assessed using the Wilcox Sum Rank test.Data was obtained from 513 Indigenous women aged 19+ years. Mean utility scores were higher for the four non-cancer health states than for invasive cervical cancer states (p-values <0.05). Lower mean utility scores were observed for late stage cervical cancer, with 0.69 at 12 months and 0.70 for lifetime duration (Intra-class correlation coefficients = 0.425). Higher utility scores were observed for the four non-cancer health states among non-metropolitan participants (ranged from 0.93 to 0.98) compared with metropolitan participants (ranged from 0.86 to 0.93) (p-values<0.05).Among a large cohort of Indigenous Australian women, the reduction in quality of life (which utilities reflect) was perceived to be greater with increasing severity of cervical cancer health states. There were differences observed by geographic location, with positive cervical screening and precursor cancer-related quality of life being much higher among non-metropolitan-dwelling participants. These utility values, from one of the largest such studies ever performed in any population will be uniquely able to inform modelled evaluations of the benefits and costs of cervical cancer prevention interventions in Indigenous women."
https://openalex.org/W3186746645,"Attachment research has been limited by the lack of quick and easy measures. We report development and validation of the School Attachment Monitor (SAM), a novel measure for largescale assessment of attachment in children aged 5-9, in the general population. SAM offers automatic presentation, on computer, of story-stems based on the Manchester Child Attachment Story Task (MCAST), without the need for trained administrators. SAM is delivered by novel software which interacts with child participants, starting with warm-up activities to familiarise them with the task. Children's story completion is video recorded and augmented by 'smart dolls' that the child can hold and manipulate, with movement sensors for data collection. The design of SAM was informed by children of users' age range to establish their task understanding and incorporate their innovative ideas for improving SAM software.130 5-9 year old children were recruited from mainstream primary schools. In Phase 1, sixty-one children completed both SAM and MCAST. Inter-rater reliability and rating concordance was compared between SAM and MCAST. In Phase 2, a further 44 children completed SAM complete and, including those children completing SAM in Phase 1 (total n = 105), a machine learning algorithm was developed using a ""majority vote"" procedure where, for each child, 500 non-overlapping video frames contribute to the decision.Using manual rating, SAM-MCAST concordance was excellent (89% secure versus insecure; 97% organised versus disorganised; 86% four-way). Comparison of human ratings of SAM versus the machine learning algorithm showed over 80% concordance.We have developed a new tool for measuring attachment at the population level, which has good reliability compared to a validated attachment measure and has the potential for automatic rating-opening the door to measurement of attachment in large populations."
https://openalex.org/W3184835592,"Social network strategies have been used by health departments to identify undiagnosed cases of HIV. Heterosexual cycle (HET4) of National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) is a social network strategy implemented in jurisdictions. The main objectives of this research are to 1) evaluate the utility of the NHBS HET cycle data for network analysis; 2) to apply statistical analysis in support of previous HIV research, as well as to develop new research results focused on demographic variables and prevention/intervention with respect to heterosexual HIV risk; and 3) to employ NHBS data to inform policy with respect to the EHE plan.We used data from the 2016 NHBS HET4 (DC). A total of 747 surveys were collected. We used the free social-network analysis package, GEPHI, for all network visualization using adjacency matrix representation. We additionally conducted logistic regression analysis to examine the association of selected variables with HIV status in three models representing 1) demographic and economic effects, 2) behavioral effects, and 3) prevention-intervention effects.The results showed 3% were tested positive. Seed 1 initiated the largest networks with 426 nodes (15 positives); seed 4 with 273 nodes (6 positives). Seed 3 had 35 nodes (2 positives). All 23 HIV diagnoses were recruited from 4 zip-codes across DC. The risk of testing positive was higher among people high-school dropouts (Relative Risk (RR) (25.645); 95 CI% 5.699, 115.987), unemployed ((4.267); 1.295, 14.064), returning citizens ((14.319); 4.593, 44.645). We also found in the final model higher association of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness among those tested negative ((4.783); 1.042, 21.944) and HIV intervention in the past 12 months with those tested positive ((17.887); 2.350,136.135).The network visualization was used to address the primary aim of the analysis-evaluate the success of the implementation of the NHBS as a social network strategy to find new diagnoses. NHBS remains one of the strongest behavioral supplements for DC's HIV planning activities. As part of the evaluation process our analysis helps to understand the impact of demographic, behavioral, and prevention efforts on peoples' HIV status. We strongly recommend other jurisdictions use network visualizations to evaluate the efficacy in reaching hidden populations."
https://openalex.org/W3186113645,"In developing countries, millions of married women who want to use medical contraception are unable to do so for various reasons. To address this gap in access to contraception international development actors are emphasizing, among other things, the implementation of empowerment programs for women to enable them to take ownership of issues related to their sexual and reproductive health. Nevertheless, studies show that beyond their socio-demographic characteristics, negotiating contraception as a couple is the essential determinant of medical contraception usage among married women in developing countries. Thus, some authors suggest that this aspect be considered in the strategies of national family planning programs. However, we do not know much about the reasons underlying the negotiation or silence around contraception in Beninese married couples. To fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with women and men living as married couples in Benin. The results show that this type of negotiation is mainly influenced by specific factors that can act as levers or obstacles. These data could help family planning service providers in Benin and possibly other developing countries to ensure greater contraceptive use among married women."
